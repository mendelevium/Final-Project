http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/immigration-and-social-security/,2013-07-02 00:00:00,"['Shaila Dewan', 'Topics.Nytimes.Com Top Reference Timestopics People D Shaila_Dewan Index.Html']",Immigration and Social Security,"The Social Security Administration says that the immigration bill passed by the Senate would help its coffers, adding $276 billion in revenue over the next 10 years while costing only $33 billion.

Immigration Divide Weighing the economic claims in the Congressional debate.

But 10 years is a short time when you consider that a vast majority of the new and newly legalized immigrants would be paying into the system during that period and drawing out their Social Security benefits later. That is the problem with attempts to determine the effect of immigration on Social Security in the long haul — every study is going to have some sort of end point, after which people who have paid in are going to start drawing out.

The Social Security Administration’s chief actuary, Stephen C. Goss, says he believes that even 75 years out, there will be a net gain from immigrants, as he wrote in May. That is because their withdrawals will be offset by their children’s contributions.

Such estimates are based on a lot of assumptions, says Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, like how many children the newcomers are likely to have (higher birth rates among immigrants taper off with time), how many are low-skilled versus high-skilled (low-skilled workers tend to cost the system more, while high-skilled workers pay in more than they get out) and just how many new immigrants are admitted under the bill, all of which are open questions.

“It’s amazing that the actuaries have said it would be positive in the long run,” Mr. Van de Water said. “It’s a lot of moving parts.”

Economists who have studied the issue tend to agree that more immigration is better, but that the effect is small. “There are other better reasons to be for or against more immigration, besides its effect on Social Security,” Mr. Van de Water said.

James P. Smith, an expert on labor markets at the RAND Corporation, added that it was misleading to consider the effect of immigration on Social Security alone. “Immigrants contribute on net to Social Security and health care,” he said. “They’re a drain on state and local budgets, largely because of education. So isolating one program is always a mistake.” (Again, it is hard to estimate the long-term effects even of a drain on education budgets because having more educated workers helps the economy.)

There are also two separate pools to consider — unauthorized immigrants who are here already, about a third of whom pay Social Security taxes, according to government estimates, and the additional immigrants who will arrive through new legal channels. The Center for American Progress, a supporter of immigration reform, says if 70 percent of illegal immigrants are eligible for legal status under the bill, they will contribute $500 billion on net in 36 years — the period that the baby boomers will put a strain on the system.

It does not include the period in which those immigrants themselves begin to draw more heavily on the system. But Adriana Kugler, a former chief economist at the Labor Department and the lead author of that study, said it did not take into account projections that an influx of immigrants would result in higher wages for everyone, nor did it calculate the contributions of offspring. “You could look at a longer horizon, but then the benefit is even greater,” she said.

Republicans have tried to clamp down on the amount that illegal immigrants who paid into the system will be able to withdraw. The Social Security Administration estimates that in 2010 illegal immigrants paid a net contribution of $12 billion, either by working under a fraudulent Social Security number or by using a legitimate Social Security number after overstaying a visa or otherwise losing permission to work. Currently, if such immigrants obtain legal status and can prove their earnings with pay stubs or W-2 forms, they can get credit for those contributions. But the Corker-Hoeven amendment to the Senate bill, which paved the way for passage, would bar them from getting credit for the previous decade’s worth of payments even if they obtain legal status.

“To some extent, it’s a taking by the federal government,” said Marielena Hincapié, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. “The people who are going to be most severely impacted by this are going to be low-income immigrants.”"
http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/politics/government-shutdown-main/index.html,2013-10-03 00:00:00,"['Tom Cohen', 'Deirdre Walsh', 'Greg Botelho']",GOP legislator: Boehner won’t let government default on its debt,"Story highlights NEW: Obama cancels a trip to the APEC summit because of the shutdown Republican: Boehner says he'd allow debt ceiling vote that relies on Democrats to pass President Obama slams ""reckless Republican shutdown"" A GOP legislator describes Republicans as ""very unified"" despite reports of division

(CNN) —

The federal government may not be hit with a double whammy on top of the ongoing shutdown, as House Speaker John Boehner told a group of fellow GOP legislators that he won’t let the nation default on its debt, according to a House Republican.

Boehner said that he’d set aside the “Hastert Rule” – that Republicans would only bring measures up for a vote if they are backed by a majority of their caucus – and rely on Democrats to pass a measure to raise the nation’s debt limit, said the House member. This legislator attended a meeting Wednesday involving Boehner, but requested anonymity because that gathering was private.

Congressional Republicans remain divided on how to structure legislation to raise the government’s borrowing level. And an aide to the House speaker downplayed the development, saying, “Boehner has always said the United States will not default on its debt, so that’s not news.”

Still, at least one Democrat – Sen. Charles Schumer of New York – cheered the prospect of the GOP leader refusing to block at least this measure that President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats strongly support.

“This could be the beginnings of a significant breakthrough,” Schumer said in a statement. “Even coming close to the edge of default is very dangerous, and putting this issue to rest significantly ahead of the default date would allow everyone in the country to breathe a huge sigh of relief.”

The Ohio Republican’s vow comes exactly two weeks before the government is set to run out of money to cover its roughly $16.7 trillion debt, unless Congress agrees to lift the so-called debt ceiling. That had long been routine in Washington – until recently, that is, when conservative Republicans have pushed not to allow more borrowing without significant cuts.

Boehner himself wrote earlier this week in USA Today that “there is no way Congress can or should pass (a debt ceiling hike) without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit and help get our economy moving again.” He accused President Barack Obama of refusing to negotiate; Obama and fellow Democratic leaders have since said they are open to talks on any and all budgetary matters, but only after the government is reopened.

Yet Boehner’s comments signal that, at least on the debt ceiling issue, he’s willing to allow a vote on a measure backed by top Democrats but not most Republicans in his chamber – something he’s refused to do with a Senate-passed measure to reopen the federal government, without any add-ons.

Chief among those Democrats is Obama who, for all his strong rhetoric on ending the government shutdown, has said that avoiding a federal debt default is an even bigger necessity. He’s insisted Congress pass such a measure, as is, without tying it to anything else.

“As reckless as a government shutdown is, an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse,” the president said in a speech Thursday in Rockville, Maryland. “There will be no negotiations over this.”

Obama challenges Boehner to allow ‘yes-or-no vote’ on shutdown

While Boehner’s comments suggest hope toward some common resolution on the debt ceiling, the government shutdown is another matter entirely.

The two sides appeared no closer to an agreement Thursday, the third day of the shutdown that comes because Congress failed to agree on a budget plan to send to President Barack Obama. In fact, they appeared to dig in – insisting their approach is best and that the other was to blame for the 800,000 workers at risk of furloughs, shuttering of national parks, loss of funding for various programs and other effects of the shutdown.

A conservative GOP wing has demanded that any spending measure include provisions to dismantle or defund Obamacare, which became law in 2010 and was upheld by the Supreme Court last year.

As he’s done before, Obama on Thursday challenged Boehner to stop what he called Republicans “reckless” strategy of refusing to pass the “clean” spending bill – which doesn’t have provisions targeting the president’s signature health care reform, the Affordable Care Act, like several passed by the GOP-led House – and instead pushing measures to fund popular programs on a one-by-one basis.

The shutdown: Personal stories from Americans on the edge

The president said the spending initiative passed by the Democratic-led Senate would pass the House with support from Democrats and some Republicans, except that Boehner won’t allow the vote.

“The only thing that is keeping the government shut down, the only thing preventing people from going back to work, and basic research starting back up, and farmers and small-business owners getting their loans – the only thing that’s preventing all that from happening right now today, in the next five minutes, is that Speaker John Boehner won’t even let the bill get a yes-or-no vote because he doesn’t want to anger the extremists in his party,” Obama said.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was part of the Democratic chorus Thursday, accusing Boehner of reneging on an agreement to let the House vote on a “clean” spending package of $988 billion, $70 billion less than Democrats wanted). Boehner went back on that deal, Reid surmised in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, because he feared fellow Republicans would turn on him and oust him from his position as House speaker.

“His job is not as important as our country,” Reid said. “… He has to have some courage.”

Reid jabs Boehner, says he reneged on deal

Cantor: GOP should stand its ground

GOP Rep. Michael Grimm said Thursday night that “very, very arrogant and very obstinate” remarks by Reid and what he calls a lack of needed leadership from Obama undermines the chances of reaching a deal.

“If you’re going to be insulted …, and if you’re going to be spoken down to, and there’s going to be this air of arrogance, you’re only going to make things worse,” Grimm, of New York, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.

While Grimm and a few other moderate Republicans have backed a “clean” spending bill without anti-Obamacare provisions, some of his colleagues in the House say the party won’t budge from their strategy. Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, for one, described his caucus as “very unified” and said Reid and Obama are “confused” if they think “we’re going to fold and let them win on everything.”

In fact, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor wrote in a memo that it’s the positions of Obama and other Democrats that are “untenable.”

House Republicans would continue passing piecemeal funding measures for popular programs such as veterans affairs, national parks and medical research to keep up pressure on Senate Democrats who refuse to consider such measures in the ongoing stalemate, Cantor’s memo said.

“While no one can predict with certainty how the current shutdown will be resolved, I am confident that if we keep advancing common-sense solutions to the problems created by the shutdown that Senate Democrats and President Obama will eventually agree to meaningful discussions that would allow us to ultimately resolve this impasse,” Cantor said in the memo that a GOP source made available to CNN.

A conversation between two conservative GOP senators showed Republicans think they can win the debate. In the comments caught by live microphone, tea party-backed Sen. Rand Paul told his Kentucky Republican colleague, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, that continuing to hammer Democrats for refusing to consider GOP proposals would eventually succeed.

Proposal from moderates

Meanwhile, two moderate House members – one Republican and one Democrat – proposed a compromise Thursday that would fund the government for six months while eliminating a tax on medical devices in the health care reforms.

Senate Democrats quickly rejected the idea because it would link the health care reform provision to the need to fund the government now while extending deep mandatory budget cuts they oppose for half of the new fiscal year.

GOP moderates huddle as conservatives set agenda

Instead, Obama -- who canceled a trip to Brunei and Indonesia for this weekend’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit because of the ongoing shutdown – and other Democrats have said they want to negotiate a broad budget deal that could include tax reforms and other matters. But they’re only willing to engage in such talks after the government reopens.

This already slogging debate over what to do about the crisis ground to a halt Thursday because of something that, at first glance, did not directly involve any of the legislators on Capitol Hill, even if it did hit very close to home.

A chase that began at a White House security checkpoint ended near the U.S. Capitol Hill when authorities opened fire on a car containing a woman and a child, an intelligence source told CNN.

Two police officers suffered injuries in the ordeal, according to D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. The female driver – who didn’t fire any shots herself, according to multiple sources – died of gunshot wounds.

The House and Senate were both put on lockdown, with no one allowed to leave or enter Capitol Hill buildings and everyone urged to steer clear of windows and doorways, for about an hour.

Not long after, Democrats and Republicans reconvened on the House floor and, in a rare show of unanimity, thanked the responding officers.

Then they resumed their normal business – which, if the past few weeks is any indication, meant more blame and little agreement on how to bring the government back on line.

Radel rips Minnesota governor's 'snowbird' tax plan, welcomes refugees","A Florida Republican congressman is welcoming to his home state Minnesota residents who migrate south to escape the Midwest’s notoriously cold, harsh winters -- now that their governor is trying to impose a so-called “snowbird tax” on them.

“Dear Governor Mark Dayton,” Rep. Trey Radel wrote Friday. “I'm writing today to thank you. As a Floridian, I am overjoyed to hear about your plan to raise taxes on Minnesotans, most especially the so-called ‘snowbirds.’ Your proposal gives us a chance to shine here in the Sunshine State.”

Dayton, a Democrat, proposed the idea last week when announcing key parts of his proposed $37.9 billion budget. He made a similar proposal last year that was defeated by the then-Republican-controlled legislature.

The plan would purportedly raise no more than $30 million over two years from all Minnesota residents who live 60 days to just under six months in Minnesota by taxing their capital gains and dividends as well as income from stocks and bonds.

However, the prorated income tax would largely hit older residents and retirees, known as “snowbirds” because they leave northern states to establish residency in such warmer places as Arizona and Florida.

Dalton said it’s unfair that somebody can live six months and a day outside of Minnesota and pay no state personal income taxes, then come back and take advantage of “all the state has to offer for five months and 29 days.”

“There is a snowbird tax -- absolutely,” he told reporters.

The purportedly first-of-its-kind tax would be difficult to enforce and is already facing opposing from state Republicans.

“I don’t even think that’s constitutional,” Senate Minority Leader David Hann told the MinnPost.com. “I don’t even know how you’d do that. (And) as far as I can see, there’s not a lot of money attached to it.”

Radel, argues in the letter, which appear written with pointed sarcasm to skewer higher taxes, that southwest Florida would welcome more entrepreneurs and philanthropists investing in the region. And he cited such incentives as no income taxes, investment incentives for big and small businesses and “great” public, charter and private schools.

“It's my sincere hope your plan has just driven many Minnesotans to become year-round residents of our great state,” he wrote. “I thank you for your policy. It draws the contrast of what is happening not only in United States today, but the world.”"

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-rta-united-american-airlines-lawsuit,0,2644876.story",,"['Kathy Bergen', 'Richard Wronski']","RTA accuses United, American of running 'sham' to avoid taxes","The Regional Transportation Authority on Monday accused United Airlines and American Airlines of running ""sham business operations"" that have deprived Chicago and Cook County taxpayers and public transportation agencies of nearly $300 million during the past seven years.



The allegations reignite the RTA's long-running battle to stop what it sees as tax-dodging in Illinois -- a campaign that has experienced some setbacks. Efforts to get the tax code changed by the Legislature have stalled. And a legal challenge by the state's Department of Revenue and the RTA to a similar tax arrangement in Putnam County have been rejected in circuit and appellate courts. The state and the RTA are asking the Illinois Supreme Court to hear an appeal.



In its most recent move, the RTA alleges that United and American operate offices in the DeKalb County city of Sycamore to avoid paying higher tax rates that would be applied from their offices in Chicago. These small, part-time offices are rarely occupied and, in at least one case, don't appear to even have a computer, the RTA said.



Both airlines claim they purchase their jet fuel, one of their largest expenses, from those offices, the RTA stated.



The RTA filed suit in Cook County Circuit Court against Chicago-based United, while deferring formal action against American, noting that the airline, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is in bankruptcy proceedings.



Both airlines and the city of Sycamore said their tax arrangements are legal under Illinois law.



""The operation of our fuel subsidiary in Sycamore has been examined by tax authorities in the past and has been determined to comply with all applicable laws,"" United said in a statement. ""We will vigorously defend ourselves against any such claims.""



Sycamore said it also intends to defend its position. American declined to comment on pending litigation.



Joe Costello, RTA executive director, said: ""We are looking to have United Airlines pay the sales tax that they legally owe. That sales tax supports public transportation and services for the city of Chicago and Cook County. It supports services that firms like United use themselves.""



The RTA estimates the tax agreements have cost it $96 million since 2005 while they deprived the city of Chicago $133 million and Cook County $60 million. The agencies overseen by the RTA -- the CTA, Metra and Pace -- rely on sales tax revenue to operate mass transit in the six-county region.



Cook County and the city of Chicago are studying the case, officials said Monday.



The tax practice by the two biggest airlines at O'Hare International Airport was first reported by the Tribune in August 2011.



Illinois is among a handful of states where sales tax is applied where a purchase offer is accepted rather than where a product is delivered to the customer. That quirk in the law creates an opportunity for companies to relocate the site of sales transactions to a lower-tax venue, some of which also offer rebates.



Sycamore has a total sales tax rate of 8 percent, of which 2.75 percent goes back to the municipality, while the rate in Chicago is 9.5 percent. Under their agreements with Sycamore, United and American jet fuel companies also recoup the lion's share of the Sycamore's portion.



United received a $17.9 million reimbursement in Sycamore's 2012 fiscal year, while American received $14.1 million, according to city budget documents. Sycamore retained $837,000.



The RTA 18 months ago filed similar lawsuits against Kankakee and Channahon, which have similar tax rebate agreements with retailers and other airlines. Those lawsuits are pending.



But allegations of tax-dodging by local companies date at least to 2008, when the Illinois Department of Revenue challenged the Hartney Fuel Oil Co.'s claim that its sales office was in the tiny village of Mark, in Putnam County, where there was no local sales tax.



The state's revenue department contended that Hartney's business took place at its longtime office in west suburban Forest View, where sales orders of about $200 million a year were processed and fuel shipped by a related company.



The issue was first reported by the Tribune.



A Putnam County judge ruled in favor of Hartney, and the ruling was upheld on appeal. Now the state, the RTA and the village of Forest View are asking the Illinois Supreme Court to take it up.



Meanwhile, the RTA will continue talking with legislators about potential changes to the tax code, said Jordan Matyas, the agency's chief of staff.



The issue is a divisive one, pitting some Downstate and suburban legislators against those from Chicago.



Previous efforts at compromise have stalled.



But the RTA won approval last summer for legislation that requires local governments to inform the public about its sales tax rebate agreements.



""That was a first step,"" Matyas said, ""to show the Legislature how widespread the practice is.""

WASHINGTON — President Obama and Congressional leaders failed on Friday to stop deep, automatic cuts in federal spending that will immediately shrink the size and ambition of government, even as they vowed an end to the rolling fiscal battles that have repeatedly threatened government shutdowns and economic crisis over two years.

Emerging from an Oval Office meeting with the lawmakers, the president called the cuts “just dumb.” He said they would slow the economic recovery and spoke emotionally about their impact on people who would feel the consequences of government layoffs and disruptions in public services.

“I don’t anticipate a huge financial crisis, but people are going to be hurt,” Mr. Obama said during a 35-minute news conference at the White House, in which he acknowledged that his campaign of highlighting fallout from the cuts had failed to persuade Republicans to consider tax increases as part of a package to avert the $85 billion in reductions over the next seven months.

But both the president and his Republican adversaries said they would not carry the fight over the cuts into a coming legislative effort to finance the government through Sept. 30, essentially declaring a cease-fire in the budget wars that have dominated Washington since 2011."

Details of the measure were unclear today and its prospects of passing remained uncertain. But both Democratic and Republican leaders said they agreed on a proposal, the first such sign of progress in more than two years of discussions spurred by a continued downgrading of the state’s credit rating.

The debate has centered on how to reduce costs while balancing the legal protections to public employee retiree benefits laid out in the state constitution. The public employee unions have repeatedly threatened to challenge in court any pension proposal that lacked their support, and they were quick to criticize today's announcement.

Negotiations among the four legislative leaders had centered on plans to slow compounded annual cost-of-living adjustments for public employees—the biggest driver of the state’s $100 billion unfunded pension liability.

“We got it done,” said Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno, who said “the goal” is to vote on the measure next week.

A top aide to Democratic Senate President John Cullerton concurred.

""There is a deal,"" said Rikeesha Phelon, spokeswoman for Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, in an email. ""We are asking our members to return on Tuesday. We are going to spend the next week reviewing the plan with our caucus.""

The senators will join House lawmakers, who were told yesterday to return Dec. 3 to Springfield for a one-day session. The Dec. 3 date is politically significant because it is the day after the filing deadline for the March 2014 primary election, and lawmakers will know what competition they have.

Radogno said the proposal would save about $160 billion and the goal is to fully fund the pension system over the next 30 years.

The proposal would raise retirement ages, create an optional 401(k)-styled plan and scale back the cost-of-living increases.

Increasing the retirement age, now set at various levels based on the type of work, would impact the youngest workers the most. Younger workers could see up to five years added to their retirement ages, Radogno said.

The cost-of-living adjustments would be altered “to be sure that the lower-paid, longest-serving employees have the biggest protection,” said Radogno. It would be largely patterned after a provision she pushed and was included in a bill that Speaker Michael Madigan passed in the House.

Currently, retirees get an automatic 3 percent compounded increase every year.

The plan that passed the House included a formula that gave weight to the number of years a person worked, a way to rein in the size of the annual pension increases of employees that worked only a few years but got huge salaries

Radogno said that proposal has been “tweaked” slightly but would not go into the details

Gov. Pat Quinn issued a statement saying the plan meets his “standard” to eliminate the unfunded pension debt and give the retirement systems financial stability.

“We have more work to do,” Quinn said. “I look forward to working with the leaders and members of the General Assembly over the coming days to get this job done for the people of Illinois.”

Officials for public employee and teachers’ unions, while unfamiliar with the details, said in a statement that they believed the proposal was “an unfair, unconstitutional scheme that undermines retirement security” since it was based on previous proposals that they had fought.

“It’s no compromise at all with those who earned and paid for their retirement benefits,” said the “We Are One” coalition, an umbrella organization for the state AFL-CIO, the Illinois Education Association, the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Service Employees International Union and the Illinois Nurses Association.

http://news.yahoo.com/fiscal-cliff-deal-leaves-lots-issues-dangling-232914021--politics.html,,[],'Fiscal cliff' deal leaves lots of issues dangling,"The ""fiscal cliff"" compromise on taxes leaves a big part of the nation's budget crisis still dangling.

Lawmakers bought a little time with a New Year's agreement to hold income tax rates steady for 99 percent of Americans while allowing payroll taxes to go up. But they left themselves only two months to settle seemingly irreconcilable differences over how much the United States should borrow and spend and where painful budget cuts should land.

Here's a look at what's been resolved and what's left hanging:

___

AUTOMATIC SPENDING CUTS

The bipartisan deal approved by the Senate and House put off dealing with the nearly $110 billion in automatic spending cuts set for this year.

Unless Congress stops them by March 1, automatic cuts of about 8 or 9 percent are set to sweep through nearly all federal agencies, with half the money coming out of the military.

Both parties talk about the need to control spending, but lawmakers don't want the kinds of chaotic cuts now barreling toward them. Republicans worry that the Pentagon would be hamstrung; Democrats say vital federal programs would be crippled.

Federal workers would face furloughs or even layoffs, Americans would see all sorts of government services curtailed, and businesses would feel the pinch of reduced government spending.

___

DEBT LIMIT SHOWDOWN

Around the same time, the United States would lose its ability to borrow money to pay its debts, unless Congress acts. That's a big deal, especially since the government borrows about 31 cents of every dollar it spends.

The U.S. bumped against its $16.4 trillion borrowing limit Monday, but the Treasury Department is using special accounting measures to avoid default for now. Private economists say those methods could probably stretch through late February or early March.

After that, the United States would risk its first-ever default.

Hopes of wrapping the issue into the year-end negotiations were dashed, setting up the potential for another standoff. House Speaker John Boehner says any debt increase must be paired with equal spending cuts. Obama says the debt ceiling is too important to negotiate.

Story continues

The last time such a showdown brought the nation close to default, in the summer of 2011, it roiled the financial markets and contributed to Standard & Poor's decision to strip the U.S. government of its AAA bond rating.

___

A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN?

Yet another deadline looms on March 27. The stopgap measure that funds government activities expires; congressional approval will be needed to keep the government running. It's another chance to fight over spending.

In 2011, the nation came within hours of a partial government shutdown that would have furloughed an estimated 800,000 government workers, closed national parks and halted the work of the IRS.

___

THE NATIONAL DEBT

The ""fiscal cliff"" deadline was originally designed to force lawmakers to confront trillion-dollar annual budget deficits that pile the nation's debts higher each year. As larger and larger numbers of baby boomers receive retirement benefits in coming years, the strain on the budget will be unsustainable.

Obama says Medicare's climbing costs must be addressed to fix this. Republicans want to rein in Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs more sharply. Many Democratic lawmakers object. And tampering with programs so popular with voters is never easy.

The ""fiscal cliff"" was supposed to be a way to force Washington to confront the long-term debt problem. The next two months will be another opportunity to come up with a plan or dodge the issues again.

The tough, unpopular decisions are further complicated by concerns that cutting spending too quickly could damage the nation's sluggish economic recovery.

___

WHAT'S DONE

The year-end ""fiscal cliff"" deadline did inspire compromise between Republicans and Democrats on some hotly debated tax questions. Some of the issues settled:

— Payroll taxes are going back up, after being trimmed for two years to help stimulate spending and boost the economy. For most workers, that means paychecks will shrink by 2 percent — another $1,000 for someone earning $50,000 a year. The wealthiest pay a lower share of their income, however, because the Social Security payroll tax applies only to the first $113,700 of earnings.

— The top 1 percent are getting socked with higher income tax rates. Income over $400,000 for individuals or $450,000 for couples will be taxed at a top rate of 39.6 percent, up from 35 percent. Everyone else gets to keep their current income tax rates, which date back to the George W. Bush-era tax cuts.

— The wealthiest Americans will pay higher taxes on their investments. Rates for their capital gains and dividends are rising from 15 to 20 percent. And the tax on estates worth more than $5 million will go up to 40 percent, from 35 percent.

— The alternative minimum tax — designed to keep the wealthy from using loopholes to avoid taxes — will be permanently indexed for inflation so it doesn't catch millions of middle- and upper-middle-income people in its net.

— Tax breaks for families with children, college tuition and low-income workers will continue for five years. A diverse group of temporary business tax breaks were extended for one year.

— Emergency federal unemployment benefits to help 2 million people out of work for at least six months will be extended a year.

— A scheduled 27 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors will be held off for a year in what's become a congressional ritual.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/18/republican-official-house-to-vote-on-debt-ceiling-increase/,2013-01-18 00:00:00,[],House Republicans offer path to avert debt ceiling stand-off -- for now,"House Republicans said Friday they would allow a vote next week on a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, a move that could avert a risky stand-off with President Obama -- at least for now.

Meeting at a retreat in Virginia, House GOP leaders said they would move on a measure allowing the government to borrow for about three more months. Without an extension, the country is expected to exhaust that authority by mid-February, risking the possibility of a market-rattling default.

While Obama has warned Republicans not to challenge him on the debt ceiling, Republicans still see that issue as key leverage to extract spending cuts from Democrats at a time when the debt is well above $16 trillion.

They made clear Friday that they'd continue to press for deficit reduction, but said the next long-term debt-ceiling vote would be conditioned on Congress debating a bona fide budget.

""Unless the Senate acts, there will be no consideration of a long-term debt-ceiling increase,"" House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said.

The Senate has not passed a full-scale budget since 2009, which has drawn lots of criticism from Republicans but protected Democrats controlling the chamber from politically difficult votes.

""Before there is any long-term debt limit increase, a budget should be passed that cuts spending,"" House Speaker John Boehner said. ""The Democratic-controlled Senate has failed to pass a budget for four years. That is a shameful run that needs to end, this year.""

To further pressure Congress, the Republican plan would condition pay for lawmakers on passing a congressional budget measure.

""We are going to pursue strategies that will obligate the Senate to finally join the House in confronting the government's spending problem,"" Boehner told Republican lawmakers at the retreat. ""The principle is simple: `no budget, no pay.""'

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid welcomed the House Republican move, without specifying whether the Senate would support it.

""It is reassuring to see Republicans beginning to back off their threat to hold our economy hostage,"" said Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson. ""If the House can pass a clean debt-ceiling increase to avoid default and allow the United States to meet its existing obligations, we will be happy to consider it.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also said: ""We are encouraged that there are signs that Congressional Republicans may back off their insistence on holding our economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare, education and programs middle class families depend on.""

Republican leaders have been grappling with how to gain leverage in their battles with Obama over the budget. Boehner successfully won about $2 trillion in spending cuts as a condition of increasing the government's borrowing cap in 2011.

Obama, however, successfully pressed through a 10-year, $600 billion increase on upper-bracket tax payers earlier this month.

Other choke points remain, including sharp across-the-board spending cuts that would start to strike the Pentagon and domestic programs alike on March 1 and the possibility of a partial government shutdown with the expiration of a temporary budget measure on March 27.

Failing to meet those deadlines would have far less serious consequences than defaulting on U.S. obligations like payments to bondholders, government pension recipients and myriad other commitments when the government confronts a cash crisis and can no longer borrow to make payments. That could cause a meltdown in financial markets and would inflame voters already disgusted with Congress.

Boehner has previously invoked a promise that any increase in the government's borrowing cap would be matched, dollar for dollar, by spending cuts or ""reforms"" that could include curbs on the long-term growth in retirement programs such as health care for the elderly. Friday's announcement did not repeat that specific promise.

The measure picked up support from key Republican conservatives, including the current and former chairmen of the Republican Study Committee, a powerful group inside the House Republican party.

""In order to allow time for the Senate to act, next week's bill will extend the debt limit for three months,"" the Study Committee said Friday in a statement. ""This is a necessary first step as we work to halt the decline of America and puts the focus where it belongs: on the Senate who has failed to do their jobs to pass a budget for more than three years.""

Obama's budget is due early next month but is expected to be released several weeks later.

“We all know that we have one looming,” Boehner said on ABC’s “This Week”. “And we have one looming because we have entitlement programs that are not sustainable in their current form. They’re going to go bankrupt.”

Boehner expressed agreement with Obama’s statement in an ABC interview the other day that the debt doesn’t present “an immediate crisis.”

But Boehner took issue with Obama’s assertion that it doesn’t make sense to “chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance.”

The new spending plan from House Republicans would balance the budget in 10 years, a priority Boehner said this morning is important to the economy.

“Balancing the budget will, in fact, help our economy,” Boehner said. “It’ll help create jobs in our country, get our economy going again, and put more people back to work.”

“The fact that the government continues to spend more than a trillion dollars every year that it doesn’t have scares investors, scares businesspeople, makes them less willing to hire people,” he said.

In a wide-ranging interview, Boehner said the House would “review” any gun control measure that came out of the Senate. He restated his opposition to gay marriage, and said that, unlike his fellow Ohio Republican, Sen. Rob Portman, he can’t imagine a situation in which he would change his mind. Portman said this week that his views had evolved since he found out his son is gay.

Dwelling on budget issues, Boehner said he has a good relationship with Obama and trusts him, and that a lack of good relations is not the problem getting in the way of a sweeping deficit-reduction plan.

The challenge is in overcoming big differences, he said.

“When you get down to bottom line,” he said, “if the president believes that we have to have more taxes from the American people, we’re not going to get very far.”

“Washington has responsibility, to our seniors and our near seniors, that we firm up these programs so that they’re there for the long term,” Boehner said.

“Because if we don’t do it, not only will they not get benefits, we will have a debt crisis right around the corner. We have time to solve our problems. But we need to do it now.”

USA TODAY

Federal parks and museums would be closed

Even weddings would be affected

Federal workers worry about missing paychecks

In Plymouth, Mass., Cassandra Lester worries about the stress her fiancé faces as a Marine veteran receiving disability and other benefits who might not be able to ""pay bills, school, rent.""

In Lansing, Mich., Jessica Yorko says she is in the middle of a mortgage refinance and worries that a federal shutdown will delay her FHA loan and cost her a locked-in loan rate.

More than 40% of federal workers across the nation face furlough if the government shuts down Tuesday. Social Security recipients will receive benefits, mail service will continue and taxes will still be collected. But the impact will be great, and it will spread far beyond Washington and the federal buildings scattered across the nation.

Lester, 27, says that when government workers were furloughed in 2011, the couple went four months without military benefits because paperwork wasn't processed. Now her fiancé is due to complete his studies as a diesel technician in November, and she is concerned that he may not receive any educational or disability benefits during a shutdown — ""and of course, we cannot get anyone on the phone at the VA,"" she says.

She says their situation is more stable now than in 2011, but as they plan their wedding, they are dogged by concerns about paying their bills if the shutdown lasts too long and a VA paperwork backlog develops.

""He worked for this money. It is his money,"" she says. ""We assumed that the money for veterans was secured and set aside in accounts for the veterans. He put his life on the line for two deployments to Iraq in the thick of wartime only to have spoiled politicians, who have all their bills comfortably paid, for us to become default on our bills and unable to pay rent.""

Cyndi Luttrell, 49, works at a federal data processing facility in Jeffersonville, Ind. She and more than 800 co-workers have been told that if the government shuts down, they will be sent home.

""Eighty percent of us normally earn $30,000 a year or less,"" she says. ""We have mortgages, kids, student loans. If we miss even one or two days of pay, that's a lot to us. We have lives out here that Congress is messing with.""

Head Start centers will close if the government does. In the Tallahassee area, that would hit nearly 400 children, their families and 100 staffers.

""We're providing a very robust preschool experience to children who live in families in poverty,"" said Tim Center, executive director of the Capital Area Community Action Agency, which administers the program in a three-county area. ""And that enables those parents to go to school, find work or go to a job. And you take away child care, parents can't go to work.""

Head Start serves 378 children ages 3 and 4, offering not only preschool but also medical, dental and mental-health care and a variety of social and other services. Children in the program receive breakfast, lunch and an afternoon snack, food they might not get otherwise, Center said.

The shutdown would slam the gates and shut the doors of places such as national parks, historic sites, the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, where the animals will be cared for but the panda cam will go dark.

The historic district of Philadelphia is a tourist mecca, with thousands of visitors daily crowding Independence Mall, the Liberty Bell and other historic sites. That won't be the case if the federal government shuts down. And that doesn't bode well for the shops and vendors that cater to those tourists.

""It'll have a big effect,"" one tourist in the crowded mall area told the local CBS affiliate. ""Nobody's going to be going into the stores to eat or buy anything. I don't know how they can do that (close the sites). This is history. Look at all these people.""

If the museums and monuments shut down and are still closed on Oct. 16, 270 eighth graders from John Witherspoon Middle School in Princeton, N.J., will be very disappointed, principal Jason Burr says.

His eighth graders visit Washington every year as part of their civics course. They tour the Capitol, the Smithsonian museums and all the monuments.

""They look forward to this more than any other thing they do all year,"" he says.

The trip is usually in May, but it was planned for off-peak travel this year. Thinking about last October, when Superstorm Sandy hit, Burr says he was worried about the possibility of bad weather.

""I didn't think I would have to be worried about a government shutdown,"" he says. ""I hope cooler heads prevail,"" he says.

The Mississippi Gulf Coast Honor Flight will escort 91 World War II veterans from the Gulf Coast to the World War II Memorial on Tuesday morning whether the government is open or closed, says Rep. Steven Palazzo, R-Miss., who will be there to greet them.

If the government shuts down, the National Park Service will erect barricades around the memorials on the National Mall and close the two streets that flank it, NPS spokeswoman Carol Johnson said. The Park Service won't have the money to staff the memorials, she said.

""It's a huge disservice to our World War II veterans, to whom we owe so much,"" Palazzo said. ""For them to step off the bus and be met with Park Service personnel and barricades, it's heartbreaking. And it makes me fighting mad.""

For many of the veterans, who range in age from 84 to 98, it is their first trip to Washington, Palazzo said. Veterans groups from 10 other states are scheduled to visit the memorial over the next week, he said.

""It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see the memorial erected in their honor,"" he said.

Palazzo sent a letter Monday to President Obama and made phone calls to the National Park Service about access to the memorials. He said he doesn't understand why the federal government must restrict access to an open-air park.

""Why would they spend the time and effort to barricade something that's generally open to the public day and night?"" he said. ""They are going to have to spend extra money just to keep people out.""

Thousands of runners are registered for Sunday's Woodrow Wilson Bridge Half Marathon that starts near George Washington's Mount Vernon, Va., homestead and includes several miles along the George Washington Memorial Parkway, which is operated by the National Park Service.

The Park Service said Monday that if the government closes, all of its programs will be canceled. Race officials posted a note on Facebook that ""since our first 8 miles are in a National Park, we could be affected. We will be making a public statement on Wednesday to update all of our runners.""

At Crater Lake National Park in Oregon, the first step would be closing the gates. People already camping would have until 6 p.m. Thursday to leave.

Park employees would show up for about four hours to close all the gates, update phone greetings and then leave.

""A few law enforcement rangers and water treatment and snowplow operators would stay on, but that would be it,"" said Marsha McCabe, public information officer at the park.

A similar scenario would play out at campsites, day-use sites and parks run by the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management across the country. At recreation destinations with no controlled access, the public could visit but there would be no services available for emergencies.

In West Texas at Big Bend National Park, an 800,000-acre expanse of soaring canyons and hiking trails near the Mexican border, Danny Ferguson says Forever Resorts, which provides concessions for hotels and RV parks in and around the park, has had only two cancellations, but he expected many more if the shutdown takes place.

The crisis comes at the worst time, he said; October is one of the park's busiest months and hotel rooms are nearly 100% reserved.

A shutdown even threatens wedded bliss.

The National Mall and Memorial Parks have issued 24 permits for October weddings at the Lincoln Memorial, George Mason Memorial and the D.C. War Memorial, spokeswoman Carol Johnson says. An e-mail went out Monday telling prospective brides and grooms, who apply for the permits up to a year in advance, that if the government shuts down, all events are canceled, she says.

""Those memorials will be closed,"" Johnson said. ""I think people will be quite upset. Unfortunately, it's beyond our control.""

The Mall itself, the grassy swath that reaches from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, would close. Barricades would block Jefferson and Madison drives, the roads that flank the Mall, and some of the memorials themselves. Public restrooms will be locked. Even the fountains that grace the parks will go dry, she said. Trash pickup at federal park properties will be suspended, including federal spaces throughout the city, such as Farragut Square Park and Dupont Circle.

Bottom line: Thousands of people will not get to see what they came to Washington to see.

""We get 1,200 buses filled with 50 people a day, easily thousands of people,"" Johnson said. ""A lot of people are going to be very disappointed.""

If California's Yosemite National Park closes, weddings scheduled at the two hotels inside the park, the Ahwahnee and the Wawona, will move to the Tenaya Lodge, a hotel and resort a few miles from the park's southern gate, says Lisa Cesaro, spokeswoman for DNC Parks and Resorts at Yosemite, which runs all three hotels.

""We do have some weddings for the coming week, so we're on standby. We have a contingency plan in the workswith alternative accommodations,"" Cesaro said.

The couples who have booked the weddings are moving ahead with their plans, she said.

""It's really unfortunate. This is not a situation you'd want to be in as a bride, but we're optimistic,"" she said. ""We'll just have to wait and see. If it happens, we'll work around it and do our best to accommodate everyone.""

Not everyone is concerned about the shutdown, however. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and others demanding that ""Obamacare"" be defunded as part of a deal to avert the crisis have their supporters, too.

""The gov't shutdown will save us all some money, my life won't be affected at all,"" tweeted Jason Sipes, pastor of West Hickman (Ky.) Baptist Church. ""Thank you Mr. Cruz for sticking up for us.""

As the clock ticks toward those mandatory budget cuts that could arrive on March 1, those listening to the news would think an asteroid is about to hit planet Earth.

Our Defense Department tells us our Defense Department can’t be cut or the world will end.

Our first responders tell us our first responders can’t be cut or the world will end.

Our National Park Service tells us our National Park Service can’t be cut or the world will end.

Our national parks were created to preserve nature, undisturbed by man. Now we are told that if we leave nature untouched, it will perish. When did the essential ingredients of biological existence become oxygen, water, sunlight and federal funding? Apparently, the Grand Canyon will cease to be a hole in the ground if the National Park Service loses a few cents of every dollar it has been given.

But let’s set aside the indispensability of man to nature, for a moment, to concentrate on a conflict of interest.

Why would we expect any public servant to tell us his or her work is suddenly less vital to our nation? Do we believe any government agency would confess that it could do with a single tax dollar less?

Opinion: Forced cuts a disaster for military

Even if the federal government tapped into Solomon’s Mines, awash with riches, would they say, “We were preparing to set our extra cash on fire but thank heavens you are here and have some use for it! Please cut our budget!” Even then, we know, Washington could not imagine itself less important or in need.

So why are we allowing ourselves to be blackmailed with our own money by those we’ve employed to serve us?

Washington is throwing a tantrum. It is threatening to hold its breath until it turns blue unless it gets what it wants. Washington is a study in juvenile petulance. If at any time it has demonstrated a childish need for discipline, this moment is it.

The American people have learned to do with less in the past six years. Less after they pay higher taxes. Less after they pay more for gas. Less after they lose their jobs or portion out smaller paychecks. Less after their homes shrink into debt. Less after their businesses fail.

But there is another economy, distant from theirs. And it is growing. Washington’s economy has learned to do with more.

Under Republican and Democratic presidents, the federal budget has grown by $1.7 trillion dollars over the past decade. Washington now has the third largest concentration of high-income households of any metropolitan area in America. A little over a year ago, Washington surpassed Silicon Valley for the highest average income in the country.

Opinion: Plenty to cut at Pentagon

Today, it is Washington’s elites, not just Wall Street’s, who make news flying to golf vacations in Florida and skiing trips in Aspen, enjoying haute cuisine at Washington’s tony Minibar. During his tenure at Citigroup from 2006 to 2008, our new treasury secretary, Jack Lew, took a nearly $1 million bonus a day before the company took a taxpayer-funded bailout. He also invested $56,000 in a fund, headquartered in a Cayman Islands building, that Obama once called “the largest tax scam in the world.”

Horace Greeley might urge, “Go east, young man.” There is gold in Washington’s hills.

What might a real leader, a president, do at this point?

He might say, “Under these difficult circumstances, let’s ask government to tighten its belt 2%, since Americans have had to tighten theirs. Let’s remember whom we are here to serve. Let’s lead by example, do our jobs more efficiently and make these cuts as painless as possible.”

We hear nothing like that from this White House.

Instead, Barack Obama directs his lieutenants to echo his threats against the people who pay their salaries. Unless Congress expands the instruments of redistribution he finds necessary to ensure his dream of equality, he promises that the sequester deal it agreed to in 2011 will rain down in “harsh, arbitrary cuts” that would “devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research … slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.”

These words come from our own president. As Bob Woodward reports, Obama originated this particular bit of Washington lunacy now known as the sequester but the blame for this mess can be laid at Republican and Democratic feet.

Both parties agreed to this contemptible game where Washington holds a gun to America’s head as they dare each other to pull the trigger. And we, the American people, permit it. What won’t we tolerate if we sheepishly allow this?

We should mark this moment, when tantrums became threats and our leaders surrendered the pretense they were serving us.

Then let’s sing, “Washington, the Beautiful” because whatever America once was, Washington is.

With Tropical Storm Chantal headed for South Florida with landfall likely Saturday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott is sounding alarm bells about the impact of National Guard furloughs on state storm preparations. “The problem is you’re losing training time, you’re losing preparation time,” Scott said during a radio interview in Jacksonville. “When will the National Guard make the decision that we stop the furloughs? Right after the hurricane hits?”

Scott joined with two other Southern Republican governors whose states are in the path of tropical storms to write a letter to President Obama urging him to call off the furloughs. In Florida, nearly 1,000 employees of the National Guard are furloughed once a week, saving the federal government money under the congressionally mandated sequester but costing the state in readiness.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, you are a dumbass. Sorry, but there's really no other professional political way to put it. It looks once again like a group of austerity-obsessed Republicans have suddenly discovered a pressing new need for some of those parts of government they decided they didn't want to pay for. Specifically, the part they suddenly discover personally affects them Mr. Scott, I have it on very good authority that the National Guard has been implementing furloughs because Republicans insisted they not be paid enough to avoid furloughs. It was called sequestration and it was in all the papers. You may have heard of it.One of those two other Southern Republican governors is of course Bobby Jindal, most famous for being pissed off at something called ""volcano monitoring"" because his state doesn't have volcanos, but a firm believer in ""hurricane monitoring"" because Bobby Jindal only believes in things he can see out his window. It isn't so much an ideological conviction for him as it is pure self-centeredness, self-centeredness above and beyond that of the usual Republican wag.

So that's great, you're sending a letter off to President Obama saying you're very very peeved about the congressionally mandated requirement that members of the National Guard be furloughed because Republicans have insisted not just on implementing what all parties agreed at the beginning was the Stupidest Possible Way to cut spending, but are now insisting that we not actually fix because Congress is literally simply too incompetent to pass any better idea. You know who would be a better person to complain to than President Obama? The damn Republicans who insist on the furloughs. The people who put the ""mandate"" in the ""congressional mandate"" part. You even have their numbers, it wouldn't be a hard call.

Unless, of course, this isn't actually about avoiding potentially dangerous cuts to government safety programs, but about moving money around (the executive branch can't do a whole lot of that either, by the way) so as to screw somebody else in order to reverse only the cuts to government safety that affect you, and your state, and the people who will have your head on a plastic cafeteria tray if you screw things up. Because that wouldn't just be stupid, that'd make you kind of a bastard.

My lingering suspicion has long been that the House, crippled by their own ideological schisms, incompetence and eff-it-all approach to government, will never be able to actually pass any legislation that removes the need for government-wide furloughs, program cancellations, and other drastic measures. They'll just go through the entire roster of government duties one-by-one, refunding each and every thing a week after the cut to that thing resulted in either a minor fiasco or an outright disaster, and only when the fiascos or outright disasters are things they can personally see out their office windows. That seems to be the case—though if we count recent House Republican reactions to natural disasters not in their own states but merely in other Republican-led states, even that might might be expecting too much of them.

As politicians in Washington slam one another over competing budget priorities, most avoid facing up to the disturbing question behind all the numbers: Is the American Dream temporarily stalled or permanently kaput?

Last Sunday, Parade magazine presented its annual survey, “What People Earn,” an exercise guaranteed to appall and infuriate readers as they compare their own salaries with the likes of Brad Pitt and LeBron James. The story is pretty much the same every year: Entertainers and athletes rake in tens of millions while secretaries and forest rangers scrape by on $35,000 to $40,000.

Sure, it seems a little insane that 19-year-old Justin Bieber makes $55 million – $6,261 an hour – while his high school music teacher probably struggles to pay the mortgage on his house, but the difference between what superstar entertainers earn and what undervalued educators are paid has always been ridiculous. The economics of Hollywood are abnormal. They may say something about our warped values, but they have never been representative of the entire economy – at least not until now.

It is more telling that Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz made close to $30 million last year while a typical twenty-something barrista at one of his coffee shops cannot find a better job, even with a college degree at the top of her resume, and so lives at home with Mom and Dad. CEOs and bankers and hedge fund managers are the new superstars of the economy. In many industries, the few men at the top make a hundred times the income of the guys and gals on the factory floor or in the office cubicles. And this is not because the men and women with the lower salaries fail to work hard enough.

Economics columnist Jon Talton recently did a rundown of the facts about today’s American economy. Among his findings:

• Worker productivity has increased nearly 23% since 2000, but hourly wages rose a pitiful 0.5% in that period.

• Taking a longer view back to 1973, productivity is up 80% between now and then, but pay is up only 11%.

• People at the bottom of the wage scale are earning less now than similar workers in 1979.

• Employees in the middle of the wage scale are getting 6% more than in 1979, but all that increase happened in the 1990s.

• High earners, meanwhile, are making 37% more than back in the 1970s, and the much-talked-about folks in the top 1% have enjoyed a 131% increase in earnings.

It is bad enough that we are going back to the income disparities of the 19thcentury’s Gilded Age, but Talton, like many other observers of the U.S. economy, notes that modern America is also becoming more stratified. We are moving toward the “Downton Abbey” society of the waning British Empire and away from the anyone-can-make-it-big America of the 1950s and ‘60s. Britain of 2013 has greater social mobility than the USA. In fact, it is now easier for the average German, Japanese or Dane to rise through the income ranks than it is for the average American. And if you are undereducated or mired in poverty, you are almost certainly stuck where you are – and the same goes for your children.

This is not the country we like to think we are and it is not the country our political leaders are willing to admit they have helped create. Thirty years of catering to Wall Street, big business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has not boosted the American economy the way it was meant to do. Yes, the financial industry and giant corporations are awash in wealth, but they are not hiring more workers, they are not paying better pay, they are not enhancing benefits, they are not sharing the wealth. On the contrary, the typical American is working much harder for worse compensation. He or she is paying a bigger share of the healthcare bill and has no pension plan waiting at the end of the line.

Details of a plan reached last week appear to show state legislative leaders are attempting to solve Illinois' $100 billion pension crisis in part by changing workers' retirement age, reducing automatic pension increases and limiting their collective-bargaining privileges.

Union leaders argue the plan to help the under-funded pension plan, which appears to have bipartisan support, seems no different than the one the General Assembly rejected earlier this year.

“It’s an unfair, unconstitutional scheme that undermines retirement security,” the We Are One Illinois labor coalition said last week as details of the plan emerged. ""It’s no compromise at all with those who earned and paid for their retirement benefits. In fact, reports suggest the leaders have repackaged Senate Bill 1 and barely bothered to disguise it.”

Rank-and-file state lawmakers were briefed on the plan Friday, and a vote could come as early as this week.

Leaders of the unions, a usually reliable Democratic vote, are specifically targeting Democratic state senators from moderate, swing districts where election opponents can hammer them for inaction or being too tough on state workers and say eight to 10 of them are considered ""persuadable.""

The battle is the most recent to play out across the Midwest where Republican governors in Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan have worked to limit collective bargain deals to reduce budget shortfalls.

The most epic battle took place in Wisconsin in 2011 when GOP Gov. Scott Walker led an effort to get the General Assembly to pass legislation that limited collective bargaining for most state workers and required them to pay more for their pensions and health-care benefits to help reduce a projected $137 million budget shortfall.

The move sparked weeks of protests in the state capitol, a national debate on the issue and a failed attempt to recall Walker, who was faced with a projected $3.6 billion deficit when he signed the legislation.

Illinois Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn and the four legislative leaders of the Democrat-controlled Assembly say the plan will save the state an estimated $160 billion over 30 years and are working to secure enough support for passage.

At The Washington Post', 'She Has Written About The Federal Workforce', 'State Politics', 'Government In Annapolis', 'In Richmond']",Yellowstone gets real about budget cuts,"Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the location of Cooke City, Mont. It is at the park’s northeast, not northwest, entrance. This version has been corrected.

— The giant yellow snowplows that wake Yellowstone from its winter slumber every March are idled, waiting for the sun to make up for federal budget cuts that are forcing the park to open late for peak season.

Mandatory cuts kicked in three days before the plows were to start clearing snow and ice from 300 roads at altitudes that reach 11,000 feet. Faced with an order from Washington to slice $1.8 million from his budget, the park superintendent, Dan Wenk, had considered his options.

He could slash the ranks of the 430 seasonal rangers, guides and other employees who help keep Yellowstone running every summer. But it would mean fewer visitor centers open, fewer walking tours and a risk to public safety.

He could halt the bison-management program — but the program is required under a court settlement. He could close the park for two weeks before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, but that would mean shutting out 267,000 visitors.

Or he could keep the seasonals, just fewer of them, and bring them on two weeks later, saving $450,000. He could freeze all permanent hires ($1 million), delay the snowplows ($250,000) and open most entrances two weeks late. About 50,000 visitors would be lost, and hundreds of fishing and hiking guides, rangers, and concession workers would lose their livelihoods.

But it seemed the best bad alternative. The sun would melt and soften the snow, saving $30,000 a day.

“We didn’t say we’re going to shut the park down” for the season, Wenk said. “But it will have real impacts.”

At parks, military bases and federal agencies across the country, managers such as Wenk are weighing choices being forced by the budget reductions known as sequestration.

“Everybody says, ‘We want you to run the park like a private business,’ ” he said, referring to the 5.1 percent cut he must make over seven months, which will feel a lot bigger. “Well, here it is. The impact is 9 percent.”

Early Monday, he sat in regulation khakis in the brown armchair in his office, five miles inside the park, 2,174 miles from Washington. The temperature outside was 3 degrees. He looked over a long list of calls and meetings on his schedule to make it official that plowing would not start on time.

He dialed the governor of Montana.

“There’s a lot of misinformation out there that we are just doing this to make a statement about the effects of sequestration,” he told Gov. Steve Bullock (D), walking him through his decision.

“That’s where we are, sir,” Wenk said.

Bullock thanked him for the briefing. Then things got messy.

By midday, a news release had gone out, and the angry while-you-were-out slips were piling up. Tour guide Rusty Cole’s was at the top.

“He’s mad as hell and not buying your argument,” read the message.

“Rusty should call his congressman,” Wenk said in frustration, rubbing his eyes.

And Cole did. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) returned his call that night.

“He said the delayed opening is not a done deal,” recounted Cole, who is furious that park officials are slashing two weeks from his 20-week season.

“They spend millions of dollars to operate Air Force One, and they can’t come up with some money to blow open the roads in Yellowstone?” Cole said.

But the sequestration law slices money from most budgets across the government, including $136 million from the 398 national parks.

In 1872, the federal government saw to it that the spectacular landscape of 2.2 million acres, which is ringed by the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, was protected as America’s first national park. Today, Yellowstone country is a deeply conservative place, where government is regarded with great suspicion.

Just ask Wyoming’s lone House member, Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R), who applauded the $85 billion carved across the board in a letter to constituents.

“Instead of blindly filling empty desks,” she wrote last week, “federal agencies will be forced to consider which positions are crucial and make their decision based on necessity rather than luxury.”

In an interview, Lummis suggested that Wenk petition House and Senate appropriators for permission to take money from his capital budget to cover the cuts, an idea he said was not legal and would never get through Congress in time.

The late opening has further inflamed the area’s anti-government sentiment as small, rural communities that serve park visitors absorb the reality of the cuts. In the large scheme of 3.4 million annual visits, losing 50,000 seems small.

But the ripple effect on jobs and tourism could means millions of dollars in lost income. The plowing delay also means that snow won’t be cleared until mid-June from the scenic Beartooth Highway, which straddles Montana and Wyoming outside the park. The National Park Service plows about half the the road.

“We have 90 days to make a living,” said Sam Bolinger, 56, who leads whitewater rafting tours along the Yellowstone River from Gardiner, Mont., in the summer and grooms park trails in the winter. “If people get the impression they can’t get into the park, they just won’t come.”

There was the hostile reaction from the mayor of Jackson, Wyo., 60 miles from the park’s south entrance, who told Wenk that anyone knows how to cut 5.1 percent from a budget without inflicting this much pain.

“This is, with all due respect, an asinine decision,” Mark Barron said in a conference call with business and community leaders. Jackson recently cut its budget by 22 percent, Barron said, “and we didn’t cut any services.”

“This is a small cut in your budget, sir,” Barron continued. “If I ran my business like this, I wouldn’t be in business long.”

It was the day’s one moment when Wenk, a self-possessed and widely respected 60-year-old civil servant, got mad. He was acting Park Service director in Washington in 2011 when the top job opened at Yellowstone. He had been a management assistant to the park superintendent in the early 1980s, and he and his wife couldn’t wait to get back.

Wenk managed to contain his temper, though, telling Barron that Yellowstone’s $33 million budget is $3.7 million smaller than it was three years ago. He asked Barron whether the park should continue to stay open in the winter, when each visitor costs $55 — vs. $10 in the summer. When the call was over, Wenk and his deputy, Steve Iobst, wondered how one could slash 22 percent just like that.

As sequestration hit, the park was preparing for high season, closing the hotels and restaurants that serve its fewer than 100,000 winter tourists. Yellowstone in winter is a landscape of white, broken only by pine trees and half-

frozen rivers. Clouds of steam from the park’s many geysers billow into the cold, while herds of bison forage. The only way around is by snowmobile, and that’s the tourist draw.

“We just saw a fox for the second time today,” marveled Tina Don, visiting from Cedarhurst, N.Y., and warming up inside a concession trailer. “The same fox!” Her husband, Scott Dere, pulled out his iPhone and scrolled through his photos. A bison, an elk, a bald eagle. Don pointed out that her hot chocolate cost just $2.25 (“There’s no place in New York you could get hot chocolate for that”) and said the park should raise the price to cover the budget cuts.

By late May, the place will be humming with cars and RVs, campfires and hikers.

The small towns at the park’s edge have been closely following Washington’s budget wars. All roads to survival lead to Yellowstone. “We’re here all day, hoping someone comes in for a cup of coffee,” said Jan Gaertner, who owns the Buns N Beds restaurant and cabins in Cooke City, Mont., population 300. “For us, $400 in a day in April is good.”

At the Old Faithful visitor center, Rich Jehle said half of his six supervisor jobs are vacant and won’t be filled, which will mean fewer guided walks around the geyser and other attractions.

“We’ll be spread thin, but we’ll adapt,” said Jehle, who oversees about half of the park’s the visitor centers and interpretive programs.

On Wednesday, Wenk was 90 minutes into a meeting with his managers to decide which seasonal workers would not be called back and how the park would adjust to permanent vacancies, when the Wyoming governor’s office called. The governor was getting complaints about the opening delay.

And Cooke City residents in particular were in a civil war. Cooke City sits on an eight-mile section of highway outside the park’s northeast entrance that’s usually plowed by the Park Service, opening access to eastern Montana. Wenk offered to plow the road first, but the snowmobile industry balked: Paved roads mean less business. Now the plow crews won’t arrive until the end of May, angering other businesses who want the road cleared.

Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead (R) organized an emergency conference call for Wednesday to figure out whether Wenk could reverse his decision or whether there was any other way to open the park on time. About 20 mayors, tourism and business leaders and state transportation officials dialed in. Mead was asked whether the state would plow the roads in the park.

It was an uncomfortable spot. A state bailout of the federal government to help his constituents? Wyoming has just sliced 6.5 percent from state spending while raising the fuel tax — a combination of new revenue and cuts that Washington can’t seem to agree to.

“It’s a bad message for Wyoming to say, Yellowstone is not open, call back later,” Mead said in an interview. “But do I ask that state resources step in to cure a large federal screw-up?”

His answer late Friday: No. His office announced that the state would provide labor and equipment — but will not “backfill federal dollars lost through sequestration.” That means the park communities must pay for the plowing.

Local leaders said they are trying to raise the money. But every day causes more delays.

Wenk is already thinking about next year, when he said he will be forced to consider closing the park in the winter. Sequestration, he thought, is here to stay.

The so-called ""Penny Plan"" would, according to its sponsors, balance the federal budget in two years by using just a 1 percent reduction in spending.

The lawmakers are pitching the plan in the simplest terms -- cutting a penny from every dollar the government spends so that spending will soon equal revenue. They cast the plan as a pick-and-choose alternative to the sequester's across-the-board budget cuts.

""Everybody should be able to live with one percent less in order to help bring this country back from the brink of catastrophic failure,"" bill sponsor and Wyoming Republican Sen. Mike Enzi said in submitting the legislation just before August recess.

Enzi is joined by fellow GOP Sens. Rand Paul, of Kentucky; John Barrasso, of Wyoming; Jim Risch, of Idaho; David Vitter, of Louisiana; Johnny Isakson, of Georgia; and Marco Rubio, of Florida. Republican Georgia Rep. Austin Scott introduced similar legislation in the House.

Senate sponsors warn that federal spending over the past 11 years has increased from 18 percent of the country's GDP to nearly 23 percent. And without intervention, they say, the national debt will go from roughly $16 billion to $25 billion by 2023, increasing interest payment so much that balancing the budget will go ""beyond the reach of Congress.""

The 1 percent cut would last two years, followed by a cap on total annual spending -- equal to roughly 19 percent of GDP. Supporters say it also will cut spending over roughly 10 years by about $5.8 trillion, based on currently projected levels.

The senators say only that the plan takes a ""worst first"" approach to the cuts -- in other words, leaving it to lawmakers to cut what they deem the most wasteful items first -- as long as the overall 1 percent cut is achieved.

Enzi has frequently talked about reducing spending by eliminating ineffective, outdated and redundant federal programs.

""You don't need five agencies doing the same thing, especially when their programs could be combined or cut,"" Enzi spokesman Daniel Head told FoxNews.com.

However, the bill singles out only entitlements.

""Absent reform, the growth of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other health-related spending will overwhelm all other federal programs,"" the bill states.

This is not the first time the plan has surfaced on Capitol Hill.

Enzi proposed similar legislation in 2011 with then-Florida Republican Rep. Connie Mack that also got Paul's support.

Paul refreshed the idea in March during his Tea Party response to President Obama's State of the Union address.

The idea is backed largely by conservative groups including FreedomWorks and the Tea Party Patriots. It also garnered support during its Capitol Hill debut from former Clinton administration aide Lanny Davis, who said the plan also needs a revenue-raising component but was ""practical"" and seemed like ""a good place to start.""

Still, the plan does not appear to enjoy widespread support among progressives.

Jim Dean, chairman for Democracy for America, called the plan ""one of the more idiotic pieces of legislation"" put forth by Congress' Tea Party-aligned lawmakers.

""Americans are smart enough to see it for what it really is: a stealth effort to gut our dwindling retirement security by slashing over $1 trillion from Social Security and more than $200 billion from Medicare,"" he told FoxNew.com.

Washington has meanwhile made progress on cutting the federal deficit, largely through recent spending cuts and tax increases, including the hike in January on Americans' highest earners.

After topping $1 trillion for four straight years, the budget is projected to fall to $642 billion in the budget year ending in September and shrink even further in the next several years before starting to grow again at the end of the decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

However, the Republican senators warned that entitlements if left unchecked will ""consume"" the additional tax revenue.

The Employment Development Department upgraded its 30-year-old system over Labor Day weekend with the aim of streamlining benefits processing. But the new system malfunctioned, forcing state workers to approve payments manually. That has created a massive backlog snaring 15% of claims filed since Sept. 1.

State officials say they’re working around the clock, but can’t say when they’ll catch up. The EDD has apologized on social media and is notifying affected Californians by mail.

But that’s little consolation to those whose benefits have been delayed. Many are falling behind on rent, car payments, and other bills and fault the EDD for its lack of action.

“They say they’re very sorry, but sorry doesn’t pay all the late fees we’re being charged due to their negligence,” said Tanya Cain, 43, who was laid off from a construction firm in late July. “A landlord doesn’t understand why you can’t pay the rent. They just understand you’re not paying it.”

Cain is owed about $1,500 in back payments. She has borrowed money to stay afloat but is down to her last $50. An automatic car insurance payment is about to hit her bank account, which would leave her overdrawn.

The computer snafu is the latest problem to plague the EDD, which has been forced to reduce services in recent months because of federal budget cuts. The agency no longer answers its unemployment hotline in the afternoons, and its regional jobs centers have lost some funding.

Loree Levy, a spokeswoman for the EDD, said officials expected some hiccups with the system upgrade “but we didn’t know it’d be to this magnitude.”

“We are well aware of the hardship this has created for people,” Levy said. “It’s requiring our utmost attention.”

Out-of-work Californians file their benefits claims by phone, mail or online. The new computer system was aimed at shortening the time needed for approval by automating much of the backroom administrative work.

The new system inadvertently flagged thousands of claims for additional review, Levy said, creating a logjam in the already taxed system. She said hundreds of EDD employees have been working overtime to process the outstanding claims by hand.

From Friday to Sunday, state workers approved $31.7 million in unemployment benefits, the agency said. Offices are normally closed Sunday, but the agency typically processes an average of $17.5 million in benefits Fridays to Saturdays.

“We think we’re finally through the worst of it,” Levy said.

Still, it’s a black eye for the agency tasked with providing employer-funded benefits to the state’s jobless. Legislators around the state, who are currently on recess, said their offices have been fielding calls and emails from residents who are not getting unemployment payments.

A spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown referred inquiries to the EDD.

“Some are angry and upset. Some simply need the checks so they can pay the bills,” said state Sen. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance). “If this is prolonged, then it will cause ripple effects for people who can’t pay their living expenses.”

Lieu said his office was doing what it could to help constituents by calling the EDD about individual cases. He blamed part of the problem on the federal budget cuts known as sequestration.

“The EDD lost an enormous number of positions,” he said.

In 2010, at the height of California’s unemployment when 1.5 million people were receiving unemployment payouts, the agency had 3,210 workers processing claims, according to the EDD’s Levy. There are now 2,182 workers processing 770,000 unemployment claims.

The EDD has been criticized in the past for being slow and unresponsive to unemployed Californians.

A state audit last year found that in the fiscal year ended June 2012, more than 17 million calls to the EDD — 24% of all calls made — went unanswered. And of the nearly 30 million calls in which individuals asked to speak with an EDD agent, 84% were unsuccessful.

The agency says it was hampered by the sharp rise in claims caused by the lingering effects of the recession and has since instituted changes recommended by auditors.

One economist said the state government has an obligation to send checks on time so people dependent on those payments can buy food and pay for necessities.

“It’s a serious and critical situation,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Cal State Channel Islands. “Many people receiving benefits, they live check to check. If it’s delayed even a day, it could mean that they can’t eat.”

The EDD’s recent troubles come as the state’s labor market has cooled and the jobless rate has ticked up. The agency reported last week that the state unemployment rate in August rose to 8.9%, the second straight monthly increase.

Despite an improvement in employment levels in recent years, 4.7 million people in the U.S. have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more, according to the Labor Department. The long-term unemployed account for 38% of all those still looking for work.

Californians waiting for unemployment checks are expressing outrage on social media, posting complaints on the EDD’s Facebook page.

One woman wrote: “You guys are horrible, been waiting too long... Sold my wedding band Friday just to get through the weekend, and it’s now Monday, still [nothing].”

Others are sharing tips on how to get an agent on the phone, listing various phone numbers to get patched through. Some posts have included information on how to get emergency food and aid from nonprofit groups.

Cutting through the red tape has been frustrating for former insurance agent Bonnie Schultz, 61.

The Banning resident said she depends on the $450 she gets each week to pay her $988 monthly mortgage. She has already missed a payment on her homeowner insurance and can barely fill her gas tank.

Getting an answer to when her claim will be processed has been a chore. Schultz said she called EDD numerous times without reaching anyone.

“Why have they not sent us something in the mail at least saying there’s a problem?” she said. “This is insane.”

Shear', 'Jonathan Weisman']",Obama Seeking to Take Credit and Set Course for Economy,"Mr. Obama’s adversaries on Monday were quick to point out that the president has frequently set out on similar campaign-style efforts to redefine or restate his economic agenda, often accompanied by rhetoric from his advisers about a new direction or emphasis. Congressional Republicans said they were incredulous that Mr. Obama planned to use another set of speeches instead of legislative negotiations to advance his economic agenda.

“It’s a cliché, but if all you’ve got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio. “They don’t know how to do anything else.”

In the fall of 2011, Mr. Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to unveil a $447 billion jobs bill that has not passed. In 2012, as his re-election campaign neared its end, he renewed his vision with a 20-page economic plan. In his State of the Union address in February, the president refocused on the economy after beginning his second term focused on gun control, immigration, climate change and gay rights. And just this past May, Mr. Obama announced he was restarting his “Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity Tour,” with stops in Baltimore and Austin, Tex.

“They’ve been saying the same thing for four years,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate. “The previous Democrat Congress passed his agenda — Obamacare, the stimulus, thousands of pages of regulations — and the economy is treading water. More taxes, more regulation, and more failures to unleash American energy jobs are not the answer.”

Administration officials on Monday conceded that the president was partly to blame for the debates in Washington veering away from the economic issues that many Americans believe are the most important. One official said that it was incumbent on Mr. Obama to shift the overall focus of the conversation in Washington, but acknowledged that has not happened.

The officials also criticized Republicans, especially in the House, for seizing on what the White House says are overblown scandals: the targeting of nonprofit groups at the Internal Revenue Service and the actions of officials after the attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

They said that some of the distractions in Washington have been out of Mr. Obama’s control: the 2010 oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico; Hurricane Sandy’s destruction late last year and the tornadoes in Oklahoma City in May; tensions in the Middle East and even the Trayvon Martin verdict."

Fitch Ratings has the U.S. on credit watch

The firm may downgrade the U.S. credit rating from AAA

S%26P downgraded its rating from AAA during the 2011 debt ceiling debate

LONDON (AP) — The United States could lose its top credit rating for the second time from a leading credit agency if there's a delay in raising the country's debt ceiling, Fitch Ratings warned Tuesday.

Congress has to increase the country's debt limit, which effectively rules how much debt the U.S. can have, by March 1 or face a potential default. There are fears that the debate will deteriorate into the squabbling and political brinkmanship that marked the last effort to raise the ceiling in the summer of 2011. The U.S. Treasury Department warned then that it had nearly reached a point where it would be unable ""to meet our commitments securely.""

If Fitch does move to downgrade the US, it will join Standard & Poor's, which was so concerned by the dysfunctional 2011 debate that it stripped the U.S. of its triple A rating for the first time in the country's history. Another major ratings agency, Moody's, also has a negative view on the U.S. outlook.

""The pressure on the U.S. rating, if anything, is increasing,"" David Riley, managing director of Fitch Ratings' global sovereigns division said at a London conference. ""We thought the 2011 crisis was a one-off event …. if we have a repeat we will place the U.S. rating under review.""

If that happens, Riley said there was ""a material risk"" of the rating coming down.

Fitch already has a negative outlook on the U.S. as the country's debt burden has risen to around 100% of its gross domestic product and has said it will make a decision on the rating this year, regardless of how the debt ceiling discussions pan out.

The U.S. government reached its statutory debt limit of nearly $16.4 trillion at the end of 2012 but has engineered extraordinary measures that should see it through February.

Riley's comments come just two weeks after U.S. lawmakers agreed a budget deal with the White House that avoided the so-called ""fiscal cliff"" of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that many economists thought could plunge the U.S. economy, the world's largest, back into recession.

Relief that a deal was cobbled together, albeit at the final hour, is one of the reasons why sentiment in the financial markets has been buoyant in the first trading days of the new year. Many stock indexes around the world are trading at multi-year highs.

""The 'fiscal cliff' bullet was dodged …. (but it's) a short-term patch,"" said Riley.

Riley warned that the different arms of the U.S. government still have a number of issues to address. As well as increasing the debt ceiling, they have to agree to spending cuts that were delayed as part of the 'fiscal cliff' agreement and back measures to avoid a government shutdown, potentially in March.

Though short-term fixes are more likely than not, Riley said the U.S. political environment is not as good as it should be for a country holding the gold-chip AAA rating. The past few years, Riley said, have been marked by ""self-inflicted crises"" between deadlines.

The major reason behind the lack of swift action in the U.S. is that the Democrats control the White House and the Senate, while the Republicans have a solid majority in the House of Representatives. Both sides have differing visions of the role of the state in society and often varying political objectives.

Despite his cautious tone on the rating, Riley said the U.S. has a number of huge advantages and that getting the country's public finances into shape will not require the same level of austerity that many countries in Europe have had to enact over the past few years, partly because the U.S. economy is growing at a steady rate.

Other factors Fitch says support the U.S.'s AAA rating are the country's economic dynamism, lower financial sector risks, the rule of law as well as the global benchmark status of the country's bonds and the dollar.

However it says these ""fundamental credit strengths are being eroded by the large, albeit steadily declining, structural budget deficit and high and rising public debt."""
http://www.nbcnews.com/business/supreme-court-declines-hear-sales-tax-case-2D11678823,2013-12-02 15:04:00+00:00,[],Supreme Court declines to hear sales tax case,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to tackle the long-standing question of whether Internet retailers like Amazon.com should be required to collect sales taxes in states where they have no physical presence.

In a case brought by Amazon and Overstock.com, the court was asked to decide whether a New York state law that requires online retailers to collect taxes is valid under the Constitution. Because the court declined to hear the case, the retailers' challenge to that law has failed.

With Congress not taking action on the issue, courts have been intervening case by case in a long-running struggle between state governments and major online retailers.

In a March ruling, the New York Court of Appeals said Amazon and Overstock could be compelled by the state to collect tax from online sales. Both companies sought the high court's review of the ruling, citing the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which limits the power of states to regulate interstate commerce.

Seattle-based Amazon has been fighting one-on-one battles with the 50 states for years over sales tax.

The government has no national sales tax and Congress has not moved ahead with proposed legislation that would give all states the power to enforce their sales tax laws on Internet retailers. For years, Congress has debated legislation to grant states the power to tax online purchases. In May, the Senate approved a bill, but it has stalled in the House of Representatives.

Amazon supports federal legislation for nationwide state sales tax enforcement, but other online retailers, including eBay and Overstock, have fought it.

Under a 1992 Supreme Court decision, retailers without a physical presence in a state do not need to collect and remit taxes in that state on each sale. Consumers are supposed to pay the tax on their own, but few do.

In states where Amazon has no physical presence, the company does not generally collect the tax, giving it a pricing edge over traditional brick-and-mortar merchants."

Boehner announced Thursday that House Republicans would agree to a six-week extension of the federal government’s ability to borrow to pay its bills, setting up late-night negotiations between the White House and Congress.

In announcing his plan, Boehner said Republicans no longer would insist on any policy changes in return for allowing the government to continue borrowing. But he did not agree to reopen government programs that shut down last week.

At a late-afternoon meeting at the White House, where Boehner and other House GOP leaders presented their proposal, the president told them that he wants the debt ceiling lifted and the government reopened, according to administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity. That put Obama in line with Senate Democrats, who have insisted that both issues be resolved together.

“The president didn’t say yes, didn’t say no,” said House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). “We’re continuing to negotiate.”

Another senior Republican, Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), said: “I think it’s clear that he would like to have the shutdown stopped.”

The issue for negotiators is to find something that Boehner could use to help sell Republicans on ending the shutdown but that Obama could also accept, Rogers suggested.

“We’re trying to find out what it is he would insist upon in a CR and what we would insist upon,” Rogers said, using the legislative jargon for a continuing resolution to fund government agencies. The president’s healthcare law, which Republicans spent weeks trying to block or delay as a condition of approving any money bills this fall, was “not discussed,” Rogers said.

Earlier in the afternoon, Senate Democrats emerged from a meeting with Obama insisting that the shutdown end.

“We want the government opened,” Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said.

Some of the Senate’s more centrist Republicans also expressed support for legislation that would end to the shutdown and extend the debt limit.

“We need to do both,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). “The country’s disgusted by this shutdown, and so am I. We need to reopen the government.”

“Both of them have to be resolved,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “It’s not rocket science.”

http://news.yahoo.com/spin-meter-dubious-list-budget-horribles-184834571--finance.html,,[],SPIN METER: A dubious list of budget 'horribles',"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama and his officials are doing their best to drum up public concern over the shock wave of spending cuts that could strike the government in just days. So it's a good time to be alert for sky-is-falling hype.

Administration officials are coming forward with a grim compendium of jobs to be lost, services to be denied or delayed, military defenses to be let down and important operations to be disrupted. Obama's new chief of staff, Denis McDonough, spoke of a ""devastating list of horribles.""

For most Americans, though, it's far from certain they will have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day if the budget-shredder known as the sequester comes to pass. Maybe they will, if the impasse drags on for months.

For now, there's a whiff of the familiar in all the foreboding, harking back to the mid-1990s partial government shutdown, when officials said old people would go hungry, illegal immigrants would have the run of the of the land and veterans would go without meds. It didn't happen.

For this episode, provisions are in place to preserve the most crucial services — and benefit checks. Furloughs of federal workers are at least a month away, breathing room for a political settlement if the will to achieve one is found. Many government contractors would continue to be paid with money previously approved.

But while the government prepares to make the best of a tough situation, it's putting the worst possible face on it all.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan says teacher layoffs have already begun, but he has not backed up that claim and school administrators say no pink slips are expected before May, for the next school year, if the budget crisis persists.

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the money crunch means the national parks system will be hit with a ""perfect storm.""

But perish the thought of yellow police tape around Yellowstone. It's far from settled that parks would close. Officials said to expect reduced operating hours, fewer rangers, bathrooms that might be locked and trash that might not be collected as often.

Story continues

To be sure, the cuts are big and will have consequences. Knowing what they will be, though, is far from a precise exercise.

And there is a lot of improbable precision in administration statements about what could happen: more than 373,000 seriously ill people losing mental health services, 600,000 low-income pregnant women and new mothers losing food aid and nutrition education, 1,200 fewer inspections of dangerous work sites, 125,000 poor households going without vouchers, and much more.

""These numbers are just numbers thrown out into the thin air with no anchor, and I think they don't provoke the outrage or concern that the Obama administration seeks,"" said Paul Light, a New York University professor who specializes in the federal bureaucracy and budget. For all the dire warnings, he said, ""It's not clear who gets hurt by this.""

The estimates in many cases come from a simple calculation: Divide the proscribed spending cut by a program's per-person spending to see how many beneficiaries may lose services or benefits under the sequester.

But in practice, through all the layers of bureaucracy and the everyday smoke and mirrors of the federal budget, there is rarely a direct and measurable correlation between a federal dollar and its effect on the ground.

That has meant a lot of tenuous ""could happen"" warnings by the administration, not so much ""will happen"" evidence.

So it was in Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' letter to Congress laying out likely consequences of the spending cuts for her agency's operations. She said the sequester ""could"" compromise the well-being of more than 373,000 people who ""potentially"" would not get needed mental health services, which in turn ""could result"" in more hospitalizations and homelessness.

Duncan left himself less wiggle room. ""This stuff is real,"" he said last week. ""Schools are already starting to give teachers notices.""

Asked to provide backup for Duncan's assertion, spokesman Daren Briscoe said it was based on ""an unspecified call he was on with unnamed persons,"" and the secretary might not be comfortable sharing details.

Briscoe referred queries about layoffs to the American Association of School Administrators. Noelle M. Ellerson, an assistant director of the organization, said Monday that in her many discussions with superintendents at the group's just-completed annual meeting, she heard of no layoffs of teachers. While everyone is bracing for that possibility down the road, she said, ""not a single one I spoke with had already issued pink slips.""

Most school district budgets for the next school year won't be completed for two months, she said, meaning any layoff notices would come in early to mid-May. ""No one had yet acted.""

As for the assertion that 600,000 women could be dropped from the Women, Infants and Children Program, that's not to say the rolls would be cut by that number. The actual number is likely to include women who are not enrolled in the program now and could be denied when seeking to join it. Federal officials say the true number will depend on how states can manage their caseloads.

Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has warned of impending furloughs of air traffic controllers, who may need to take one day off every two weeks, and said air-travel delays are likely across the country. Asked Friday why the airline lobby predicted no major impact on air travel from the sequester, he said, ""I don't think they have the information we're presenting to them today.""

""The idea that we're just doing this to create some kind of a horrific scare tactic is nonsense,"" LaHood said. But it's a pressure tactic nonetheless: ""What I'm trying to do is to wake up members of the Congress on the Republican side to the idea that they need to come to the table.""

However the cuts fall, Light at NYU says the Washington Monument ploy, also known as the Firemen First principle, is at work.

It goes like this: Put someone's budget at risk and the first thing you'll hear is a threat to close a cherished national symbol or lay off firefighters and police, when in fact there are other ways to cut spending.

It so happens the Washington Monument is already closed, for earthquake repair. But Obama indulged in the Firemen First principle quite literally.

He appeared at the White House in front of officers in blue uniforms to warn of the consequences of the sequester. ""Emergency responders like the ones who are here today — their ability to help communities respond to and recover from disasters will be degraded.""

FBI and Border Patrol furloughs are expected. Still, the White House has directed agencies to avoid cuts presenting ""risks to life, safety or health"" and to minimize harm to crucial services.

The law gives little flexibility to agencies to protect favored programs, except for big ones specifically exempted from the automatic cuts, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans benefits. There's only so much latitude to move money among accounts.

But not everything is cast in stone. The Small Business Administration, for example, should be able to avoid furloughs because of early retirements already achieved, said Karen Mills, the administrator. And she said declining demand for one type of loan should free up money for other lending, so ""we are not slowing down giving loans to anyone.""

In the partial government shutdown during his presidency, Bill Clinton and his officials told some tall tales and sketched dark scenarios that didn't come to pass, though some might have if the crisis had lasted weeks or months longer. The shutdown played out over two installments totaling 26 days from mid-November 1995 to early January 1996.

National park properties closed (yes, even the Washington Monument), passport and federal mortgage insurance processing were disrupted and toxic waste cleanup stalled as hundreds of thousands of federal workers went idle, paid retroactively later. But states, communities and private groups stepped up to tide over the neediest, keeping Meals on Wheels rolling with their own resources, for example, until Clinton found emergency money to cover the costs. Warnings that Medicare treatment would be withheld proved unfounded, and veterans got their care.

Contractors, who perform many key services for government, kept working for IOUs. A claim by the government that deportations ""have virtually ended"" was not so.

The Justice Department told the story of a Florida gas station rejecting the government-issued credit card of a drug-enforcement agent to illustrate the indignity of it all.

But the reality was humdrum: The card had merely expired.

The rout was complete, the retreat disorderly. President Obama got his tax hikes -- naked of spending cuts -- passed by the ostensibly Republican House of Representatives. After which, you might expect him to pivot to his self-proclaimed ""principle"" of fiscal ""balance"" by taking the lead on reducing spending. ""Why,"" asked The Washington Post on the eve of the final ""fiscal-cliff"" agreement, ""is the nation's leader not embracing and then explaining the balanced reforms the nation needs?""

Because he has no interest in them. He's a visionary, not an accountant. Sure, he'll pretend to care about deficits, especially while running for re-election. But now that he's past the post, he's free to be himself -- a committed big-government social-democrat.

As he showed in his two speeches this week. After perfunctory nods to debt and spending reduction, he waxed enthusiastic about continued ""investments"" -- i.e. spending -- on education, research, roads and bridges, green energy, etc.

[pullquote]

Having promised more government, he then promised more taxes -- on ""millionaires"" and ""companies with a lot of lobbyists,"" of course. It was a bold affirmation of pre-Clintonian tax-and-spend liberalism.

Why not? He had just won Round 1: raising rates. Round 2 is to raise yet more tax revenues by eliminating deductions. After all, didn't John Boehner offer him $800 billion of such loophole-closing revenues just a few weeks ago?

To paraphrase Churchill on the British Empire, Barack Obama did not become president of the United States to preside over the liquidation of the welfare state. On the contrary, he is dedicated to its expansion. He's already created the largest new entitlement in half a century (ObamaCare).

And he has increased federal spending to an astronomical 24.4 percent of GDP (the postwar norm is about 20 percent), a level not seen since World War II.

But this level of spending requires a significantly higher level of taxation. Hence his hardball fiscal-cliff strategy of issuing an ultimatum to Republicans to raise tax rates -- or be blamed for a massive across-the-board tax increase and a subsequent recession.

I'll get you the money by eliminating deductions, offered Boehner. No, sir, replied the president. Rates it must be.

Why the insistence?

(1) Partisan Advantage

As I wrote last month, the ultimatum was designed to exploit and exacerbate internal Republican divisions. It worked perfectly. Boehner's attempted finesse (Plan B), which would have raised rates but only for those making more than $1 million, collapsed amid an open rebellion from a good quarter of the Republican caucus.

At which point, power passed from the House to the Senate, where a deal was brokered. By the time the Senate bill reached the House, there was no time or room for maneuver. Checkmate. Obama neutralized the one body that had stymied him during the last two years.

(2) Ideological Breakthrough

Obama's ultimate ambition is to break the nation's 30-year thrall of low taxes -- so powerful that those who defied the Reaganite norm paid heavily for it. Walter Mondale's acceptance speech at the 1984 convention promising to raise taxes ended his campaign before it began. President George H.W. Bush's no-new-taxes reversal cost him a second term.

On this, too, Obama is succeeding. He not only got his tax increase passed. He did it with public opinion behind him.

Why are higher taxes so important to him?

First, as a means: A high-tax economy is liberalism's only hope for sustaining and enlarging the entitlement state. It provides the funds for enlightened adventures in everything from algae to Obamacare.

Second, as an end in itself. Fundamentally, Obama is a leveler. The community organizer seeks, above all, to reverse the growing inequality that he dates and attributes to ruthless Reaganism. Now, however, clothed in the immense powers of the presidency, he can actually engage in unadorned redistributionism. As in Tuesday night's $620 billion wealth transfer.

Upon losing the House in 2010, the leveler took cover for the next two years. He wasn't going to advance his real agenda through the Republican House anyway, and he needed to win re-election.

Now he's won. The old Obama is back. He must not be underestimated. He has deftly leveraged his class-war-themed election victory (a) to secure a source of funding (albeit still small) for the bloated welfare state, (b) to carry out an admirably candid bit of income redistribution and (c) to fracture the one remaining institutional obstacle to the rest of his ideological agenda.

Not bad for two months' work."

Helderman', 'Reporter Focusing On Political Enterprise Stories']",Inside the immigration bill: E-Verify expansion draws fire,"The new system will rely more heavily on ""photo-matching."" The E-Verify system will contain a vast database of photographs, and workers applying for jobs would need to present identification with photographs that match those in the database to prove they are who they say they are and that they are in the country legally.

For non-citizens, that would mean showing a work authorization or green card with a photo. Citizens could show passports or driver's licenses, where states have agreed to provide license information to the E-Verify system. To encourage states to turn over the information, he bill includes $250 million in new funding to reimburse states that choose to take part.

Photo-matching is less expensive for employers — and potentially less invasive-feeling for workers — than finger-printing, which had been considered by senators during their extensive negotiations.

Still, the process already has its critics, which say it amounts to the creation of a new national ID.

""If you take a step back and think about what that means, when this reaches fruition and is completed, you'll have an Internet-accessible system that has everyone’s photo and identifying information in it,"" said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel with the ACLU. ""You can easily imagine E-Verify becoming the national ID system.""

That the system will now be required for employers, even small businesses that might have trouble shouldering the cost, is also a concern, he said. ""That's a fundamental shift,"" he said from the current system, which is largely voluntary.

Jim Harper, director of information studies at the Cato Institute, said photographs are the weakest form of biometric identification. He predicted that a system that is launched using photos would later be expanded to include other identifiers people might see as more problematic including iris scans and fingerprints. But he said the ""knitting together"" of available sources of photographs into a single database is itself a concern.

""I’m standing down on the horizon, waving my arms saying , 'Hey, hey this is a national ID system!"" he said. ""It's big government at it's worst.""

Still, many immigration advocates have shelved their long-time opposition to E-Verify, believing it one piece of a necessary compromise that will also allow a path to citizenship for those now in the country illegally. The system, they believe, is necessary to convince wary conservatives that the nation will not face a new flood of illegal immigrants once a path to citizenship is provided for many who are already here.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, said a new system to reduce incentives for employers to hire illegal immigrants — and make it harder for them to do so — is a key piece of any broad-based overhaul of the system.

""It's the essential trade-off: legalization and a path to citizenship, for employer verification,"" he said. ""That is really the heart of every comprehensive immigration reform package ever put together."""

Pollak'],Sperling's Disingenuous Defense of Sequester,"White House economic adviser Gene Sperling, who controversially told journalist Bob Woodward he would “regret” accusing the Obama administration of shifting the goalposts to include tax hikes in debate over the sequester, offered a misleading defense of the sequester on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley on Sunday.

Sperling told Crowley that the original intent of the sequester was “to force both sides to come back to the type of grand bargain that Bowles-Simpson have called for, that most budget experts call for…”.

But President Barack Obama rejected the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission, even though he had established it to propose solutions to the country’s long-term budget crisis.

As Woodward recalled in The Price of Politics, and as is easily confirmed by a variety of other sources, including former Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner, Obama rejected the Bowles-Simpson formula because he was not willing to accept reforms to the country’s entitlements, including Social Security.

Obama and the Democrats wanted larger tax hikes and fewer cuts to spending and entitlements. Many Republicans, too, rejected the plan, largely because it left the massive new entitlement of Obamacare in place.

Moreover, as Woodward pointed out elsewhere in the book (and as Breitbart News highlighted long before Woodward’s claims about the sequester made him a White House target), it was Obama himself who scuttled a “grand bargain” by demanding additional revenues through tax hikes when a deal had been within reach.

Sperling’s revisionist history invites the question: if the sequester had been meant to encourage a grand bargain like Bowles-Simpson, why hasn’t Obama simply embraced Bowles-Simpson?

The obvious answer is that Obama had no intention of reaching a deal, and hoped to use the sequester as he used the “fiscal cliff”–to squeeze more concessions out of Republicans on tax rates, and to blame the opposition for whatever horrible economic outcomes the administration could conjure."

The hour-long affair was more like a conversation between the like-minded on issues such as the ongoing budget battles and going around Congress by raising the debt ceiling by executive fiat. Anyone who remembers the non-stop confrontation directed at President Bush just a few years ago, by this same group of reporters, would not recognize them today.

Not a single reporter confronted Obama over the violent rhetoric he and his administration have been using to describe Republicans, or even the fact that as a Senator, Obama voted against raising the debt ceiling — a position he is now describing as dangerous, irresponsible and akin to hostage-taking.

In fact, in this briefing, Obama used the words “hostage, insane, ransom, nuclear bomb, chaos, disaster.”

Mark Knoller of CBS News is the only reporter that asked the president about the individual compromise spending bills the GOP have passed to fund the parks, veterans, and National Institutes of Health, among other items. Obama swatted away the question with talking points without being challenged on the fact that this veto threat means children suffering from cancer will not get treatment from the NIH.

No reporter even asked about the ObamaCare launch debacle.

Here are some of the questions that were asked:

—

Julie Pace of AP Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Obviously if Congress does pass a clean CR and a clean debt ceiling bill, those may just be short-term measures. If that happens, does your offer to negotiate with them on issues like health care and spending and deficit reduction still stand in the intervening weeks if they pass measures that are just perhaps six weeks or two months long? — Julianna Goldman. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You laid out the economic consequences of default, but if we were to get to that point, would you prioritize and pay bondholders first to maintain the semblance of credit or — rather than Social Security recipients or military servicemen and women? And how would you go ahead and make that determination? — Sam Stein, Huffington Post. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. With Speaker Boehner so far unwilling to hold a vote on a clean CR, what assurances can you give to those affected by a shutdown who are concerned about an even longer impasse? And how worried are you personally that your preferred solution to this clean CR and sequestration levels may do harm to the nation’s economy and your second-term agenda? — Roberta Rampton. Q: Thanks. You talked a bit about the hit to credibility around the world that this impasse has caused. I’m wondering what you and your administration are telling worried foreign creditors, China and Japan, who are calling and then asking about whether the United States is going to avoid defaulting on its debts? — Ari Shapiro. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the Supreme Court, and the term started today with a campaign finance case that sort of picks up where Citizens United left off. You called Citizens United devastating to the public interest, so I wonder if you could weigh in on this latest case.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointed the finger at China Saturday when addressing cybersecurity threats, the latest in a series of rhetorical skirmishes between the United States and China on the issue.

Speaking to an audience of defense professionals at a regional security summit in Singapore, Hagel said the United States was concerned about “the growing threat of cyber intrusions, some of which appear to be tied to the Chinese government and military.”

Even as he singled out China, Hagel added that United States was “determined to work more vigorously with China” in order to address the problem.

Acknowledging the risk of “miscalculations and mistakes as to who was behind the attack,” Hagel insisted that the most effective way to combat the cyber threat is through mutual cooperation between countries and governments.

“Cyber threats are not just a threat to the United States or a threat to any one country. They are threats to China,” Hagel said.

Hagel also noted that the United States has increased investments in cybersecurity to counter the increasing threats.

The Pentagon previously blamed China in its annual report to U.S. lawmakers on Chinese military capabilities.

The report, published in May, stated that some of the recent cyberattacks in the United States appeared “to be attributable directly to Chinese government and military.”"

Liberals doubted Summers over Harvard remarks%2C role in financial deregulation

Business economists preferred Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen%2C a known quantity%2C for the top job

Even Summers recognized a nomination would mean a confirmation fight

For Larry Summers, two camps of rivals apparently proved to be one too many.

Everyone knew liberals didn't want the former Treasury secretary to be President Obama's pick to chair the Federal Reserve. They were sore about his remark as Harvard's president that women were less likely to excel at science. And they were suspicious of his role in Clinton-era financial deregulation -- especially the decision barely to regulate financial derivatives at all. That loosed a monster called the credit-default swap that forced the $85 billion bailout of AIG five years ago this weekend, and nearly brought down all of Wall Street with it.

The surprise was the level of skepticism about Summers from his own crowd -- Wall Street types and business economists.

In a USA TODAY survey, 56% of the 42 economists said they preferred Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen for the top job. Conservatives who favor a good sound business administration wanted the quiet, liberal academic Yellen because she's closely identified with easy-money policies that have served Wall Street well.

Either camp of opponents may not have been able to kill Summers' candidacy. The combination of the two made it untenable, as Summers withdrew his name Sunday.

In his letter to the president, Summers wrote of wanting to avoid a contentious confirmation fight. Such a fight became all the more certain when three Senate Democrats (Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Ohio's Sherrod Brown and Montana's Jon Tester) signaled they would vote against him.

Generally, it has been thought Summers favored less monetary accommodation than Yellen has — which cost him support that might have offset liberal opposition. With Wall Street still nervous about the upcoming process of weaning the economy off reliance on the Fed's easy-money policies, they liked Yellen because they knew Yellen.

Yellen is ""extremely well-qualified and she's been there through the (financial) crisis,"" Mesirow Financial chief economist Diane Swonk said in July. `""We need continuity.""

Bottom line: When the financial market players line up behind the Berkeley professor -- and the professor would be the first woman Fed chair to boot -- there was no constituency left for a Summers pick. He always appeared to be the President's idea, preferred by too few others."

Tea Party-aligned groups challenge the farm bill as lawmakers work to hammer out a compromise

Fight highlights feud in Republican Party between business interests and activist wing

Some conservatives want deeper cuts to food stamps

WASHINGTON — In the aftermath of the partial government shutdown, some Tea Party-aligned groups that helped push a conservative revolt in Congress over President Obama's health care law are readying for Round 2.

Their top target: the sweeping legislation that will set federal farm policy for years to come. Next week, a group of lawmakers will meet to begin hashing out differences between the Senate and House versions of the farm bill. Conservative groups, such as Heritage Action for America, are lobbying to jettison any compromise, saying neither version does enough to slash taxpayer subsidies to agribusiness.

""You are using taxpayer money to subsidize industries that are making record profits,"" said Dan Holler of Heritage Action. His group is urging lawmakers to approve a one-year extension of existing farm policies rather ""than locking in bad law for another three to five years,"" he said.

The latest confrontation over the farm measure underscores the rift between the pro-small-government Tea Party faction of the Republican Party and the business community. Grassroots Tea Party activists, whose opposition to the health care law helped fuel the budget fight that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown this month, say they won't back down from efforts to reduce government spending and will make their displeasure known in next year's midterm elections.

""We think gridlock is a good thing,"" said Diane Cox, a Tea Party activist from Valdosta, Ga., who is one of 6,000 Heritage Action ""sentinels"" who pushed to defund the Affordable Care Act and is closely watching developments on the farm bill. ""It's called the balance of powers.""

""I don't think politicians understand that we are serious about stopping wasteful government spending,"" said Cox, 68. ""We are going to have to bring a few more of them home.""

Already this year, skirmishes over spending have delayed efforts to complete a new, five-year farm law, now more than a year overdue. In the past, farm bills enjoyed bipartisan support, in part because the measures paired pro-farm policies with continued support for food stamps, guaranteeing ""yes"" votes from lawmakers representing both rural and urban areas.

After rejecting an earlier version of the farm bill in June, the GOP-led House broke the legislation into two pieces, first approving a chunk that dealt with farm subsidies along with other agriculture policies and then passing the food-stamp portion. The House-passed bill cuts food stamps by roughly $40 billion during the next decade, dropping benefits to 3 million people.

The Senate measure cuts far less from food stamps — about $4 billion over 10 years.

Both versions eliminate $5 billion in subsidies known as ""direct payments"" to farmers, long criticized because they pay certain types of farmers the same amount each year regardless of need or whether they plant crops.

Conservative advocacy groups want more. They are challenging an array of provisions, including taxpayer-funded subsidies for crop insurance.

""If you are a Republican and you say social welfare programs are wasteful, you are hypocritical if you turn around and give subsidies to corporations,"" said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a group backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.

The group was not among those that urged lawmakers to defund Obamacare during the recent budget showdown, but it has made repealing the health care law among its top priorities. The group also wants deeper cuts to the food stamp program, which has grown dramatically. More than 47 million people now receive food stamps, up from 21 million a decade earlier.

Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau, said the House and Senate measures contain ""significant reform.""

""The elimination of direct payments is a big deal,"" she said. ""It might not be enough reform for Heritage, but it's real reform.""

She said the measure has drawn conservative attention, in part, because so few bills have any chance of winning approval in a gridlocked Congress. ""You have more Tea Party members in the House,"" she said. ""There are more reformers, and they want to reform whatever comes along.""

What happens next will be a test of the clout of the Tea Party, derided by the party establishment for helping to engineer a budget showdown that shuttered parts of the government and threatened a debt default without winning any significant concessions on the health care law.

So far, top Republicans and Democrats on the agriculture panel appear eager to move forward on a compromise. Last week, President Obama said the farm bill was one of three priorities for Congress to resolve before year's end. The others are a budget agreement and an overhaul of the nation's immigration system.

Even as they sound alarms on the farm measure, conservative advocacy groups say they do not plan to retreat from efforts to dismantle the health care law. FreedomWorks, another Tea Party-aligned group, wants to force lawmakers to vote on a measure that would eliminate the employer contribution on health care for members of Congress and is urging more votes on measures that would delay the health law's mandate that uninsured Americans buy health insurance starting next year or pay a fine.

On Wednesday, meanwhile, Americans for Prosperity launched a $2 million advertising campaign highlighting four vulnerable House members over their votes on the health care law. It also is working to keep states from expanding Medicare, the government's health-insurance system for the poor.

""Repealing Obamacare is a long-term effort,"" Phillips said."
http://news.yahoo.com/furloughed-workers-pinching-pennies-volunteering-102807293.html,,[],"Furloughed workers pinching pennies, volunteering","They're experienced research engineers and park rangers still in college, attorneys who enforce environmental regulations and former soldiers who took civilian jobs with the military after coming home from war.

And all of them have one thing in common: They were sent home on unpaid furlough last week after a political standoff between the president and Congress forced a partial shutdown of the federal government. More than 800,000 federal workers were affected at first, though the Pentagon has since recalled most of its idled 350,000 employees.

What these sidelined government employees are doing with their spare time varies as widely as the jobs they perform. Some are tightening their budgets at home, watching what they spend on food and other necessities, fearing it could be weeks before they earn another paycheck. Others are having a tough time keeping their workplace projects shelved and agency emails unread.

While Congress and the White House work on a deal to ensure furloughed workers receive back pay once the shutdown ends, some expenses can't be put off, whether it's replacing a broken furnace for $6,500 or buying diapers for a baby due before the month ends.

Here are the stories of just a few of the government workers directly affected by the shutdown.

___

As the government shutdown began its second week, Donna Cebrat was focused on stretching each dollar of her savings under the assumption she might not be able to return to work for a month or longer.

""Instead of having a dinner, I'll have a bowl of cereal. Maybe for dinner and lunch. Or maybe I'll go down to McDonald's for a hamburger off the dollar menu,"" said Cebrat, 46, who works for the FBI at its office in Savannah, Ga. ""Lots of budget cuts. Not that I was living extravagantly before.""

Cebrat makes her living processing requests for public access to FBI records made under the Freedom of Information Act. She lives alone in a middle-class suburb and estimates the money in her savings account could last her anywhere from two to six months.

Story continues

She checks headlines for any news on negotiations between the president and Congress, but said she avoids reading full stories or watching shutdown reports on TV that would only bring her down further.

""I don't need to see the name-calling,"" Cebrat said. ""I just need to see the headline.""

Otherwise Cebrat has spent her days sanding and repainting her bathroom walls — a new tub, toilet and vanity will have to wait until next year — and taking walks in her neighborhood. She's avoided trips to the mall or the movies.

Catherine Threat sat at the bar, typing a note to her friends on Facebook.

""How do I serve my country from this barstool in the only restaurant in this tiny town outside a training base that is mostly shut down?"" she wrote.

The 40-year-old staff sergeant in the Army Reserve returned from Afghanistan in July, taking a civilian job at Fort McCoy in central Wisconsin.

Then, last week, she and most of her colleagues were furloughed — a maddening existence for a woman who isn't used to sitting still for very long.

So she headed to Chicago to help fellow veterans patrol the streets to help keep school children safe. It wasn't much different from the foot patrols she did during her three years in Afghanistan.

Foot patrols there created a presence, built bonds and deterred violence.

""That's what we're doing here, too,"" she said as she stood with other veterans outside an elementary school in a neighborhood that has had gang violence and other crime.

The assignment was short-lived. Threat was called back to Fort McCoy, along with hundreds of other civilian employees.

She didn't see the recall as a victory ""because there are still a lot of people out of work"" because of the shutdown.

But either way, she was grateful for the chance to serve in Chicago.

""Sometimes, I think this has almost been better for me. I've gotten more out of it than I'm contributing,"" she said, quietly monitoring children walking by her.

""But hopefully, I contributed something.""

Jonathan Corso sat at his dining room table, the signs of a terrible week all around him.

At his feet, his family's beloved dog, Dixie. The sad-eyed, 14-year-old spaniel/mutt has terminal cancer and the day before had been given only about a month to live. Under his feet, the banging of workmen installing a new $6,500 furnace at his Decatur, Ga., bungalow after the old one broke.

And there was Corso, home at 9:30 on a Friday morning. He would normally be at work at the Atlanta regional office of the Economic Development Administration, a small federal agency that provides help and construction grants to industrial parks, colleges and local governments.

Corso, 44, and his wife, Liza, who works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were both furloughed.

In recent years, their federal jobs seemed stable while people working in state and local government and many private companies saw wage freezes or layoffs.

But now this.

The couple has savings, and they and their 7-year-old son should be fine financially for a while.

There have been a few silver linings: The couple went to lunch together on a weekday. Corso, a marathoner, began his daily 10-mile run at 6 a.m. rather than his more onerous 4:45 a.m. usual start time. That allowed him to stay up one night to watch a baseball game.

""We're trying to make the best of it right now,"" Corso said.

___

Rob Howard has been working through the shutdown, but not at his day job as an information technology specialist for the federal Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, which oversees people on probation and supervised release.

Instead, he's volunteering for So Others Might Eat, a Washington organization that serves meals to the poor and homeless. On Oct. 4, he was a coffee server. Two days later, he washed dishes after lunch.

""I just want to keep busy during this time,"" said Howard, 45, who lives in Upper Marlboro, Md.

He has also gotten work done around his house, finally finding time to redo the floor in an upstairs bathroom. He took out the old linoleum and put down some black and white tile, which he said sat in his garage ""forever.""

Howard also spent time cleaning.

""I could probably have a party at my house right now because it's spotless,"" he said.

One day he made two trips to the gym.

""I can't stay idle too long or I'll lose my mind,"" he said.

___

Darquez Smith found himself furloughed from his job with the National Park Service just as his fiancee is due to give birth to their daughter later this month.

Smith, 23, of Xenia, Ohio, is spending his time off looking for a new job. Working as a park ranger at the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, which tells the story of the Wright brothers, is his only source of income.

""Mentally, it's definitely no fun at all,"" said Smith, who has an interview lined up with a company next week. ""It's never fun to be out of work and not have the ability to go to work, and still have bills to pay.""

Smith said he's looking for work in information technology and is pursuing an IT degree at Central State University.

By the time rent is due Nov. 1, Smith said he'll need to be back at his Park Service job or have found other work. Utility bills and car insurance will soon follow, along with the added costs of raising a newborn.

""For me as a student, a full-time worker paying all the bills myself, with a lot of responsibilities, there's never really a day off or a fun day,"" he said.

During the government shutdown in 1995 and 1996, Dan Madrzykowski would occasionally sneak onto the Gaithersburg campus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and check on some lab work or crunch some numbers.

""NIST is not really a bureaucracy; it's more a series of labs. People are driven differently,"" said Madrzykowski, a fire protection engineer from Damascus, Md., who's worked for the agency for 28 years.

This time, security is tighter after 9/11, and rules forbidding furloughed employees from working are strictly enforced.

So Madrzykowski, whose work has helped develop better tactics and equipment for firefighters, is devoting time to projects for a professional group, the Society of Fire Protection Engineers. And he's had to break his habit of answering email on his government-issued Blackberry from firefighters around the country.

Last week, Madrzykowski and colleagues had planned to begin work on developing standards for radio communications equipment to function in the extreme temperatures that firefighters face. The research is used by industry groups to set standards for equipment manufacturers.

That work will wait.

Madrzykowski said his biggest worry is that NIST won't be able to recruit and retain young researchers because government work no longer has the stability that once made it attractive.

""I'm old. My wife works. We've got a little bit of a cushion,"" he said. ""But for young people in a metro area, they're barely making it. We've lost several young people to private industry.""

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/opinion/abandoned-in-indian-country.html,2013-07-24 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],Abandoned in Indian Country - The New York Times,"It’s an old American story: malign policies hatched in Washington leading to pain and death in Indian country. It was true in the 19th century. It is true now, at a time when Congress, heedless of its solemn treaty obligations to Indian tribes, is allowing the across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester to threaten the health, safety and education of Indians across the nation.

Many Republicans have lately taken to dismissing the sequester as a mild headache for a country that needs to tighten its belt. They are willfully averting their eyes from Indian reservations, where the cuts are real, specific, broad and brutal. The victims are among the poorest, sickest and most isolated Americans.

The sequester in a nutshell? “More people sick; fewer people educated; fewer people getting general assistance; more domestic violence; more alcoholism,” Richard Zephier, executive director of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, recently told Annie Lowrey of The Times.

The damage is being done to agencies and programs whose budgets rely nearly entirely on federal sources, now being slashed. In signing treaties with Indian nations in return for land, the federal government promised a wide array of life-sustaining services. One of the most important is the Indian Health Service, which serves about two million people on reservations and is grossly underfinanced even in good times. It routinely runs out of money halfway through the year. Though Medicare, Medicaid and veterans’ health were exempted from sequestration cuts, the Indian Health Service was not. It stands to lose about $228 million in 2013 from automatic sequester cuts alone, out of a $4 billion budget. That will mean 3,000 fewer inpatient admissions and 800,000 fewer outpatient visits every year."

Obama said the Republican leadership should put the bill up for a vote. The problem is, the House doesn’t have the bill. The Senate still has not delivered its bill to the House for consideration.

In the days after the Senate passed its bill, House Ways and Means Chairman David Camp pointed out that the bill is unconstitutional, in its construction. The Senate bill raises revenue by creating new taxes and fees. According to the Constitution, however, legislation that raises revenue can only be introduced first in the House.

This creates a real dilemma for Senate backers of the bill. As my colleague Matt Boyle explained at the time:

When such a revenue-raising bill comes out of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, currently Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), can use a procedure called a “blue slip resolution” to automatically kill it on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. Stockman has been promising to attempt to kill the Senate’s bill that way and, as such, Reid has refused to send it to the House, thereby protecting the bill from being “blue slipped.” The term “blue slip,” Stockman’s office noted in a release, comes from the blue color of the paper on which a resolution is printed that returns a Senate bill back to the Senate in these situations.

This is why supporters of the Senate bill are so eager to conference with the House. They need even a simple piece of legislation on immigration to get around the constitutional problem. Conferees could strip out all the language of the House bill and substitute the Senate provisions, and the resulting bill would be constitutional.

GOP Leadership isn’t blocking the House from voting on the Senate bill. The drafters of the original Senate bill are the ones blocking the House."

Washington (CNN) - House Republicans are slamming the White House for not negotiating with them. House Speaker John Boehner told GOP rank-and-file that President Barack Obama was rejecting the House GOP offer and instead working with Senators from both parties to end the shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.

""I'm disappointed that the President has rejected the offer that we put on the table,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. ""I know that he's trying to see which Republican Senator he can pick off in the Senate. I hope that the Senate Republicans stand strong so we can speak with one voice.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='deirdrewalshcnn']

""All eyes are on the Senate,"" said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois. ""It doesn't seem like the White House is serious at all about entering negotiations with us until they see what comes out of the Senate. If they get something out of the Senate that's weaker than our negotiated position, it obviously strengthens their position.""

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, was more blunt.

""The President rejected our deal,"" he said. ""It's up to Senate Republicans to stand up to the President.""

Those Senate Republicans are in the midst of talks with their colleagues across the aisle. A bipartisan group of about 10 Senators, led by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, met Friday afternoon to try to find a way forward in the Senate, according to sources familiar with the meeting.

Collins' plan for a longer extension of the debt limit and government funding has gained some traction. Her proposal would repeal the 2.3% tax on medical devices, which is used to help pay for Obamacare, and give federal agencies greater flexibility to deal with the forced spending cuts known as sequestration.

With the White House's rejection of House Republicans' offer, members will head home to their district for the weekend, many of them angry at what they see as an intransigent administration.

Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, said the President has negotiated in bad faith and that he never intended to reach a deal, only bait and switch.

The Republican caucus has never been more unified than they now are against a ""very bad"" deal between Senate Republicans and the President, he said.

GOP leadership will remain in Washington to continue negotiations, advising their members they could possibly call them back for a vote. As of now, though, no votes are planned, and members will return Monday afternoon.

The tax cuts described in Ryan's budget would generate a huge windfall for high-income taxpayers. On average, households would get a cut of $3,000. But those in the top 0.1 percent of income, who make $3.3 million or more, would get a whopping $1.2 million on average-a 20 percent increase in their after-tax income.

To put it another way, each of the Ryan budget budgets backed by House and Senate Republicans over the last three years inevitably will produce both oceans of red ink and a Treasury-draining payday for the rich. Unless, that is, Republicans can identify which tax breaks and loopholes they would limit or end to prevent those two certainties from coming to pass.

And from the beginning, that's precisely what they've been too cowardly to do.

As the Washington Post showed (chart above), the trillion-plus dollars in annual tax expenditures is now larger than Uncle Sam's take from the income tax each year. Much of the estimated $1.3 trillion in annual tax expenditures in 2015 (a figure almost double the size of the last fiscal year's budget deficit) benefits working and middle income Americans. For example, the home mortgage interest deduction was worth $89 billion in 2011. Tax-deferred 401K accounts cost the Treasury $63 billion that same year. The Earned Income Tax Credit had a similar price tag. It's no wonder, as the Post concluded, ""ever-increasing tax breaks for U.S. families eclipse benefits for special interests.""

So which ones would John Boehner, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and company curb or close? We're still waiting for an answer.

Matthew Yglesias mocked the dodge at the center of Ryan's 2012 budget, the same one he used before and since:



Thirteen pages dedicated to explaining his vision for revenue-neutral tax reform. And even so he manages to not name a single tax deduction that he's planning to eliminate. Home mortgage interest deduction? I dunno. Electric vehicle tax credit? I dunno. Deductibility of state and local income taxes? I dunno.

We're talking about a lot of loophole-closing. As Howard Gleckman of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center points out, to make his numbers work Mr. Ryan would, by 2022, have to close enough loopholes to yield an extra $700 billion in revenue every year. That's a lot of money, even in an economy as big as ours. So which specific loopholes has Mr. Ryan, who issued a 98-page manifesto on behalf of his budget, said he would close? None. Not one. He has, however, categorically ruled out any move to close the major loophole that benefits the rich, namely the ultra-low tax rates on income from capital. (That's the loophole that lets Mitt Romney pay only 14 percent of his income in taxes, a lower tax rate than that faced by many middle-class families.)

That same month, Paul Krugman tried to decipher which deductions and tax breaks are actually in the mystery meat that is Paul Ryan's budgetary dog food. As he explained in "" Pink Slime Economics "":

Appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe on March 20, 2012, Congressman Ryan declared he would ""get rid of the special interest loopholes, special deductions, lower everybody's tax rates, bring in at least as much revenue to the government but grow the economy and create jobs, and get spending under control so we can pay off this debt."" But when host Joe Scarborough asked, ""Which one of those [loopholes] do you eliminate,"" Ryan decided to duck and cover:



""We want to do this in the light of day and in front of everybody. So the Ways and Means Committee, which is in charge of the tax system, sent us the plan here, which is a 10 and 25 percent bracket for individuals and small businesses, and then they want to have hearings and, in light of day, show how they would go about doing this.""

""That's what the Ways & Means Committee is supposed to do. That's not the job of the Budget Committee,"" Ryan said on Fox News Sunday. ""What we're saying is, we want to do this in the light of day, not in some backroom deal. We want to have hearings in the Ways & Means Committee that Chairman Dave Camp has already started that work, to say what tax benefits should go.""

Both chairmen refused to say what they supported or what tax loopholes they'd propose closing. Camp focused instead on areas of agreement. ""There are so many good (tax) simplification policies that we agree on,"" he said. Asked whether they'll propose limiting the mortgage-interest deduction that homeowners now enjoy, Camp acknowledged that two-thirds of Americans don't itemize their federal taxes and said that perhaps a complete rethink was in order.

Appearing on CBS' Face the Nation just days later, Ryan again claimed that ""We're proposing to keep revenues where they are, but to clear up all the special interest loopholes, which are uniquely enjoyed by higher income earners, in exchange for lower rates for everyone."" But he once again pleaded the Fifth when asked which ""special interest loopholes"" he would do away with:Almost two years later, Camp won't publicly say what tax benefits would go, either. As McClatchy reported in June on the progress he and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) had made:A complete rethink, indeed. During the 2012 campaign, Paul Ryan's running mate Mitt Romney similarly called for closing tax loopholes to offset his huge tax cuts for the wealthy. For months, Mitt Romney had performing the same trick as Ryan, promising only that the ""1 percent keeps paying the current share they're paying or more."" His economic adviser Glenn Hubbard even confirmed Romney's cowardice, explaining ""it is not his intention to take on any specific deduction or exclusion and eliminate it.""

Unfortunately for the Republican ticket, nonpartisan analysts trying to model Romney's proposals did. And the picture they painted wasn't a pretty one. Even after assuming the closure of tax loopholes and deductions which disproportionately favor the rich, the Tax Policy Center forecast that President Romney would end up cutting taxes for the richest five percent of earners while increasing the tax bill for the other 95 percent of Americans. It's no wonder Ezra Klein concluded that ""'broadening the base and lowering the rates' is anti-family tax reform,"" adding:



""The size of the tax cut he's proposing for the rich is larger than all of the tax expenditures that go to the rich put together. As such, it is mathematically impossible for him to keep his promise to make sure the top one percent keeps paying the same or more.""

""So I haven't laid out all of the details about how we're going to deal with each deduction, so I think it's kind of interesting for the groups to try and score it, because frankly it can't be scored, because those kinds of details will have to be worked out with Congress, and we have a wide array of options.""

""Let's be clear on this: A tax plan that can't be scored because it doesn't include sufficient details is not a plan. It's a gesture towards a plan, or a statement of intended direction, or perhaps an unusually wonky daydream. But it's not a plan.""

""What would be best is a fundamental reform of the tax code that lowers rates, broadens the base, makes America's business competitive again, and reduces the burden imposed by taxes on work and investment.""

Lawmakers had no idea how they'd make the math work. It would be a mammoth task, forcing them to dig into big, popular middle-class tax breaks.

Romney stuck to his line, assuring voters those gains for the gilded class weren't true because no one could predict what his plan would do. During an appearance on CNBC , he went for the full ostrich:In response, the Post's Klein could only shake his head:It's certainly not plan, but instead a fraud. Yet just days after Barack Obama vanquished his Republican opponent, Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt suggested the president make the Republican scam his own. ""Look at ways to increase revenue by one growing the economy,"" he said on Fox News. ""And two, maybe look at the tax code, just like Governor Romney suggested, you look at the tax code and increase revenue without increasing taxes."" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor agreed:But by September, Cantor didn't even include tax reform in his list of priorities for House Republicans. As for Paul Ryan, next week he has a compromise budget proposal to work on with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, a task he must complete to avoid another embarrassing government shutdown for the GOP. And after that, he has a 2016 presidential campaign to contemplate. All of which means the Republicans' three-year tax reform scheme is, at best, on the backburner. As Politico concluded, Camp and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan did not make it any easier on themselves:Or, to put it another way, tax reform is dead. Long live tax reform."

The GOP measures had little chance of gaining enough Democratic support to reach the 60-vote supermajority hurdle, but they did serve to release some of the pent-up frustration among Republican senators over the bill that will allow the $16.4-trillion debt limit to be raised to continue paying the nation’s bills through May.

The final bill was approved 64 to 34.

Obama is expected to swiftly sign the legislation as lawmakers gear up for the next budget showdown: deep automatic spending cuts that will begin to hit the economy March 1 if nothing is done to stop them.

QUIZ: Test your knowledge about the debt limit

The $1.2 trillion in cuts had once been considered so severe they would force Congress to the negotiating table to devise an alternative deficit-reduction strategy.

Advertisement

But with a month to go before the cuts begin, Congress appears unable to reach a compromise over tax and spending alternatives.

The debt-ceiling legislation will suspend the borrowing authority limit through May 19, even though the Treasury Department would be expected to continue paying the nation’s bills with so-called extraordinary measures through summer.

Advertisement

Another $450 billion in debt is expected to be amassed in that time as the nation’s already accrued bills are paid, pushing the debt load to nearly $17 trillion.

Republicans have been grumbling since House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) engineered passage of the debt-ceiling bill in that chamber last week, complaining that they gave up an opportunity to extract spending reductions from the White House.

To attract GOP support, Boehner tacked on a provision that would withhold lawmakers’ pay if the House or Senate fails to approve a budget for the coming 2014 fiscal year.

Boehner wanted to avoid the potential of a risky credit default if the debt limit was not raised, while pushing on to the next budget fight.

The two-year budget agreement, which cleared a key test vote earlier in the day, was expected to get a final vote no later than Wednesday.

Ahead of the final vote, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tried unsuccessfully to use a parliamentary tactic to force a vote on the amendment, which he wrote to undo the cuts for military retirees.

A provision in the already House-passed bill would cut retirement benefits for military retirees by $6 billion over 10 years.

Sessions wanted to instead eliminate an estimated $4.2 billion in annual spending by reining in an IRS credit that illegal immigrants have claimed.

He and fellow senators argued the bill unfairly sticks veterans and other military retirees with the cost of new spending.

“It’s not correct, and it should not happen,” Sessions said on the floor.

""By blocking my amendment, they voted to cut pensions for wounded warriors,"" he said afterwards. ""Senators in this chamber have many valid ideas for replacing these pension cuts, including my proposal to close the tax welfare loophole for illegal filers, and all deserved a fair and open hearing. But they were denied.”

Sessions’ office claimed the vote Tuesday to block the amendment was a vote to ""cut military pensions instead of cutting welfare for illegal immigrants.""

Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Wash.,who brokered the budget deal with House counterpart Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., argued the GOP effort was really an attempt to kill the entire bill.

[audio-clip]

The Republican-led House passed the bill last week in an effort to avoid another stalemate leading to a potential government shutdown, like the one in October that polls showed was largely unpopular with voters.

The two-year budget deal would ease for two years some of the harshest cuts to agency budgets required under automatic spending curbs commonly known as sequestration. It would replace $45 billion in scheduled cuts for the 2014 budget year already underway, easing about half of the scheduled cuts.

The Department of the Interior late last week agreed to let states use their own money to reopen some national parks. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also determined football and other sports could continue at service academies through October.

Following outrage from military groups, the Pentagon contracted with a charity to provide death benefits to the families of fallen soldiers, before President Obama abruptly signed legislation to do just that.

Earlier, the Pentagon also announced most of its 350,000 furloughed civilian military personnel would return to their jobs. And CIA Director John Brennan said he would begin bringing back employees deemed necessary to the agency's core missions.

""It appears they are truly just making this up as they go along, as they have put out one inconsistent policy after another,"" House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, R-Wash., said in a statement, accusing the administration of playing ""political games.""

Charges that the Obama administration exaggerated the cutbacks from the outset were amplified Sunday when hundreds of vets marched in Washington to protest the closure of popular war memorials, including open-air sites.

The group organizing the protest charged in a statement that the closure was implemented ""in a mean-spirited fit of selfish anger"" -- though the Park Service says it's trying to operate within the bounds of the law.

Congress is now entering a vital week as lawmakers try and craft a way out of the partial shutdown, with a debt-ceiling deadline looming on Thursday. With the impasse lasting perhaps longer than many anticipated, the administration's move to roll back some of the cuts has done little to staunch criticism that President Obama is making Americans feel the pain in hopes of forcing House Republicans to cave.

The criticism began when military veterans were blocked from visiting the WWII memorial on the National Mall. It hit a flash point last Wednesday when Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia in Congress, criticized Obama, a fellow Democrat, in a White House meeting for not allowing her city during the partial government shutdown to spend revenue controlled by the federal government.

""The president's point of view I had to take issue with"" she told Fox News after the meeting, in which she interrupted Obama a few times, according to others in attendance. ""The city is running out of its contingency funds.""

The Republican-led House agreed to free up the money, but the proposal was rejected by the Democrat-controlled Senate.

Hastings was among the first to suggest Obama was picking and choosing his targets. He pointed out that while high-profile sites like the Lincoln Memorial were closed, low-key monuments scattered throughout the District were open.

""It appears as though only the highly visible monuments and areas are being closed to the public -- further proof that the Obama administration is only playing politics and purposely choosing to make this shutdown as painful as possible,"" he said soon after the partial shutdown began.

And a National Park Service ranger told The Washington Times: ""We've been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. It's disgusting.""

The administration, in rolling back some of its cuts, argues it was compelled to act with a heavy hand at the beginning of the budget impasse.

As hundreds of thousands of Defense Department civilians were furloughed, Pentagon officials said they were waiting on a legal opinion on whether they were permitted under a recently signed law to bring back the workers.

However, they also acted as major defense contractors announced impending furloughs, including Lockheed Martin Corp. saying days earlier that it was poised to send home 3,000 workers.

The cuts themselves are supposed to be rooted in agency-by-agency plans submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget before the partial shutdown began. Those plans are based on the legal standard that the federal government only spend money on items necessary for ""the safety of human life or the protection of property.""

Perhaps the most problematic of the cuts implemented so far for the Obama administration was the decision to withhold death benefits for the families of more than two-dozen military service members.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney last week said the president was ""very disturbed to learn of this problem"" and that he expected it to be fixed that day.

However, the administration later determined it didn't have the authority to pay the money, and a charity group would cover the cost.

The president, though, then reversed course and signed a bill authorizing the payments.

William A. Thien, national commander of Veterans of Foreign Wars, blasted Congress and the administration over its treatment of veterans during the stalemate.

""We also have a hypocritical National Park Service that closes our nation's war memorials to veterans and a federal government that continues to make foreign aid payments while our own national security is threatened because Congress has failed to pass a defense budget or put an end to the sequester,"" he said."

Program has had problems with fraud and harrassment

Army says problems have been fixed

Key congressman still doubts its value

WASHINGTON — Army Secretary John McHugh defended the use of military social scientists on battlefields despite some initial ""command, training and personnel challenges"" with the program in its early years

McHugh sent a letter recently to Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., a member of the Armed Services Committee who had raised concerns with McHugh about the Human Terrain System after USA TODAY reported that an internal Army report had found team members falsified time sheets to inflate their pay and had engaged in racial and sexual harassment. The program, launched in 2007 with civilian social scientists, was aimed at helping commanders understand local populations and avoid antagonizing them.

Army internal reviews, including a 2010 report obtained by USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act were used to ""increase oversight, improve personnel selection and enhance effectiveness,"" McHugh wrote to Hunter on March 15.

Hunter said he's not convinced the program, which cost the military $58 million in 2013, is worth the investment.

""The problem here is that the Army's take on things overlooks an investigation that raises some serious concerns and doesn't account for program shortcomings and criticisms,"" Hunter told USA TODAY.

One key concern raised by the Army report was the systematic submission of fraudulent time sheets by members of Human Terrain Teams. One team manager said in a sworn statement that team members conspired to have the manager fired for refusing ""to bow to their wishes for unconstrained overtime and comp time hours.""

The manager surveyed managers of other teams in Afghanistan and found some teams were filing for ""extremely high number of hours for work performed on their Forward Operating base,"" so they were ""getting only three or four hours off PER DAY, just sleep time, which I knew from personal experience would not stand up to common-sense scrutiny.""

A 2010 memo to the deputy chief of staff for the Army's Training and Doctrine Command from the Army's investigating officer found overtime was ""excessive"" and determined that ""168 hours per pay period (i.e. 84 hours per week, or 12 hours a day/7 days a week) is either the de facto standard or the desired standard of HTS leadership.""

This standard, according to another memo, ""approximates a salary of between $224,000 and $280,000 per year and allows an employee to take nearly six months of paid leave at the end of a 9-month tour."" Military members of the teams earned 40% less and felt a ""sense of inequity.""

The Army says allegations of time sheet fraud have been investigated and were not proved.

Many of the problems were resolved when team members, who had been contractors, were converted to limited-term federal government employees in 2009, McHugh wrote. In 2010, leadership positions were staffed by government employees and soldiers.

""In spite of the administrative challenges, HTS has been a very successful program,"" McHugh wrote. ""Commanders in combat units supported by HTS in Iraq and Afghanistan have indicated that HTS adds significant value to their operations.""

The Army intends to maintain the human terrain teams to avoid a ""cold start,"" McHugh wrote.

Soldiers, not government employees, should provide that capability, Hunter said. As the military faces the need to cut $46 billion from its budget by the end of September, programs such as Human Terrain System need more scrutiny, he said.

""Even if HTS was 100% effective, which we know it's not, does it make sense to spend money, regardless of how much or how little, on something like this when training and operations are being cut back because of funding?"" Hunter said."

It was the first time economic growth contracted since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 and showed how much the concerns about large tax hikes and federal spending cuts weighed on businesses as last year drew to a close.

A last-minute deal in Washington averted most of the tax increases and delayed the automatic spending cuts. Economists say they believe that will lead to economic growth in the first three months of 2013.

But Thursday’s report -- the government’s first estimate of fourth-quarter economic activity -- was a surprise.

QUIZ: Test your knowledge about the debt limit

Economists has projected that the gross domestic product -- the nation’s total economic output -- would expand about 1% in the fourth quarter, a slowdown from the 3.1% growth in the July-through-September period.

But a drop in inventory investment by businesses, federal government spending and U.S. exports led to the first contraction since the economy shrank 0.3% in the second quarter of 2009.

Leading the drop in government outlays was a 22.2% drop in defense spending.

“The economy ended 2012 on a very sluggish pace, even though one-time factors put the number below the trend,” said Kathy Bostjancic, director for macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board.

“While the inventory runoff and the steep decline in defense spending in the fourth quarter made economic activity look weaker than it really was, the underlying demand from consumers and businesses kept moving forward at a moderate pace,” she said.

Christie's Bad Bet Will Cost Taxpayers Millions","The gambling industry and Atlantic City are not in good health. The Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City recently sold for $20 MM - today it would cost $400 MM to build, so it has lost 95% of its value. The Sands and Atlantis casinos have disappeared. Yet Christie thought this project was a good investment of taxpayers' $260MM which is now essentially down the drain.

Because betting is now legal in neighboring states, gambling here is way down. The casino hotels have slashed their workforces, cut real wages and, citing falling property values, received huge property tax refunds - with more refunds likely. The city has sold $103 million of bonds to finance casino property tax refunds, bonds that with interest will cost the average homeowner more than $2,100 over the next two decades, Michael Stinson, the city finance director, said.

As early as last September an article by David Cay Johnston appeared in Reuters describing the troubles the Atlantic City gambling industry was facing so it should come as no surprise that the casino is now declaring bankruptcyBut Gov. Christie likes to brag in his ads and speeches that he has lowered New Jerseyan's property taxes.

According to Johnston, Atlantic City has imposed a tax on its residents to subsidize the casinos - $100 mm over next 15 years. The casinos cannot operate without government subsidies and have become ""welfare queens"". This is an ironic reversal of what was supposed to produce jobs and income for residents, who now instead have to support the industry with their tax dollars.

According to Johnston, Chris Christie is a leading proponent of corporate socialism - taking from the many and giving to business owners. Massive gifts to corporations entice them to relocate to New Jersey. For example, these corporations get to collect state income tax from workers' paychecks, but do not have to actually pay it to the state. They pocket the state income tax.



The city is about to sell another $35 million in bonds, while the Press of Atlantic City reports that $40 million more may have to be borrowed next year. If all that happens the average homeowner eventually may be out more than $3,600 in added taxes. That may well understate the added costs to local taxpayers in the next few years as the gambling business is likely to shrink even more, as Mayor Lorenzo Langford told me. Each time another casino opens in nearby states, ""the Atlantic City market should expect to see some lost business,"" Mayor Langford said, and ""one or more of the weaker casinos may close.""

Of course what this brings to mind is the endless whining by Republicans about Solyndra. who liked to repeat that the government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers. Which is of course ridiculous on its face as the government has always been instrumental in shaping policy and the economy. And Solyndra will have cost taxpayers far less than Revel and is a far more ethical and beneficial use of monies as it could have reduced the effects of climate change, whereas gambling robs from the poor to give to the rich.



NEW YORK (CNNMoney) To Democrats it represents government support for a private enterprise that was supposed to create something that made us all better off -- clean energy and jobs.

To Republicans it represents government overstepping its role. With the issue not showing signs of fading away in the election, here are seven things you should know about Solyndra and the Department of Energy loan program that supported it. It was started by Bush: The DOE loan program that funded Solyndra was actually started by President Bush in 2005. It was intended to provide government support for ""innovative technologies."" Lawmakers set aside $10 billion to cover any losses from $26 billion in loans. Solyndra could potentially cost the government $529 million. And Beacon, a power storage company that also went bankrupt, cost the government $12 million. So even if Solyndra ends up costing the full $529 million, there's still nearly $9.5 billion available should other loans go belly up. Solyndra wanted more: The company applied for another $468 million in funding shortly after its first DOE loan closed. The government did not award the second request.



And of course the final reminder is Christie's cancellation of what was at the time the country's largest public works project, on the grounds that taxpayers couldn't afford it. But, according to him they can afford to subsidize a private project.

The Tunnel would have created jobs in the region, but Christie chose to throw good money after bad in Atlantic City. Furthermore his reasons for doing so have now been refuted in a subsequent GAO report.



Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey exaggerated when he declared that unforeseen costs to the state were forcing him to cancel the new train tunnel planned to relieve congested routes across the Hudson River, according to a long-awaited report by independent Congressional investigators. The report [...] found that while Mr. Christie said that state transportation officials had revised cost estimates for the tunnel to at least $11 billion and potentially more than $14 billion, the range of estimates had in fact remained unchanged in the two years before he announced in 2010 that he was shutting down the project. And state transportation officials, the report says, had said the cost would be no more than $10 billion. Mr. Christie also misstated New Jersey’s share of the costs: he said the state would pay 70 percent of the project; the report found that New Jersey was paying 14.4 percent. Canceling the tunnel, then the largest public works project in the nation, helped shape Mr. Christie’s profile as a rising Republican star, an enforcer of fiscal discipline in a country drunk on debt. But the report is likely to revive criticism that his decision, which he said was about “hard choices” in tough economic times, was more about avoiding the need to raise the state’s gasoline tax, which would have violated a campaign promise. The governor subsequently steered $4 billion earmarked for the tunnel to the state’s near-bankrupt transportation trust fund, traditionally financed by the gasoline tax.



If there's any doubt that Christie is a typical Republican let's hope this debacle puts it to rest. He is on the forefront of corporate socialism - giving from the many to give to the (well connected) few."

Economists aren't very optimistic that trend will continue in the months ahead.

Gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of economic output -- rose at a 2.5% annual pace in the first three months of the year, driven largely by a pick-up in consumer spending, the Commerce Department said.

Consumer spending, which alone accounts for roughly two-thirds of GDP, rose at a 3.2% annual pace, the fastest pace since the end of 2010.

At first glance, that's pretty remarkable, since most workers saw their take-home pay drop in January, following the end of the payroll tax cut.

But the data also shows that consumers funded that spending in part by saving less. Americans saved an average of 2.6% of their disposable income in the first quarter, down from 4.7% at the end of 2012.

""Households are drawing down savings, and they are borrowing to continue spending,"" said Steve Cunningham, director of research and education for the American Institute for Economic Research. ""That won't last forever.""

What were people buying? Primarily, more services. That too could be partly temporary in nature.

Americans spent more on housing and utilities, which rebounded after slumping following Hurricane Sandy in the prior quarter. This March was also the coldest since 2002, a weather patten that boosted the demand for heating.

Consumer spending on durable goods like autos also contributed to stronger economic growth, but to a lesser extent.

On the business side, investment in equipment and software added slightly to growth. An even bigger boost, however, came as businesses restocked their shelves and warehouses after drawing down their inventories in the fourth quarter. That effect is also likely to be temporary, Cunningham said.

Related: The global economy is losing steam

Meanwhile, cuts in government spending, mainly related to defense, dragged on the economy in the first quarter.

The last two quarters marked the biggest six-month contraction in the federal government's economic activity since the months following the Korean War, which ended in 1953, noted Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist of Capital Economics.

Spending by federal, state and local governments is now lower than it was in mid-2007, before the recession began.

Given the fiscal squeeze, Ashworth said it's rather impressive that the economy still grew 2.5% in the first quarter. Since the recovery began in mid-2009, the economy has grown an average of 2.1% a year. Once you strip out the government's spending, though, that growth looks more like 3.1%.

""It's becoming more and more clear that the public sector is the real thing holding the economy back now,"" he said.

Public-sector cutbacks are likely to continue dragging on the economy through the rest of the year as the federal government alone cuts $85 billion over a seven-month period.

Economic growth isn't likely to be as strong in the second quarter. Other economic data already shows the economy may have lost some steam starting in March.

Job growth slowed, retail sales slumped and the manufacturing sector showed signs of weakness.

Overall, the first quarter GDP report was a bit of a letdown. Economists had been expecting the economy to grow at an even stronger rate of 2.8%.

""Even this weaker-than-hoped-for growth rate exaggerates the true underlying momentum in the economy,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.

He noted that one of the surest signs of a marriage in trouble was that both parties were convinced that they had been forgiving of various betrayals and accommodating of various foibles, yet this generosity hadn’t been reciprocated. Naturally, this brought to mind the increasingly strained relationship between Tea Party conservatives and Republican regulars. What better way to describe how Ted Cruz must feel about John Boehner, the sellout, and how John Boehner must feel about Ted Cruz, the zealot?

Molly Ball of the Atlantic recounts the quasi-mutinous musings of various conservative luminaries, like Glenn Beck of TheBlaze, Erick Erickson of RedState.com, and Sean Hannity of Fox News, among others. As recently as 2010, the notion that the Tea Party movement would bolt from the GOP to establish a party of its own would have seemed absurd. But now, in the wake of a fiscal showdown that’s proven to be an utter fiasco for congressional Republicans, the idea of a bona fide divorce is gaining credence. Among the Tea Party faithful, there is a widespread conviction that the effort to defund Obamacare would have proven successful had Speaker Boehner and his anxious allies been tougher, and more willing to risk breaching the debt ceiling. Republican regulars, meanwhile, are largely convinced that the defund Obamacare effort was a hopeless indulgence that exacted a real political cost. At least one critic of the Tea Party movement, David Frum of the Daily Beast and CNN, has argued that Republicans would benefit if “the Sarah Palins and the Ted Cruzes who have done so much harm to their hopes over the past three election cycles” were to bolt.

This isn’t the first time libertarian-minded conservatives have contemplated a formal exit from the GOP. In the 1970s, William A. Rusher, the publisher of National Review and a staunch, Rockefeller-hating Goldwaterite, frequently made the case for a new conservative party, which he hoped would be led by Ronald Reagan. After Reagan’s narrow defeat in the 1976 contest for the Republican presidential nomination, however, the former California governor stood by his moderate rival Gerald Ford, and in doing so he dashed the hopes of Rusher and other third-party enthusiasts. The Libertarian Party, established in the early 1970s, has long been divided over whether to appeal to disaffected Republicans or hippies. In the 1980 presidential election, the Libertarians achieved great success by espousing a pacifist, left-leaning brand of “low-tax liberalism,” while in 1988 the party turned to Ron Paul, the libertarian populist who would later make waves as a Republican presidential candidate in 2008 and 2012. The 2012 Libertarian presidential nominee, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, an unpretentious Republican who combined familiar Tea Party bromides with a commitment to ending the War on Drugs, had some promise as an alternative to Mitt Romney, but in the end his candidacy proved to be a footnote, in part because the septuagenarian Paul stole his thunder. The Constitution Party, first established as the U.S. Taxpayers’ Party in 1991, is a vehicle for a hard-edged Christian conservative politics that has never found much success. And in 2000, Pat Buchanan tried to transform Ross Perot’s Reform Party into a nationalist conservative party in line with his own idiosyncratic, anti-trade populism.

Given that all of these efforts have failed, why would the Tea Party movement succeed in establishing itself as a real rival to the GOP? I doubt that it would. But it is true that the political landscape has changed in recent years. Over the past decade, formal party organizations have grown progressively weaker, to the point where they are hollowed-out shells often overshadowed by well-funded independent expenditure groups. This is despite the fact that broad-based party organizations have a number of advantages over non-party outfits, including greater accountability and autonomy. The Tea Party movement already operates as a kind of shadow party within the larger Republican universe, with independent expenditure groups, think tanks, and overlapping networks of intellectuals and activists serving as its foundation. Getting on the ballot would be difficult, as the Democratic-Republican duopoly in most states actively works to suppress political competition from minor parties, but it wouldn’t be impossible.

The obvious downside of a Tea Party exit for conservatives is that the U.S. relies almost exclusively on first-past-the-post elections, in which the candidate with the most votes wins the election. Countries that use various forms of proportional representation are far friendlier to minor parties, which is why Germany, Israel and New Zealand tend to have several parties represented in their national legislatures and not just two. Tea Party candidates in congressional races would presumably be splitting the right-of-center vote with GOP candidates, thus allowing Democrats to slip into office in areas that are now monolithically Republican. Moreover, Tea Party stalwarts have good reason to believe that they can eventually take over the national Republican Party. Why abandon it now when victory is within reach? Of course, the prospect of a Republican Party dominated by the Tea Party movement isn’t exactly heartening to mainstream conservatives who fear that Tea Party excesses will cement a generation-long Democratic majority.

Rather than an outright divorce, Republicans ought to consider a different approach. Right now, Tea Party activists are pledging to launch a new round of primary challenges against Republicans deemed “squishy.” The big problem with primary elections, however, is that they attract relatively few voters, and even fairly well-informed party members often know little about the candidates on primary ballots. Knowing a candidate’s party is tremendously useful — it offers a quick shorthand as to what candidates believe. Primary ballots are bereft of this kind of useful information. Yes, you can generally be assured that the candidates running in a GOP primary are Republicans. But which kind of Republican?

In “Informing Consent: Voter Ignorance, Political Parties, and Election Law,” Christopher Elmendorf of the UC Davis School of Law and David Schleicher of the George Mason University School of Law propose providing primary voters with on-ballot guides to candidates’ issue stances, as well as endorsements. For example, if a Tea Party candidate runs against a regular Republican, she can include endorsements by current officeholders (like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul) or widely-recognized political groups (like Tea Party Express). Republican primary voters would have a much easier time making a meaningful choice between candidates if they knew that one had been endorsed by the Tea Party Express while the other had been endorsed by the centrist Main Street Partnership. This wouldn’t make the GOP’s warring factions fall in love all over again. Indeed, it could intensify intra-party conflict by encouraging the formation of new pressure groups. But it would help settle the question of whether Republicans want to be the party of Sarah Palin and Ted Cruz or of Chris Christie and Jeb Bush. And that’s not nothing.

It appears that he will urge the government to spend more, while using euphemisms such as “investments” to obfuscate the issue. The speech will likely focus on “investments” in infrastructure and education.

White House economic adviser Gene Sperling warned that closing the deficit “doesn’t mean you pull back on everything … I don’t think that laying the foundation for future growth (with research and highway spending) is anything to discount in any way. What you need to do is be smart.”

White House press secretary Jay Carney opined, “The core emphasis that he has always placed in these big speeches remains the same, and it will remain the same — the need to make the economy work for the middle class.” He added that the State of the Union address will speak of “proposals that are necessary to help the middle class grow and to help the economy grow.”

Obama, as usual, is proceeding with his plans despite polls showing they are unpopular.

Last week a poll by Fox News revealed 73 percent of voters believed cutting spending was the best approach to fixing the U.S. economy, while only 15 percent who favored increased spending. Two out of three people surveyed were against another “economic stimulus.”

A new Pew poll indicated that the budget deficit was now the third most important issue concerning Americans, surpassing terrorism and just behind the economy and jobs. According to the Commerce Department, the last quarter of 2012 featured the economy shrinking by .1 percent.

The difference between Obama and the GOP, which favors cutting spending without raising spending, can be summed up in two quotes: former Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter saying that cuts in spending alone would “strangle our economy,” and Noelle Clemente, with the American Action Forum, asserting that the claims by the White house of cuts they have made are “full of budget gimmicks …We’ve seen that stimulus spending doesn’t work. That’s not the solution. … We know that this is a long-term spending problem and it’s driven by long-term spending: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.”"

The initially disappointing 88,000 figure for March was revised to a more respectable 138,000. The February figure was revised up to 332,000 from the initial report of 268,000. That was the most new jobs added in a month since May 2010.

The private sector added 176,000 net new jobs in April, led by a gain of 73,000 in professrional and business service industry positions, the Labor Department report said. However, government shed 11,000 jobs, with the federal workforce down 8,000 positions.

The unemployment rate ticked down last month from 7.6% in March. The 7.5% rate for April was the lowest since December 2008.

“With an increase of 165,000 jobs in April, and following the significant upward revisions for February and March, the job market looks better than expected despite the sequester or issues like the rising cost of providing healthcare benefits,” said Kathy Bostjancic, director of macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board.

The economic recovery has been showing signs of slowing as tax increases, the federal spending cuts known as the sequester and the European recession combine as obstacles to growth.

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.5% annual rate in the first three months of the year, a marked improvement over the 0.4% growth in the last quarter of 2012. But the figure was below expectations, and analysts forecast that growth will slow to about 1% in the second quarter of this year before picking up again.

Economic reports in recent days have been weak, although initial jobless claims dropped last week to their lowest level in more than five years.

Amid concerns about the pace of the recovery, Federal Reserve policymakers said for the first time this week that they were prepared to increase their controversial stimulus efforts.

(CNN) —

Five years ago, on October 3, 2008, with the economy in a tailspin, President George W. Bush signed the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program into law, giving the government the ability to bail out the big banks to prevent further calamity.

A number of factors caused the economic collapse, but one in particular stands out – a witch’s brew of money and politics.

As the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission wrote in its 2011 report, “It did not surprise the Commission that an industry of such wealth and power would exert pressure on policy makers and regulators. From 1999 to 2008, the financial sector expended $2.7 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses; individuals and political action committees in the sector made more than $1 billion in campaign contributions.”

Five years later, with millions of Americans still unemployed or underemployed, not much has changed.

Wall Street is still the biggest player in Washington. The industry dished out more dough than any other industry during the 2012 election. In the first six months of 2013, the finance, insurance and real estate sector has already given $63 million to federal candidates and committees. It has spent $242 million on more than 2,000 lobbyists.

The Dodd-Frank financial reform was an important legislation and it has, and will continue, to protect consumers from abuses of the banks. But the industry played a major role in what rules were passed and it continues to play a role in the implementation of regulation rules.

Soon, the Supreme Court may give bankers and wealthy special interests – the same guys and gals who wrecked the economy in 2008 – even more influence.

On October 8, the court will hear oral arguments in McCutcheon v. FEC, a case brought by Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon and the Republican National Committee that threatens to remove the aggregate limits that individual donors can give, in total, to federal candidates and committees each election cycle.

For the 2014 election cycle, that total is $123,200 – more than double the median American family income. If the court sides with McCutcheon, an individual donor could bundle more than $1 million to congressional fundraising committees.

So what does this have to do with Wall Street and TARP? Plenty.

Some 28% of the roughly 1,200 individuals who got within 10% of the aggregate limit in the 2012 election work on Wall Street. These super donors work at Goldman Sachs, Elliott Management and other top financial firms. Wall Street was the biggest industry to put money into politics.

If aggregate limits are thrown out, a future presidential candidate could be allowed to ask for a $2 million donation for his campaign and various committees. Congressional leaders could set up a fundraising committee that could take in $3.5 million from one donor. That’s a sweet deal for Wall Street, but it’s a raw deal for democracy.

Based on past precedent, the court should uphold the current limits. But whether the justices do or do not, our democracy is already in trouble. Congress must act to raise the voices of We the People.

StampStampede.org brings the issue home to Main Street.

The Stampede encourages people to legally stamp messages such as “not to be used for bribing politicians” on our nation’s currency to support reforms to #GetMoneyOut of politics. Every bill is seen an average of 875 times and helps demonstrate a growing, sustained demand for reform.

One solution is modeled on successful systems in Arizona, Connecticut and Maine, which allow candidates to run competitive campaigns for office by relying on a mix of small donations and limited public funds. There are a handful of similar measures already introduced in Congress. They would empower small dollar donors and help them compete with the lobbyists, bankers and wealthy donors writing big checks.

The American people want and deserve a representative democracy that represents the people, not super-rich donors. But unless we come together and demand change, Congress will continue to be owned (or at least rented) by big money.

http://news.yahoo.com/treasurys-lew-congress-needs-pass-131656283.html,,[],Treasury's Lew: Congress needs to pass debt limit,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress needs to raise the debt limit and take away the ""cloud of uncertainty"" about the nation's ability to pay its bills, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in an interview broadcast Sunday.

""The fight over the debt limit in 2011 hurt the economy, even though, in the end, we saw an extension of the debt limit. We saw confidence fall, and it hurt the economy,"" Lew said on NBC's ""Meet The Press."" :Congress needs to do its job. It needs to finish its work on appropriation bills. It needs to pass a debt limit.""

Senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill are trying to come up with must-do legislation to keep federal agencies running after Sept. 30 and prevent the possibility of a government shutdown. At issue is what is normally routine: a plug-the-gap measure to fund the government for a few weeks or months until a deal can be worked out on appropriations bills giving agencies their operating budgets for the full 2014 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.

However, some Democrats don't want to vote to continue to fund the government at new, lower levels mandated by the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. And some conservatives are making a last stand against President Barack Obama's new health care law. In addition, Senate Democrats are resistant to a $20 billion spending cut sought by many Republicans.

The issue has divided Republicans between those who think it's appropriate to use the threat of a government shutdown as a negotiating tactic, and those who don't.

Rep. Peter King, R.-N.Y., said Republicans should be searching for ways to de-fund or repeal the Obama health care act. But he called threatening to shut down the government ""terror politics"" and said the strategy wouldn't work. Others have worried that the gamesmanship could cause Republicans to lose control of the House.

Some observers say it's an idea doomed to fail anyway, since Obama brings both a veto pen and the White House podium to the battle.

Story continues

""We should not be closing down the government under any circumstances,"" King said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has taken just that tack, rounding up fellow conservatives to pledge to oppose any budget extension that funds implementation of the health care law. Sunday, he said it was unfair to implement a law that many Americans don't want and that still has wrinkles that need to be ironed out.

""I understand that there's some in the Washington establishment, some from both political parties, that weren't happy with me over this,"" Lee said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ''And in this instance, I'm going to take that as a compliment, an indication that I'm doing something right.""

""The fact is that we can delay this bill,"" he added. ""And if we can delay it, we can stop its consequences, at least for now.""

Lew maintains that the president won't negotiate over the debt limit.

""The mere fact of negotiating over the debt limit, after 2011, would introduce this notion that somehow there's a question about whether or not we're going to pay our bills, whether or not we're going to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,"" Lew said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos."" ''Well, it's not OK to default. Congress can't let us default.""

""(Congress) has to stop looking for what's the last possible moment,"" Lew told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''They should get back after they take their time off in August and they should finish their work and get it done so that there's no uncertainty about America's ability to pay its bills.""

Separately, Lew said no federal bailout is in the works for the city of Detroit, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection. Pressed as to why the government chose to bail out big banks, the auto industry and others, but isn't assisting the city, Lew said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the government has been giving Detroit technical advice and has made resources available to help take down blighted properties through federal programs.

But Lew said that the situation during the financial crisis that warranted the other bailouts was ""unique,"" and that the current problems that Detroit has with its creditors, ""it's going to have to work out with its creditors."""

Most Americans think the IRS broke the law by targeting Tea Party groups for harassment.

But only 17%25 think it is even somewhat likely that anyone will be charged.

The lesson for the country is that trust in the government is very low.

So last week, while most of the country was talking about football or fears of a government shutdown, Rasmussen released a poll that should worry everyone -- but especially incumbent Democrats in Congress. According to Rasmussen's survey, most Americans think the IRS broke the law by targeting Tea Party groups for harassment, but few expect it to be punished. Fifty-three percent think the IRS broke the law by targeting the Tea Party and other conservative groups like the voter-integrity outfit True The Vote; only 24% disagreed. But only 17% think it is even somewhat likely that anyone will be charged, while 74% think that criminal charges are unlikely.

So a majority of Americans think that government officials who exercise an important trust broke the law, but only a very small number think anything will be done to punish them.

There are a couple of lessons to draw from this. One is bad for the country in general, but the other is bad for congressional Democrats.

The lesson for the country is that trust in the government is very low. (In another Rasmussen poll, 70% think that government and big business often work together against consumers and investors. According to Gallup, trust in government is lower than during Watergate.) But it's worse than that.

Believing that government officials break the law is one thing; believing that they face no consequences when they're caught and it becomes public is another. Not only is this a sort of ""broken windows"" signal to other bureaucrats -- hey, you can break the law and get away with it -- but it's particularly damaging where the IRS is concerned.

America's tax system, despite the feared IRS audit, is fundamentally based on voluntary compliance. If everyone starts cheating, there aren't enough IRS agents to make a dent. Beyond taxes, that's true regarding compliance with the law in general. Moral legitimacy is what makes honest people obey the law even when they can get away with breaking it. Undermine that and you get a country like, say, Italy, where tax evasion is a national sport.

Meanwhile, there's another bit of bad news buried in that poll, this time for Democrats. The bad news is that a majority of Americans thinks the IRS broke the law even though the news media have consistently downplayed the scandal. But as the scandal has dragged on for months, word has filtered out anyway. Come 2014, the government's damaged brand will reflect poorly on members of the president's party, regardless of media efforts to protect them.

Beyond that, the Wall Street Journal's James Taranto has begun calling President Obama ""President Asterisk,"" saying that IRS efforts to weaken his opposition in the run-up to the 2012 election devalue Obama's victory the way illegal steroid use devalues an athlete's record-book standing. Taranto writes that this puts Obama in a situation that is in some ways worse than Nixon after Watergate: ""We now know that government corruption -- namely IRS persecution of dissenters -- was a factor in Obama's re-election.

To be sure, Obama himself has not, at least so far, been implicated in the IRS wrongdoing as Nixon ultimately was in Watergate. On the other hand, Nixon's re-election victory was so overwhelming that no one could plausibly argue Watergate was a necessary condition for it. The idea that Obama could not have won without an abusive IRS is entirely plausible.""

Of course, the press hated Nixon, while it is still doing everything it can to protect Obama. But, as we see, word filters out. Stay tuned.

We’re on the cusp of a deep and entirely self-inflicted national economic wound because of a tragic clash of psychologies. In 2011, President Obama let the GOP use the threat of default as extortion; when he caved in during that standoff, and agreed to an all-spending cut budget deal plus the creation of the ill-fated “supercommittee,” the blackmailers won. Two irreconcilable lessons were drawn. First, Obama learned he can never let this brand of hostage-taking happen again, lest he weaken his office and assure the endless spectacle of governance by crisis. Second, tea party Republicans learned that, when push comes to shove, this president blinks. Little wonder they think Obama will shortly buckle again. But no sane steward of the office can allow the debt-ceiling tactics of 2011 to prevail once more. Thus, real danger is much closer than even the sliding stock market in recent days suggests.

We need a way out. It would be nice if Obama simply said, “let’s raise the debt ceiling just enough to accommodate the $1.2 trillion in new debt the latest Republican budget calls for” — but the GOP would assent only if the rest of its (deeply misguided) budget were also enacted. It also would be nice if the press pointed out (in between breathless countdowns to calamity) that we’re the only nation that even has a “debt limit” available to be hijacked as a forcing device; in countries with common sense, when a budget is passed, any new debt associated with that budget is automatically okayed. It would be nice, too, if Congress hadn’t made a foolish fetish of eliminating earmarks, so a shrewd set of courthouses and bridges in “deserving” Republican districts could have sealed a reasonable budget deal weeks ago.

Alas, we are where we are. And so the cry goes up from across the land: If only there were a deal to be struck that honored both parties’ values, a deal that advanced the cause of both economic rationality and social justice.

The surprising news is that, with a little imagination, that deal exists. It’s this: The president should offer to give states a waiver from the rollout of Obamacare if (and only if) they implement instead a system of universal catastrophic health insurance in their state.

How might this work? Governors could ask the Department of Health and Human Services for the ability to consolidate all federal cash now coming to their state for nonelderly health care — including Medicaid, the new Obamacare subsidies and, ideally, the cost of the tax subsidy for employer-provided care — to fund a universal catastrophic plan. (Regulations say such waivers can’t be sought until 2017, but Obama would offer to start them immediately).

Two (and only two) requirements would be imposed on the state plans. First, “catastrophic” would be defined relative to income. (A $5,000 deductible for a family earning $22,000 doesn’t make sense). Second, there would have to be some form of funding — perhaps via pre-loaded health savings accounts — to assure that people can pay for proper preventive care, typically shortchanged in catastrophic insurance schemes.

What would this deal accomplish? The president would show unprecedented “flexibility” vis-a-vis his signature domestic accomplishment, while getting Republicans to join him (finally) in endorsing the principal of universal coverage. (Since Obamacare will leave as many as 25 million people still uncovered, it is possible that many more Americans would become secure against financial ruin from illness under this proposal than under the Affordable Care Act itself).

Republicans can boast of plunging a dagger into the heart of that “evil” Obamacare; of moving states to the forefront of policy innovation, itself a conservative ideal; and of rescuing poor Americans from the clutches of that “second-class” system, Medicaid, because poorer folks would have private catastrophic/preventive plans instead.

In short, this deal walks everyone back from the brink and lets both sides and their allies claim important victories. House Speaker John Boehner and Obama could agree to a “term sheet” now, and pledge to legislate within a few months. Tea party leader Steve King (R-Iowa) told me Tuesday that this kind of deal held promise.

Of course, in Lt. Colombo’s famous mantra, “there’s one more thing” — the debt limit must be scrapped altogether. The president is right: The hostage taking can’t go on. In a sense, Obama would have submitted to “blackmail” one last time to get Republicans on board with universal coverage and to bury the debt limit forever as an instrument of policy. Rightly understood, this would cement the president’s legacy in ways even the unfettered rollout of Obamacare in current form can’t achieve. Meanwhile, in exchange for “slaying” Obamacare, Republicans would agree to have us join the community of nations that views the passage of a budget as authorization for any debt that budget may contain.

In the hothouse of today’s crisis, this deal may be beyond the imagination of those ostensibly in charge. But a few creative lawmakers on each side of the aisle could join to float something like it tomorrow. The alternative, I fear, will be some muddled repeat of 2011, a new chain of pointless fiscal cliffs that further diminishes the United States’ s standing in the world, or worse, an unforgivable but all-too-plausible “Guns of August”-style tumble into catastrophe.

Lois Lerner, director of exempt organizations for the IRS, will assert her right against self-incrimination during her scheduled appearance Wednesday before the House oversight panel.

The news about Lerner is yet another low point for the IRS and the Obama administration in their struggles to explain how IRS employees in a field office in Cincinnati targeted some groups that had applied for tax-exempt status.

Lerner’s criminal defense attorney, William W. Taylor III, sent the committee a letter saying that he advised Lerner, because of a federal criminal investigation, not to answer questions about the screening or about what the committee said were “false or misleading” responses she made four times to the committee’s earlier queries about the IRS’ actions.

“She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation, but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course,” Taylor wrote to Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He asked that Lerner be excused from appearing, but an Issa spokesman said she would be expected to show up anyway.

“Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs,” spokesman Ali Ahmad said.

That news came as the last two commissioners of the agency, Douglas Shulman and Steven Miller, endured a barrage of hostile questions from members of the Senate Finance Committee about who was responsible and why they didn’t reveal the problems earlier.

And a White House spokesman defended the decision by senior officials not to brief President Obama about the matter. White House spokesman Jay Carney said there was “nothing the president could or should do until that process was completed.”

Advertisement

New details have emerged this week showing that, with an audit by an inspector general nearing release, officials at the IRS, the Treasury Department and the White House started talking a month ago about some kind of preemptive public disclosure about the improper targeting.

In late April, IRS officials reported to the Treasury Department that they were thinking about having Lerner talk about it in a speech, with an apology, according to a Treasury Department official. Treasury officials “expressed some concern” about the idea but “deferred” to the IRS.

Advertisement

About the same time, the IRS floated the idea of having Miller reveal the targeting during congressional testimony. Once again, the Treasury Department said it was the IRS’ call, according to a statement from a Treasury official.

And the Treasury Department also knew in advance that Lerner would reveal the targeting on May 10, answering a planted question during an American Bar Assn. conference. The disclosure quickly turned messy, with Lerner struggling to answer questions during a follow-up call with reporters. The White House knew about the speech idea but not the plan to plant a question, the Treasury official said.

Miller, the acting IRS commissioner forced to resign last week, said he took responsibility for that bungled rollout strategy.

“Did not work out,” he said bluntly. “Obviously the entire thing was an incredibly bad idea.”

Advertisement

Lerner, head of the unit that scrutinizes nonprofits for the IRS, came to the agency from the Federal Election Commission in 2001. In June 2011, according to the inspector general’s report, Lerner learned that employees in Cincinnati were using terms like “tea party” and “patriots” to cull applications from nonprofit groups for review.

Lerner immediately ordered changes, the report says. But in January 2012, someone at the IRS put out another email telling screeners to watch out for groups that used other political terms, including those involved in educating on the Constitution.

The groups raised protests after the IRS sent them letters with a long list of questions, including the identity of their donors and the names of the people invited to their events. Congress started asking questions. But Lerner, along with other senior IRS employees, did not reveal the improper targeting before May 10.

During the hearing Tuesday, senators on the Finance Committee accused Shulman and Miller of deliberately hiding the matter from Congress. “It’s a lie by omission. There’s no question about that in my mind,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the committee’s top Republican.

Advertisement

“I did not lie, sir,” Miller responded.

Shulman also said he wasn’t trying to hide anything.

Advertisement

He said he didn’t know about the screenings when he told Congress that no improper targeting had occurred. Afterward, he kept quiet because the audit was still underway. “And sitting there then and sitting here today, I think I made the right decision, which is to let the inspector general get to the bottom of it, chase down all the facts and then make his findings public,” he said.

Miller said he still could not provide the names of the IRS employees who were responsible for the inappropriate screening. The inspector general, J. Russell George, promised further scrutiny.

Advertisement

Shulman, who retired in November 2012 after five years as commissioner, said he regretted that the problems happened on his watch, but he resisted a suggestion by one senator that he apologize to several Texas groups that received long lists of questions during the screening process.

“I didn’t touch individual cases and I certainly didn’t touch cases that involved political activity,” Shulman said.

Advertisement

“The buck doesn’t stop with you,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).

“I certainly am not personally responsible for creating a list that had inappropriate criteria on it,” Shulman said.

Advertisement

Shulman and Miller also were taken to task for failing to address the underlying issue that helped create the mess: determining how much political activity is permitted by social welfare organizations that get tax-exempt status. Federal tax law says these groups should be “exclusively” devoted to the public welfare. But the IRS later issued a rule that said politics could not be the group’s “primary purpose,” and neither the agency nor Congress has ever defined that rule.

Since the Citizens United decision in 2010, such groups — which don’t have to report their donors to the public, as do political entities — have been used as vehicles for hundreds of millions in political spending.

Miller agreed that the IRS had done a poor job at providing guidance on what level of political activity was acceptable.

“How long do we wait?” asked Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).

“That’s a question that you’ll have to ask my successor, sir,” Miller said.

Congress has four days left to pass a spending bill to keep the government running. But traditional arguments between Republicans and Democrats, and bickering within the Republican Party have delayed action for days. While the unusual floor fight between senators from the same party focused on one temporary spending bill, it highlighted the intra-party fights raging among Republicans over everything from national security surveillance to immigration reform and how deeply to cut into government social safety-net programs. Corker, a Tennessee Republican, accused Cruz and fellow conservative Tea Party-backed Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah of not wanting to vote on legislation on Thursday night because they wished to maximize their public exposure on Friday. They ""have sent out emails around the world and turned this into a show possibly, and therefore they want people around the world to watch maybe them and others on the Senate floor,"" Corker said on the Senate floor. ""That is taking priority over getting legislation back to the House so they can take action before the country's government shuts down,"" Corker said. Cruz's office defended the delay and said it was better that the debate play out in the full light of day so the American people know exactly what is happening. ""America will be watching closely which senators vote to allow Democrats to fully fund Obamacare, and the vote should be carried out in the open for all to see,"" Cruz's office said. Earlier this week, Cruz, a first-term senator from Texas, spent 21 hours and 19 minutes talking on the Senate floor in what many Republican lawmakers viewed as a publicity stunt to rail against President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as 'Obamacare.' Although Cruz repeatedly warned his Republican colleagues that a vote to advance the Senate's budget bill was akin to supporting Obamacare, he later voted in favor of advancing the legislation. DISAGREEMENT OVER STRATEGY Corker questioned Cruz's marathon anti-Obamacare speech, which looked like a filibuster that senators normally use to block legislation. ""I don't think ever in the history of the Senate that we've had a 21-hour filibuster and then the person carrying out the filibuster voted for the issue they were filibustering,"" said Corker. Many Republicans disagree with Cruz's and Lee's strategy of using the threat of a government shutdown to stop funding Obamacare, since they do not have the votes to approve the bill in the Democratic-controlled Senate and Obama has said he will veto it. But pressure from the two senators as well as outside groups affiliated with the conservative Tea Party movement led the Republican-led House to pass a spending bill that included a provision to defund Obamacare. ""It's my understanding that the reason you don't want to send a bill over to the House who could possibly put in place some very good policies for us here, is that you want the American people and the outside groups that you've been in contact with to be able to watch us tomorrow,"" Corker said. The Senate is expected to vote on Friday on a bill to keep the government funded through mid-November. The legislation will then go back to the House where Republicans are expected to attach other Republican-friendly provisions. (Reporting by Rachelle Younglai; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

Lois Lerner, director of the IRS’ exempt organizations unit, spoke deliberately and crisply in her opening remarks to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the first time she has appeared before Congress since she revealed earlier this month that the division she oversaw inappropriately screened and questioned tea party and other groups seeking nonprofit status.

“I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws,” Lerner said. “I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided any false information to this or any other congressional committee.”

DOCUMENT: Inspector General’s IRS report

The fireworks started from the hearing’s outset, the third congressional showdown on the IRS controversy in less than a week. Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Vista), in his opening remarks, had harsh words not only for IRS and administration officials, but for the Treasury inspector general as well, whose audit was initiated at Issa’s request. Issa said J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, did not inform him soon enough about the results of his review.

George is one of four witnesses appearing before the committee Wednesday, along with former IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman, deputy Treasury secretary Neal Wolin and Lerner. It was Lerner’s refusal to answer questions that prompted a combative early exchange.

“While I would very much like to answer the committee’s questions today, I’ve been advised by my counsel to assert my constitutional right not to testify or answer questions related to the subject matter of this hearing,” Lerner said. “After very careful consideration, I’ve decided to follow my counsel’s advice and not testify or answer any of the questions today.

“Because I’m asserting my right not to testify, I know that some people will assume that I’ve done something wrong. I have not. One of the basic functions of the 5th Amendment is to protect innocent individuals, and that is the protection I’m invoking today.”

Issa asked Lerner to reconsider.

“I will not answer any questions or testify about the subject matter of this committee’s meeting,” she responded.

Issa then dismissed Lerner and her attorney, criminal defense lawyer William W. Taylor III, from the hearing room, prompting an objection from his Republican colleague, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.

“You don’t get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination. That’s not the way it works,” said Gowdy, a former prosecutor. “She waived her right to 5th Amendment privilege by issuing an opening statement. She ought to stand here and answer our questions.”

Some in the audience applauded.

The committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, interjected. “Unfortunately, this is not a federal court, and she does have the right, and we have to adhere to that,” he said.

Issa consulted with his staff, asked Lerner again to reconsider or answer a narrower range of questions. Again she declined, and Issa excused Lerner and her attorney from the hearing room.

Lerner’s refusal to testify was known in advance to the committee. Taylor, in a letter sent to Issa on Monday, asserted Lerner “has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course.”

According to an inspector general’s report, Lerner found out in June 2011 that some staff in the IRS Cincinnati field office had used such terms as “tea party” and “patriots” to select applications for additional scrutiny. The report stated Lerner ordered changes to the inappropriate criteria.

But neither Lerner nor anyone else at the IRS told Congress, even after repeated queries from several committees, including House Oversight, about whether some groups had been singled out unfairly.

What began in Manhattan eight months ago first spread to Chicago and Washington and this week has hit St. Louis, Kansas City, Detroit and Flint, Mich. On Wednesday alone, workers picketed McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Popeye’s and Long John Silver’s restaurants in those cities with an ambitious agenda: pay of $15 an hour, twice what many now earn.

These strikes, which are planned for Milwaukee on Thursday, carry the flavor of Occupy Wall Street protests and are far different from traditional unionization efforts that generally focus on a single workplace. The national campaign, underwritten with millions of dollars from the Service Employees International Union, aims to mobilize workers — all at once — in numerous cities at hundreds of restaurants from two dozen chains.

None of the nation’s 200,000-plus fast-food restaurants are unionized.

The strategists know they want to achieve a $15 wage, but they seem to be ad-libbing on ways to get there. Perhaps they will seek to unionize workers at dozens of restaurants, although some labor leaders scoff at that idea because the turnover rate among fast-food employees is about 75 percent a year. Or the strategists and strikers might press city councils to enact a special “living wage” for fast-food restaurants. Or perhaps by continually disrupting the fast-food marketplace from counter to counter across the country, they can get McDonald’s, KFC and others to raise wages to end the ruckus. The protests’ organizers acknowledge that yet another goal is to push Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and pressure state legislatures to raise the state minimums."

Most Americans will pay more in taxes in 2013 because of the expiration of a payroll tax cut

Obama's claim that the deal will reduce the deficit depends on one's baseline assumption

Video could make some think they won't see a tax increase unless they make more than $400,000

In a Web video, President Obama leaves out some key facts about the fiscal cliff deal, possibly leaving the wrong impression about its impact on taxpayers and the deficit:

Obama boasts that ""middle-class families"" will not have to ""pay upwards of $2,000 more in taxes this year."" That's accurate for income taxes, but Obama doesn't mention that the deal allowed a payroll tax cut to expire. About 77% of taxpayers will pay more in taxes this year — nearly $1,200 more for those earning between $75,000 and $100,000, a group that fits squarely in Obama's broad definition of middle class.

Obama says the agreement ""will reduce the deficit."" In fact, the deficit will increase by about $4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for all but those in the top 1% of taxpayers. The deal will ""reduce the deficit"" only compared with what it would have been if the Bush tax cuts had been extended for everyone.

All the president's talk about preserving middle-class tax cuts in the just-passed bill to avert the so-called fiscal cliff may give one the impression that, except for the wealthy, people will be paying the same amount in taxes this year as last. But that's not correct. Left out of Obama's analysis is that a temporary, two-year reduction in Social Security payroll taxes was allowed to expire. As a result, most people will actually pay more in taxes this year.

In some cases, Obama has been clear that the fiscal cliff deal means an extension of lower income tax rates for middle-income earners. For example, he told reporters on Jan. 1 that under the new law more than 98% of Americans ""will not see their income taxes go up.""

He made no mention of payroll taxes in that press briefing. Nor is there a mention in the White House fact sheet about the fiscal cliff deal.

And in a campaign-style video sent out to supporters, Obama says only that the deal spared middle-income households from a bruising tax hike.

Obama, Jan. 2: You know my top priority has been preventing a tax hike that could have hit 98% of all Americans in 2013. Because the last thing middle-class families can afford right now would be to pay upwards of $2,000 more in taxes this year.

It's true that the deal spares middle-income earners the worst of the fiscal cliff tax hikes. The law is likely to raise $620 billion in new high-income revenues, mostly by allowing Bush-era tax cuts to expire for individuals making more than $400,000 and couples making more than $450,000 a year (that affects 1% of Americans, not 2%, as Obama said). But for people below that income threshold, the income tax rate will remain the same.

That's certainly a big deal. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projected that if all of the expiring tax cuts were allowed to go away, the nation would probably slide into a recession and the unemployment rate would rise to 9.1%.

But Obama's video — in which he leaves out the qualifier income tax — may lead many to believe that if they don't earn upward of $400,000, they will not see a tax increase in 2013. And they may be surprised when they get their first paycheck this year to see that it is a bit lighter. That's because a two-year reduction in the Social Security payroll tax — that pesky FICA line on your paycheck — was allowed to expire.

As a result, those with income between $40,000 and $50,000 would pay an additional $574 in payroll taxes in 2013, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. Those with household income between $75,000 and $100,000 (still solidly middle-class by Obama's definition) would pay an additional $1,194 in 2013. Allowing the payroll tax to go back up to 6.2% from 4.2% will mean an average tax hike for all Americans of $721 over the course of 2013. That's $60 a month.

Overall, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 77% of Americans will be paying more in taxes in 2013 than they did in 2012.

""For most, the only reason is because of the payroll tax,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

Many politicians do not view that as a tax hike, but rather as simply the expiration of a two-year tax cut that was always designed to be temporary. Extending the payroll tax cut was not part of Obama's 2013 budget. But whether it was part of the Obama administration's initial fiscal cliff proposal is a bit fuzzy. As we reported on Dec. 5, the president's opening offer in the fiscal cliff negotiations included $200 billion in new stimulus spending. At that time, Treasury declined to give us a detailed list of proposals for new spending, but it did confirm published reports that some of the elements of the stimulus plan might include an extension of the Social Security payroll tax holiday, as well as infrastructure spending. Those were not part of the law that passed.

One could argue the Bush tax cuts were also temporary, but only because Republicans didn't have enough votes to make the tax cuts permanent when the legislation was approved in 2001. And so they were enacted for nine years, with Republicans expecting that the cuts would ultimately be made permanent. And then they were extended for another two years by Obama and Congress.

Deficit-cutting?

As for Obama's claim that the fiscal cliff deal will reduce the deficit, that depends on one's baseline assumption. The deficit is smaller than it would have been if the Bush tax cuts had been extended for everyone, including the wealthy. But it is larger than if the Bush tax cuts had been allowed to expire for everyone as scheduled at the end of 2012.

Among budget experts, it is the difference between starting with a baseline of ""current policy"" — which assumed the Bush tax cuts would have been extended for everyone, as they were in 2010 — and ""current law,"" which called for the expiration of all the Bush tax cuts on Jan. 1, 2013.

Assuming ""current policy,"" Obama is able to claim the fiscal cliff law reduces the deficit, mostly by increasing high-income revenue by $620 billion. But assuming ""current law,"" the deal actually increases the deficit by nearly $4.6 trillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office — because it permanently extends the Bush tax cuts for most taxpayers.

Obama is trying to have it both ways, as he toggles between the two assumptions. By assuming the tax cuts would have expired for everyone without his action, the president claims credit for averting an income tax hike for middle-income taxpayers. But, in order to take credit for cutting the deficit, Obama is assuming that the tax cuts would have been extended for everyone."

Remember how running the printing presses was going to cause runaway inflation? Since the recession began, the Fed has more than tripled the size of its balance sheet, but inflation has averaged less than 2 percent.

pretty much standard liquidationism, with a strong goldbug streak.

Krugman calls Stockman's analysis of our economic history as- I wonder if that is intended at least in part to link Stockman to the craziness of the likes of Glenn Beck, who after all has been a paid mouthpiece for gold interests?

Perhaps not, since Stockman basically asserts that we have been going to Hell in a handbasket since FDR took us off the gold standard, and have been on sprees ever since:

spending sprees, consumption sprees, debt sprees, and above all money-printing sprees. If disaster was somehow avoided for 70-plus years, it was thanks to a series of lucky accidents.

which doesn’t make the nation as a whole any poorer, and doesn’t require that we collectively spend less. In fact, the biggest problem created by all this debt is that it’s keeping the economy depressed by causing us collectively to spend too little, with debtors forced to cut back while creditors see no reason to spend more.

In a sense, all of that tartness is simply preface from Krugman, who then provides an important economic lesson on our rising debt. Yes, it has increased as a portion of GDP. The amount that is foreign has increased, albeit less than most Americans think, but that it mainly America borrowing from AmericansRemember, you do not pay taxes on interest earned from government bonds, and that investment is still considered absolutely safe. Add to that the large amounts of cash being held by corporations because inflation is so low and we we should already see the need for investment to stimulate spending. As Krugman has noted for some time, because interest rates are currently so low, the government should, rather than cutting spending, be increasing it as a stimulus whose return will based on historic trends within a short time return far more in tax revenue than it will cost interest. Such additional spending will also create increases in revenue for state and local governments, as sales and income tax streams increase, the price of real estate begins to return to higher levels, and then those governments can perhaps even rehire some of those employees they have been forced to lay off because they are required to run balanced government. That rehiring adds additional spending which will also increase government revenue through taxation.

Krugman is all for restoring financial controls and oversight to deter excess leverage and prevent the next crisis.

To deal with the crisis that’s already here, we need monetary and fiscal stimulus, to induce those who aren’t too deeply indebted to spend more while the debtors are cutting back.

by turning our problems into a morality play of sin and retribution, it helps condemn us to a deeper and longer slump.

the notion of macroeconomics as morality play has a visceral appeal that’s hard to fight. Disguise it with a bit of political cross-dressing, and even liberals can fall for it.

This of course is ""anathema"" to Mellonites, like Stockman, like the deficit hawks, like Pete Peterson, like unfortunately too many Democrats as well. They think that deficit spending - which in their minds includes any spending on the social safety net that does go through the private sector so that corporations can gain some direct profit - is what has caused our current financial crises, which they measure primarily in the size of deficits and debts, never mind that the deficit increased under a Republican administration in part because of unnecessary tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations and fighting two wars without paying for them. Krugman warns us that their approach of liquidation is destructive, becauseOf course, the messaging from the Mellonites has been working. As Krugman puts it ""sin sells."" That is,This is happening not just on the macroeconomic level of the national economy. We see it in the policies of Democratic mayors like Emanuel in Chicago, who use among other things the financial problems as a justification for slashing away at the basic local government function of public education, and finding ways of turning that function into something that can turn profits for the investor class and corporations, even as it destroys neighborhoods and ignores the needs of those hurting the most.

The real political cross-dressing comes from a Democratic President more committed to a ""grand bargain"" with ""bi-partisan"" support than he seems to be to rebuilding the economy for the long term. What is sad is that he can clearly argue that he was right on stimulus spending. That is, he could clearly argue had he pushed for a more significant stimulus the first time around. Even so, the data supports him - rather than pushing for the grand bargain he should be pushing for more stimulus.

Krugman's column saddened me because of its ending, especially the words visceral appeal that's hard to fight. I do not think it is impossible to fight but the rhetorical battle is already lost when the Democratic President accepts the framing of the argument in a way that cedes control to the Mellonites, whether they are simply hostile to government or merely wrong-headed about how governments and economies actually function.

Still, the column is important enough I wanted to bring to the attention of this community. The link gets you past the firewall and does not count against your quota of Times stories for the month.

Read the whole thing.

It is worth the time.

But then, isn't that always true of Krugman?"

It is, however, an extremely cautious proposal, one that doesn’t follow through on its own analysis. After all, if sharp spending cuts are a bad thing in a depressed economy — which they are — then the plan really should be calling for substantial though temporary spending increases. It doesn’t.

But there’s a plan that does: the proposal from the Congressional Progressive Caucus, titled “Back to Work,” which calls for substantial new spending now, temporarily widening the deficit, offset by major deficit reduction later in the next decade, largely though not entirely through higher taxes on the wealthy, corporations and pollution.

I’ve seen some people describe the caucus proposal as a “Ryan plan of the left,” but that’s unfair. There are no Ryan-style magic asterisks, trillion-dollar savings that are assumed to come from unspecified sources; this is an honest proposal. And “Back to Work” rests on solid macroeconomic analysis, not the fantasy “expansionary austerity” economics — the claim that slashing spending in a depressed economy somehow promotes job growth rather than deepening the depression — that Mr. Ryan continues to espouse despite the doctrine’s total failure in Europe.

No, the only thing the progressive caucus and Mr. Ryan share is audacity. And it’s refreshing to see someone break with the usual Washington notion that political “courage” means proposing that we hurt the poor while sparing the rich. No doubt the caucus plan is too audacious to have any chance of becoming law; but the same can be said of the Ryan plan.

So where is this all going? Realistically, we aren’t likely to get a Grand Bargain any time soon. Nonetheless, my sense is that there is some real movement here, and it’s in a direction conservatives won’t like.

As I said, Mr. Ryan’s efforts are finally starting to get the derision they deserve, while progressives seem, at long last, to be finding their voice. Little by little, Washington’s fog of fiscal flimflam seems to be lifting."
http://news.yahoo.com/obamas-no-negotiation-stance-setting-tone-072558838--politics.html,,[],Obama's no-negotiation stance setting new tone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — This time, President Barack Obama says, he's not budging. This is the confrontational Obama, the ""Make my day"" president, betting Republicans blink to avoid a government shutdown or a first-ever default of the nation's debts.

It's a proposition not without risk and one with a history of last-minute accommodations on both sides. Brinkmanship between Obama and congressional Republicans has often stopped at the precipice's edge.

In this round, however, the president and his aides maintain that when it comes to raising the government's borrowing authority and meeting its debt obligations, there's no bargaining. To conservatives wishing to undo the 3-year-old health care law in exchange for an increase in the nation's credit, Obama on Friday said bluntly: ""That's not going to happen.""

""I don't know how I can be more clear about this: Nobody gets to threaten the full faith and credit of the United States just to extract political concessions,"" Obama said in a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room.

Still, House Speaker John Boehner says a debt hike must be linked to budget cuts and other programmatic changes.

""The president says, 'I'm not going to negotiate,'"" Boehner said. ""Well, I'm sorry, but it just doesn't work that way.""

Obama's stance is rooted in experience, politics and a desire to protect himself from similar demands in the remaining three years of his presidency.

Obama advisers note that past negotiations have not yielded grand bargains and that the mere threat of default in 2011 rattled the economy, causing a downgrade in U.S. credit. Talks earlier this year to avoid automatic spending cuts known as sequestration also failed.

Obama aides also note that Boehner himself eight months ago declared an end to negotiations with Obama, favoring the regular legislative process instead.

That process has proved messy for the GOP, and senior White House aides insist that in a standoff, Republicans will be perceived as the unreasonable party. And the White House is convinced any concession would place the president in the position of having to bargain again and again when the next debt ceiling looms.

Story continues

""I'm not going to start setting a precedent, not just for me, but for future presidents, where one chamber in Congress can basically say each time there needs to be a vote to make sure Treasury pays its bills, we're not going to sign it unless our particular hobby horse gets advanced,"" Obama said Friday.

His advisers only see a downside if Obama doesn't stand his ground.

""Every poll I've seen suggests that while no one escapes cleanly from a shutdown, the GOP would bear the brunt,"" former senior White House counselor and Obama adviser David Axelrod said. ""The bigger danger for the president is to put himself in a position to be constantly held hostage. First they want an arm. Then they want a leg. It's unsustainable.""

House Republican leaders, meanwhile, want to attach other provisions to the debt ceiling, including approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and provisions blocking pollution regulations.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., on Thursday demanded the GOP-controlled House simply send the Senate unencumbered spending and debt ceiling bills.

""There's no need for conversations,"" Reid said. ""We've spoken loudly and clearly, and we have the support of the president of the United States. And that's pretty good.""

The Pew Research Center, however, found nearly 6 out of 10 Americans want politicians they side with to be more willing to engage in talks. And the public split about evenly in the Pew poll on who would be responsible if the government shut down, with 39 percent blaming Republicans and 36 percent Obama and much of the rest blaming both.

""The president may not be playing this just for this set and this match,"" said Patrick Griffin, the White House legislative director under President Bill Clinton. ""As his tenure goes on and his legacy looms larger, he might not be as poll sensitive as he might be otherwise.""

White House aides say Obama is still willing to negotiate over a long-term spending deal, just not as part of raising the debt ceiling. But the opportunity for that could be short-lived, too. The Senate version of the short-term spending bill would set up another possible government shutdown as soon as Nov. 16.

What's more, lines in the sand have blurred before.

Obama ran for re-election vowing to increase taxes on individuals making more than $200,000. Republicans insisted they would not raise taxes at all. In the end, both settled on a hike on incomes above $400,000. Most recently, Obama altered course on Syria, at first determined to launch missile strikes against its regime, then seeking congressional support before taking a diplomatic path aimed at destroying Syria's chemical stockpile.

The White House also sees the current showdown as an opportunity to cast the Republican Party in the image of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a leader in the effort to kill Obama's health care law.

""They have allowed Ted Cruz to be their face, write their charter and steer their ship,"" said senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer. ""That is a decision that has real consequences for how the American people view the Republican Party as we head into this debate.""

Still, if the White House is eager to stitch Cruz' name to the Republican Party banner, many Senate Republicans were doing their best to distance themselves from the Texan and his aggressive tactics.

Indeed, as much as Republicans dislike the health care law, many Republicans argue that seeking to kill it is fruitless as long as Obama is president and Democrats control the Senate.

An increasingly outspoken minority of Fed officials are concerned that monthly purchases of about $85 billion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities are doing more harm than good. They argue the effort may need to end even before the nation’s unemployment rate drops, because it is encouraging excessive risk-taking and could make it harder to control inflation.

But the Federal Open Market Committee reiterated its determination in January to hold course until there was “substantial improvement” in the outlook for job growth, and several officials cautioned at the meeting that the greater risk to the economy was in stopping too soon, according to the account, which was published after a standard three-week delay.

Those officials “noted examples of past instances in which policy makers had prematurely removed accommodation, with adverse effects on economic growth, employment and price stability,” it said. “They also stressed the importance of communicating the committee’s commitment to maintaining a highly accommodative stance of policy as long as warranted by economic conditions.”"

According to the Tax Policy Center, those earning $611,000 are among the top 1 percent in the United States. Those with income of $6,800, meanwhile, are among the bottom 5 percent.



The unemployment rate is 16 percent, or more than double the national average.



But according to John Sutter, who recently traveled to the town of Lake Providence in the parish for CNN's Change the List project, few of its 7,500 residents are complaining.



""I was hard pressed to find people in Lake Providence who think income inequality, specifically, is a problem,"" Sutter wrote on CNN.com. ""This is the way things are, they say.""



Delores Gilmore, a 44-year-old overnight prison guard who lives on the south side of the lake, earns $8.50 per hour working 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. to make ends meet.



""The first of the month, I pay the rent,"" she said. ""The next check, I pay my light bills. Sometimes I won't pay my rent and I pay the light bill from last month — if they cut if it off. Then I pay the rent the end of the month. ... I get it done. By the grace of God, I get it done.""



Gilmore may not complain about the income division, but she does dream about being on the other side, Sutter writes:

Gilmore, a stern but funny lady who answers the door saying, ""What now?!"" and carries a switch to church in case her kids act up, never wore shoes in the imagined house, only socks. Her real living room floor is made of splintered plywood. But the floors in the dream home were smooth as a skating rink. In the dream, Gilmore ran through the halls and slid across the floor in her socks — just like Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business.""

Story continues





Thomas Terral, a 71-year-old businessman who lives on the other side of the lake, is among the top 5 percent:





He lives a life of relative luxury — nothing that would seem outlandish by national standards, but it is a far cry from life south of the lake. His living room has the vibe of an upscale ski lodge, with the heads of various animals — one is a bighorn sheep, I think -- staring at you from elevated angles. In the office, a bear rug has its mouth open, fangs showing. Terral shot it with a bow and arrow on a hunting trip in British Columbia. On the coffee table is a copy of Forbes magazine. Cover story: ""Peace Through Profits.""





Terral's family owned several farm-related businesses, including one that they sold in 2010.



""I felt like my mission was to supply as many jobs as I could,"" Terral said. ""Of course, we were a small company, and I think the most employees we had was a little under 70 — 68 or so. What we did was probably the best thing we could do to help the situation.""



""By 'the situation,'"" Sutton writes, ""he means the poverty south of the lake."""

This so-called correspondent is a living breathing pipe-organ for the White House and its latest push to blame sequester — and by extension, the GOP — for Obama’s failed economic policies.

A little after 2pm ET today, Velshi appeared on CNN with Brooke Baldwin. She asked how the business community is reacting to sequester. His response was to use both hands to grab hold of Obama’s talking points from earlier today and spread that sequester gospel like one of the president’s apostles:

Generally speaking the word from the business community is pretty standard. We are at a time in our economy where it would be useful to be building and expanding. We got unemployment edging down, jobs being created, very low interest rates, and an energy boom. We could be really moving to the top of the global pile in terms of economic activity, and this sort of thing [sequester] is like the government sticking its foot out just as your gaining speed as you’re running.

Where to begin?

This isn’t a little partisan spin coming from Velshi, it is full-blown Orwellian propagandizing. You expect this kind of flackery from David Axelrod, not someone CNN poses as an objective correspondent.

1. Unemployment is not edging down. It is edging up. At best it’s stuck, and the CBO says it is going to stay stuck for at least another year.

2. Job creation is barely treading water with population growth.

3. An energy boom? Has Velshi filled his gas or home heating tank lately?

4. How exactly is our economy “gaining speed” when our economy plummeted around three-points last quarter to a growth level of one-tenth of one-percent?

5. “We could be really moving to the top of the global pile?” Did Velshi really say that? Good grief. Even Obama is more careful with the happy talk.

Then there are the lies of omission: The fact that we learned just today that the drop in income last month was the biggest in 20 years; and the fact that sequester represents about 2% of the federal budget, which translates to about a measly 1% of our GDP.

The picture Velshi is outrageously and dishonestly trying to paint is that our economy is humming (when the EXACT opposite is true) and that, if it falters (to a point where even the media can’t happy talk it), the fault falls on the government being too small, which Obama tried so desperately to stop.

But Velshi wasn’t done sucking up to Obama. Oh, no, someone’s looking for a “good dog” by blaming sequester in part on the right-leaning Chamber of Commerce:

But I have to tell you, the business community to some degree has fed this. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce really contributed to the partisanship and the election of people who are on both sides of this in Washington. And this is the result.

In Velshi’s defense… he has earned that “good dog.”

Come on CNN, can’t you do a little better than this? The economy just might become the biggest story in the country soon. If you want to earn back an audience, you’re going to need a business correspondent with some credibility, respect for context, and more respect for the viewer than his failed agenda.

This was slightly more than the 28 percent who said President George W. Bush was to blame. An additional 44 percent thought it over but just weren’t sure.

This is a preposterous notion. Everybody knows Barack Obama couldn’t have been responsible for the Katrina response because he was in Indonesia in 2005, learning about his Muslim faith in a madrassa. He had moved to Indonesia directly from his home country of Kenya, stopping in the United States just long enough to fake the moon landing.

When I read a report about the poll on the Talking Points Memo Web site, the first thing that came to mind was the famous campaign-trail quotation from the man who actually was president in 2005: “Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning.”

Evidently, they is not, at least not in Louisiana. Yet ignorance alone does not account for this bizarre finding.

The Katrina result, from the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling, is somewhat suspect because it is from an automated, push-button polling method. Yet the finding, if unscientific, is revealing: It shows that a substantial number of Republican voters will agree to something they know to be false if it puts Obama in a bad light.

The Katrina question is consistent with the many surveys finding an appalling amount of misinformation embraced by the electorate. Seven in 10 Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. One in five thought that Obama was Muslim. In another famous poll, Americans were three times more likely to be able to name two of the seven dwarfs than two Supreme Court justices.

Earlier this year, Public Policy Polling found disturbingly high levels of belief in UFOs and aliens, and the believers were bipartisan: Twenty-two percent of Mitt Romney voters said Obama was the Antichrist, and 13 percent of Obama voters said the government allowed the 9/11 attacks to occur.

But Obama’s presidency has provoked a particularly steep rise in the proportion of Republican conspiracy theorists. A Pew poll last year found that 30 percent of Republicans and 34 percent of conservative Republicans thought Obama was Muslim — roughly double than thought so four years earlier. Gallup polling in April 2011 found that 43 percent of Republicans thought Obama was born in another country.

Obama conspiracy theories have flourished in the Deep South, where wealth and educational levels are both low. This makes sense: Where voters are least informed, they are most susceptible to misinformation peddled by talk-radio hosts and the like.

For this reason, voters in reliably Republican states, which tend to be poorer, with lower test scores, are more vulnerable to misinformation. To use one measure, the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress test of eighth-grade reading, all but one of the top 10 states were in Obama’s column in 2012. Of the 19 doing worse than average, 14 were red states.

This is what makes the Katrina question so interesting. Certainly, Louisianans are on the low end of the education rankings, fifth from the bottom in math and third-to-last in reading. But this question got around the ignorance question by asking Louisiana Republicans about a topic they know intimately.

All but the most clueless had to know that Obama, a first-term senator in 2005, was not responsible for the botched storm response that Louisianans experienced up close and personally. It’s a notion so demonstrably false that they wouldn’t have heard anybody arguing for it on Fox News or talk radio. Yet 29 percent of Republican primary voters (the sample size was 274) reflexively endorsed the falsehood.

Why?

“Obama derangement syndrome is running pretty high right now among a certain segment of the Republican base,” Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, told me. “There’s a certain segment of people who say, ‘If you’re going to give me the opportunity to stick it to Obama, I’m going to take it.’ ”

In other words, a large number of that 29 percent who said Obama was responsible for the Katrina response knew that he wasn’t but saw it as a chance to register their displeasure with the president. Obama has driven a large number of Republican voters — Jensen puts it at 15 to 20 percent of the overall electorate — right off their rockers. And to that, there is only one thing to say.

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-set-approve-huge-2013-spending-bill-160418908--finance.html,,[],Senate set to approve huge 2013 spending bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate moved toward a vote Wednesday on a huge, bipartisan spending bill aimed at keeping the government running through September and ruling out the chance of a shutdown later this month.

Chamber leaders announced that a logjam that had stalled the bill had been broken and that the measure would pass by late afternoon and return to the House, where a vote on Thursday would send it to President Barack Obama for his signature.

The Senate rejected an amendment by Tom Coburn, R-Okla., that was aimed at shifting money within the National Park Service to try to make sure the White House remained open to tours. But even if approved, the amendment would appear to fail to accomplish its goal since the reason for closing the White House tours was a budget cut for the Secret Service, not the Park Service.

Sens. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Roy Blunt, R-Mo., won voice vote approval of another amendment — eagerly sought by the meatpacking and poultry industries — that would offer them relief from food inspector furloughs that threaten to intermittently shutter plants.

The overall measure would fund the day-to-day operating budgets of every Cabinet agency through Sept. 30, provide an additional $87 billion to fund overseas military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and maintain a pay freeze for federal workers.

The measure gives the Pentagon much-sought relief from a cash crunch in accounts for training and readiness, gives veteran health programs their scheduled increases and sets the detailed, line-by-line budgets for agencies such as Commerce, NASA, Agriculture and Justice.

The measure leaves in place automatic budget cuts of 5 percent to domestic agencies and 8 percent to the Pentagon. The cuts have largely been unnoticed by the public but are making lawmakers uncomfortable, especially as intermittent layoffs known as furloughs begin to take effects next month.

The fear of those furloughs compromising safety at 173 airports slated to lose their air traffic controllers led Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., to seek to restore funding to prevent the layoffs. He was denied an attempt to amend the measure, which led him to drag out debate. But Moran relented rather than to deny other senators from winning votes on amendments.

Story continues

Democrats have generally resisted efforts to fix the automatic cuts on an ad hoc basis, arguing that the so-called sequester needs to be replaced in its entirety as part of a broader budget deal.

The developments in the Senate come as the House resumed debate on the budget for next year and beyond. Republicans are pushing a plan that promises sharp cuts to federal health care programs and domestic agency operating budgets as the price for balancing the budget in a decade. That plan, by Budget Committee chairman and failed GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, also contains a hotly contested provision calling for transformation of Medicare for beneficiaries born in 1959 and after into a program that subsidizes health insurance premiums instead of directly paying hospital and doctor bills.

The House was set to consider a set of alternative budgets from the left and right on Wednesday before voting on the GOP plan on Thursday. The Senate was expected to begin debate of the budget Wednesday in hopes of a vote on Friday."

It has been four long winters since the federal government, in the hulking, shaven-skulled, Alien Nation-esque form of then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, committed $700 billion in taxpayer money to rescue Wall Street from its own chicanery and greed. To listen to the bankers and their allies in Washington tell it, you'd think the bailout was the best thing to hit the American economy since the invention of the assembly line. Not only did it prevent another Great Depression, we've been told, but the money has all been paid back, and the government even made a profit. No harm, no foul – right?

Wrong.

It was all a lie – one of the biggest and most elaborate falsehoods ever sold to the American people. We were told that the taxpayer was stepping in – only temporarily, mind you – to prop up the economy and save the world from financial catastrophe. What we actually ended up doing was the exact opposite: committing American taxpayers to permanent, blind support of an ungovernable, unregulatable, hyperconcentrated new financial system that exacerbates the greed and inequality that caused the crash, and forces Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to increase risk rather than reduce it. The result is one of those deals where one wrong decision early on blossoms into a lush nightmare of unintended consequences. We thought we were just letting a friend crash at the house for a few days; we ended up with a family of hillbillies who moved in forever, sleeping nine to a bed and building a meth lab on the front lawn.

How Wall Street Killed Financial Reform

But the most appalling part is the lying. The public has been lied to so shamelessly and so often in the course of the past four years that the failure to tell the truth to the general populace has become a kind of baked-in, official feature of the financial rescue...

...

...The bailout deceptions came early, late and in between. There were lies told in the first moments of their inception, and others still being told four years later. The lies, in fact, were the most important mechanisms of the bailout…

…

…So what exactly did the bailout accomplish? It built a banking system that discriminates against community banks, makes Too Big to Fail banks even Too Bigger to Failier, increases risk, discourages sound business lending and punishes savings by making it even easier and more profitable to chase high-yield investments than to compete for small depositors. The bailout has also made lying on behalf of our biggest and most corrupt banks the official policy of the United States government. And if any one of those banks fails, it will cause another financial crisis, meaning we're essentially wedded to that policy for the rest of eternity – or at least until the markets call our bluff, which could happen any minute now.

Other than that, the bailout was a smashing success."

As states and cities wrestle with mounting pension woes, some even seeking refuge in bankruptcy, Washington has mostly stayed on the sidelines.

By law, the 50 states are sovereigns, so even though federal officials have regulated company pension plans for decades, they have had little interest in telling the states how to run theirs.

Now, one United States senator wants to change that. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has devised a way for states and cities to exit the pension business while still giving public workers the type of benefits they want. It involves a tax-law change that would enable governments to turn their pension plans over to life insurers.

Big players like MetLife and Prudential, to cite just two, might thus step into shoes now occupied by the likes of Calpers, California’s giant state pension system. Any such change would be voluntary, said Mr. Hatch, who plans to introduce enabling legislation on Tuesday. He and the Finance Committee’s Democratic chairman, Max Baucus of Montana, are committed to working on a tax overhaul package this year, and the public-pension change could be one part of that.

“America cannot continue sleepwalking into the financial disaster that awaits us if we do not get the public-pension debt crisis under control,” Mr. Hatch said. “The problem is getting more serious every day.”

Working with insurers would not suddenly make trillions of dollars appear, but Mr. Hatch said it would make costs more predictable and protect both retirees and taxpayers. The proposal “does not include an explicit or implicit government guarantee,” he said.

Aides said emphatically that insurers did not come up with this idea and talk the senator into promoting it. Mr. Hatch has been concerned about public pensions for some time, having issued his own study of their problems early last year. His report stated, among other things, that state pensions were a valid issue for federal lawmakers because of the likelihood that Washington would be called upon to bail one out at some point. Specialists working for the finance committee’s Republicans devised the insurance arrangement after extensive discussions with public-pension stakeholders, particularly unions that represent public workers.

In those talks, a committee staff member said, union officials were adamant about holding onto their members’ defined-benefit pensions, the type where workers receive a stream of predetermined monthly payments from retirement to death. In corporate America, many companies have been discontinuing such pension plans, not wanting to bear the investment risk they pose, especially as the population ages. Companies often give their workers 401(k) plans as a replacement, passing the investment risk to them.

Police unions in particular — an important constituency for Republicans — said their workers would not accept anything like that.

That is what prompted finance committee staff members to think about insurance companies. They, too, provide lifelong income to their customers — they just don’t call it a pension; they call it an annuity. Annuities can be devised in any number of ways, including precisely duplicating the terms of a worker’s pension. Senator Hatch’s staff eventually decided that shifting the states’ pension business to insurers was the only way to continue providing the monthly checks that public retirees want without forcing local taxpayers to come up with more money every time the stock market plunges. Life insurers would bear the investment risk, shielding both retirees and taxpayers.

Life insurers can also lose money over soured investments. But the states, which regulate insurance, have guarantee programs to protect policyholders in such cases. No backstop like that exists for public pensions, which is why benefits for older retirees in places like Prichard, Ala., and Central Falls, R.I., have been cut sharply after their municipal pension funds ran out of money.

Perhaps more important, state insurance regulators provide a kind of oversight unknown in the world of public pensions. They require insurance companies to meet capital requirements, taking into account the riskiness of their investments. Insurers are also required to hold more assets than they estimate they will need, and if they burn through their surpluses, state regulators can close them down.

Public pensions, by contrast, have no capital requirements and can make themselves look stronger by taking on more risk.

If Senator Hatch’s proposal were to become law, a local government that opted for insurance would hold competitive bidding once a year. The winning carrier would give each worker a contract, guaranteeing a retirement-to-death annuity amount for a year’s worth of work. Public employees’ unions would no longer negotiate the size of their members’ pensions; instead, they would negotiate how much the local employer would pay the insurer upfront. The annuity contracts would be portable, meaning workers would take theirs with them when they changed jobs.

This way, a worker retiring at the end of a 40-year career would have 40 annuity contracts, each representing the retirement income earned from a year’s work. An aide to Senator Hatch said an administrative body would have to be created to combine the contracts and issue a single check so the retiree would not receive 40 of them every month. But it would be not be a federal entity. The measure does not expand federal powers or impair states’ rights.

The real change would be in the federal tax code. The money that local governments set aside in public pension funds now clearly receives preferential tax treatment; money that it might pay an insurer does not. If a city or a state tried it, the Internal Revenue Service could say the money constituted income for the workers and require them to pay taxes on it.

If the bill became law, it would give the same tax preference to insurance premiums.

Insurers and their trade associations have already sent letters telling Senator Hatch they support his goals and will work with him on the legislative proposal. So has the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the trade association that represents the state guarantee systems. The biggest opposition is likely to come from public pension systems themselves. They now rely on contributions from workers to help close shortfalls and would lose some of that every time a local government shifted its business to the insurance industry. As envisioned by Senator Hatch, the annuity premiums would be paid solely by public employers; no employee contributions would be allowed."

Peters', 'Jonathan Weisman']",2 Parties’ Budgets Show Big Rift,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats and House Republicans on Tuesday outlined vastly divergent approaches to shoring up the government’s finances, a reminder of how far apart they remain on fiscal policy even as both sides insist publicly that a bipartisan compromise is possible.

As part of the effort to find common ground, President Obama made a rare appearance at a gathering of Democratic senators — his first of four meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week — to explore ways that the two parties could overcome differences that have deadlocked the budget process for much of the last five years.

But in many ways, the two parties seemed to be working in parallel universes.

House Republicans, led by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, presented a tax and spending plan that relies on many of the same policies that became lightning rods for critics during the 2012 presidential campaign, when Mr. Ryan was the party’s vice-presidential nominee. At the White House, a senior administration official said that the Republican budget demonstrated how complicated negotiations would be.

The Republican plan sets out to balance the budget in a decade and would cut spending by $4.6 trillion through 2023, in large part by rolling back many of Mr. Obama’s signature legislative accomplishments. It would repeal the health care overhaul of 2009, eliminate the subsidized insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion that make up the core of the law, and turn Medicare into a system of private insurance plans financed by federal vouchers."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/22/americas-richest-states_n_3972653.html,2013-09-22 00:00:00,['Wall St.'],The 10 Richest States In America: 24/7 Wall St.,"Last year, household income remained effectively unchanged, according to data released this week by the U.S. Census Bureau. This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012.

“The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year” said Economic Policy Institute’s Elise Gould. “We’re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.”

While the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 — nearly half that of Maryland’s.

Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. “We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don’t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.”

States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did.

Employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state’s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.

Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state’s household income. “When we’re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it’s about jobs.” Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.

Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.

The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.

At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed.

“There’s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,” Danziger said. “Even when manufacturers haven’t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.”

To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2012, as well as 2012 ACS data on health insurance coverage, employment and poverty.

Here are America's richest states, according to 24/7 Wall St.

And as I wrote last week, the Congressional Budget Office expects deficit reduction to lop off 1.5 percent of GDP growth in 2013; if those measures were not in place, we would be looking at 3 percent growth for the coming year, the amount we need to achieve a strong recovery."

Spends More on Disability than Food Stamps, Welfare Combined","In an eye-opening six-month investigation into America’s disability program, Planet Money reporter Chana Joffe-Walt uncovered a “disability industrial complex” fraught with fraud that churns out 14 million checks every month to citizens the government has deemed disabled.

“Since the economy began its slow, slow recovery in late 2009, we’ve been averaging about 150,000 jobs created per month,” said Joffe-Walt in an Public Radio International (PRI) “This American Life” interview. “In that same period every month, almost 250,000 people have been applying for disability.”

Among Joffe-Walt’s findings are the following facts:

The federal government spends more money each year on cash payments for disabled former workers than it does on food stamps and welfare combined; America’s two largest disability programs, including health care for disabled workers, costs taxpayers $260 billion a year

In some parts of the country, such as Hale County, Alabama, one out of every four working-age adults collects a disability check

As of 2011, 33.8% of newly diagnosed disabled workers cited “back pain and other musculoskeletal problems” as their reason for being unable to work. In 1961, the top reason for being disabled was “heart disease, stroke”

Disabled workers do not get counted in the unemployment figures. If they did, the numbers would be far higher

Less than 1% of people who went on disability at the beginning of 2011 have returned to the workforce

The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program–which covers kids and adults–has exploded. SSI is now seven times larger than it was 30 years ago.

The report suggests that the much-touted Welfare to Work policies of the 1990s that appeared to successfully move welfare recipients off the public dole may have been a mirage. States have figured out that shifting people from welfare to disability frees up substantial funds, as states have to pay the costs of welfare, but the federal government picks up the tab for disability.

“That’s a kind of ugly secret of the American labor market,” said MIT economist David Autor. “Part of the reason our unemployment rates have been low, until recently, is that a lot of people who would have trouble finding jobs are on a different program.”

Joffe-Walt says disability has “become a de facto welfare program for people without a lot of education or job skills.” The reporter notes that the disability program “wasn’t supposed to serve this purpose; it’s not a retraining program designed to get people back onto their feet.”

According to Social Security chief actuary Steve Goss, disability insurance program reserves will run out of money in 2016."
http://news.yahoo.com/landmark-moment-making-judge-rule-detroit-bankruptcy-231938038--sector.html,,[],Landmark moment in making: judge to rule on Detroit bankruptcy,"By Joseph Lichterman DETROIT (Reuters) - The largest-ever municipal bankruptcy petition in U.S. history faces a watershed moment on Tuesday, as the judge overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy case is scheduled to rule whether the city is eligible for protection from creditors - an event that has citizens, public officials, creditors, retirees and others awaiting the judge's words and preparing responses. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes has scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. EST on Tuesday to announce his decision, which will be followed by the release of a written opinion. Rhodes' ruling will begin a new chapter in the case that first arrived in federal court with Detroit's July 18 bankruptcy petition. [ID:nL1N0FU01E] If Rhodes rules Detroit is eligible for bankruptcy, which most experts expect, the city will begin working toward its next major move, the submission of a plan to readjust its more than $18 billion in debt. No matter how Rhodes rules, the case could drag on through a possibly lengthy appeals process that could delay the city's plan to submit its plan of readjustment by the end of the month. The city's largest union has asked Rhodes to allow any appeal to proceed directly to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, bypassing the U.S. District Court in Detroit. ""There are bankruptcy judges who are known to sometimes take the easier way out and to try and get the people to resolve it rather than make the hard decisions,"" said attorney Chuck Tatelbaum, who has been involved in the financial restructuring of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and who has previously practiced in front of Rhodes. ""He's not one of those. He'll do what's right, but he's not afraid to take the time to make that hard decision that's then going to be reviewed under a microscope by an appellate court,"" said Tatelbaum, who is not involved in the Detroit case. Detroit is burdened by $18.5 billion in debt as it struggles to provide even the most basic services to the city's 700,000 residents. About 40 percent of the city's streetlights do not work and about 78,000 abandoned buildings litter the city, whose population peaked at 1.8 million in 1950. In order to meet federal eligibility requirements, Detroit must prove that it is insolvent, it was authorized to file for bankruptcy and that it negotiated with creditors in good faith or that negotiations were impractical. AUCTIONING ARTWORKS? City unions, retirees and pension funds objected in court to Detroit's filing, contending during a nine-day trial in November that Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr did not negotiate in good faith and drove the city into bankruptcy court instead. Orr, a former bankruptcy lawyer, was appointed in March by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican. Opponents also argue that Michigan's constitution protects pensions from being slashed and that the city has other assets it can sell to pay down its debts, including the works of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Orr has brought in auction house Christie's to place a value on some pieces in the museum's collection. In June, Orr put forward an initial proposal on how Detroit should deal with its $18.5 billion in debt and liabilities that offered unsecured creditors only pennies on the dollar to settle their claims. Orr raised eyebrows by declaring that holders of most of Detroit's general obligation bonds would be treated as unsecured creditors who would be part of a group that would receive pro-rata shares of $2 billion in notes to settle their $11.5 billion in claims. Detroit says about half its liabilities stem from retiree benefits, with $5.7 billion in liabilities relating to retiree healthcare and another $3.5 billion from pensions. Likely cuts to retiree pensions and changes in healthcare benefits have been at the heart of the objections from the city's unions, pension funds and retirees. Orr drew pointed questions from Rhodes over possible cuts during his time on the witness stand in the eligibility trial last month. ""Everybody is hanging on the edge of the cliff waiting to see what the announcement is ... and to me it kind of seems like the train left the station,"" said Brendan Milewski, a 34-year-old retired Detroit firefighter who was paralyzed in 2010 while battling a fire. ""The state and the EM have had a lot of time to steer the course and plot the direction they're going in."" In some respects the Detroit Institute of Arts has become symbolic of the costs of allowing Detroit to fall into bankruptcy. Last week, a group of the largest creditors asked Rhodes to order an independent valuation of the museum's 66,000-piece collection. One of the city's most prized cultural assets, the museum includes paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Henri Matisse, an original cast of Auguste Rodin's ""The Thinker,"" and a fresco mural by Mexican artist Diego Rivera. Christie's has not yet issued its valuation of the museum's collection. Bill Nowling, Orr's spokesman, said in an email last week that the city disagrees with the creditors' filing, but the move helps ""illustrate the lengths they are willing to go to ensure they receive payment.""

Delivered on one of the year’s busiest online shopping days, the court’s decision is expected to accelerate the move by states to try to capture the taxes due on online purchases made by their residents.

The court’s refusal to take up the issue also increases pressure on Congress to settle the long-standing dispute between online and conventional bricks-and-mortar retailers and to enact legislation standardizing online sales tax collection.

“We have a patchwork of out-of-date laws,” said David C. Blum, a Chicago tax attorney uninvolved in the case but who has represented online retailers. “They may have made sense in the era before the Internet, but not now.”

The pioneering New York statute has become a model for efforts by California and other states to capture tax revenue. Today, 34 states by law or administrative process require at least major online retailers to collect sales taxes.

States said they lose more than $23 billion a year in revenue when people buy products online and fail to pay the required sales tax. Conventional retailers complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage because they must collect those taxes on each sale.

Some states have been passing laws that stretch their ability to force online retailers to collect sales taxes. The pressure of those laws helped California and Texas strike deals with major Internet retailers such as Amazon to collect sales taxes so they could locate distribution centers and other facilities there.

New York’s 2008 statute requires out-of-state Internet retailers to collect sales taxes if they used affiliates in the state to direct business to their websites, such as a museum website that directed people to Amazon to buy books.

The law treated these Web affiliates as though they were a sales force within the state. The U.S. Constitution always has allowed states to collect taxes from out-of-state companies if they have employees or offices — a nexus — physically located within a state.

Amazon and Overstock.com Inc. appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the New York law was unconstitutional.

The companies cited a 1992 Supreme Court decision involving mail-order catalogs. In that case, the court said states could collect sales taxes from retailers only when they have a physical presence in the state.

Lawyers for Amazon and Overstock had argued that their dealings with other Web affiliates in New York did not constitute having a physical presence there. Citing similar laws in California, Connecticut, Illinois and North Carolina, the companies also said the New York law has “provided a road map for other state legislatures to enact similarly burdensome legislation.”

In Monday’s brief order, the high court turned down the appeals of Amazon and Overstock without comment, a decision that has the effect of upholding New York’s law.

“Bricks-and-mortar [stores] won,” said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Assn. “The court has decided that states have the right to pass what New York passed.”

But even if the New York law had been overturned, California’s statute would have remained largely in force, experts said.

Like New York, California established nexus for making out-of-state retailers collect sales taxes. But California also created a basis for sales tax collection if a company had even a minor physical presence in the state.

Amazon, based in Seattle, not only has affiliates in California, but operates a research facility for its Kindle e-reader and has a subsidiary, the Independent Movie Database, located in the Golden State.

Since passage of California’s law in 2011, Amazon’s physical presence in California has ballooned as part of an agreement the company made with Gov. Jerry Brown. Amazon now operates three giant distribution centers — in San Bernardino, Tracy and Patterson — and probably will open more facilities as it moves toward same-day delivery service statewide.

California tax collectors recently reported that the new law generated $263.4 million in new revenue for the state treasury and local governments for the fiscal year ended June 30.

Retailers and state officials now are expected to ramp up efforts to get Congress to adopt a nationwide rule for online sales taxes. The National Conference of State Legislatures said it would send about 200 legislators, in town for an annual forum, to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to lobby for legislation.

Because it has the power to regulate interstate commerce, Congress can pass a law that allows states to force all retailers to collect sales taxes for purchases made by state residents.

“This decision further illustrates why a national solution is needed to level the playing field for local bricks-and-mortar retailers and help them compete more effectively against out-of-state Internet sellers,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).

Durbin is a leading sponsor of the Marketplace Fairness Act, which gives states the authority to require larger online retailers with no physical presence in those states to collect sales taxes on its residents’ purchases.

The Senate approved the bill on a bipartisan 69-27 vote in May. But the legislation has been stalled in the House, where Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) wants to make changes.

Advertisement

In September, Goodlatte issued seven principles for such legislation, including that compliance with sales tax laws should be simple and not favor one type of retailer over another.

Some anti-tax groups have opposed the Senate legislation, arguing it was a de facto tax increase because it would cause many people to pay more in taxes. Consumers are required to pay sales taxes to their state for all their online purchases, but only about 1% do so.

Brandon Arnold, vice president of government affairs at the National Taxpayers Union, called the Supreme Court decision “Cyber Monday’s Worst Deal.”

The National Retail Federation, which represents online and conventional retailers, said it was time for a more comprehensive solution.

“As we see the growth in Internet sales every year, there’s more of a need to figure out a way for these taxes to be collected by the retailer, but in a way that’s not too burdensome,” said Rachelle Bernstein, the trade group’s vice president and tax counsel. “I think that’s what Congress is working on and that’s what’s still needed.”

Amazon also supports a national approach and has backed the Senate bill because it “would protect states’ rights to make their own revenue policy choices while allowing them to collect more than a fraction of the revenue that’s already owed,” said Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman.

He Previously Covered State', 'National Politics', 'Including The Presidential Campaign.', 'David Zahniser Covers Los Angeles City Hall For The Los Angeles Times.']",Mayor Eric Garcetti faces early test over proposed DWP deal,"Less than a month after taking office, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is facing a major test of his power: A union leader who ran a brutal campaign against him in the May election is trying to line up City Council support for a new salary agreement for Department of Water and Power workers.

The high-stakes political drama has been building for weeks in private conversations and closed-door meetings at City Hall. It has prompted Garcetti to risk an early and potentially ugly public fight with a powerful critic, DWP union leader Brian D’Arcy.

Advertisement

The proposed labor agreement also raises the possibility of a struggle between Garcetti and Council President Herb Wesson, who has been pushing for a quick deal with the DWP union, Local 18 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

The ultimate terms of the contract will affect future rates that Los Angeles businesses and nearly 4 million residents pay for water and power.

On Thursday evening, Garcetti spokesman Yusef Robb declined to confirm the deal’s terms, but denounced it. “It’s not good enough. Period,” he said. “Mayor Garcetti was elected with a clear mandate to bring real reform to the DWP, and that includes pensions, healthcare and salaries.”

Under the deal, outlined in a memo obtained by The Times, more than 8,200 DWP employees would forgo a scheduled raise of 2% to 4% that is supposed to take effect Oct. 1. They would also get no raises the following two years. In 2016, they would get a pay hike of up to 4%.

Advertisement

The proposed agreement also includes reduced retirement benefits for newly hired employees. They would be required to contribute 3% of their salary toward health coverage after they retire — up from zero for current employees. Talks on the deal began months ago, when Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was still in office. The memo, written by City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana and DWP General Manager Ron Nichols, says the deal would save the public $6 billion over 30 years. Wesson and D’Arcy both declined to comment Thursday.

The deal includes a settlement of a 2010 lawsuit filed against the city by union representatives on the DWP’s pension board. The suit alleges that the city improperly forced the utility to absorb at least $183 million in retirement costs when it shifted hundreds of workers onto the DWP payroll to help balance the general government budget that pays for police and other basic services.

On Tuesday, Garcetti, Wesson and the rest of the city’s labor negotiating committee held a private meeting at City Hall on both the lawsuit and the proposed DWP contract. Immediately afterward, union leader D’Arcy and Santana attended a closed-door, courthouse settlement conference on the lawsuit with a judge.

Garcetti’s spokesman said late Thursday that the city should continue fighting the case. “The lawsuit is without merit and is not a factor in the mayor’s decision-making,” Robb said.

Advertisement

In his campaign, Garcetti vowed to stand up for ratepayers and be an independent check on the DWP union. The labor group and its affiliates spent $2 million portraying Garcetti as “living large” at taxpayer expense, and promoting his opponent, Wendy Greuel. A central thrust of Garcetti’s campaign was that his rival would reward the DWP union by burdening ratepayers with rich labor contracts.

The union’s current contract expires in the fall of 2014. On Friday, Garcetti, Wesson and the three other members on the city’s Executive Employee Relations Committee are scheduled to meet privately to discuss the new contract proposal.

Advertisement

In remarks to reporters Wednesday, Garcetti stressed pay and benefit costs for the city workforce must be controlled.

“While we’ve backed away from the cliff, the cliff isn’t out of sight,” he said. “And it’s going to be very important to me that we hold down those raises, pensions and healthcare costs that in the past have driven expenses in this city. I said that during the campaign. I will continue to do that at the negotiating table as mayor.”

Advertisement

A close ally of the DWP union, who declined to be identified by name because of the sensitivity of the labor talks, said the proposal on the table serves the city’s interests. “It’s the best deal they’ve cut with any union so far,” he said. “This is a good deal for the city.”

That’s not much of a good-faith effort. Though Mr. Obama expressed approval that “cooler heads” were prevailing in the House, according to his press secretary, Jay Carney, he also made it clear that the offer needs to include an end to the shutdown.

Postponing default by raising the debt ceiling for five or six weeks offers only momentary relief, and refusing to do so would have been unthinkable. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday that the public’s retirement savings and benefits were at serious risk if Republicans left the debt ceiling unchanged. Business leaders — the traditional constituency of the Republicans until the Tea Party muscled them out of the way — have been pressuring leaders to change course.

A default would roil the global bond market, push up interest rates, and almost certainly produce another recession. Although Mr. Boehner grandly pronounced the six-week delay to be a major concession, the same danger will stare Congress in the face before Thanksgiving."

@DRUDGE Speaker Pelosi Part 2: Opening Jan 5. 2015

Rush Limbaugh:

Rush Limbaugh on Wednesday blasted the Republican Party as “irrelevant” and responsible for “creating one of the greatest political disasters” he’s ever seen. “I was trying to think earlier today, if ever in my life I could remember any major political party being so irrelevant,” the conservative radio host said on his show, according to a transcript. “I have never seen it. I have never seen a major political party simply occupy placeholders, as the Republican Party is doing.” Rush says the party still refuses to offer ""serious opposition"" to Obama, again claiming that this is because Obama is black.

Rush says the party still refuses to offer ""serious opposition"" to Obama, again claiming that this is because Obama is black. Hardliner and actual CNN contributor Erick Erickson, or maybe he's not there anymore because who the hell watches CNN these days:

I am tired of funding Republicans who campaign against Obamacare then refuse to fight. It’s time to find a new batch of Republicans to actually practice what the current crop preaches.

The Tea Party Nation is very, very sad:

Barack Obama demanded unconditional surrender from the Republican Party. He pretty much got it. […] In short, the GOP got nothing from their fight. But then again, McConnell, Boehner and the GOP establishment never tried.

As are a great many of the arsonists themselves, lighters still in hand:



@CongHuelskamp Must be kidding. After 15 days and no proposal by Obama or Reid, GOP leadership may pass Democratic deal for them? http://t.co/...

FreedomWorks and Club For Growth are frothing and foaming.



@philipaklein FreedomWorks: ""The line separating the Democrats and the Republican establishment is fading- it might have disappeared today.""

But House conservatives like Raul Labrador know what the real problem with their plan was. It's the fault of that damn meddling media for saying House Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare instead of calmly explaining that the Republicans merely wanted to reasonably exchange defunding or delaying the law in exchange for allowing the federal government to continue to function. Stop painting us as unreasonable!

""We never asked for a full repeal of Obamacare because we can't get that,"" he said. ""We have voted on a full repeal of Obamacare that the Senate has rejected every single time. But what we were asking for, our position from the beginning, was exchanging a one-year CR for a one-year delay of Obamacare. That was something we thought both sides were giving on something.""

John Boehner may have decided that he'd rather not plunge the United States into default quite just yet, but the true believers? They're mad. Really, really mad. A roundup of arsonist reactions:

Much more, below the fold.

What’s the impact?,"Much of the federal government will shut down as of midnight. What will be closing, why and what impact will it have?

Question: Why a shutdown?

Answer: Every year, Congress has to approve laws, known as appropriations, that provide money for federal agencies. The new budget year begins on Oct. 1, and Congress has failed to pass a single one of the appropriations. An effort to pass a stop-gap bill to provide temporary money has stalled in Congress: Republicans have insisted they will not approve the stop-gap measure unless Democrats agree to block money for President Obama’s healthcare law, and Democrats have refused to do that. Under federal law, if an agency does not have an appropriation law in force, it can’t spend money, so it has to close.

Q: Do all government programs stop?

Advertisement

A: No. There are three big categories that don’t. Some programs don’t require annual appropriations. That group, which includes Social Security, Medicare and other so-called entitlements, continue without interruption. The second group entails functions “necessary to protect life or property.” Law enforcement, the military, intelligence agencies and foreign embassies all will stay open. Finally, some programs have other sources of money that will allow them to function for a while. Courts, for example, can spend money they have collected through fines and fees, funds that would allow them to keep functioning for a while.

Q: What are some examples of government offices that will close?

A: The national parks, federally owned museums, such as the Smithsonian, offices overseas that give visas to foreigners hoping to visit the United States, many federal regulatory agencies, IRS call centers that provide assistance to taxpayers and most offices that handle federal grants and contracts will all close.

FULL COVERAGE: First government shutdown in 17 years



Q: What happens to federal workers?

A: At least 800,000 federal civilian workers will be furloughed. They will not be paid during the shutdown.

Q: Will workers get back pay once the shutdown ends?

A: The last time this happened, during the Clinton administration, Congress approved retroactive pay. There’s no guarantee, however.

Advertisement

Q: What impact will all this have on the economy?

A: A lot depends on how long a shutdown lasts. If the duration is only a few days, the economic impact will be small. But the impact builds with time. The tourism industry will be among the first hit because of the closure of parks and the inability of foreign tourists to get visas.

Q: Why hasn’t Congress passed its appropriations bills on time?

A: Passing money bills has been difficult for years because of disputes between the two parties about how much to spend. This year, the problem got a lot worse after House Republicans passed a budget plan that called for deep cuts in spending. When the time came to translate those overall spending numbers into specific appropriations bills, the bills failed because many Republicans decided the spending levels were too low.

What shuts down in a government shutdown

Q: How long will a shutdown last?

A: Both Republicans and Democrats will be watching to see which side gets blamed for the impasse. Whichever side is losing the battle for public opinion will eventually decide the price has gotten too high and will offer concessions. In the Clinton administration, there were two government shutdowns. One lasted five days, the other, which affected only part of the government, went on for three weeks.

Those are two of the reasons why President Obama’s job approval remains below 50 percent -- and hits a new low among independents.

Just 25 percent of independents approve of the job the president is doing, down from 31 percent last month.

Independents were essential to Obama’s 2008 victory when 52 percent backed him. That support dropped to 45 percent in the 2012 election (Fox News exit poll). In fact, Republican Mitt Romney topped Obama by garnering 50 percent among independents.

Overall, 46 percent of voters approve of Obama’s job performance, while 47 percent disapprove. That’s a slight improvement from last month when headlines trumpeted the IRS targeting of conservative groups, the NSA spying on Americans and the Justice Department monitoring journalists. At that time 43 percent approved and 51 percent disapproved (June 22-24).

The new poll also finds most voters -- 63 percent -- are dissatisfied with how things are going in the country, while about one-third are satisfied (35 percent). These views are mostly unchanged since January. However, dissatisfaction has gone up 10 percentage points since just before the presidential election. In January of 2009, in the final days of the George W. Bush administration, 79 percent felt dissatisfied.

It continues to be a summer of discontent with Congress: 18 percent of voters approve of the job lawmakers are doing, while 74 percent disapprove. Last month 15 percent approved and 77 percent disapproved (June 22-24). Approval of Congress hit a record-low 10 percent in August 2011.

Voters split over whether Obama and his team have helped the economy: 43 percent think the administration has made it better, while 44 percent say it’s made it worse. That’s an improvement from a year ago when 37 percent said the White House had made the economy better and 49 percent said worse (July 2012).

A 57-percent majority says they don’t see any signs the economy has started to turn the corner, while 38 percent say they feel the worst is over. Those views are little changed from a year ago.

The poll does find patches of optimism: By a two-to-one margin voters are more likely to say the housing market is getting better than worse (56 percent vs. 28 percent). And by a five percentage-point margin, more voters think the nation’s job situation is getting better than getting worse (44-39 percent).

Democrats are three times as likely as Republicans to be happy with the way things are going in the country, twice as likely to think the economy has turned the corner, and more than twice as likely to think the job situation has improved. Majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans agree the housing market is getting better.

Poll Pourri

Though Barack Obama’s job rating remains underwater, his personal favorability rating stands at 50 percent, up from a record low 47 percent last month. That means the president has a few more fans than Pope Francis, who has a 46 percent favorable rating. That said, nearly six times as many people have an unfavorable view of Obama (46 percent) as the pope (8 percent). Nearly half of voters have no opinion of Pope Francis (19 percent “can’t say” and 26 percent say they’ve never heard of him).

Recently CBS’s Bob Schieffer said in his weekly commentary that while he still thinks the United States is the greatest country in the world, he’s concerned the country doesn’t have the reputation it once had. Voters agree: 79 percent say the U.S. is the greatest country in the world, and 82 percent think the country is losing some of its standing. Most Republicans (83 percent) and Democrats (78 percent) feel the United States is the greatest country in the world. On the other hand, by a 19 percentage-point margin, Republicans (91 percent) are more likely than Democrats (72 percent) to think America isn’t the model that it once was.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,017 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from July 21 to July 23.

Having failed to persuade their traditional Republican allies in Congress to avert a government shutdown, business leaders fear bigger problems ahead, and they're taking sides with a Democratic president whose health care and regulatory agenda they have vigorously opposed. President Barack Obama is embracing the business outreach, eager to employ groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Wall Street CEOs to portray House Republicans as out of touch even with their long-established corporate and financial patrons. snip On Wednesday, Obama is hosting chief executives from the nation's 19 biggest financial firms. Moreover, the Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to Congress signed by about 250 business groups urging no shutdown and warning against a debt ceiling crisis that they say could lead to an economically disastrous default. snip The letter circulated by the Chamber of Commerce urges lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling ""in a timely manner and remove any threat to the full faith and credit of the United States government."" snip Concerned, the Chamber of Commerce is preparing to participate in political primaries, protecting friendly lawmakers from conservative challengers. ""Clearly we're getting to a point where we need a Congress that's going to be productive, proactive and create a stable environment for economic growth and job creation,"" said Scott Reed, a Republican political consultant who is advising the chamber on its strategy.

The Koch Brothers do not really represent the one thousanth of one percent who have real economic power. Many of them are at risk from the destruction of the world economy and a debt default will hurt them. Thing are going well for the ultra-rich, and they are tied to the health of the system.

It will be interesting to see a civil war among the Titans of Big Capital.

Granted, they created the Frankenstein monster, but all the more reason for them to deal with it. Money still talks in Republican circles and it will be interesting to watch this war. Tea Party and Kochs vrs. Big Capital.

An interesting anti-Fascist coalition including Labor and Big Capital. It won't last, and should not since class struggle still continues, but it could put down the Tea Party.

Meanwhile, the Republican War on the United States of America continues."

Accuses Illinois of Securities Fraud,"“Public pension disclosure by municipal issuers continues to be a top priority,” said Elaine C. Greenberg, chief of the S.E.C.’s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, which was formed in 2010.

Its first action against a state accused New Jersey of fraud that year in connection with pension disclosures that said a special reserve had been set up to pay for pension increases. The reserve was an accounting illusion, The New York Times had previously reported.

In that case, as with Illinois, the S.E.C. has cited the harm done to the investors who bought the governments’ bonds — not the retirees whose pensions were at risk, or the taxpayers who found themselves expected to make outlays they never agreed to. The S.E.C.’s mission is to uphold the integrity of the capital markets, not to protect retirees or promote balanced budgets.

“Municipal investors are no less entitled to truthful risk disclosures than other investors,” George S. Canellos, acting director of the S.E.C.’s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement. “Time after time, Illinois failed to inform its bond investors about the risk to its financial condition posed by the structural underfunding of its pension system.”

The S.E.C. noted that Illinois had passed a law in 1994 allowing itself to put less than the required amount into its pension system each year. It is not the only state to have done so. For the next 15 years, Illinois issued annual reports showing that it was on track with its lawful schedule, even as it fell further behind the real-world amount needed to pay all current and retired public employees.

By 2003, the state was so far behind that it issued $10 billion of bonds and put the proceeds into its pension funds to make them look flush. The main underwriter of those bonds, Bear Stearns, was later found to have made an improper payment to win the business, figuring in the corruption trial of a former governor, Rod R. Blagojevich.

In 2005, the state passed another law, giving itself a holiday from making even the inadequate annual pension contributions called for by its 1994 schedule. It said it would offset the missing money with bigger contributions from 2008 to 2010, but then did not do so. By 2010, the reported shortfall of the pension system was $57 billion, and senior officials were warning that the system was at risk of breaking down completely."

President Barack Obama is doing it, by parting with 5 percent of his salary, for the time being.

So, is this ""moving the needle"" and helping to bring both sides ""back to the table""? I'll let the Republican National Committee answer that question for me:

Does @BarackObama actually think giving $20,000 of his salary back to the Treasury will solve anything? #gop — GOP (@GOP) April 5, 2013

I tell you, what a shock.

Look, this salary-reduction strategy is just a stupid idea, all around. And it would be a stupid idea if Obama just gave back his entire salary. Which, by the way, he could do. It's not like he needs the money. In fact, the chances that the United States of America will ever elect a president who authentically needs a salary of any kind is approximately ""the null set"" for the foreseeable future.

And as Alex Pareene points out, the decision to part with a small portion of a salary really doesn't make any sense from a political standpoint: ""If you are trying to convince Republicans to reverse savage government spending cuts that they have all decided that they are fine with, and you are also someone Republicans hate, cutting your own salary seems like an odd negotiating strategy,"" Pareene writes.

Nevertheless, we know the impetus for this salary-giveback comes from being shouted at for months and months and months by Beltway Centrist Hacks, who honestly and authentically believe that Obama needs to make more magical gestures to secure a ""Grand Bargain.""

These pundits want the GOP to give on revenues, and they're even willing to admit that Republicans are being intransigent, but they believe that this is Obama's problem to solve, and that he must solve it with a series of powerful displays of sentimental force. Obama is trying to bridge the gap by offering up substantial cuts to earned benefit programs that would impoverish elderly Americans. Impoverishing elderly Americans is also something that the Centrist Hack set desires, rather badly, but they know that this is a deal Obama would rather not have to make. And that's a huge problem for them -- Obama should want to bargain away Medicare and Social Security, with a smile on his face and a song in his heart. And until he does that, he is not showing ""leadership.""

Naturally, I do not expect even this group of pundit nimrods to look with favor upon Obama's slight gesture of returning 5 percent of his salary. We can all agree that it is woefully insufficient as a means to move legislation of any kind. But it's better in one sense than anything else the ""Leadership Surrealists"" have come up with: actual money ends up in the U.S. Treasury.

Looks like we are back to having a series of really awesome steak dinners to secure a ""Grand Bargain"" that will likely screw most Americans in the short pants, I guess!

The GOP wants to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program so that more recipients must be working or in training to qualify for food stamps. ""Newscasts tell stories of young surfers who aren’t working, but cash their food stamps in for lobster,"" the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) has said in background documents explaining the proposals to reporters.

The newscasts in question are two Fox News stories about one 29-year-old California food stamp recipient who harbors no ambition to get a job.

“This is the way I want to live and I don’t really see anything changing,” the man said in the stories, copies of which Fox distributed to Capitol Hill offices. “It’s free food; it’s awesome.”

Just wanting a job wouldn't be awesome enough to satisfy Republicans' proposed rules, however. While merely seeking work fulfills a requirement of unemployment insurance, SNAP recipients would have to do better.

""If you’re looking for work but can’t find it, and you can’t find a place in a work or training program -- something only a few states make available to all of these individuals -- you will lose SNAP after three months,"" Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget Priorities said in a Wednesday blog post. The Center on Budget has been the foremost critic of the legislation outside of Congress.

Able-bodied adults without children would be eligible for only three months of benefits under the GOP plan unless they're working, training, or volunteering 20 hours per week -- a pre-existing requirement that most states have waived because of high unemployment. Republicans have cited Congressional Research Service data showing that able-bodied adults without dependents had risen to 10.2 percent of the overall SNAP population in 2011, up from 6.6 percent in 2007.

Overall SNAP enrollment surged to 47 million in 2012 because the Great Recession and its aftermath made more Americans poor enough to qualify. Republicans prefer to blame liberal policy for the increase, so their bill would take the waivers away.

Republicans also want states to be able to require working-age SNAP recipients with children older than one year to obey the work requirements outlined in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, meaning at least 20 hours per week at a job, volunteering, or participating in a state-run training or work-search program. But the legislation doesn't require states to make space available to SNAP recipients in such a program. Since it would allow states to keep half the savings from reduced enrollment, critics like Greenstein say the bill essentially pays states to kick people off food stamps.

Despite slacker stereotypes, the share of food stamp recipients who work has risen over time. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 30 percent of SNAP recipients worked in 2010, up from fewer than 20 percent in 1990. Most of the rest are either elderly, children, or disabled.

The CBO has estimated that the Republican legislation would result in 3.8 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps next year and would save $39 billion over 10 years. But House Republicans are unlikely to get their way -- even if the bill passes the House on Thursday afternoon, the Democratic Senate is unlikely to accept most of its provisions, and the White House has already threatened a veto.

Even without new legislation, all food stamp beneficiaries will see an across-the-board drop in the value of their benefits this November thanks to the expiration of a boost from the 2009 stimulus bill. Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) have introduced a long-shot bill to prevent the drop.

The surfer in the news reports, Jason Greenslate, did not respond to a request for comment on serving as the latest in a long line of examples of no-good food stamp recipients."

Thousands of federal employees are facing unpaid time off as agencies determine that they will have to furlough workers to absorb the cuts.

But other workers -- including some in the private sector -- are losing their jobs altogether, underscoring just how much daily life for many people is tied to a functioning government. Some examples:

On Monday, 250 workers at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state received pink slips, while another 2,500 others found out they're facing furloughs. Approximately 9,000 people work at the nation's most contaminated nuclear site, and the Associated Press reports that ""cleanup is likely to be slowed"" because of the budget cuts.

Continental Maritime, a contractor that repairs U.S. Navy ships, expects to lay off 185 employees, effective April 12. Other contractors have issued conditional layoff notices -- meaning that jobs are safe if Congress restores some funding to the Defense Department -- to thousands of employees.

Four-hundred eighteen contract workers tied to the Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania are losing their jobs due to sequestration. Two-hundred sixteen people will be dismissed on April 15 and 107 on April 30, the Morning Call of Allentown, Pa., reports. The paper noted that the Tobyhanna Army Depot is losing 35 percent -- $309 million -- of its government funding through the end of the fiscal year, and that more than 5,100 of the people who work there are being forced to take 22 furlough days.

At least eight municipal employees in Monterey County, Calif., are losing their jobs as a result of a decrease in the number of military contracts.

In early March, 23 people who work with the parks and recreation and maintenance departments in Tooele County, Utah, were laid off in order to grapple with the federal budget cuts. ""I have four kids. This is my livelihood,” said Scott Chance, a 12-year employee. ""It pays my health insurance. It gives me my house.""

Engineering Services Network is an engineering and technology company and one of the top Latino-owned companies in Virginia. President and CEO Raymond Lopez Jr. told NBC Latino that he has ""lost about 20 employees through sequestration.""

The Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas, announced in February that it was cutting 414 jobs -- about 10 percent of its workforce. ""I don't know how we're going to make it,"" Raymond Wyrick, whose last day was scheduled to be March 9, told CNN Money.

While people around the country deal with these furloughs, job losses and a reduction in government services like unemployment benefits and funding for domestic violence prevention, much of the debate in Washington continues to center around the fact that the White House is no longer offering tours and the Easter Egg Roll could be called off.

Congress is now working on a continuing resolution to keep the government running when the current funding runs out on March 27. It's expected to keep in place the $85 billion in sequestration cuts -- meaning workers may still face furloughs -- although federal agencies will likely get more flexibility in how to absorb those cuts.

"http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-harney-20130113,0,6931945.story",2013-01-13 08:00:00,[],Homeowners and sellers escape ‘fiscal cliff’ with key benefits,"WASHINGTON — Although it wasn’t a total win for homeowners and sellers, the patchwork legislation that emerged from the “fiscal cliff” fracas on Capitol Hill came pretty close. In fact, it even reached back and resuscitated two key tax benefits for housing that had expired more than a year ago. Now homeowners will be able to take deductions on their 2012 tax returns that they assumed were no longer available.

Here’s a quick tally sheet on what the new legislation could mean for you as a buyer, seller or owner.

• Do you, like millions of Americans, pay mortgage insurance premiums or guarantee fees on an FHA, VA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Rural Housing loan? The American Taxpayer Relief Act — the fiscal cliff compromise bill — allows you to write off the insurance premiums you paid during 2012 along with your mortgage interest, provided your household income does not exceed $110,000. Legal authorization for this deduction expired at the end of 2011. But the new bill retroactively permits write-offs for 2012 and 2013 for qualified borrowers.

• Did you do some energy efficiency renovations in your home during 2012, installing insulation, energy-saving windows, doors, roofing material, non-solar water heaters and the like? Maybe you’re thinking about doing a little green rehab in 2013? For either year, you may be able to claim up to a $500 tax credit thanks to the revival of a home energy improvement incentive that lapsed in 2011. Five hundred bucks may not sound huge, but remember: It’s a credit, not a deduction, so it means $500 off the bottom line of your federal tax return.

• Are you planning a short sale of your underwater home this year or hoping to receive a principal reduction on your loan as a result of a mortgage modification by your lender? The new legislation reauthorized the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act that had been scheduled to terminate Dec. 31, and spares you potentially punitive federal taxes on the amount forgiven. Had the debt relief exception in the tax code not been renewed, large numbers of underwater owners participating in short sales — in which banks agree to accept less than the full amounts owed on a loan as part of a sale to a new buyer or investor — would have faced taxation on the full amount forgiven, as if it were regular income.

Lenders and real estate brokers say thousands of financially distressed homeowners would have been devastated by the expiration. Alexis Eldorrado, a Chicago-area real estate specialist in short sales, says she has five clients who are underwater on their mortgages by an average of $100,000 and awaiting short sale closings in the coming weeks. They probably would have had to file for bankruptcy had Congress not renewed the debt forgiveness law, she said, because none of them could afford to pay taxes on $100,000 they never actually received.

What’s in the legislation that some buyers or sellers might not like? Start with steeper capital gains taxes for high-income sellers with big gains that exceed current federal exclusion limits of $250,000 (single tax filers) and $500,000 (married joint filers). Say you are single and earn more than $400,000, or you’re married, file jointly and earn more than $450,000. Under the new legislation, you can expect to pay 20% on capital gains. So if you sell your principal residence this year and your gain on the sale is $750,000, the capital gains tax rate on the amount in excess of the exclusion limit will be 20%, rather than 15%. Sellers below the income thresholds will still pay capital gains taxes at 15%, and earners at the two lowest tax brackets will pay nothing on capital gains.

Another negative: The fiscal cliff deal limits deductions for mortgage interest, property taxes, charitable donations and other write-offs for single-filing taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes above $250,000 and married joint filers above $300,000. The formula it uses is complex, but it could amount to about $1,000 in additional tax liability for a couple with an income around $400,000, according to housing industry estimates.

All in all, not so bad. Then again, major tax reform efforts are coming this spring, with mortgage interest and other real estate write-offs prominent among the targets. So enjoy the fiscal cliff bill results — at least for a little while.

The legislation%2C affecting seven million students this year%2C would tie loan rates to the financial markets

The Republican-controlled House is expected to pass it before the August break

President Obama %22strongly supports%22 the bill%2C the White House said Wednesday

WASHINGTON--Despite strong opposition from liberals, the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate approved a bill Wednesday to tie federal college loan rates to financial markets to retroactively roll back an unpopular July 1 rate hike.

The bipartisan legislation was approved 81-18.

The GOP-controlled U.S. House is expected to approve the legislation before the August recess. President Obama supports the bill and commended the bipartisan effort that produced it, the White House said in a statement issued Wednesday. The legislation will affect seven million students heading to college this fall.

The bill will bring down interest rates for subsidized Stafford loans in the short-term. These rates doubled to 6.8% on July 1 because Congress could not come to terms on an agreement ahead of that deadline. Under the legislation, undergraduates will be able to borrow at 3.9% for this school year; graduate students at 5.4%, and parents at 6.4%.

Liberal Democrats are wary that the legislation could allow interest rates to rise above 6.8% in future years as the financial markets recover and interest rates rise.

""The truth of the matter is, if the bill on the floor passes without amendment, it would be a disaster for the young people of our country who are looking to go to college and for the parents who are looking to help pay their bills,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who voted against the bill. Sanders offered an amendment to sunset the legislation in two years, but it was rejected.

The legislation includes loan interest rate caps at 8.25% for undergraduates, 9.5% for graduates, and 10.5% for parents. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates rates would not hit the rate caps within the next decade.

An effort by Sens. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to put tighter interest rates caps on student loans was also rejected. Reed and Warren also voted against the bill.

Instead of Congress continuing to set interest rates on student loans, future borrowers will see their loans tied to the U.S. Treasury 10-year borrowing rate. The legislation creates a three tier systems, to charging an additional 1.85% for undergraduate Stafford loans, 3.4% for graduate Stafford loans, and 4.4% for PLUS loans, which parents can take for their children. The interest rate would be fixed over the life of the loan.

The legislation provided a rare area of accord between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans. The president included a similar proposal in his budget this year, which House Republicans touted in initial legislation.

House Speaker John Boehner's office noted the similarities between the House GOP proposal and the final bill. ""A victory indeed, and one that shows when we have common ground, we should seize it on behalf of the people we serve,"" said a blog posted Wednesday on the speaker's official Web site."

The government-owned building was finally sold to a private developer for $19.5 million this month. But it sat there for 10 years -- off the market and vacant -- while taxpayers footed the bill for its upkeep.

A for-sale sign only went up the day before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform dragged General Services Administration officials into the musty structure for a hearing last summer. Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., berated a bewildered GSA official at that hearing, saying: ""You can't get your job done! I don't care if it's a Republican or Democratic administration, the job is not getting done!""

Congressional frustration may be warranted. The federal government owns or leases between 55,000 and 77,000 vacant properties. But it's impossible to tell exactly how many. No precise inventory has been kept.

Selling them off, though, could save taxpayers between $3 billion and $8 billion a year, according to various analysts. That's nothing to scoff at as the government grapples with a mounting debt and sequester-tied spending cuts.

""These properties could be used first to consolidate agencies that now are in leased buildings,"" D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton told Fox News.

Tom Schatz, of Citizens Against Government Waste said: ""This is a problem that has been identified for years, and every time someone in the White House says 'let's sell property,' the red tape is simply too much for this process.""

In 1987, amid media coverage of the nation's persistent homeless problem, Congress passed a law that said unused government properties first had to be offered to other federal agencies, then to state agencies, and, as a last resort, for use as homeless shelters before they could be put on the market.

""We spend about 8 billion dollars a year maintaining properties that we have no use for. Now that 8 billion dollars is just thrown down the drain because we can't get past the homeless lobby to get a common-sense way to take care of their problems and also us to unload properties,"" Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., told Fox News.

Former Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., notes that Congress is full of people who've never held private-sector jobs.""There is nothing wrong with that. But it means they have never really been in the position of running something, of making hard decisions, of having scarce resources and having to set priorities.""

Schatz echoes that sentiment -- noting the way the government handles the excess properties is counter to common sense. ""Rather than having the government get the first choice, the first choice should be to sell and then go back down the line. There are plenty of places for homeless shelters,"" he said.

Legislation to require the federal government to expedite the sale of underused properties died in the last Congress. It was resurrected this year in Republican Rep. Paul Ryan's proposed budget, which the Senate voted down this month.

But Norton has hopes Congress will begin to remedy the problem this year.""The Oversight and Government Reform committee has just passed again its bill which I think has a good chance of getting all the way to the Senate,"" she said.

Still, if Congress does pass a bill to sell excess properties, inventorying all of them would be a daunting undertaking given that they're spread across all government agencies."

Pew/Stateline Staff Writer

Benefits are being reduced by about 5%25 beginning Nov. 1

A household of eight would see benefits reduced %2465 a month

The reductions will be acutely felt in states with a higher food stamp population

The record number of Americans relying on federal aid to put food on the table will have to make do with less starting today, as a recession-era boost to food stamps officially expires.

Benefits are being reduced by about 5% beginning Nov. 1 for all of the nearly 47.7 million Americans on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. A family of four will receive $36 less each month because of the reduction, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A household of eight would see benefits reduced $65 a month. The average monthly benefit per household for all 50 states and the District of Columbia last year was $278.

The cuts severely curtail the federal funds that have flowed into local communities and businesses through the states. Georgia, for example, will see total benefits cut by $210 million, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Illinois' share of the cut will be $220 million. For Ohio, it's $193 million. All told, $5 billion less in food stamp benefits will be paid over the next year.

The reductions will be acutely felt in states with a higher food stamp population, particularly in the dozen states where one in five residents is collecting benefits.

Vulnerable populations will be especially affected. In New York, more than 1 million elderly people or those with disabilities will feel the impact, according to the center's analysis. About 2.3 million children in both California and Texas will be affected.

The expiring benefits were always intended to be temporary, and some say calling the end of the benefits boost a ""cut"" is disingenuous. Congress approved a higher level of food stamp benefits for all recipients as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, the stimulus bill enacted in 2009.

""It's a boost that was only meant to be temporary,"" said Rachel Sheffield of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""They're not cutting the program.""

But despite an improved economy, demand for assistance remains at record levels — almost three times what it was in 2000. The cost of the program has ballooned as well. A decade ago, federal spending on food stamps topped $20 billion annually. In the last fiscal year, the U.S. spent a record $78.4 billion. In Washington and in many states, Republicans have backed efforts to curb spending, cut benefits and trim enrollment in SNAP.

The persistent demand and skyrocketing costs have prompted calls from some policymakers to cut spending on the program. Others say reductions are premature and will hurt those still reeling from the recession.

""We know that it's going to increase the people that come to us,"" said Page Crosland of the Capital Area Food Bank, which serves Washington, D.C. — where nearly one in four are on food stamps — along with parts of Virginia and Maryland. ""We're working around the clock to meet this anticipated increased demand.""

The issue is one of the central disputes in the congressional debate over the farm bill, which ramped up again this week. House Republicans have proposed nearly $40 billion in cuts to SNAP over the next decade. The Congressional Budget Office has said such a cut could end benefits for nearly 4 million people next year alone. Senate Democrats have backed a $4 billion cut.

That larger dispute has contributed to a relative quiet over the reductions taking effect today. While Democrats and the White House blasted Republicans when they backed deep food stamp cuts in their farm bill proposal, there was no significant effort to stem the reductions now taking place.

Republicans and Democrats will continue to debate their respective farm bill measures, along with broader tax and spending disputes under the plan that ended the government shutdown last month.

If the debate proceeds as it has -- many times -- in the past, then most Democrats will embrace the president’s message and back the proposal, while most Republicans will oppose it, on the grounds that higher labor costs will lead to higher unemployment.

But we shouldn’t rely on political opinions in this debate. Facts clearly demonstrate that raising the minimum wage is a bad idea.

The case against raising the minimum wage is straightforward: A higher wage makes it more expensive for firms to hire workers. How big an effect does this have on the job market? Economists debate this. But no one argues that increasing the minimum wage increases the number of unemployed workers who find jobs. In the end, the trade-off is clear. People who keep their jobs get more money; those who lose their jobs, or fail to get new ones, suffer.

In announcing his proposal to increase the minimum wage, the president argued that doing so would alleviate poverty. The president is certainly correct to turn his attention to the poor, many of whom have been suffering for years in a tough economy. And it is clearly desirable for households that engage in full-time work not to live in poverty. But increasing the minimum wage would not accomplish this goal.

Research published in 2010 by economists Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser concluded that if the federal minimum wage were increased from $7.25 an hour to $9.50 an hour (remember that the president’s proposal is to increase the minimum wage to $9 per hour), only 11.3% of workers who would gain from the increase belong to poor households.

Why?

First, many people who live in poverty do not work, and would thus be unaffected by an increase in the minimum wage. In addition, workers who earn the minimum wage are generally not the primary breadwinners in their households. They are secondary earners -- an elderly parent earning some retirement income or a spouse with a part-time job. Or they are young people living with their parents. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while workers under age 25 make up only about 20% of those who earn hourly wages, they constitute about half of all workers earning the minimum wage or less. Raising the minimum wage is therefore an ineffective anti-poverty proposal.

The case for a higher minimum wage grows even weaker when you stop to consider that there are vastly superior alternatives for steering money to low-income households. For example, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found that expanding the earned income tax credit is a much more efficient way to fight poverty than increasing the minimum wage.

Why have we so often embraced a less effective tool? A tax credit is less politically palatable because it takes money directly out of federal coffers, while the minimum wage can be raised without it showing up directly on the government’s books. The cost of a higher wage is borne by employers and consumers -- and by the unfortunate people who end up not working because of it.

It is also important to consider the president’s proposal to increase the minimum wage in the context of today’s labor market. The unemployment rate for African American teenagers stands at a staggeringly high 43.1%. For white teenagers, the unemployment rate is 22.1%; a little more than 11% of workers older than 25 and without a high school diploma are unemployed.

To put these numbers in perspective, overall unemployment at the height of the Depression was about 25%. Especially for low-skill workers and for young workers, the two groups of workers who will be disproportionately hit by a minimum-wage increase, ours is a labor market in crisis. Increasing the cost of job creation now is unwise.

One reason public officials continue to embrace such a bad idea is that it’s popular, and thus can provide an opportunity to score political points. The last time we had this debate, it was President George W. Bush who signed a minimum-wage increase into law. The fact that even a Republican president did so shows just how tempting this policy is to politicians.

The head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Steve Israel, knows this. He told the Washington Post last month that the minimum wage was “a reminder to suburban independent voters that House Republicans are extreme, and out of touch.” Rep. Nancy Pelosi seconded that notion, explaining to the Post that Democrats intend to embrace a simple message: “We want to raise the minimum wage, and you don’t. Why not?”

Why not support increasing the minimum wage? Because it will make it more expensive for businesses to hire young and low-skill workers at a time of crisis-level unemployment. Because it will not alleviate poverty. Because there are much better alternatives to help poor families, and because the minimum wage is a dishonest approach that hides the true cost of the policy."

After drawn-out negotiations, Congress was able to cobble together a fiscal plan and pass it in both chambers Tuesday night. No one walked away getting everything they wanted but that didn’t stop Obama from declaring victory and playing the passage as a ringing endorsement from the American public to push Republicans even harder on taxes in the coming months.

“The agreement leaves substantial scope for reducing tax expenditures for high-income households” during any future debates over tax reform and entitlement programs, the Obama administration said in a ""fact sheet"" released following Tuesday morning's Senate vote.

Obama, during brief remarks Tuesday night after the House passed the bill, reiterated that ""cutting spending has to go hand in hand with further reforms to our tax code so that the wealthiest corporations and individuals can't take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most Americans.""

Many Republicans had complained that the legislation would raise taxes without making any significant cuts in government spending. Conservatives toyed late Tuesday afternoon with tacking on billions in spending cuts. In the end, that idea was abandoned and the House voted on the Senate-passed bill. That bill allows tax increases on households making above $450,000 -- it's a narrower swath of families than Obama was previously looking at, but the president still used it to suggest the dam had been broken on tax hikes.

The Obama administration and Democrats were able to apply pressure Republicans into making a deal, often taking their pleas public. On Monday, Obama held a midday press conference with a group of middle-class Americans standing behind him as he took shots at Congress for its clumsiness in negotiations.

Economist Doug Holtz-Eakin says the House GOP played the only hand it could with a deadline approaching that would have forced the nation to face historic tax increases on virtually every single American in the country.

“They did the best they could,” Eakin said. “Getting a deal is a victory – and that should be recognized – but it’s far from a slam dunk and more work needs to be done.”

Had the House not passed the legislation, tax rates enacted in the last decade would have expired and broad tax increases would have kicked in affecting nearly every working American. An additional $110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending would have also gone into effect -- it has instead been delayed two months.

Republicans say they didn’t get the spending cuts they wanted and plan to continue their fight in the next two months when another round of budget battles take place over the debt ceiling."

Spending keeps going up. Revenues%2C however%2C are not.

Does that mean that the ballooning debt is all Obama%27s fault%3F No.

The United States can%27t go on forever increasing its debt by 60%25 every four years.

President Obama, the Democrats, and plenty of Republicans in Congress, would like it if you'd spend the next few weeks talking about gun control. That's because when you are, you're not talking about the country's financial situation.

And, as the graph included here, taken from OMB budget data, illustrates, the situation is dire. Spending keeps going up. Revenues, however, are not. And, since we're borrowing the difference, President Obama has what Politico is calling a debt problem: ""The staggering national debt — up about 60% from the $10 trillion Obama inherited when he took office in January 2009 — is the single biggest blemish on Obama's record, even if the rapid descent into red began under President George W. Bush. Obama has long emphasized Bush's role in digging the immense hole. But he owns it now.""

Well, things did start to go south under Bush. But look at that graph more closely. In 2003, when we invaded Iraq (one of those ""two wars on the credit card"" that Obama likes to blame for the debt), and when we passed the Bush tax cuts (the other thing Obama likes to blame for the debt) revenue actually started to climb. The revenue and spending lines start to converge, and, as they head up to 2006 it actually looks as if the two might cross, with revenue outpacing spending.

Even the New York Times noticed, spotting unexpected increases in revenue in 2005, and in 2006 noting that a ""surprising"" increase in tax revenues was closing the budget gap. The heady possibility of surpluses was in the air. But -- look at the graph again -- everything changes in 2007.

What happened in 2007? The financial crisis hadn't struck yet. But we did elect a new Democratic Congress, with Democrats controlling both houses for the first time in over a decade. The trend immediately reversed, and became much worse with President Obama's election in 2008 and inauguration in 2009. (In fact, despite talk of ""wars on the credit card,"" we could save a lot of money by cutting defense spending back to where it was in 2007.)

So does that mean that the ballooning debt is all Obama's fault? No. Most of those spending bills got Republican votes, too. But it does mean that, as Politico notes, Obama now owns the 60% increase in the debt that has occurred on his watch, and can no longer credibly blame Bush (under whom plenty of Democrats voted for spending bills).

Economist Herbert Stein observed that something that can't go on forever, won't. The United States can't go on forever increasing its debt by 60% every four years. Therefore, it won't. The only question is how things will stop -- smoothly or catastrophically.

As we head into the next debt-ceiling debate, it's worth considering these words from a patriotic senator concerned with America's future:

""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. . . . It is a sign that the U.S. government can't pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our government's reckless fiscal policies. … Leadership means that 'the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt limit.""

The senator? Sen. Barack Obama, in 2006.

I wish that guy was President now.

Werfel, who currently serves as the controller of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also worked with the Bush administration.

""Throughout his career working in both Democratic and Republican administrations, Danny has proven an effective leader who serves with professionalism, integrity and skill,"" Obama said in an emailed statement. ""The American people deserve to have the utmost confidence and trust in their government, and as we work to get to the bottom of what happened and restore confidence in the IRS, Danny has the experience and management ability necessary to lead the agency at this important time.""

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will appoint a new acting commissioner to the Internal Revenue Service this week, a senior administration official confirmed to The Huffington Post.

The news comes a day after the president announced the departure of acting commissioner Steven Miller, as the tax agency has become engulfed in scandal for targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status leading up to the 2012 election.

""It is important to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward,"" Obama said Wednesday in a statement.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew requested Miller's resignation after a Treasury Department inspector general's report released earlier this week found that lower-level IRS staff acted out of incompetence by subjecting groups applying for 501(c)(4) status to greater scrutiny if they had words like ""tea party"" in their names. The report also found that the targeting was not politically motivated, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for a firm response from the president.

Obama said he had directed Lew to continue investigating the IRS and pledged to ""work with Congress as it performs its oversight role"" in the process.

Some Republicans have argued that dismissing Miller is not enough, given that the acting commissioner had already been planning to leave his post in June. Nonetheless, it was influential Republican lawmakers such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) who initially demanded Miller's resignation.

At a press conference Thursday, the president rejected calls for a special counsel to investigate the agency.

""I think that it's going to be sufficient for us to be working with Congress. They've got a whole bunch of committees,"" Obama said, pointing out the IG had produced a report and conducted an audit. He added that Attorney General Eric Holder had also announced a criminal investigation into what happened.

""Between those investigations, I think we're going to be able to figure out exactly what happened, who was involved, what went wrong, and we're going to be able to implement steps to fix it,"" Obama said. ""That, ultimately, is the main priority that I have, but also I think the American people have.""

Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House, told HuffPost on Wednesday that the administration had acted swiftly and appropriately amid the controversy.

""It was good the president said there's going to be accountability and responsibility,"" Hoyer said. ""And the guy who's the head, like the coach, takes the responsibility. I think it was the appropriate action.""

Some also charge hypocrisy, since Democrats once opposed the very step they took last week.

In fact, seeing the world as it is rather than pining for a world that no longer exists is a condition for reducing polarization down the road. With their dramatic decision, Senate Democrats have frankly acknowledged that the power struggle over the judiciary has reached a crisis point and that the nature of conservative opposition to President Obama is genuinely without precedent.

What happened on Nuclear Thursday has more to do with the rise of an activist conservative judiciary than with the norms of the Senate. From the moment that five conservative justices issued their ruling in Bush v. Gore, liberals and Democrats realized they were up against forces willing to achieve their purposes by using power at every level of government. When the Bush v. Gore majority insisted that the principles invoked to decide the 2000 election in George W. Bush’s favor could not be used in any other case, they effectively admitted their opportunism. Dec. 12, 2000, led inexorably to Nov. 21, 2013.

Bush v. Gore set in motion what liberals see as a pernicious feedback loop. By giving the presidency to a conservative, the five right-of-center justices guaranteed that for at least four years (and what turned out to be eight), the judiciary would be tilted even further in a conservative direction.

Bush was highly disciplined in naming as many conservative judges as he could. His appointments of Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito bolstered the Supreme Court’s conservative majority. The court later rendered such decisions as Citizens United, which tore down barriers to big money in politics, and Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Both, in turn, had the effect of strengthening the electoral hand of conservatives and Republicans.

With the conservatives’ offensive as the backdrop, Senate Democrats and liberals on the outside revolted in 2005 against the Republican threat to use the nuclear option when the GOP controlled the Senate. Progressives felt they had no choice but to throw sand into the gears of a juggernaut.

Liberals said things eight years ago that are being used by conservatives to accuse them of hypocrisy now. I didn’t have to look far for an example of what they’re talking about.

In a column in March 2005, I called the GOP’s effort to speed the confirmation of conservative judges “a blatant effort to twist the rules” that ignored “the traditions of the Senate.” I might take back the “traditions of the Senate” line, a rhetorical attempt to call conservatism’s bluff. But what animated my argument then is the same concern I have now: This era’s conservatives will use any means at their disposal to win control of the courts. Their goal is to do all they can to limit Congress’s ability to enact social reforms. At the same time, they are pushing for measures — notably restrictions on the right to vote — that alter the electoral terrain in their favor.

And it is simply undeniable that in the Obama years, conservatives have abused the filibuster in ways that liberals never dreamed of. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid cited the Congressional Research Service’s (CRS) finding that in our history, there have been 168 cloture motions filed on presidential nominations. Nearly half of them — 82 — happened under Obama. According to CRS, of the 67 cloture motions on judicial nominees since 1967, 31 occurred under Obama. Faced with this escalation, senators long opposed to going nuclear, among them Reid and California’s Dianne Feinstein, concluded it was the only alternative to surrender.

Republicans gave the game away when all but a few of them opposed Obama’s three most recent appointments to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit not on the merits but by accusing the president of trying to “pack the court.” In fact, Obama was simply making appointments he was constitutionally and legislatively authorized to make. His nominees were being filibustered because they might alter the circuit court’s philosophical balance. The GOP thus demonstrated beyond any doubt that it cares far more about maintaining conservative influence on the nation’s second most important judicial body than in observing the rules and customs of the Senate.

This is why the Senate Democrats’ action will, in the end, be constructive. The first step toward resolving a power struggle is to recognize it for what it is. The era of denial is finally over.

USA TODAY

Obama wants to make it clear he will not budge

President says he has made offers and is willing to negotiate%2C but only after government is reopened

WASHINGTON— In his ongoing battle with Republicans over a government shutdown and a looming default, President Obama armed himself on Tuesday with an olive branch and an anvil.

For a brief moment at his hastily arranged White House news conference, Obama emphasized his willingness to work with Republicans to get past this fiscal crisis that's shut down the federal government for eight days and is now threatening to inflict real pain to an American economy.

Asked whether he'd willing to negotiate with Republicans, even if they just passed a short-term budget deal, the president brightly responded ""absolutely."" Obama added that he doesn't expect to get 100% of what he wants. And he noted that doesn't believe he has the answers to everything and joked that his wife could tell you about some of his flaws.

But in between the fleeting moments of conciliatory rhetoric, Obama pounded away at a Republican party—and particularly House Speaker John Boehner--who he says is trying to extract a ransom to do their job.

Obama cast himself as the adult in the room—the one who has been willing to go more than halfway in past negotiations much to the chagrin to many Democrats—and is willing to sit down with Republicans again if they agree to even short-term deals on the budget and debt ceiling.

At this point, the president lamented that he has no true negotiating partner. The Tea Party is ""forcing"" the speaker to issue threats to the economy, he said. Obama even scoffed at Boehner's recent suggestions that there aren't the votes in the House to pass a clean budget resolution or debt limit hike.

""Let them vote to keep the government open or not, and they can determine where they stand and defend that vote to their constituencies,"" Obama dared. ""And let them vote on whether or not America should pay its bills or not. And if, in fact, some of these folks really believe that it's not that big of a deal, they can vote no.""

In this latest round of budgetary wars, Obama has maintained a rhetorical consistency: There will be no negotiations until Congress passes a clean budget and debt ceiling hike.

Obama says if he gives in now to what he sees as unreasonable Republican demands—which include defunding or delaying his signature health care law which Congress passed three years ago-- it would weaken the institution of the presidency and change American democracy.

His tough talk also could bolster fellow Democrats who are less than enthused by his track-record for negotiations.

Democrats grouse that he caved earlier this year when agreed to extending George W. Bush era tax cuts to those making less than $450,000, after vowing to sunset the provision for all top earners. And the bad taste lingers for Democrats from the 2011 fight in which Obama relented after demanding a clean increase to the debt limit.

But on Tuesday, Obama seemed to be trying to send the message that this time will be different.

""I think what has changed is they're aware of the fact that I'm not budging when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States,"" Obama said about the debt ceiling. ""You don't pay a ransom, you don't provide concessions for Congress doing its job and America paying its bills.""

Boehner, however, doesn't yet sound convinced. He told reporters shortly after Obama's remarks that Republicans won't blink to the president's call for ""unconditional surrender.""

""The long and short of it is, there's going to be a negotiation here,"" Boehner told reporters.

Who blinks first remains to be seen. But eight days into the impasse, there isn't even the semblance of common ground."

The impasse meant that 800,000 federal workers were to be furloughed and more than a million others would be asked to work without pay. The Office of Management and Budget issued orders shortly before the midnight deadline that “agencies should now execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations” because Congress had failed to act to keep the federal government financed.

After a series of rapid-fire back and forth legislative maneuvers, the House and Senate ended the day with no resolution, and the Senate halted business until later Tuesday while the House took steps to open talks. But Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, dismissed as game-playing the House proposal to begin conference committee negotiations.

“We will not go to conference with a gun to our heads,” he said, demanding that the House accept the Senate’s six-week stopgap spending bill, which has no policy prescriptions, before negotiations begin."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/18/news/economy/federal-reserve-taper/index.html,2013-12-18 00:00:00,['Annalyn Kurtz'],"Federal Reserve tapers its stimulus program, citing stronger job market","Federal Reserve officials decided Wednesday to start gradually reducing their massive economic stimulus program.

Beginning in January, the Fed will buy $75 billion in bonds each month, down from the $85 billion it had been buying since September 2012.

""In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases,"" the Fed said in a statement.

The Fed decided to cut back on both types of bond purchases -- mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries -- by $5 billion per month each.

The bond-buying program has become so large, it's expected to push the Fed's assets to $4 trillion this week -- money the Fed basically created out of thin air.

The new cut represents the beginning of a gradual wind-down process which Wall Street has nicknamed ""tapering.""

But the complete end to Fed stimulus is still probably years away.

Fed officials have been stressing lately that tapering does not mean ""tightening."" In fact, the Fed extended its commitment to keep short-term interest rates ""exceptionally low"" until either the unemployment rate falls to around 6.5% or the inflation rate exceeds 2.5% a year.

At a press conference immediately following the announcement, Bernanke stressed that the Fed's actions did not amount to a withdrawal of support for the economy. ""Nothing we did today was intended to reduce accommodation,"" he said.

Most officials expect rates to rise in 2015, despite the fact that inflation will likely still be below the target at that point.

Bernanke also explained that the Fed had ""enhanced"" its forward guidance on keeping interest rates low.

""The committee is determined to avoid inflation that is too low, as well as inflation that is too high,"" Bernanke said.

But rates will remain low for a while, so consumers can still expect to lock in historically cheap rates on mortgages, car or business loans, albeit probably not at the record lows seen earlier this year.

Stocks jumped following the announcement, with the Dow gaining 200 points after the news.

Related: Will the market actually cheer tapering?

How we got here: Traditionally, the Fed has used low interest rates to stimulate the economy in times of stress, but in the most recent financial crisis, it was forced to take unprecedented measures.

First, the Fed slashed its key interest rate to near-zero in 2008.

Next, in a program known as ""quantitative easing,"" or QE, the Fed started buying bonds like U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in an attempt to lower long-term interest rates too.

That second move came in three rounds that have since been nicknamed QE1, QE2 and QE3.

Among them, QE3 was the only program that wasn't given an explicit end-date. Instead, the Fed said it was looking for substantial improvement in the job market. But there's room for interpretation on what exactly that means. The Fed already botched some of its communications surrounding the word ""substantial.""

Back in May, for example, Chairman Ben Bernanke said he believed the Fed would start to taper ""later this year,"" ending the bond-buying program completely in 2014, when the unemployment rate falls to around 7%.

Wall Street believed him, and stocks started falling and bond yields started rising over the summer.

But then the Fed met in July, September and October without taking action, and the unemployment rate fell to 7% in November, but still there was no taper.

Only one Fed member -- Eric Rosengren of the Boston Federal Reserve -- formally dissented against Wednesday's decision. He felt that unemployment was still too high and inflation was still too low to begin pulling back on stimulus.

Bernanke will attend one more policy meeting next month, before his term as Fed chair ends January 31. The rest of the Fed's exit strategy will have to be left to his presumed successor, Janet Yellen.

President Obama nominated Yellen for the position in October, and the Senate is expected to confirm her this week."

Yes, in the land of six-guns, cattle rustling and Enron, handing a sandwich to a homeless person in a city park or serving a bowl of soup in a rented storefront can earn you a $500 fine. Some charitable organizations, financially unable to risk the fines, have relocated outside the city.

Last week, Houston police ticketed a homeless man for trying to feed himself by fishing a donut from a trash bin in a public park.

James Kelly, a nine-year Navy veteran, was issued a citation for violating a peculiar law on the books since 1942, and amended as recently as 2002, that makes it illegal to “remove any contents of any bin, bag or other container that has been placed for collection of garbage, trash or recyclable materials.”

“I know on the face of it, it sounds very cruel,” Ray Hunt, president of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, said, claiming that most police officers would not cite someone for simply taking food from a dumpster.

Yes, Mr. Hunt, it does, and apparently they do; see the copy of the citation above.

Since the news broke of Kelly’s encounter with the law, there has been an outpouring of concern from less heartless Houstonians. Randall Kallinen, a Houston attorney who’s fought against the “anti-feeding” ordinance, has taken the case. Kallinen acknowledges that Kelly got his ticket based on the garbage law not the feeding ordinance, but says the two laws overlap in that both seek to achieve the same goal – to force the homeless out of Houston and into neighboring municipalities.

""The city of Houston has shown, over the many years, a hostile environment toward the homeless,"" said Kallinen, who plans to represent Kelly in court next month."

Obama continued, “I meant what I said; I’m going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release.”

Obama also blasted reports that job creation would be significant: “”[M]y hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline – which might take a year or two – and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in a economy of 150 million working people.” He stated that gas prices would go up in parts of the United States thanks to Keystone XL: “So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they can’t ship some of that oil to world markets.”

On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told Fox News Sunday that Keystone’s failure to move forward was somehow Republicans’ fault: “There were some political games that were played, that took it off the trail and path to completion, where Republicans put it out there as something that was put on a timetable that it could not be resolved. It caused a delay. Playing political games with something like this was a mistake.”

(CNN) - House Speaker John Boehner had some choice words Tuesday for his colleagues in the Senate over the forced spending cuts set to begin Friday.

Boehner, known for his at-times colorful language, said the House won't move a budget bill until the Senate ""gets off their ass and begins to do something.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

He made his comments to reporters after speaking to the House GOP conference on Capitol Hill. Ahead of President Barack Obama's trip to Newport News, Virginia Tuesday afternoon, Boehner criticized the president for holding campaign-style events about the spending cuts, rather than acting to prevent them.

At issue is a disagreement over how to stave off the automatic, across-the-board cuts, known in Washington as the sequester. Democrats and Obama want to replace it with a mix of more specific cuts and an increase in taxes through the closing of certain loopholes.

Republicans, on the other hand, say taxes are out of the question.

""He's gotten his tax hikes,"" Boehner said, referring to the-end-of-the-year fiscal cliff bill that raised tax rates on top earners. ""It's time to focus on the real problem here in Washington and that is spending.""

Building onto the criticism, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Obama is hardly willing to meet Republicans in the middle.

""The president says we can't have any progress on this sequester unless we get the second tax hike in eight weeks. That's not compromise,"" Cantor said.

Later Tuesday, Senate Majority Harry Reid responded to Boehner's remark.

""I was raised in a little town that had 13 brothels in it,"" the Nevada Democrat said. ""So I am used to some pretty salty language as you know.""

Reid then read out Boehner's quote.

""I think he should understand who is sitting on their posterior,"" Reid added. ""We are doing our best here to pass something. The speaker is doing nothing to try to pass anything over there.""

Earlier in the day, Reid said Senate Democrats have a ""balanced proposal"" to replace the sequester with ""smart spending reductions"" and ""measures that close corporate tax loopholes and wasteful subsidies and revenue from the very wealthiest among us.""

Despite their proposal, however, Reid definitively stated the cuts will still take place due to GOP opposition.

""My Republican colleagues are standing in the way of a solution,"" he continued. ""They only want cuts and more cuts. They are willing to sacrifice three quarters of a million American jobs rather than ask multi-millionaires to pay a penny more.""

The former hub of America's car industry has had major problems in recent years with its finances and in July it became the largest city in the US to file for bankruptcy, with debts estimated at $18.5bn (£12.1bn).

In an interview in the New York Times Magazine, Boston mayor Thomas Menino was asked where he would live if he could live in any other American city and he said Detroit was a place he would love to go.

When asked what he would do there he said: ""I'd blow up the place and start all over.

""No, seriously, when it takes a police officer 90 minutes to answer a call, there's something wrong with the system.

""Forty percent of the streetlights are out, most of the buildings are boarded up. Why? Inaction, that's the problem - leadership.""

Detroit's mayor Dave Bing criticised his counterpart's remarks, referring to the Boston bombing blasts earlier this year that left three dead and more than 200 people injured.

Mr Bing said: ""It is extremely regrettable that Boston Mayor Thomas Menino used such an unfortunate choice of words to describe what he would do if he came to Detroit.

""I would think the mayor of a city that recently experienced a deadly bombing attack would be more sensitive and not use the phrase 'blow up.""'

Mr Menino has now said sorry, telling WBZ NewsRadio 1030: ""I made a mistake, I apologise"", CBS reports.

He said he stood by the numbers he cited in the article, claiming he got them from a Detroit financial report.

But, he admitted he used a ""poor choice of words"".

Mr Bing said Mr Menino should have got ""his facts right"".

He added: ""The Detroit police department's response time is not - and has never been - 90 minutes.

""And, most of our city's buildings are not boarded up. Since taking office more than four years ago, there has been tireless action on the part of my administration to improve the quality of life for our citizens.

""In fact, I invite Mayor Menino to visit Detroit to see our city for himself."""
http://news.yahoo.com/unequal-place-in-america-160711227.html,,[],Louisiana parish provides extreme example of inequality,"In a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, President Barack Obama called economic inequality ""the great unfinished business"" of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy. And Louisiana's East Carroll Parish provides an extreme example of the inequality found in much of the country.



The richest 5 percent in the parish earn $611,000 per year on average, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, while the poorest 20 percent make $6,800. According to the Tax Policy Center, those earning $611,000 are among the top 1 percent in the United States. Those with income of $6,800, meanwhile, are among the bottom 5 percent.



The unemployment rate is 16 percent, or more than double the national average.



But according to John Sutter, who recently traveled to the town of Lake Providence in the parish for CNN's Change the List project, few of its 7,500 residents are complaining.



""I was hard pressed to find people in Lake Providence who think income inequality, specifically, is a problem,"" Sutter wrote on CNN.com. ""This is the way things are, they say.""



Delores Gilmore, a 44-year-old overnight prison guard who lives on the south side of the lake, earns $8.50 per hour working 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. to make ends meet.



""The first of the month, I pay the rent,"" she said. ""The next check, I pay my light bills. Sometimes I won't pay my rent and I pay the light bill from last month — if they cut if it off. Then I pay the rent the end of the month. ... I get it done. By the grace of God, I get it done.""



Gilmore may not complain about the income division, but she does dream about being on the other side, Sutter writes:

Gilmore, a stern but funny lady who answers the door saying, ""What now?!"" and carries a switch to church in case her kids act up, never wore shoes in the imagined house, only socks. Her real living room floor is made of splintered plywood. But the floors in the dream home were smooth as a skating rink. In the dream, Gilmore ran through the halls and slid across the floor in her socks — just like Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business.""

Story continues





Thomas Terral, a 71-year-old businessman who lives on the other side of the lake, is among the top 5 percent:





He lives a life of relative luxury — nothing that would seem outlandish by national standards, but it is a far cry from life south of the lake. His living room has the vibe of an upscale ski lodge, with the heads of various animals — one is a bighorn sheep, I think -- staring at you from elevated angles. In the office, a bear rug has its mouth open, fangs showing. Terral shot it with a bow and arrow on a hunting trip in British Columbia. On the coffee table is a copy of Forbes magazine. Cover story: ""Peace Through Profits.""





Terral's family owned several farm-related businesses, including one that they sold in 2010.



""I felt like my mission was to supply as many jobs as I could,"" Terral said. ""Of course, we were a small company, and I think the most employees we had was a little under 70 — 68 or so. What we did was probably the best thing we could do to help the situation.""



""By 'the situation,'"" Sutton writes, ""he means the poverty south of the lake."""

As a deeply respected economist, she will bring two vital attributes to that role as a steward of the economy.

First, she represents continuity with the Fed’s current low-interest-rate policies to foster employment while controlling inflation. Those policies, which she has helped to create and sustain, have undeniably boosted the flagging economy.

Just as undeniably, they have generated controversy and consternation. Ms. Yellen has expertly addressed those concerns, including the risks inherent in a prolonged low-interest-rate policy, though the most feared effect, inflation, is as yet nowhere in sight.

She also has been realistic about the limits of the Fed’s efforts. Her grasp of the issues in all their complexity has given her the credibility to lead the Fed in deciding how long to continue monetary stimulus policies and how eventually to ease up and end them."

President Obama to meet with Democratic and Republican caucuses in coming days

The first session is Wednesday with House Democrats

WASHINGTON — President Obama plans to meet with House Republicans on Thursday, but the two sides are already clashing over the guest list.

An aide to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he is sending only an 18-member delegation to the White House because a smaller meeting has a better chance of resolving disputes over the government shutdown and debt ceiling.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama is ""disappointed"" that Boehner is ""preventing"" all 233 House Republicans from attending.

""The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country about how the shutdown and a failure to pay the country's bills could devastate the economy,"" Carney said.

Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said that ""nine days into a government shutdown and a week away from breaching the debt ceiling, a meeting is only worthwhile if it is focused on finding a solution -- that's why the House Republican Conference will instead be represented by a smaller group of negotiators, including the elected leadership and certain committee chairmen.""

Many House Republicans are insisting that a new spending plan, or an increase in the debt ceiling, include a delay of the Obama health care law, a provision the president opposes.

Obama also met late Wednesday with members of the House Democratic caucus about the ongoing government shutdown and the prospect of a debt ceiling default.

House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Obama emphasized he is open to any discussion about the budget -- once the government is re-opened.

""We can talk when the government is open,"" Hoyer said. ""The government doesn't need to be shut.""

The president will also meet with Senate Democrats on Thursday, and Senate Republicans later in the week.

""This is about the president meeting with as many members of Congress as he can to talk about these very important issues and the need to make sure that we don't inflict severe damage on our economy and on our middle class unnecessarily,"" Carney said.

In recent days, Obama has refused House Republican requests to negotiate a new spending plan that would end the government shutdown and include a delay of the health care plan.

Obama is also refusing to negotiate on the need to raise the $16.7 trillion debt, which the Treasury Department expects to breach on Oct. 17, a week from Thursday.

The debt ceiling gives the government authority to borrow money to pay the nation's debts. Without an increase, the government faces a default that Obama says will create an ""economic shutdown."""

Ag Secretary Tom Vilsack says rural America is losing its political clout

Decline in rural population means fewer lawmakers advocating rural issues

Leaders say rural interests must work together to educate%2C advocate

WASHINGTON — When the top cheerleader for rural America has some harsh words for the people he represents, it might be time to take notice.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack delivered a dire warning to the 51 million farmers, ranchers and other residents inhabiting rural America before a farm group in Washington last month. His message: Rural Americans are becoming less relevant in the country's increasingly urban landscape and unless they find a way to reverse the trend their voice will continue to fall on deaf ears in Washington and around the world.

""Unless we respond and react, the capacity of rural America and its power and its reach will continue to decline,"" Vilsack said. ""Rural America, with a shrinking population, is becoming less and less relevant to the politics of this country, and we better recognize that, and we had better begin to reverse it.""

In the past four years, he said, more than 50% of rural counties have seen their population decline.

Vilsack pointed to rural America's diminishing impact as a reason Congress was unable to pass a farm bill in 2012 — during an election year. More than 80% of lawmakers are not representing rural areas, making it an uphill battle for those outside of urban areas to be heard in Washington by senators and representatives who may not fully understand or appreciate the role played by agriculture in the United States.

As their influence diminishes, lawmakers representing so-called non-metro America are left to collect a smaller piece of government spending. And they have less influence on laws and regulations that affect people in their areas.

""It's time for us to have an adult conversation with folks in rural America,"" said Vilsack, who urged those living in rural areas to be proactive and not to hang on to the successes of the past. ""We need a proactive message, not a reactive message. How are you going to encourage young people to want to be involved in rural America or farming if you don't have a proactive message? Because you are competing against the world now and opportunities everywhere. Young people have all of these opportunities.""

The former Iowa governor said the strong agricultural economy – supported by high commodity prices, growing demand for ethanol and other renewable fuels and the increased use of public land for recreation – has failed to improve the rural economy, where poverty rates hover at 17%, higher than in metropolitan areas.

During the 1990s, people flocked to rural areas to take advantage of the growth in jobs. But with fewer positions now available, a major incentive to move out of the big city has vanished. Rural America gained about 2.2 million people between 2000 and 2010, but the growth was about half of the previous decade, according to a review of U.S. Census Bureau data by Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire's Carsey Institute. Counties dependent on farming saw their population grow a meager 0.3% between 2000 and 2010, and only 29% of those counties actually gained people. The minimal growth rate was attributed entirely to births rather than people moving there.

Still, the analysis found more than a third of 2,051 rural counties experienced what's called a ""natural decrease"" — where more people are dying than are being born. Although population growth also slowed in metropolitan regions of the country from the 1990s, the rate last decade was still far greater — 10.8% — than in rural areas.

""I'd have a hard time really arguing with"" Vilsack's warning to rural America, said Michael McCurry, South Dakota's state demographer who also teaches at the state university in Brookings. ""Our rural people are not that significant. We don't have the votes. We don't have the voice, and, by golly, I just don't see it changing. Barring some massive plague or environmental disaster, we're going to continue becoming more urban.""

Rural America, which encompasses nearly 75% of the land area of the United States, currently accounts for about 16% of the country's population, the lowest in the nation's history. In fact, it has been almost a century since people living in rural America outnumbered those who resided in metro areas. The U.S. Census Bureau classifies rural areas as open country and settlements with fewer than 2,500 residents.

The reasons surrounding the slowing population growth compared with urban and suburban areas are complicated, but those who have studied the shift boil it down to one thing: fewer opportunities. The use of combines, tractors and other farming technology that began decades ago, along with the gradual consolidation of operations since then, have reduced the number of people needed to staff farms and ranches. Meanwhile, the growth of steel, automobile and other industries, along with a college education, pulled young people into urban areas where they got married and had children. Most did not return to their rural roots.

It is the same in much of the country today. As towns shrink, there is less demand for everyday services that create jobs. A school with smaller class sizes might have to lay off teachers or a business could abandon plans to open up a new plant, further siphoning off jobs and depriving the area of additional tax dollars needed for things such as repaving roads or improving emergency services.

In Iowa, where agriculture is the top industry, 74% of the state's population was rural in 1900 but by 1990 that figure slipped to 39%. The shift away from rural living has likely accelerated since then, according to those who study populations in America.

The change is even more noticeable by county. In Kenneth Johnson's analysis of Census Bureau data he found the agricultural county of Osceola in northwestern Iowa had 6,452 people in 2010 compared with 8,371 three decades earlier and 8,956 in 1910. In contrast, Dallas County, Iowa, which is on the fringe of the Des Moines metro area, has experienced significant gains in the past couple of decades. In 2010, its population was 66,135 compared with 29,513 in 1980 and 23,628 people in 1910.

John Cromartie, a geographer with USDA's Economic Research Service, participated in a University of Montana study that included visits to high school reunions in 21 rural communities across the country during 2008 and 2009. Interviews with people who stayed in the community and others who had moved away showed that the decline of a town had a direct impact on the psyche of people and affected whether they would want to return to raise their family or open a business.

"" 'When I was a kid there was a bowling alley here, two drugs stores where you could go get a soda, and it was just a bustling active place that was well kept up. Now look at it, ' "" Cromartie often heard from people he interviewed. "" 'Half the stores are closed up. No one comes down here anymore. It's not a place you would send your kids to go hang out.' ""

To be sure, some rural parts of the United States continue to prosper and many counties near metro areas have actually seen their ranks grow. In North Dakota, a decades-long streak of population erosion was reversed after a boom in coal, oil and natural gas attracted thousands of workers to the area.

For Vilsack and others, the struggle is finding a way to make rural America a place enticing enough for people — especially those in their 20s, 30s and 40s — to stay, work and raise their families.

Craig Hill, president of the Iowa Farm Bureau, said farm and other commodity groups need to advocate for the interests of agriculture, especially as the food supply comes under attack. Last year, for example, the meat industry was criticized for using trimmings, dubbed by some as ""pink slime,"" that have been added to beef since the early 1990s to reduce both costs and fat content. No deaths or illnesses have ever been linked to the additive.

""We went about our business assuming that consumers knew where food came from, and knew production practices and knew of the safety and the value that they are receiving,"" Hill said. ""We were unaware of how much the consumer didn't know about conventional agriculture.""

In Washington, some lawmakers have an equally difficult task convincing others in Congress that rural America still matters. In order to boost their presence, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said those representing rural America need to form coalitions to underscore the impact these forgotten areas have on the nation's well-being.

""That is a challenge in this country, where food is abundant and, for most people, affordable and taken for granted,"" Harkin said.

Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political science professor, said representatives and senators overseeing large rural areas need to press upon urban and suburban lawmakers that ""their fates are tied to rural America."" Sabato pointed to the recently averted crisis facing the dairy industry as an example.

A deal reached as part of the ""fiscal cliff"" talks in Washington earlier this month prevented dairy subsidies from reverting to 1949 levels, a move that could have caused milk prices to double to about $7 a gallon across the country. The lawmakers need ""to make the connection with their colleagues, to make the argument with their colleagues: here's how what's happening in my district affects yours,"" Sabato said, noting it would take significant time for the push to have a meaningful impact in Congress.

Farmers and lawmakers representing agriculture-intensive states or districts strongly disagree with Vilsack's analysis of a declining of rural America. While their political power in Washington may have eroded, farmers and ranchers point to the food, fuel and jobs they produce, along with their impact on the country's economy, as evidence of their ongoing importance.

""It's a little disappointing to hear the secretary of this great nation make a comment like that. We have less power as a vote, but as far as relevancy, we are more relevant today than we've ever been."" said Justin Dammann, who raises corn, soybeans and cow calves near Essex, in far southwest Iowa.""I kind of question if (Secretary Vilsack is) not just trying to get us fired up.""

McCurry, South Dakota's demographer, has lived in rural America most of his life. The 63-year-old grew up in northwest Montana and now lives 15 miles away from the South Dakota State University campus. He has no plans to leave behind the many trees and beautiful sunrises and sunsets he sees from his home.

""For me, I'm pretty comfortable there,"" McCurry said. ""I live in this place where I got a little fish pond. I do have to shoot the rabbits when they get into my garden, but it's a pleasant and a quiet life and I enjoy it."""

WASHINGTON -- House Republicans said Saturday that the White House has rejected their offer to temporarily increase the debt ceiling and open the government.

Members leaving a closed-door meeting said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told them talks with President Barack Obama on how to end the government shutdown and avert the looming Oct. 17 deadline to raise the nation's borrowing cap, had reached a dead end. There was also concern that the White House might strike a deal with Senate Republicans, who presented their own plan to Obama on Friday.

Many lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), said it was now up to their colleagues in the Senate to hold firm so that Republicans in both chambers would appear united.

""I'm disappointed that the president has rejected the offer that we put on the table,"" Cantor told reporters after the meeting. ""I know that he's trying to see which Republican senator he can pick off in the Senate. I hope that the Senate Republicans stand strong so we can speak with one voice.""

House Republicans had put forward a proposal to extend the debt limit for six weeks and work quickly to reopen the government, if the president agreed to a broader framework for deficit reduction. They presented the plan to Obama in a meeting at the White House Thursday evening. Both sides said afterward that discussions would continue, though neither the White House nor GOP leadership said they were close to a deal.

Members suggested both sides wanted to keep the appearance of potential for progress, even though Obama rejected their plan in a phone call with Boehner on Friday.

Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) paraphrased Boehner's message to the conference as, ""Every offer we've made, they've just turned us down.""

He added it was a ""White House talking point"" that the two sides were still talking.

""What [Boehner's] really saying is, 'I'm not shutting the door on further discussions, but right now nothing is happening',"" he said.

Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) said the White House requested that House leadership ""stick with the line that talks were proceeding."" ""That line was continued, and then late yesterday afternoon, the president called and they declined every part of the offer,"" he said.

An aide to Boehner declined comment.

Price said while there was concern over Obama's negotiations with Senate Republicans, he didn't think their plan would pass the upper chamber. Sources told The Huffington Post that a bipartisan group of 10 senators, five from each party, are ironing out the details of a plan floated by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). It would reportedly fund the government through March, raise the debt ceiling through January, give federal agencies flexibility to manage across-the-board cuts caused by sequestration, and delay Obamacare's medical device tax by two years.

""I think the timing on that is challenging,"" Price said. ""We want to get back to a regular order process where we're doing appropriations bills and putting Congress' stamp of priorities on the spending of this government.""

""We hope that our Senate Republican colleagues stand with us united to force the president to have a conversation,"" he added.

Conservative House members outright rejected the Collins' plan and were skeptical it would pass the Senate, let alone the House.

""The idea that Susan Collins can dictate what happens in the Senate is kind of silly,"" Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) said. ""They can negotiate all day long, but obviously at the end of the day it has to pass the House.""

Fleming said the plan was dead on arrival in the House. ""They're not going to get that, because we're not going to support it,"" he said.

UPDATE: 2:05 p.m. -- Senate Democratic leadership rejected the Collins plan Saturday afternoon. A senior Democratic aide said the proposal is pretty unpopular among most Democrats, for two reasons: It locks in the current level of sequestration, minus another $20 billion in 2014, and it makes changes to Obamacare.

""Why would Dems ever support that?"" asked the aide. ""It's crazy that it got this far.""

Negotiations are now in the hands of Senate leaders Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said McConnell requested a meeting with Reid, and that the two sat down with Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn) in Reid's office Saturday morning to hash out a way forward.

The contours of a deal were far from apparent, but Jentleson added both the White House and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) office were ""fully engaged"" as talks progressed.

Atlantic Club casino -- formerly the Hilton -- closes Jan. 13

1%2C600 jobs will be lost

%27Idea of casinos was to give the local people jobs%2C not take jobs away from them%27

ATLANTIC CITY — A Blue Christmas doesn't begin to describe what many workers at the doomed Atlantic Club Casino Hotel will have Wednesday.

Two days before Christmas, a bankruptcy court judge approved the sale of the casino -- formerly known as the Atlantic City Hilton -- to two competitors. They will strip it for parts and close it Jan. 13.

Some workers say they're cutting way back on Christmas presents for kids, looking to sell their homes and researching how to file for unemployment and food stamps.

Annette Flack, a food server at the casino, says she now has to worry about paying for health insurance and keeping the gas turned on.

""I bought my son a zip-up sweater he liked,"" she said outside the courtroom, her eyes still wet with tears. ""My daughter in college? I told her I got a couple small things, but your Christmas gift this year is going to college. It's disgusting how they did it and when they did it, the timing. It's not a Merry Christmas when they can team up to crush the weak ones.""

Under a deal reached Friday and approved by judge Gloria Burns on Monday, two rival casino companies with a presence in Atlantic City, Tropicana Entertainment and Caesars Entertainment, will buy the casino for $23.4 million and shut it down. Tropicana will take the slot machines and table games, while Caesars will get the 800-plus-room hotel.

Neither has any interest in operating the business in Atlantic City's now diminished market. Atlantic City will have 11 casinos after the shutdown.

The judge noted the timing of the shutdown.

""I feel badly that it didn't come out in a better way,"" she said. ""This is not palatable to the people who are going to be losing their jobs. It's not lost on me that lots of people are losing their jobs, especially at this time of year.""

Catherine Irizarry has worked 27 years as a cocktail server at the casino, which opened in 1980 as The Golden Nugget, and whose commercials featured then-owner Steve Wynn bringing fresh towels to Frank Sinatra.

In subsequent years, the casino was renamed Bally's Grand Hotel and Casino and then the Hilton before becoming the Atlantic Club in early 2012.

""I'm still in shock,"" Irizarry said. ""I never thought it would end this way. I'm not ready to retire yet. I'm 56 years old — where am I going?""

She said she planned to spend Christmas Day with co-workers, whom she called ""my second family,"" before they soon go their separate ways.

""You wake up and you feel like it's a dream that will go away,"" she said. ""And then it never does.""

Fran Critch also cried as she looked ahead to Christmas, and her uncertain future. She has worked as a food server at the Atlantic Club for 29 years.

""We're thinking of selling our house, like a lot of people here are,"" she said. ""A guy I know has already applied for food stamps.""

She and other soon-to-be jobless workers said none of the 11 other casinos are hiring, and said there are few other jobs in the region.

Atlantic City's main casino workers union succeeded in getting the Atlantic Club to make $1,500 severance payments to about 650 of the 1,600 casino workers who were union members. But the shutdown came too abruptly to organize a toy drive for the families of laid-off workers, as the union was able to do when Resorts laid off dozens of workers before Christmas three years ago. The union is planning a forum soon where it will help workers file for jobless benefits, food stamps and other aid to which they may be entitled.

But none of that makes up for having a job at Christmastime, said Mary Creedon, a cocktail server at the casino since the day it opened 33 years ago.

""We're losing our jobs, we're losing our medical insurance, and the future prospect for jobs is not bright,"" she said. ""Most of us are in our 50s or 60s.""

Janice Kavkeano, another employee from day one, remembered what the big selling point was in the 1976 campaign to legalize casino gambling in New Jersey.

""The idea of casinos was to give the local people jobs, not take jobs away from them,"" she said. ""I was there on the day this place opened and I'll be there on the day we close."""

McDonnell described as aware of gifts from Virginia businessman,"Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell was aware of gifts and financial help provided by a wealthy Richmond area businessman during the same months the governor and his wife took steps to help his company, according to people familiar with documents and interviews gathered by federal investigators.

For example, McDonnell (R) was present at a charity auction in 2011 when the chief executive of Star Scientific, which makes a dietary supplement, successfully bid on a fashion tour of New York for the governor’s wife in front of a crowd of onlookers, witnesses said.

Separately, the executive, Jonnie R. Williams Sr., flew the governor and his wife on a weekend trip to Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, over Labor Day weekend last year. And Williams repeatedly allowed the governor, his sons and staff to play golf and buy golf gear at elite Richmond area country clubs, running up more than $7,000 on Williams’s tab, according to the documents turned over to authorities.

Each of these newly public examples of Williams’s generosity came on top of more than $150,000 worth of valuables and money The Washington Post has previously reported — gifts that Williams provided to the governor’s family over more than 18 months in 2011 and 2012.

People familiar with accounts that Williams and others have provided to investigators, as well as witnesses interviewed by The Post, say each of those gifts came with the governor’s knowledge — contrasting with an assertion by McDonnell’s attorneys that he was in the dark about the extent of the gifts Williams bestowed on his family.

View Graphic Timeline: Star Scientific and Gov. McDonnell

Attorneys for the governor and first lady Maureen McDonnell argued to federal prosecutors two weeks ago that the governor should not be charged with any crimes, in part because of this ignorance, people familiar with the sessions said.

The governor could not have been influenced to improperly help the Star Scientific executive, they asserted, based on gifts he didn’t know about at the time. The couple’s attorneys told prosecutors that Maureen McDonnell worked to hide Williams’s gifts because she feared her husband’s disapproval, the people said.

Case status

What had been an unusually fast-paced investigation has hit some delays as prosecutors consider the evidence, including the governor’s account and new information, several people familiar with the probe say.

In recent weeks, the governor’s legal team lost a secret court battle to withhold from prosecutors internal office communications, those people said. McDonnell’s attorneys said the papers were protected by attorney-client privilege because they concerned communications between the governor and some staff members who are lawyers.

Prosecutors have now asked the governor’s and first lady’s attorneys to return for a second round of discussions no later than the week of Sept. 15, during which prosecutors are expected to lay out the key elements of the case, said a person familiar with the schedule.

Prosecutors could decide whether to file charges after the meetings, the person said. But the timing is somewhat tricky, because voters go to the polls Nov. 5 to select McDonnell’s successor, and prosecutors may want to avoid a perception that their work is influencing the results, people familiar with the investigation said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment.

Rich Galen, a spokesman for the governor’s legal team, said the “evidence is clear” that McDonnell complied with state disclosure laws, which require that elected officials report all gifts worth at least $50 but do not require that gifts to immediate family members be made public.

McDonnell has disclosed receiving $9,650 in gifts from Williams and Star Scientific, including private plane trips and a summer lake-house vacation.

On Friday, Galen said that Williams’s version of events cannot be trusted, and he stressed that neither Williams nor his company received any state grants, loans, contracts or similar tangible state benefits. Bill Burck, an attorney for Maureen McDonnell, said it is not surprising that the first couple socialized with Williams, since they were all friends.

Galen noted that a Star spokeswoman has previously said that the company never sought any special benefits from the state.

Williams’s version

Williams and other Star Scientific officials have provided investigators with extensive details of gifts Williams gave to the governor and his relatives, and in some cases, their accounts differ from the governor’s about McDonnell’s role and knowledge, according to people familiar with the evidence.

Those accounts show that Williams arranged to be reimbursed by his company for many of the gifts, a sign that he viewed the gifts as a business expense that would pay dividends to the company.

The company has told investigators that corporate officials initially were not aware that Williams was tapping company accounts to pay for gifts to the McDonnells, other than when Williams formally sought reimbursement for plane trips he provided to McDonnell for campaign events, according to people familiar with their accounts.

Jerry Kilgore, an attorney for Williams, declined to comment, as did Abbe Lowell, Star’s attorney.

People familiar with the probe say Williams and the company have turned over records showing that he paid for golf outings for the governor at elite country clubs in the Richmond area a half-dozen times between May and September 2011. The records are also said to indicate that Star reimbursed Williams that year for $7,500 in greens fees, golf equipment and apparel for the governor, his twin college-aged sons and members of his staff.

Star, likewise, underwrote a trip Williams arranged for the governor and first lady to Cape Cod a year ago, paying for private plane travel and a stay at a seaside inn.

The governor’s disclosure form appears to report the gift, noting that Star paid nearly $7,400 for flights between Richmond and Massachusetts, lodgings and event expenses in 2012.

The disclosure form doesn’t note these details: that the first couple went together to the Cape, joined by Williams, Williams’s wife and Johns Hopkins University doctor Paul Ladenson, who has served as a top consultant to Star. The weekend was part of a campaign by Williams to sell the governor and other top state officials on his company’s new dietary supplement, Anatabloc, the people said.

Ladenson, who also attended a luncheon hosted by the first lady at the governor’s mansion to mark the launch of Anatabloc in 2011, did not respond to requests for comment.

Virginia State Police records show taxpayers paid $2,967.83 for the governor’s protective detail to join him for the five-day stay at the Chatham Bars Inn, a hotel once described by Boston Magazine as a likely haunt of a modern-day Jay Gatsby.

That same Labor Day weekend, Williams also used personal credit card reward points to pay for McDonnell’s then-24-year-old daughter, Rachel, and a friend to fly to Florida for a vacation, according to people familiar with his account. The trip was described as a graduate school graduation present.

Another example of Williams’s gift-giving submitted to investigators involved a September 2011 fundraiser in Richmond for the American Cancer Society, which Williams attended as a guest of the first lady. The event, “Cure By Design,” featured a fashion show with cancer survivors as models and an auction of clothing and other fashion-related items.

Williams arranged for a male model with whom he is friends to travel to Richmond from New York for the event and escort Maureen McDonnell down the catwalk, recalled designer Alex Garfield, who served as a celebrity auctioneer at the event. Pictures on the charity’s Facebook page show the governor and first lady posing with Williams, the model and Garfield.

Garfield recalled that as the auction began, the governor appeared on the stage to take part. In front of a large audience, Williams agreed to pay $15,000, the winning bid, to give the first lady one of the evening’s most prized items: a weekend in New York and a tour of the fashion district conducted by Garfield.

“The governor was standing on the stage next to me,” Garfield said. “We were watching everybody. If he knew [Williams], he knew it.”

Although Williams paid for the trip, Garfield indicated that the first lady hadn’t claimed her prize.

Governor’s version

McDonnell has said he once considered Williams — whom he met shortly before his 2009 campaign for governor — a “family friend.”

“The McDonnells and Williams families were friends. They socialized together because of their friendship. The notion that there was anything else to it is just plain wrong,” Burck, the attorney for Maureen McDonnell, said Friday.

Since news emerged that Williams is cooperating with prosecutors, the governor’s spokesman has described the executive as someone long in trouble with government entities. On Friday, Galen said Williams needs to “appear to be cooperating” to avoid his own legal troubles.

Galen called Williams “hardly a credible source” and said evidence will show that Williams repeatedly “falsified his expense accounts with respect to his claimed dealings with the Governor and Mrs. McDonnell.”

In an e-mail exchange with The Post, Galen did not address the most recently discovered gifts from Williams to the governor and his family.

McDonnell apologized last month for breaching the public’s trust in his interactions with Williams. But he has also said publicly that he was not aware of all of Williams’s gifts.

For example, attorneys for the first couple told prosecutors in their August meeting that Maureen McDonnell did not initially tell her husband that Williams took her on a $15,000 shopping trip in New York in spring 2011. Nor did she tell him that Williams was the source of a $6,500 Rolex watch, inscribed with the words “71st Governor of Virginia,” which she gave the governor for Christmas that year, the McDonnells’ attorneys said.

Many of McDonnell’s loyalists have long maintained quietly that the governor was a victim of his wife’s excesses and was so busy with state business that he had little time to monitor her behavior.

As a legal matter, ignorance could be helpful to the governor if it helps him convince prosecutors that he was not taking action in exchange for Williams’s gifts and that his wife was not working on Williams’s behalf when she used her role and state offices to help the company.

Attorneys for the governor and first lady maintain that he also was initially unaware that she on several occasions bought stock in Star Scientific, purchases that gave his family a financial stake in the company as she was simultaneously promoting the company at Star events across the country.

They have said publicly that the governor’s actions to help the company were limited, were not out of the ordinary and were not undertaken as part of any exchange with Williams.

Those actions are even less problematic, they have argued to prosecutors, when paired with how little he knew about his wife’s actions.

Prosecutors are now weighing that claim, along with Star corporate records and other evidence they have gathered over a months-long investigation. People familiar with Williams’s account have said that the executive has told prosecutors that he and the governor had discussed ways to help Star.

The governor’s allies have bemoaned leaks of allegations that have surfaced in the probe, and Galen said in a written statement that the leaks were intended to “harm the reputation of Governor McDonnell and his family.”

“It is important for citizens to take much of what Mr. Williams says with a grain of salt,” Galen said."

The job pays $5.25 an hour, plus tips. “I’m glad I don’t have a family,” Stewart said. “Because if I had a family, man, we’d be hit.” (Will Figg/For The Washington Post)

The alarm rang on John Stewart’s phone at 1:10 a.m. Up at 1:30, he caught one bus north into Philadelphia a little after 2 and another bus, south toward the airport, half an hour after that. He made it into work around 3:25 for a shift that started at 4, for a job that pays $5.25 an hour, which he cannot afford to lose.

Stewart is 55, tall and thin and animated. At work he wears a clip-on tie, a white cotton shirt with a fraying collar and a pair of black sneakers he nabbed on sale for $12.99 a few days ago. He wheels elderly air passengers from the ticket counters through security and to their gates, and back again, and every once in a while they tip him. Usually for lunch he buys a candy bar. His skin flakes from psoriasis, which gets worse when he worries, which, these days, is all the time. He can’t pay for treatments to soothe the itching or for a car to shorten his pre-dawn commute.

“I can’t save money,” he said recently, “to buy the things I need to live as a human being.”

American workers are living with unprecedented economic anxiety, four years into a recovery that has left so many of them stuck in place. That anxiety is concentrated heavily among low-income workers such as Stewart.

More than six in 10 workers in a recent Washington Post-Miller Center poll worry that they will lose their jobs to the economy, surpassing concerns in more than a dozen surveys dating to the 1970s. Nearly one in three, 32 percent, say they worry “a lot” about losing their jobs, also a record high, according to the joint survey, which explores Americans’ changing definition of success and their confidence in the country’s future. The Miller Center is a nonpartisan affiliate of the University of Virginia specializing in public policy, presidential scholarship and political history.

View Graphic Lower-income workers have job and income worries.

Job insecurities have always been higher among low-income Americans, but they typically rose and fell across all levels of the income ladder. Today, workers at the bottom have drifted away, occupying their own island of in­security.

Fifty-four percent of workers making $35,000 or less now worry “a lot” about losing their jobs, compared with 37 percent of ­lower-income workers in 1992 and an identical number in 1975, according to surveys by Time magazine, CNN and Yankelovich, a market research firm. Intense worry is far lower, 29 percent, among workers with incomes between $35,000 and $75,000, and it drops to 17 percent among those with incomes above that level.

Lower-paid workers also worry far more about making ends meet. Fully 85 percent of them fear that their families’ income will not be enough to meet expenses, up 25 points from a 1971 survey asking an identical question. Thirty-two percent say they worry all the time about meeting expenses, a number that has almost tripled since the 1970s.

Americans’ economic perceptions often divide along political lines; supporters of the incumbent president are usually more optimistic about the job market and the health of the economy. But that’s not the case with this new anxiety. Once you control for economic and demographic factors, there is no partisan divide. There’s no racial divide, either, and no gender gap. It also doesn’t matter where you live.

What matters in this new anxiety, what unites the people who worry more now than ever, are income and education. Workers who earn less, and workers who didn’t graduate from college, fear losing their already weaker livelihoods more than anyone else.

Spend a day with John Stewart — a man who has worked low-wage jobs since the late ’70s — and you start to understand why.

Back then, fewer worries

His first job — he doesn’t remember if it was in 1978 or ’79 — was cooking eggs and pancakes at a five-and-dime in New York City. He made $2.35 an hour, which would be a little less than $8 an hour today. He was 19 years old, a high school graduate who had grown up in Brooklyn and North Carolina. He hadn’t gone to college. He was sending chunks of his paycheck south to his parents, who were battling health issues. It was an anxious time in the national economy, with inflation running high.

He worried hardly at all, about any of it.

“In the years back then,’’ Stewart explained recently, “if you left a job, you were able to find another job, within the next day or the same week.”

He did leave that cooking job, fairly quickly. He found work right away as a messenger, running documents all over the city. In later years he would work in offices and at a trash dump infested with rats. He tried college for six months but left when his mother died. He has never gone back, though he would like to; he says he has never had the time or money for school. Eventually he landed in New Jersey at a Wal-Mart, poised, he thought, for a manager’s job. But he lost the promotion chance and the job — he was late to work too often, because of unreliable public transportation, he says — and in the fall of 2010 he retreated to Philadelphia to live with a cousin and look for a new gig.

This time, finding a job took him five months. It’s sadly typical for this recovery: In October, more than 4 million Americans had been looking for work longer than six months. That was down from nearly 7 million people at the start of 2010, but still 1 million more than at any point in U.S. history before the Great Recession.

When Stewart finally got the job at the airport, through a man at his church, he thought he was signing on for $7.25 an hour. On the first day they told him no, it’s $5.25 plus whatever tips come your way. That’s not usually very much. He brings home about $600 most months after taxes and accounting for unpaid sick days, he says. He pays a family friend $400 a month to live in her basement.

It makes him grateful to be a bachelor: “I’m glad I don’t have a family,” Stewart said. “Because if I had a family, man, we’d be hit.”

He has held the job for two years, arriving hours before sunrise on the circuitous bus route that takes more than an hour to cover what would be a quick ­seven-mile drive.

Before the shift begins at 4 a.m. he sits with colleagues, usually chatting about family and friends and complaining about work. On a recent Thursday, his first assignment came at 4:05. He picked up a 91-year-old woman at the counter and wheeled her through security, helping her shed her coat and walk through the checkpoint. It was a cold morning in the terminal, as usual, and he wore a blue jacket over a navy windbreaker over a navy sweater over his usual shirt and tie. At the gate she tipped him. He wouldn’t say how much.

Tips vary from day to day — sometimes he leaves work with enough cash in his pocket for a takeout dinner. Sometimes hardly any at all. Some folks bark directions sternly at the man pushing them around. Some passengers in the terminal curse him when they need to move as he rolls the chairs through. One man tried to fight him after Stewart asked him several times to make way.

The job is hardest before the sun comes up, Stewart said, but he tries to treat every day like he’s “going to a party” when morning comes.

“I believe in God,” he said, “and I try to keep that smile on my face, even though I may be struggling.”

He is usually tired by 6 a.m.

“My feet hurt now,” he said, boarding the bus, shortly after his shift ended at noon. “I’m tired. I always get tired.”

A stagnant labor market

There is a reason workers like Stewart are so nervous in today’s economy. That reason is the economy itself. There are still 11 million Americans looking for work who can’t find a job. The unemployment rate is 7.3 percent, higher than it has been since 1980, except during recessions and their immediate aftermaths. Adjusting for inflation, average household incomes for the poorest 40 percent of workers have fallen steadily — by more than 10 percent, total — since 2000.

Lower-income workers get most of their money from wages, as opposed to investments or other capital gains, said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute, who writes extensively about unemployment and income.

“It’s no surprise that security concerns are off the map now [among those workers] because the labor market is so bad,” Shierholz said. “High unemployment hurts workers across the board, but it hurts workers with low and moderate incomes more.”

Even worse, there aren’t many signs that job and wage growth will rocket upward anytime soon — especially for workers like Stewart without college degrees.

“High-paying jobs for people who didn’t go to college just aren’t there anymore” in large numbers, said Melissa Kearney, an economist who directs the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution.

As low-income workers tightly grip their current jobs, few are seeking the skills and education often required to land better-

paying ones, the Post-Miller Center poll suggests. Fewer than four in 10 of those earning less than $35,000 annually said they’ve taken training programs in the past year to update their knowledge or skills, compared with about half of middle-income workers and nearly two-thirds of those whose household income tops $75,000.

Several economists say there’s a simple explanation for that gap: Poorer people can’t spare the time or money to go to school. Stewart, for example, would love to ditch his airport job to work as a hospital aide, hopefully for higher pay and at least some health benefits. (His job now offers none.) He’d need to take classes to earn a certification to qualify for that work. He has no idea how he’d swing that, financially. But he has hope that he will — and that, too, is typical of low-earning, anxious workers today.

Nearly six in 10 of those workers think it’s likely they’ll find a new job that pays better in the next five years, compared with fewer than four in 10 middle- and upper-income workers. Almost half expect a significant raise at their current job in the next half-decade, again outpacing the optimism of those who currently take home more.

Day to day, though, Stewart battles fatigue and depression. He rode two buses home from work when his Thursday shift ended, then hopped off and walked a few blocks toward his basement apartment. He had visitors, so he sat in the upstairs living room, near a computer table with pictures of the smiling Obama family, and talked for almost an hour.

But if it were a normal day, he said, if he were alone, he’d have walked off the bus and into the house and straight downstairs. He’d strip off his shirt and light a cigarette and lie down. Just to take it easy, for a bit.

Federal parks and museums would be closed

Even weddings would be affected

Federal workers worry about missing paychecks

In Plymouth, Mass., Cassandra Lester worries about the stress her fiancé faces as a Marine veteran receiving disability and other benefits who might not be able to ""pay bills, school, rent.""

In Lansing, Mich., Jessica Yorko says she is in the middle of a mortgage refinance and worries that a federal shutdown will delay her FHA loan and cost her a locked-in loan rate.

More than 40% of federal workers across the nation face furlough if the government shuts down Tuesday. Social Security recipients will receive benefits, mail service will continue and taxes will still be collected. But the impact will be great, and it will spread far beyond Washington and the federal buildings scattered across the nation.

Lester, 27, says that when government workers were furloughed in 2011, the couple went four months without military benefits because paperwork wasn't processed. Now her fiancé is due to complete his studies as a diesel technician in November, and she is concerned that he may not receive any educational or disability benefits during a shutdown — ""and of course, we cannot get anyone on the phone at the VA,"" she says.

She says their situation is more stable now than in 2011, but as they plan their wedding, they are dogged by concerns about paying their bills if the shutdown lasts too long and a VA paperwork backlog develops.

""He worked for this money. It is his money,"" she says. ""We assumed that the money for veterans was secured and set aside in accounts for the veterans. He put his life on the line for two deployments to Iraq in the thick of wartime only to have spoiled politicians, who have all their bills comfortably paid, for us to become default on our bills and unable to pay rent.""

Cyndi Luttrell, 49, works at a federal data processing facility in Jeffersonville, Ind. She and more than 800 co-workers have been told that if the government shuts down, they will be sent home.

""Eighty percent of us normally earn $30,000 a year or less,"" she says. ""We have mortgages, kids, student loans. If we miss even one or two days of pay, that's a lot to us. We have lives out here that Congress is messing with.""

Head Start centers will close if the government does. In the Tallahassee area, that would hit nearly 400 children, their families and 100 staffers.

""We're providing a very robust preschool experience to children who live in families in poverty,"" said Tim Center, executive director of the Capital Area Community Action Agency, which administers the program in a three-county area. ""And that enables those parents to go to school, find work or go to a job. And you take away child care, parents can't go to work.""

Head Start serves 378 children ages 3 and 4, offering not only preschool but also medical, dental and mental-health care and a variety of social and other services. Children in the program receive breakfast, lunch and an afternoon snack, food they might not get otherwise, Center said.

The shutdown would slam the gates and shut the doors of places such as national parks, historic sites, the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, where the animals will be cared for but the panda cam will go dark.

The historic district of Philadelphia is a tourist mecca, with thousands of visitors daily crowding Independence Mall, the Liberty Bell and other historic sites. That won't be the case if the federal government shuts down. And that doesn't bode well for the shops and vendors that cater to those tourists.

""It'll have a big effect,"" one tourist in the crowded mall area told the local CBS affiliate. ""Nobody's going to be going into the stores to eat or buy anything. I don't know how they can do that (close the sites). This is history. Look at all these people.""

If the museums and monuments shut down and are still closed on Oct. 16, 270 eighth graders from John Witherspoon Middle School in Princeton, N.J., will be very disappointed, principal Jason Burr says.

His eighth graders visit Washington every year as part of their civics course. They tour the Capitol, the Smithsonian museums and all the monuments.

""They look forward to this more than any other thing they do all year,"" he says.

The trip is usually in May, but it was planned for off-peak travel this year. Thinking about last October, when Superstorm Sandy hit, Burr says he was worried about the possibility of bad weather.

""I didn't think I would have to be worried about a government shutdown,"" he says. ""I hope cooler heads prevail,"" he says.

The Mississippi Gulf Coast Honor Flight will escort 91 World War II veterans from the Gulf Coast to the World War II Memorial on Tuesday morning whether the government is open or closed, says Rep. Steven Palazzo, R-Miss., who will be there to greet them.

If the government shuts down, the National Park Service will erect barricades around the memorials on the National Mall and close the two streets that flank it, NPS spokeswoman Carol Johnson said. The Park Service won't have the money to staff the memorials, she said.

""It's a huge disservice to our World War II veterans, to whom we owe so much,"" Palazzo said. ""For them to step off the bus and be met with Park Service personnel and barricades, it's heartbreaking. And it makes me fighting mad.""

For many of the veterans, who range in age from 84 to 98, it is their first trip to Washington, Palazzo said. Veterans groups from 10 other states are scheduled to visit the memorial over the next week, he said.

""It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see the memorial erected in their honor,"" he said.

Palazzo sent a letter Monday to President Obama and made phone calls to the National Park Service about access to the memorials. He said he doesn't understand why the federal government must restrict access to an open-air park.

""Why would they spend the time and effort to barricade something that's generally open to the public day and night?"" he said. ""They are going to have to spend extra money just to keep people out.""

Thousands of runners are registered for Sunday's Woodrow Wilson Bridge Half Marathon that starts near George Washington's Mount Vernon, Va., homestead and includes several miles along the George Washington Memorial Parkway, which is operated by the National Park Service.

The Park Service said Monday that if the government closes, all of its programs will be canceled. Race officials posted a note on Facebook that ""since our first 8 miles are in a National Park, we could be affected. We will be making a public statement on Wednesday to update all of our runners.""

At Crater Lake National Park in Oregon, the first step would be closing the gates. People already camping would have until 6 p.m. Thursday to leave.

Park employees would show up for about four hours to close all the gates, update phone greetings and then leave.

""A few law enforcement rangers and water treatment and snowplow operators would stay on, but that would be it,"" said Marsha McCabe, public information officer at the park.

A similar scenario would play out at campsites, day-use sites and parks run by the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management across the country. At recreation destinations with no controlled access, the public could visit but there would be no services available for emergencies.

In West Texas at Big Bend National Park, an 800,000-acre expanse of soaring canyons and hiking trails near the Mexican border, Danny Ferguson says Forever Resorts, which provides concessions for hotels and RV parks in and around the park, has had only two cancellations, but he expected many more if the shutdown takes place.

The crisis comes at the worst time, he said; October is one of the park's busiest months and hotel rooms are nearly 100% reserved.

A shutdown even threatens wedded bliss.

The National Mall and Memorial Parks have issued 24 permits for October weddings at the Lincoln Memorial, George Mason Memorial and the D.C. War Memorial, spokeswoman Carol Johnson says. An e-mail went out Monday telling prospective brides and grooms, who apply for the permits up to a year in advance, that if the government shuts down, all events are canceled, she says.

""Those memorials will be closed,"" Johnson said. ""I think people will be quite upset. Unfortunately, it's beyond our control.""

The Mall itself, the grassy swath that reaches from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, would close. Barricades would block Jefferson and Madison drives, the roads that flank the Mall, and some of the memorials themselves. Public restrooms will be locked. Even the fountains that grace the parks will go dry, she said. Trash pickup at federal park properties will be suspended, including federal spaces throughout the city, such as Farragut Square Park and Dupont Circle.

Bottom line: Thousands of people will not get to see what they came to Washington to see.

""We get 1,200 buses filled with 50 people a day, easily thousands of people,"" Johnson said. ""A lot of people are going to be very disappointed.""

If California's Yosemite National Park closes, weddings scheduled at the two hotels inside the park, the Ahwahnee and the Wawona, will move to the Tenaya Lodge, a hotel and resort a few miles from the park's southern gate, says Lisa Cesaro, spokeswoman for DNC Parks and Resorts at Yosemite, which runs all three hotels.

""We do have some weddings for the coming week, so we're on standby. We have a contingency plan in the workswith alternative accommodations,"" Cesaro said.

The couples who have booked the weddings are moving ahead with their plans, she said.

""It's really unfortunate. This is not a situation you'd want to be in as a bride, but we're optimistic,"" she said. ""We'll just have to wait and see. If it happens, we'll work around it and do our best to accommodate everyone.""

Not everyone is concerned about the shutdown, however. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and others demanding that ""Obamacare"" be defunded as part of a deal to avert the crisis have their supporters, too.

""The gov't shutdown will save us all some money, my life won't be affected at all,"" tweeted Jason Sipes, pastor of West Hickman (Ky.) Baptist Church. ""Thank you Mr. Cruz for sticking up for us.""

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is a busy place.

It has been examining the Internal Revenue Service, postal reform, border security and other high-profile issues.

Now Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) turns the committee’s attention to a series of federal employee-related bills that have fallen into the legislative hopper by flying far below the public’s radar.

Federal employee groups wish some of the measures would crash before takeoff.

On Wednesday, the committee is scheduled to vote on several pieces of legislation, including those that would prohibit employee bonuses for the rest of this fiscal year, allow agencies to place senior executives on “investigative leave without pay,” and facilitate the taping of employee telephone conversations by taxpayers.

With all the angst about government surveillance of telephone and other communications, Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) wants to turn the tables. “The Citizen Empowerment Act” would “require most federal agency employees to provide individuals with a verbal or written notice of the individual’s right to record a conversation before a meeting or telephone call,” according to a statement from her office.

The legislation, she said, would “give individuals a new tool to fight back, and allow citizens to protect themselves or their businesses when a government official comes calling.”

Fight back?

“The real intent of this legislation is to vilify federal employees and make us appear untrustworthy,” said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) wants to stop federal employee bonuses for the rest of this fiscal year and cap them at 5 percent of salary through fiscal 2015. “The federal government has no business handing out millions in bonuses to senior-level staff,” he said, while at the same time furloughing employees.

The National Treasury Employees Union opposes the bill, saying “performance awards . . . serve the important purpose of recognizing performance above established standards, and in that way, encourage and reward high-performing federal employees.”

Senior Executive Service members would be punished before being found guilty of misconduct under the Government Employee Accountability Act, introduced by Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.). The legislation, which passed the House last year, would allow agencies to place senior executives on “investigative leave without pay.”

The legislation, Kelly said, would “stop those under investigation from receiving salaries paid for by the very public whose trust they abused.” But if the situations are under investigation, then apparently it hasn’t been finally demonstrated that the employees abused the public’s trust.

“To the uninformed, Rep. Kelly’s bill sounds sensible, however, Senior Executives already serve at considerable risk since they have virtually no effective appeal rights,” said Carol A. Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association. The bill, she added, would create a “guilty until proven innocent” standard.

Bipartisan legislation offered by Texas Reps. Henry Cuellar (D) and Michael McCaul (R) seeks to improve federal government services through the establishment of government-wide standards to improve response times. The Office of Management and Budget would set the standards and the chief performance officer at each agency would be responsible for improving customer service.

“Too often we hear that Americans are frustrated with government service,” Cuellar said. “It is our responsibility to act when we hear that students are having difficulty with federal student loans or when seniors experience a delay in their retirement benefits. Every taxpayer every day will benefit from this legislation.”

Another bipartisan bill targets government waste by requiring Uncle Sam to produce more reports.

“The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act addresses federal government waste by requiring each federal agency to produce an annual report that identifies every program with a description of the program and its costs, expenditures for services, beneficiaries of services and number of staff,” said a statement from the office of Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who sponsored the bill with Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). “This information would be posted online with recommendations from each agency to improve efficiency.”

Issa’s bill to reform the long-ailing U.S. Postal Service also is on the agenda. It would do a number of things, including phasing out Saturday delivery of bills and letters, but continue six-day delivery of packages and medicine. The Postal Service would be allowed to forget about past-due payments to pre-fund retiree health-care benefits and the payments for this fiscal year and next would be eliminated.

Postal employees would pay more for health insurance benefits, and postal labor contracts would not be allowed to have no-layoff clauses.

“The legislation incorporates reforms offered by members of both sides of the aisle and builds upon months of bipartisan and bicameral discussions,” Issa said.

American Postal Workers Union President Cliff Guffey said Issa’s plan isn’t as bad as one previously advanced, but is still “deeply disturbing.” The union is urging its members to fight the bill by calling lawmakers.

“This bill would have a devastating effect on the Postal Service and on postal employees, as well as the American people,” said Gary Kloepfer, APWU legislative and political director. “We must do everything we can to stop it.”

This isn’t the only bill generating that response.

Mayor Vincent C. Gray vetoed legislation Thursday that would force the District’s largest retailers to pay their workers significantly more, choosing the potential for jobs and development at home over joining a national fight against low-wage work.

Gray’s quandary is playing out in many U.S. cities, where local leaders who generally sympathize with worker causes are also eager to lure jobs and commerce for their constituents. Retailers, most notably Wal-Mart, have placed an increasing focus on urban expansion, while unions and advocates for workers have pushed measures like the District’s “living wage” bill as a valuable hedge against the proliferation of low-paying jobs.

The veto, which is unlikely to be overridden by the D.C. Council, clears the way for Wal-Mart to continue its entry into the District — plans years in the making that were thrown into question after lawmakers embraced the wage proposal this year.

Gray (D) announced his veto in a letter delivered to Council Chairman Phil Mendelson on Thursday morning. It explained his opposition to the bill and tried to soften the political consequences by disclosing his intention to seek a minimum-wage increase from all employers, not just large retailers.

In the letter, Gray said the measure was “not a true living-wage bill,” because its effect would be limited to “a small fraction of the District’s workforce.” He called the bill a “job-killer,” citing threats from Wal-Mart and other retailers that they would not locate in the city if the bill becomes law.

“If I were to sign this bill into law, it would do nothing but hinder our ability to create jobs, drive away retailers, and set us back on the path to prosperity for all,” he said.

In an interview, Gray did not say what minimum wage he would seek, except that any increase would be “reasonable” and would come after consultation with lawmakers and interested parties.

Mendelson, who shepherded the bill through the council after introducing similar bills for years to no avail, said he was disappointed by the mayor’s decision. “The issue is, do we want to attract low-paying jobs?” he said. “We want decent jobs that pay decent wages so our residents can afford to live in the District of Columbia.”

The bill, known as the Large Retailer Accountability Act, would require retailers with corporate sales of $1 billion or more and operating District stores of at least 75,000 square feet to pay their employees a “living wage” — no less than $12.50 an hour in combined wages and benefits. The proposal includes an exception for employers who collectively bargain with their workers. Existing employers would have four years to come into compliance.

The city’s minimum wage is $8.25 an hour. The bill would raise the annual earnings of a full-time employee making the lowest legal wage from about $17,000 to $26,000.

While the bill’s supporters repeatedly said it was not targeted at Wal-Mart, the debate was inextricably tied to the retail giant’s plans, announced in late 2010, to open as many as six stores in the city in the coming months and years.

The union exemption and square-footage requirement rankled Wal-Mart officials, who said those provisions created an uneven playing field — particularly with the unionized grocery chains they plan to compete with in the city.

View Graphic D.C. lawmakers gave final approval Wednesday to a bill requiring certain large retailers to pay their employees a 50 percent premium over the city’s minimum wage, a day after Wal-Mart warned the law would jeopardize their plans in the city.

A day ahead of the bill’s final passage in July, Wal-Mart told council members and the public that it would not pursue three of the six planned stores and would explore options for withdrawing from the others should legislators proceed. The ultimatum changed no votes on the council.

Wal-Mart spokesman Steven Restivo called the veto “good news for D.C. residents,” saying Gray chose “jobs, economic development and common sense over special interests.”

Restivo said the company will move forward with its stores in the District: “We look forward to finishing the work we started in the city almost three years ago.”

Wal-Mart’s entry into the city has prompted a political identity crisis for many elected officials, forced to reconcile their liberal, pro-union sentiments with the desire to create jobs and better retail options for their constituents.

Key council members, including Mendelson (D) and Business Affairs Committee chair Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), were unabashed in support of the bill. But Gray made no secret in recent months that, for him, jobs and retail took priority.

Wal-Mart's entry into the city was an early political coup for Gray, and he personally lobbied — some say threatened — top company executives to commit to a store at the Skyland Town Center development not far from his home in Ward 7.

The Skyland store is among those Wal-Mart has threatened to abandon should the living-wage bill become law. Gray said Thursday that the effect of the retailer’s ultimatum was not a decisive factor.

“If I thought that this was really going to be otherwise a tremendous benefit for the people of the District of Columbia, then I would have swallowed hard and done it,” he said.

A coalition of labor unions, clergy members and progressive political activists backing the bill has canvassed neighborhoods and held media events in hopes of pressuring Gray into signing the bill. Wal-Mart and other large retailers, they argued, could pay their workers better wages without significantly harming their bottom lines.

Some said they considered Wal-Mart’s ultimatum a bluff; others said they would rather see the retailer walk away than accept its “poverty wages.” Wal-Mart has pushed back on the notion that its wages are considerably less than other retailers, saying its pay would be “competitive” and accusing the grocery workers union of signing a contract that pays some of its members wages that would not comply with the living-wage law.

Business groups, other retailers and even former mayor Anthony A. Williams urged Gray to veto the bill, citing the potential job losses, the effect on grocery access, “retail leakage” to the suburbs and potential harm to the city’s business reputation.

Gray’s decision sets up a final political showdown with the council, which can override the veto with a two-thirds vote within 30 days. Shortly after he received the veto letter, Mendelson informed colleagues that the override vote will take place Tuesday, at the council’s first legislative meeting since giving the bill final passage in July.

An override would require the approval of nine of the council’s 13 members. The bill passed 8 to 5 , and no member has since acknowledged that their vote could change.

Mike Wilson, a spokesman for Respect DC, blasted Gray’s veto but said he was hopeful the council would overturn it.

“Unfortunately, the mayor bought the line of the Wal-Mart lobbyists and the other sort of corporate interests that have been pushing against it,” Wilson said. “We’re counting on the council to do the right thing on Tuesday, to stand with the residents and override his poor decision.”

One of the members who voted against the bill, Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), said that although she disliked Wal-Mart’s ultimatum in July, her view had hardened that it could put the District at a competitive disadvantage at luring retailers from Maryland and Virginia.

“When I weigh the District’s interests, they weigh more heavily in voting against the bill. I’m not for Wal-Mart or against Wal-Mart,” she said, “I’m against this bill.”

The District's living-wage measure has followed a nearly identical trajectory to a similar bill taken up by the Chicago City Council in 2006. With Wal-Mart planning its first stores there, lawmakers passed the bill, sending it to Mayor Richard M. Daley, who vetoed it. An override vote narrowly failed.

Wal-Mart now operates 10 Chicago stores.

COVID-19 has claimed the life of another New Brunswicker, pushing the total number of COVID-related deaths in the province to 38, Public Health announced Monday, along with 15 new cases. A person in their 90s in the Edmundston region, Zone 4, has died ""as a result of COVID-19,"" according to a news release. The person resided at Pavillon Beau-Lieu, a special care home in Grand Falls, where there's an outbreak involving the variant first reported in South Africa. Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she is saddened by the news. ""I join all New Brunswickers in sharing sincere condolences with this person's loved ones during this difficult time,"" she said in a statement. On Sunday, Public Health announced another resident of the special care home, someone in their 80s, had died in hospital ""as a result of COVID-19."" With the 15 new cases, there are now 142 active cases of respiratory disease in the province. Six people are in hospital, including two in intensive care. The breakdown of the new cases is as follows: Moncton region, Zone 1: one case: A person 30 to 39 This case is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Saint John region, Zone 2: three cases: A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 One case is under investigation, one case is travel-related and the other is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Fredericton region, Zone 3: five cases: A person under 19 A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 Two people 60 to 69 Three of the cases are contacts of a previously confirmed case and two are travel-related. The 15 new confirmed cases announced Monday put the total number of active cases in the province at 142.(CBC) Edmundston region, Zone 4: three cases: Two people 50 to 59 A person 90 or over All three cases are contacts of a previously confirmed case and are linked to the outbreak at Pavillon Beau-Lieu. Campbellton region, Zone 5: one case: A person 50 to 59 This case is travel-related. Bathurst region, Zone 6: two cases: A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 Both cases are travel-related. New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

But Golden State Republicans aren’t just on the opposite side of issues from Democrats. Lately, they’ve been at odds among themselves.

The divisions were on display when the state’s 15 Republicans split almost evenly on a vote to end the government shutdown and extend the nation’s borrowing authority. All 38 Democrats, in contrast, stuck together in support of the measure.

The Republicans also split on roll calls this year to cut the food stamp program, provide Superstorm Sandy relief, reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and end a program that promotes U.S. agricultural products abroad. No California Democrats broke ranks.

The GOP differences have been stark on immigration.

While Republican Reps. Jeff Denham of Turlock and David Valadao of Hanford joined Democrats in support of legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally, some of their California GOP colleagues vehemently oppose what they regard as amnesty for lawbreakers. Others are open to granting legal status to some immigrants but oppose a path to citizenship.

It’s no surprise to find divisions within the largest state delegation in Congress, given its size, regional differences on issues such as farm policy, and the political vulnerability of some of its members.

Democrats have broken ranks too. Freshman Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Palm Desert), for example, drew flak for joining Republicans in voting to delay Obamacare’s individual mandate. Seven of the state’s Democrats recently broke from their party to support a Republican-written bill that would let insurers continue selling policies that don’t meet new federal standards under the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans have been unified on plenty of issues, such as their disdain for Obamacare, but appear to be thumbing their noses at party discipline these days more than the Democrats.

“California Republicans always tend to be independent cusses,” said Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove). “I think it’s a DNA thing.”

Said Steve Frank, a strategist for the Tea Party Caucus of California: “It’s every man for himself. They’re looking for what’s best for themselves politically.”

The divisions reflect fissures within the larger House Republican ranks that have presented Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) with a challenge akin to trying to herd cats. Republicans have been tugged one way by the tea party and another way by business-oriented establishment Republicans.

“The Republican Party is in the midst of an internal debate over where it should be going,” said Jon Fleischman, a former state GOP official who publishes a conservative blog.

Some of the cracks within the GOP ranks are the result of geography.

“California is a huge and diverse state with districts that have little in common other than they happen to fall within our state’s borders,” said Dave Gilliard, a Republican consultant in Sacramento. “Ed Royce’s constituents in Yorba Linda have little in common with Doug LaMalfa’s in Weed.... These guys are not fearful of the tea party or business lobbyists or anyone else. Their votes are dictated by their own beliefs and how they perceive their district.”

Advertisement

Royce, of Fullerton, said Republicans were “struggling” to determine the best course forward for the country, given challenges such as the national debt. “Part of it is in the nature of Republicans. They’re harder to corral.”

California Republicans as a whole, like the rest of the House GOP, have become more conservative over the last 25 years, according to an analysis of voting patterns by University of Georgia political scientist Keith T. Poole.

The variation among California Republicans covers a “wider spectrum on the ideological scale” — still on the conservative side — than it has in the past, according to UC San Diego political scientist Gary Jacobson, who has studied the data. “This means that Republicans are relatively less uniform in their ideological locations, as measured by their roll-call voting patterns, than they were prior to this Congress.”

Reps. John Campbell of Irvine, Dana Rohrabacher of Costa Mesa, Royce and McClintock have compiled the most conservative voting records this year in the delegation. All four voted against ending the government shutdown. Reps. Paul Cook of Yucca Valley, Ken Calvert of Corona and Valadao, all of whom voted to end the shutdown, are at the other end of the range. On average, however, they are a bit more conservative than House Republicans as a whole, according to Jacobson.

Voter-approved changes to the state’s political system also may be contributing to the divisions.

A new political map put four Republicans in districts where Latinos make up 40% or more of the population and five in districts that are at least 30% Latino. Denham and Valadao represent heavily Latino Central Valley districts that rely on immigrants to pick crops.

“If they want to hold on to their seats, they certainly can’t behave like standard-issue Republicans,” Jacobson said.

Rohrabacher, the senior California Republican in the House, attributed the divisions to more competitive districts.

Dan Schnur, a former GOP strategist who directs USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said the state’s new primary system that pits the top two finishers against each other in the general election, regardless of their party, means that candidates do not need to rely as much on the party base but must work more aggressively to reach out to independents and centrists from the other party.

“The biggest impact of the top-two primary is not during the election but afterwards,” he said. “You send someone to Sacramento or Washington, and once they get there, you’ve created a much greater incentive for them to look for ways to work with members of the other party.”

Calvert, chairman of the California Republican congressional delegation, attributed his caucus’ 8-7 split to end the government shutdown to differences over tactics.

Overall, he said, “we’re together 90% of the time.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/11/House-GOP-Caves-Will-Lift-Debt-AND-Reopen-Government,2013-10-11 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],House GOP Blinks: Will Lift Debt AND Reopen Government,"House Republicans have sent the White House a revised proposal to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks, as well as reopen government through December 15th, which was their original spending proposal before the partial shutdown. The revised GOP plan reflects the demands Obama made in a meeting with House GOP Leaders on Thursday. It also reflects the unwillingness of the DC GOP to face a fiscal showdown with Democrats.

Aside from reopening the government and agreeing to raise America’s debt over the current $16.7 trillion limit, the Republicans made several other concession to President Obama and the Democrats. One such example is that Obamacare would receive funding. The Republicans would get to take out a portion of the president’s signature legislation, but the law would substantially remain intact. The AP reports:

Under a proposal she and other GOP senators have been developing, a medical device tax that helps finance the health care law would be repealed, and millions of individuals eligible for subsidies to purchase health insurance under the program would be subject to stronger income verification.

In addition, some of the across-the-board “sequester” cuts would be reversed under the GOP plan. It has not been determined which specific cuts will be targeted at this time.

In exchange for meeting, at least momentarily, all of Obama’s demands, the House GOP is seeking a “framework” for future negotiations on addressing longer-term budget issues. These negotiations would be led for the Republicans by Rep. Paul Ryan, who is likely to seek a “grand bargain” resolving the nation’s structural budget problems.

After such a swift capitulation on the current impasse, how likely is it that the GOP will be able to extract meaningful reforms during yet another round of budget talks? House Leadership has already shown that, when nearing an actual deadline, it will cave while extracting very few concessions.

The GOP surrender comes at a time when it is in a stronger position than it was during the partial government shutdown in 1995/96. The public generally blames both parties and President Obama for the fiscal stalemate. Obama’s approval ratings, meanwhile, have cratered to 37%, the lowest of his Presidency.

In addition, 61% of the public thinks significant spending cuts have to be part of any deal to lift the debt ceiling. By that, they mean actual cuts, not a “framework” to discuss cuts.

The House GOP has signaled to the Democrats that it is desperate to end the stand-off. They will, of course, promise that they will have more “leverage” next time. They’ve said that so many times, they probably even believe it."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/us/politics/obamas-2013-state-of-the-union-address.html,2013-02-13 00:00:00,[],Text: Obama’s 2013 State of the Union Address,"Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can’t pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America. That’s what tax reform can deliver. That’s what we can do together.

I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won’t be easy. The politics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. So let’s set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. Let’s agree, right here, right now, to keep the people’s government open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.

Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda. But let’s be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?

A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than one million new jobs. I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda, and I urge this Congress to pass the rest. Tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat – nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.

Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.

After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.

There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There’s no reason this can’t happen in other towns. So tonight, I’m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Departments of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. And I ask this Congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is Made in America.

If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s; developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries ten times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race. And today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy."

Story highlights Writers: Debt ceiling puts Obama in a trap; executing law means violating others A president cannot authorize spending, taxing or borrowing to avoid ceiling, they say Writers: He should borrow exactly enough money to implement Congress' budget That move would be the least unconstitutional solution to his ""trilemma,"" they say

Their article on the president’s options in the face of the debt ceiling impasse appeared in the October 2012 issue of the Columbia Law Review, with a recent follow-up appearing in the online edition of the same journal.

President Barack Obama might soon find himself in a quandary in which basic arithmetic prevents him from faithfully executing all of the laws Congress has passed. The debt ceiling statute prohibits borrowing enough money to make up the difference between funds in the Treasury and legal obligations to spend.

Anything the president does would violate some law. Indeed, anything he does would be unconstitutional because all of the relevant powers – spending, taxing and borrowing – belong to Congress.

Many Washington insiders have assumed that if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, Obama could simply cut spending. But constitutional history says otherwise.

When President Richard Nixon tried to “impound” money that Congress had ordered him to spend, the courts slapped him down. During Bill Clinton’s administration, the Supreme Court ruled that the president has only a limited ability to cut spending even with congressional authorization. He has no constitutional power to cut spending without such authorization.

If every action the president might plausibly take would usurp a power of Congress, what should he do? He should minimize the usurpation.

During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln unilaterally suspended habeas corpus. Lincoln argued that if that decision was unconstitutional, it was nonetheless necessary to avoid a greater evil: violating his constitutional oath to defend the Union. Faced with a dilemma, Lincoln chose the less unconstitutional course.

The same goes for this president from Illinois. If Congress creates a trilemma, he must choose the least unconstitutional option.

Some commentators suggest that the Treasury could generate $2 trillion for the government by minting two platinum coins, using an obscure law that was enacted for the express purpose of creating memorabilia. But doing so would be economically equivalent to borrowing $2 trillion and thus, even if technically legal, would violate the substance of the debt ceiling law.

In a constitutional crisis, analysis should rest on constitutional principles, not technicalities. The core issue is separation of powers: What course of action would minimize the executive taking over legislative authority?

The answer is violating the debt ceiling, not cutting spending or raising taxes. By borrowing exactly enough money to cover the difference between funds in the Treasury and expenditures required by law, the president would simply be implementing Congress’ budget.

By contrast, a presidential decision to raise taxes or cut spending would require many policy-laden judgments: Whose taxes would be raised and by how much? What expenditures would be cut, to what degree and according to what criteria?

For the president to make these quintessentially legislative judgments on his own would usurp power on an enormous scale. Issuing debt beyond the debt ceiling would be unconstitutional but not as unconstitutional as raising taxes or cutting spending.

Despite some confusion, Obama has kept the least unconstitutional option on the table. In December, White House press secretary Jay Carney said that the “administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the president the power to ignore the debt ceiling.”

That observation is beside the point. True, some scholars argue that the debt ceiling violates Section 4 of the 14th Amendment. If so, then the debt ceiling is void and the president’s power to borrow money comes, not from the 14th Amendment, but from the statute authorizing the Treasury secretary to “borrow on the credit of the United States government amounts necessary for expenditures authorized by law.”

Putting aside the 14th Amendment, Carney’s claim at most shows that unilaterally raising the debt ceiling would override Congress’ borrowing authority. But that merely states one horn of the trilemma. Unilaterally raising taxes or cutting spending would usurp more congressional authority.

Our leaders can still act responsibly by raising the debt ceiling or, better yet, by repealing it entirely. Congress can then control federal debt simply by paying attention to the gap between spending and taxes. It should not force the president to usurp one of its powers.

But if Congress leaves the president no constitutional options, he must choose the least unconstitutional one: borrowing money beyond the debt ceiling.

In an assertive State of the Union address that fleshed out the populist themes of his inauguration speech, Mr. Obama declared it was “our generation’s task” to “reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth — a rising, thriving middle class.”

“Every day,” he said, “we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills to get those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?”

The increase in the minimum wage, from $7.25 an hour now, was the most tangible of a raft of initiatives laid out by the president, from education and energy to public works projects. Taken together, Mr. Obama said, these investments would accelerate the nation’s recovery by helping those in the broad middle class."

The 6-3 decision is a victory for a former USC student from Thailand, Supap Kirtsaeng, who figured he could earn money by buying textbooks at lower costs in his native country and selling them in the United States.

He was sued by publisher John Wiley & Sons for violating its copyright protection. A jury in New York agreed with the publisher, and the former student was assessed damages of $600,000 for willfully violating the company’s copyrights.

But the Supreme Court reversed that judgment today in Kirtsaeng vs. John Wiley and ruled the student had the better interpretation of the law.

The decision helps book buyers and merchants who resell goods purchased abroad, but it could prove to be a setback for American companies that sell copyrighted goods overseas.

Until now, these U.S. copyright holders have maintained that they can sell copyrighted works abroad -- and sometimes, at much lower prices -- and prevent them from being re-imported for sale in this country without their permission.

But the justices decided Tuesday that the holders’ rights expire when their copyrighted product is lawfully sold overseas. Under the so-called “first sale” doctrine, a copyright holder has a right to profit from the first sale of a book, but not its resale.

Justice Stephen Breyer noted the textbooks at issue were lawfully made overseas with the permission of the copyright owner. They were not pirated copies. In that instance, the “first sale” doctrine applies, he said, so that buyer was free to resell the books he had lawfully purchased.

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy dissented.

Story highlights NEW: Some in Congress say they're planning on giving their pay to charity during shutdown Thousands of federal workers have been furloughed and will lose pay in the shutdown Members of Congress will still get paid, as mandated by the 27th Amendment Some lawmakers say they will give their paychecks to the Treasury or to charity

(CNN) —

In an extended shutdown, most of the federal workforce would go without pay, but the checks will keep coming to the 533 current members of Congress.

Who gets paid in a shutdown and who doesn’t?

“That is disgraceful in my view,” said freshman Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, told CNN. “Basically the only people who get paid in a shutdown are members of Congress, and that is irresponsible.”

Gabbard plans to send any pay she receives during a shutdown back to the Treasury. The combat veteran said she was shocked to find out recently that members’ pay is protected.

It is – by the Constitution.

Opinion: Taxpayers, you deserve your money back

The 27th Amendment to the Constitution restricts any Congress from changing its own pay. The measure was proposed in the first days of the Republic but was not ratified until 1992, after a grass-roots movement promoted the idea and the necessary number of state legislatures approved it.

While many may have wanted to restrain Congress from increasing its pay, the amendment also blocks Congress from freezing or cutting its compensation.

The result? Congress gets paid no matter what. Gabbard is not the only member surprised.

The list: What’s open, what’s closed

“I don’t even know whether it stops or not,” Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, said when asked about his pay during a shutdown.

When told that the Constitution mandates congressional paychecks stay as-is, Fleming responded that he hadn’t thought through what he would do yet but would likely donate his pay during a shutdown to charity.

“Obviously we need to share the pain of the American people,” he concluded.

The offices for the top two members of Congress – House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid – wouldn’t respond to specifics about their pay.

According to a report by the Lexington Herald-Leader newspaper, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, plans to donate his salary to charity during the shutdown.

Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Texas, told CNN he is urging his fellow members of Congress to donate their pay to charitable causes.

“I don’t think we should get paid until (the shutdown) is resolved,” Rep. Pete DeSantis, R-Fla, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday. “I’ve asked the clerk to withhold any pay for me until we get this up and running. I just think that that’s fair for the folks involved who’ve been negatively affected by this.”

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, disagreed with DeSantis. “I think that’s another game (House Republicans) want to play, appealing to a demagogic approach to this,” Hoyer told Tapper on Tuesday.

Shutdown ‘extremely damaging’ to U.S. intelligence operations

“Members of Congress ought to be on the job working hard,” Hoyer added, “getting this job done to the American people, getting their government opened, getting federal employees back to work and serving the public, serving the growth of our economy, serving our national security ends.”

While members will get paid, they must decide which of their own office staff have to go home.

Members of Congress run their own office payroll and will decide who is essential and non essential. But even congressional staff members who work during a shutdown would not get paid until later – only their bosses will get paid on time.

“My staffers are working with pay. Right now,” Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, said Tuesday on “Crossfire.”

“They’re doing oversight on the federal government. … They’re continuing to work on the waste.”

Coburn also said he’s keeping his salary earned during the shutdown. “I’m going to keep my salary and going to make sure I spend it and tithe it and give to it charities and do the thing that I’ve always done. … I’m not going to stop working.”

But Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who appeared alongside Coburn on “Crossfire” on Tuesday, is taking a different approach.

“Eighty percent of my staff, unfortunately, is on furlough,” she said, “I’m going to be contributing [my salary] on a daily basis. For every day we are not seeing an open – a government that’s open, I’m contributing.”

The RNC report audited everything surrounding the Republican agenda -- except the product itself.

Republicans have let the salesmen take control%2C replacing principles and values with consultants.

We don%27t need 100 pages. Our agenda can be tweeted in less than 140 characters.

In private enterprise, a business fails when it ceases to meet the demands of the consumer. Senior management, out-of-touch and complacent, loses the vision that made the start-up a success in the first place. The sales pitch and cash flow replace innovation and product quality. And when the stale product ceases to create value for its customers, buyers look elsewhere or simply stay home.

This story should sound familiar to the ""senior management"" of the Grand Old Party, who asked a group of their peers to produce a report --""The Growth and Opportunity Project"" -- to explain the underperformance of the GOP product line in 2012.

But the RNC report audited everything surrounding the Republican agenda -- except the product itself.

Republicans have let the salesmen take control of their company, replacing principles and values with consultants flacking a slicker sales pitch for the wrong ideas. And the jig is up. Too many Americans are no longer buying what the GOP is selling.

The Republican Party needs to revisit their business model, once built on the core values of individual freedom, economic opportunity for all, and constitutionally-limited government. In my lifetime, these quintessential American principles have guided the GOP to its three great electoral successes, in 1980, 1994, and 2010.

Winning on principle and then reverting to consultant-driven campaigns about nothing has been a ""Groundhog Day"" style political nightmare for grassroots activists. So while Republican cognoscenti continue to learn the same lesson over and over, we are moving ahead.

The grassroots freedom movement (including tea partiers, small-l libertarians, constitutional conservatives, and independents who don't see much to like in either party) is on the ascent. Our community is growing because our allegiance is not to political party, but to the shared values of fiscal sanity and individual freedom.

We don't need 100 pages. Our agenda can be tweeted in less than 140 characters:

Build community voluntarily working together. Be authentic. Treat people equally. Don't hurt people and don't take their stuff.

Building community.

Paradoxically, Republicans claim a long-term economic vision in their political rhetoric, but view their customers through the short-term lens of election cycles. It feels, at best, like a one night stand. You never get the callback after the first Tuesday in November. Real political and policy change comes from a long-term relationship, and that is never going to come out of a campaign consulting shop.

True cultural change starts with education and building relationships at the local level. Candidates who represent the values of the freedom movement and bring fresh ideas and innovative solutions to the Republican Party are selected from the bottom-up.

Rock star fiscal conservatives like Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Tim Scott were not hand-picked by the GOP establishment in a politically correct attempt to ""recruit diversity."" Grassroots enthusiasm for the candidates generated organically behind the ideas and the values for which they stood.

Using this authentic and principle-driven process, our movement has begun to repopulate the Republican Party with an upstart generation of leaders who are younger and more diverse than ever before in the Party's history. We will return their call if they stay faithful to the ideas that won their elections.

Freedom as our strategy.

The primary process – much like the free market- is a discovery process. Competitive primaries allow us to look for qualitative upgrades and hold politicians accountable regardless of political party. While the billions of dollars spent on TV ads in 2012 are swept into the dustbin of history, the future of political campaigning is becoming more transparent, decentralized and democratic.

Thanks to the Internet, our community is fueled by the decentralization of information and the ease of connecting with like-minded individuals through social media. The costs and barriers to entry into political activism are lower than ever before. Disintermediation politics has shifted the balance of power away from Washington insiders, putting citizens back in the driver's seat.

Freedom, transparency and individual choice are trending. A new Republican Party would respect the choices of the millions of ""kingmakers"" who make electoral impact at the margin.

Don't hurt people and don't take their stuff.

While Republicans struggle to define a principled agenda, the ethos of the freedom movement is simple: Be authentic and consistent. Treat every American equally under the law. Don't hurt others, and don't take their stuff.

The freedom movement is a coalition of the willing, operating on a voluntary and value-for-value basis. We oppose the government's habit of subsidizing the irresponsible with other people's stuff. We are sick of watching politicians and corporate lobbyists pick winners and losers in the marketplace at the expense of everyday individuals. We use politics as a means to advance our values, not an end.

Lastly, we believe that Washington answers to its citizen shareholders, not the other way around. The RNC's 100-page attempt to rebrand themselves to the American public highlights the fatal conceit of the GOP's senior management. The challenge is not finding a way to ""open America's ears"" from the top-down. The solution is to open your own.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/19/sen-grassley-says-irs-to-pay-70m-in-employee-bonuses-despite-spending-cuts/,2013-06-19 00:00:00,[],Grassley: IRS to pay $70M in employee bonuses despite spending cuts,"The IRS is set to pay roughly $70 million in employee-union bonuses, contrary to an Obama administration directive to halt such rewards amid the deep, government-wide budget cuts known as sequestration.

The apparent deal with the National Treasury Employees Union is scheduled for Wednesday and was made public by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.

Grassley's office said the information came from a ""person with knowledge of IRS budgetary procedures.""

The IRS is already facing widespread criticism, which started last month when IRS officials acknowledged that agents had improperly targeted Tea Party groups and conservative organizations for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. Then the agency's inspector general issued a report a few weeks later that documented lavish employee conferences during the same time period.

Grassley says the bonuses should be canceled under an April directive from the White House budget office.

More On This...

The directive was written by Danny Werfel, a former budget official who has since been appointed acting IRS commissioner.

The IRS said it is negotiating with the union over the matter but did not dispute Grassley's claim that the bonuses are imminent.

Office of Management and Budget ""guidance directs that agencies should not pay discretionary monetary awards at this time, unless legally required,"" IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said in a statement. ""IRS is under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement, which specifies the terms by which awards are paid to bargaining-unit employees.""

Eldridge, however, would not say whether the IRS believes it is contractually obligated to pay the bonuses.

""In accordance with OMB guidance, the IRS is actively engaged with NTEU on these matters in recognition of our current budgetary constraints,"" Eldridge said.

The National Treasury Employees Union did not respond to requests for comment.

Three congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating the targeting of conservative groups. And key Republicans in Congress are promising more scrutiny of the agency's budget, especially as it ramps up to play a major role in implementing the new health care law.

Much of the agency's top leadership has been replaced since the scandals broke. President Barack Obama forced the acting commissioner to resign and replaced him with Werfel, who used to work in the White House budget office.

In a letter to Werfel on Tuesday, Grassley said the IRS notified the employee union March 25 that it intended to reclaim about $75 million that had been set aside for discretionary employee bonuses. However, Grassley said, his office has learned that the IRS never followed up on the notice. Instead, Grassley said, the IRS negotiated a new agreement with the bargaining unit to pay about $70 million in employee bonuses.

""While the IRS may claim that these bonuses are legally required under the original bargaining unit agreement, that claim would allegedly be inaccurate,"" Grassley wrote. ""In fact, the original agreement allows for the re-appropriation of such award funding in the event of budgetary shortfall.""

Werfel wrote the directive on discretionary employee bonuses while he was still working in the White House budget office. The directive was part of the Obama administration's efforts to impose across-the-board spending cuts enacted by Congress.

“It’s like robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. ""On the one hand the IRS claims it’s short on resources, but on the other hand it appears they’re ready to dole out $70 million in bonuses that looks like a payoff to union workers at a time when we’re drowning in a sea of red ink. Given the government guidelines on sequestration, this is certainly an issue that demands further scrutiny.”

The sequestration cuts are resulting in at least five unpaid furlough days this year for the IRS' 90,000 employees. On these days, the agency is closed and taxpayers cannot access many of the agency's assistance programs.

Werfel's April 4 memorandum ""directs that discretionary monetary awards should not be issued while sequestration is in place, unless issuance of such awards is legally required. Discretionary monetary awards include annual performance awards, group awards, and special act cash awards, which comprise a sizable majority of awards and incentives provided by the federal government to employees.""

""Until further notice, agencies should not issue such monetary awards from sequestered accounts unless agency counsel determines the awards are legally required. Legal requirements include compliance with provisions in collective bargaining agreements governing awards.""

http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/10/09/a-14th-amendment-for-all-centuries/,2013-10-09 00:00:00,"['Garrett Epps', 'Posted Boredinvestor', 'Posted Samrch', 'Posted Oneofthesheep', 'Posted Anzus', 'Posted Uaus', 'Posted Dejahthoris', 'Posted Ruralfarming', 'Posted Juniorsenior', 'Posted Bs_Detector']",A 14th Amendment for all centuries,"During the 1980s, a colorful Washington figure used to stand in Lafayette Square near the White House holding a sign: “Arrest Me. I Question the Validity of the Public Debt. Repeal Section 4, Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” That section reads: “The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.” As far as I know, the whimsical “protester” was never arrested; he wasn’t breaking any law. Congressional Republicans, if they force the United States into default on its debt, will be.

Even most journalists and policy wonks hadn’t heard of Section 4 until recently. But with a default on “the public debt” increasingly possible, many now find the subject gripping. What if the House Republican majority decides that they are just too angry to authorize repayment of the debt? They’d be violating the Constitution — but what would happen to the country, and to them?

During the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011, a number of scholars, including me, suggested that President Obama could end the standoff by proclaiming that Section 4 required him, as part of his duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” to set aside the debt ceiling and borrow enough money to fund payments on the debt. Obama later said his lawyers told him that was “not a winning argument.” This time around, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has already said that “this administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the power to the president to ignore the debt ceiling.”

Nevertheless, it’s useful to understand the history that brought Section 4 into being. Its story has parallels to the political situation in the United States today, almost a century and a half after the 14th Amendment was adopted.

In April 1865, Abraham Lincoln was killed by a southern assassin. Eight months later, the 13th Amendment was ratified and emancipation became the law of the land. But even amid the ashes of defeat and the triumph of Abolition, the South proclaimed itself not beaten, but triumphant. One influential southern newspaper explained in January 1866 that if the southern states’ population were counted proportionately in Washington, “the political power of the country will pass into the hands of the South, aided, as it will be, by Northern alliances.”

It was all too believable. Freedom for the slaves made their former masters stronger, not weaker, because southern states planned to accept full congressional representation for the freed blacks (as slaves, they had counted only as 3/5 of free people) — while permitting only whites to vote. Freed slaves now would count one for one, giving the South as many as 28 new House seats — and 28 more electoral votes — all to be determined by an all-white electorate.

After the war, the South wanted their state governments to repay the money they had borrowed to fund the Confederate war effort — and they wanted federal help to do it. If the Union would help not help pay back those debts, then they saw no reason why the U.S. national debt should be repaid either. After all, virtually all of it had been borrowed to fund the Union war effort. “If we’ve got to repudiate [the confederate debt], we may as well help the Democrats repudiate the debt on the other side too,” a delegate to Georgia’s new constitutional convention told a reporter, referring to the national debt. “What’s fair for one is fair for the other.” A South Carolina white put it more colorfully: “What, ruin us, and then make us help pay the cost of our own whipping? I reckon not!”

Northern politicians took the threat of resurgent southern power so seriously that they drafted the 14th Amendment, the longest in the Constitution. The former seceded states were excluded from Congress, and only allowed back in when their states ratified the amendment. In its five sections, it sought to systematically dismantle what northerners called “the slave power.” The Bill of Rights would apply in the South. Southern states would not get representation for black residents if the ballot remained all white. Former Confederate leaders could not serve in Congress. There would be no repayment for slaves. There would be no repayment of the Confederate debt. And the U.S. debt, amassed to pay for the war, was never to be repudiated — it was not even to be “questioned.”

Long after Reconstruction ended, the Supreme Court held that Section 4 remains an absolute command. “While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the government issued during the Civil War, its language indicates a broader connotation,” Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote for the Court in a 1935 case called Perry v. United States. “Nor can we perceive any reason for not considering the expression ‘the validity of the public debt’ as embracing whatever concerns the integrity of the public obligations.”

A large number of today’s House Republicans seem to be channeling the ghosts of those long-ago secessionists. Beaten in an election, they still expect to rule, and they seem to recognize only the laws of which they approve. But last January, every member of the House swore to “support and defend” the Constitution, and “bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” They took that obligation “freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.”

There is no “14th Amendment exception” to that oath.

A century and a half ago, nearly a million Americans died to establish the United States as one nation. And when the battle ended, the new nation publicly pledged that it had undergone Lincoln’s “new birth of freedom” — that it would give due process and equality to all within its borders.

And that it would always pay its debts. On time. In full. Whether any willful group of renegades liked it or not.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/30/obama-low-ball-keystone-fact-check/,2013-07-30 00:00:00,[],Obama doubles down on low-ball Keystone jobs claim despite fact-check criticism,"President Obama doubled down Tuesday on his claim that the Keystone XL oil pipeline would create just a handful of jobs, despite being hammered by Republicans and fact-checkers alike for the claim.

The president addressed Keystone during a speech in Chattanooga, Tenn., as he challenged Republicans to come up with new jobs proposals.

""They keep on talking about this -- an oil pipeline coming down from Canada that's estimated to create about 50 permanent jobs. That's not a jobs plan,"" Obama said.

In citing the 50-jobs number, though, the president was using the smallest possible number attached to the pipeline project. The estimate he used likely refers to a State Department finding that -- after the pipeline is built -- it would take roughly 50 people to maintain it.

But the comment ignores the rest of the State Department report that estimates the project would create nearly 4,000 annual construction jobs -- and potentially ""support"" an annual 42,000 jobs.

More On This...

Obama similarly ignored those findings during an interview he gave recently to The New York Times. In the interview, Obama said the project would create roughly 2,000 construction jobs and maybe 100 additional jobs after that -- calling it a ""blip relative to the need.""

As FoxNews.com reported on Monday, Obama appeared to eschew the higher job-creation estimate from his own State Department, opting instead to use the numbers from a 2011 Cornell University Global Labor Institute study, which opposes construction of the crude-oil pipeline.

A Washington Post fact-check column on Tuesday questioned why the administration would ignore its own numbers.

""Ordinarily, we would expect the president to cite an estimate from his own State Department, rather than a think tank opposed to the project,"" The Post story said.

The paper acknowledged that much of the estimating is ""guess work"" that includes speculation about such ""spinoff"" jobs as suppliers.

""But the president shouldn't pick and choose how he cites job-creation numbers. Perhaps he is tipping his hand on what he secretly thinks of the Keystone XL by citing a low-ball figure, generated by the pipeline's opponents, but he should stick to using the official government estimate,"" the fact-check column concluded.

The Post suggests that Obama should perhaps estimate the job-creation numbers just as he did when touting his stimulus plan. The column gave the president's claim two ""Pinocchios"" -- out of four on the paper's fact-check scale.

Republicans were more critical of the claim.

""A president disparaging private-sector jobs while backstage at a jobs rally is beyond belief,"" Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told FoxNews.com. ""The president's own State Department reported that Keystone would support upwards of 40,000 jobs. In this economy, any source of private job creation should be welcomed with open arms. After nearly five years and 15,500 pages of review, there is no reason to delay these jobs another day. Republicans, Democrats, leading unions, and job creators all agree, it's time to start building.""

Another fact-check site -- one tied to the industry -- also blasted Obama's original comments. A post on the Oil Sands Fact Check blog cited the State Department's total estimates and wrote: ""Um ... that's a little more than a blip. President Obama also could have consulted the many labor union members across the country who need those jobs and have held rallies in support of Keystone XL across the nation."""

Daley has kept a low profile since leaving office in 2011.

That doesn't mean he has lost interest in urban issues. The former mayor has turned his attention in a surprising direction, beyond Chicago's borders to one of the most intractable urban tragedies in America: the collapse of Gary, Ind.

""I always believe no part of America should be forgotten, and I think Gary has been forgotten,"" Daley said.

Daley is using his influence at the University of Chicago, where he is a distinguished senior fellow, to push a modest but growing amount of manpower toward Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson.

With guidance from Daley and Freeman-Wilson, University of Chicago graduate students are trying to figure out what to do with Gary's abandoned buildings and how to promote greater use of technology to help the city accomplish more with less, among other projects.

The hope is that the students will go on to help other cities after graduation. If successful, the U. of C.-Gary partnership could be replicated in other industrial towns grappling with decline.

Gary spans about 55 square miles, nearly a quarter of the size of Chicago. Yet the steel town's population has plummeted to an estimated 80,000, meaning the city has lost about half its people since 1960. The city's problems have mounted, including abandoned buildings and homes, sagging infrastructure and a declining budget to pay for services.

Outsiders have tried to fix Gary since at least the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Freeman-Wilson, a former Indiana attorney general, judge and Harvard College and Harvard Law School graduate, has reinvigorated Gary's renewal efforts. And she's unafraid to ask for help.

Immediately after winning the 2011 Democratic primary, Freeman-Wilson called Daley for advice. They met, and Daley invited her to be the first guest speaker at his lecture series at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy, where Daley has a five-year appointment.

This quarter, 11 students from the university's public policy, business and social services schools are getting course credit for working on projects for Gary.

""It was Mayor Daley's idea,"" Freeman-Wilson said as she rode from a meeting on Chicago's West Side to Gary. ""I had always envisioned getting the support and work from (University of Chicago Law School) alums, because there were issues around codes and things of that nature. It was not until the mayor came up with the idea of using students from the (Harris) School of Public Policy that I said, 'Oh yeah, that would work. That would work very well.'""

Daley does not teach a class at the University of Chicago. He runs an occasional lecture series.

Carol Brown, his last policy chief at City Hall, leads the program and the class, which is called the ""Urban Revitalization Project: City of Gary, Ind."" Grants from the Chicago-based Joyce and MacArthur foundations help pay administrative costs, including Brown's salary and that of a part-time assistant.

Last quarter's class was divided into three project teams. One team is cataloging Gary's abandoned buildings, which are magnets for crime and eyesores that further depress surrounding property values. Another is trying to recruit pro bono legal and consulting services for the city. And a third is trying to craft a strategy to clean up front stoops and empty lots one block at a time. This quarter's class also is tackling untapped funding opportunities and economic development.

Freeman-Wilson said a major benefit of the partnership is the fresh ideas from students ""who aren't jaded by the limitations of government, whereas a 20-year employee might say, 'Oh, no, we can't do that in government because we don't have X, Y and Z.'""

Already their work has prompted more widespread use among Gary employees of a technology that stores and analyzes geographic data. City workers are now using the technology to map potholes, fallen tree limbs and illegal dump sites. That way work crews can be dispatched to neighborhoods where the problems are most severe.

""This partnership encourages urban planners to think broadly about regions instead of cities — greater Chicago instead of the city of Chicago,"" said Stephen Paul O'Hara, a historian at Xavier University who wrote a book about Gary.

The students operate as consultants. They gather best practices and ideas from cities around the country and then recommend a course of action. At the end of each 10-week quarter, students present their recommendations to Daley, Freeman-Wilson and their staffs. Their grades are based on those presentations and supporting reports.

""I will tell you, it never stops getting nerve-wracking,"" second-year graduate student Jocelyn Hare said of presenting to Daley. ""But it gets easier.""

Last spring, Hare, 32, responded to an email seeking student volunteers to conduct preliminary research to test the idea of a partnership. Hare then interned for the city of Gary during the summer. The Harris school paid her $15 an hour. She then enrolled in the first class in the fall and again this winter, when it was opened to graduate students outside of Harris for the first time.

An Oak Park native and former Chicago Public Schools employee, Hare knows most of Freeman-Wilson's senior staff, from the zoning chief to the director of constituent services.

""Coming into Harris, the first year of course work was incredibly rigorous and incredibly quantitative-heavy,"" Hare said. ""But I didn't get a lot of practical experience. And there's a big gap between policy work in real life and the policy tools I was learning in school.""

So why isn't the project focused on Chicago's most impoverished neighborhoods?

""Because of Mayor Rahm Emanuel,"" Daley said in a Jan. 31 speech to several hundred wealthy University of Chicago supporters and their guests. ""He has a leadership quality. He is our mayor. For somebody to say, you know, 'Yeah, I just retired, and I'm going to do something in the city,' I felt that"" was inappropriate."

Obama acted Friday, the deadline for the president and Congress to avoid the steep, one-year cuts.

The president placed blame squarely on Republican lawmakers at a Friday press conference for failing to stop automatic spending cuts that were to begin kicking in later in the day, calling the cuts ""dumb, arbitrary.""

Republicans, for their part, said the fault was his, for insisting that increased taxes be part of the resolution

The president said the impact of the cuts won't immediately be felt, but middle class families will begin to ""have their lives disrupted in significant ways."" He said that as long as the cuts stay in effect, Americans will know that the economy could have been better had they been averted.

""The pain, though, will be real,"" Obama said.

He said he still believed the cuts could be replaced but he wanted a deal that includes more tax revenue.

""Let's be clear: None of this is necessary,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. ""It's happening because of a choice that Republicans in Congress have made. We shouldn't be making a series of dumb, arbitrary cuts to things.""

Obama met for less than an hour Friday morning with House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

Boehner's office said he and McConnell told Obama they're willing to close tax loopholes but only to lower taxes overall, not to replace spending cuts. Obama and congressional leaders have agreed that Congress should pass a bill funding the government beyond the end of March while they keep working on a way to replace the spending cuts, Boehner's office said.

""The president got his tax hikes on January 1st,"" Boehner said bluntly after the meeting with Obama. ""The discussion about revenue in my view is over. It's about taking on the spending problem here in Washington.""

On Thursday, two proposals aimed at blunting the blame over the cuts -- one Democratic and the other Republican -- were rejected in the Senate.

McConnell has already drawn a line in the stand and said in a statement released before Friday's meeting that Republicans will not support any last-minute deals and they will not raise taxes.

""Republicans have offered the President numerous solutions, including the flexibility he needs to secure those reductions more intelligently,"" McConnell said in the statement. ""I am happy to discuss other ideas to keep our commitment to reducing Washington spending at today's meeting. But there will be no last-minute, back-room deal and absolutely no agreement to increase taxes.""

In addition to McConnell, the President meet with House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Vice President Biden will also be at the meeting.

In the days leading up to the deadline, there were few signs that either party had much progress on how to cut the federal debt that now tops $16.5 trillion.

As the White House has come to acknowledge, the impact of the cuts will – for the most part -- not be felt immediately.

The billions of dollars in budget cuts are most likely going to phase in over the next few months. Furloughs of government workers will begin several weeks from now. Administration officials say the impact of this and other cuts will build up over time; Obama describes the effect on the economy as a “tumble downward.”

But some fiscal hawks see a silver lining, in that the sequester will force the government to trim the waste in order to shield higher-priority items. Already, the White House budget office is recommending agencies take a skeptical eye toward costly conferences and training programs.

The two sides remain deadlocked over the issue of raising taxes. Republicans want to replace the current regime of cuts with different, more sensible, cuts. Democrats want to blend in a set of tax increases, closing loopholes for top earners and some corporations.

The effects of the 2013 sequestration will be rolled out over the next several months. It won’t be a government shutdown but it will be a government slowdown.

“The impact of this policy won’t be felt overnight but it will be real,” Obama said. “The longer these cuts are in place, the greater the damage.”

The predicted impact of the spending cuts could come in flight delays, limited hours at national parks, longer wait times at border crossings and furloughs of civilian Pentagon employees – and workers at several other agencies.

Some officials say the administration has the leeway, or should be given the leeway, to spread around the budget pain.

“There is so much hype on this, it’s ridiculous,” David Walker, former U.S. comptroller general, told Fox News. “We spend as much money as the next 15 countries put together and some of the people who are hyping this big time are going to be really embarrassed.”

How the public reacts to the cuts will have an effect on how Congress addresses the issue. If voters react with a shrug, the GOP may be less compelled to agree to the kinds of tax increases Obama wants. If there’s a big backlash, the Obama administration may take it as vindication that the public won’t stand for big cuts to federally funded programs. Still, Republicans point out that the sequester idea originated at the White House.

“The sky is not going to fall but things will get progressively worse,” Maryland Democrat Rep. Chris Van Hollen said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday’s talks are designed to be a “constructive discussion” about how to keep the deep spending cuts from having harmful consequences.

The meeting, the first face-to-face since Obama was sworn in for his second term in January, will essentially look past the current $85 billion in cuts to the next looming fiscal crisis – a possible government shutdown.

On March 27, the fiscal 2013 continuing appropriations resolution expires, cutting off the ability of most agencies and programs to operate. A new spending bill will be needed to keep the government from shutting down.

Following March Madness – budget style – Congress will have two months to decide on the debt limit. Congress has suspended enforcement of the $16.4 trillion limit on federal borrowing until May 18. The short-term debt limit deal will then raise the borrowing limit the following day, on May 19, to the debt accumulated up through May 18. The short-term extension, approved in January, will allow what budget experts project will be $450 billion in additional borrowing before the debt limit is raised to a new, higher level.

And then, even if no increase in granted by May 19, the Treasury Department will be able to stave off a final day of reckoning until late July or early August by redeploying cash management measures which would allow it to claw back about $220 billion worth of borrowing capacity.

Set Debt Limit Showdown,"With the president refusing to negotiate over the essential increase and Republicans saying he must, reporters pressed Mr. Obama about whether he is considering some executive action to sidestep Congress and raise the debt ceiling — as Democratic leaders have urged. But Mr. Obama declined to answer directly, and his administration has ruled out proposals to either invoke authority under the 14th Amendment or mint a platinum coin as a sort of collateral for more debt.

The debt issue dominated the news conference, and later the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, added to the pressure by writing to Congressional leaders that the department still expects to hit the limit between mid-February and early March.

“Treasury would be left to fund the government solely with the cash we have on hand on any given day,” he said, forcing it to choose among creditors, federal contractors, veterans, Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries and the many other claimants to federal dollars. Some Republicans support temporarily making choices among claimants, but the administration and some financial analysts say that approach would be unworkable and amount to the nation’s first default on its obligations.

Separately, Mr. Geithner and Gene Sperling, director of the White House National Economic Council, held a conference call with corporate executives, many of whom have expressed concern the threat of default could damage the economy. The administration is hoping that business leaders can persuade Republicans to avoid confrontation over the debt limit, but party leaders were undeterred.

The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, also called on Congress to increase the debt ceiling to cover bills that it has already incurred. “The right way to deal with this problem is for Congress to do what it is supposed to do and what it needs to do,” Mr. Bernanke, a Republican appointed by President George W. Bush and later reappointed by Mr. Obama, said in a speech at the University of Michigan."

House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) said bureau Director Richard Cordray was not legally appointed to the position and therefore the panel cannot accept his testimony.

It was the latest salvo in a long-running battle by top Republicans against the bureau, which was created in 2010.

Republicans argue the bureau is too powerful and poses a threat to the health of banks and the rights of consumers. But the White House, backed by consumer advocates, said it is needed to prevent a repeat of the subprime mortgage meltdown and to keep financial institutions from taking advantage of average Americans.

President Obama installed Cordray in the position in early 2012 using a controversial recess appointment. A federal court has invalidated three other recess appointments Obama made on the same day, calling into question Cordray’s future.

“Absent contrary guidance from the United States Supreme Court, you do not meet the statutory requirements of a validly serving director of the CFPB, and cannot be recognized as such,” Hensarling wrote to Cordray on Monday.

Hensarling, who took over as committee chairman in January, has been an outspoken critic of the bureau. The new agency was the centerpiece of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which Hensarling and every other House Republican opposed.

Nearly all Senate Republicans also opposed the law, and they banded together to block the confirmation of any nominee to head the bureau unless changes were made to reduce its power.

House Republicans forced the Democratic-controlled Senate to limit the length of its recesses in hopes of preventing Obama from making a recess appointment.

But in January 2012, Obama appointed Cordray as well as three members to the National Labor Relations Board, positions Senate Republicans also were blocking. Obama argued the Senate was not really in session at the time and was holding pro-forma sessions simply to prevent him from making recess appointments.

A year later, a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that Obama’s NLRB recess appointments were invalid. The NLRB is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court.

The panel did not address Cordray’s appointment, but opponents of the agency have said the ruling calls into question its validity as well.

“The court’s unanimous ruling makes it clear that there is no legally appointed director of the CFPB at this time,” Hensarling said. “By law, the committee can receive this testimony only from a director who is appointed in accordance with the Constitution and the Dodd-Frank Act, which created the bureau.”

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), the top Democrat on the committee, said Cordray should be allowed to testify. A hearing has not been scheduled but had been expected in coming weeks.

“Mr. Hensarling’s own letter concedes that no court has addressed the legitimacy of the president’s appointment of Richard Cordray to be the director of the CFPB,” she said. “I suggest that Chairman Hensarling allow Director Cordray to appear before the committee to deliver his report as required by law.”

Moira Vahey, a spokeswoman for the bureau, also said the court ruling did not address Cordray’s appointment and “it has no direct effect on the bureau.”

“The bureau continues its essential work of protecting American consumers,” she said.

Interestingly, one of the main Republican complaints about the bureau is that Congress does not have enough oversight over its activities.

The bureau gets its funding directly from the Federal Reserve, not through the congressional appropriations process. In light of the court ruling, Hensarling also has questions whether Cordray has the authority to request the funding.

Hensarling said that his committee “intends to continue to conduct rigorous oversight of the CFPB’s activities” and will accept testimony from other bureau officials. He noted the committee on Monday called two bureau officials to testify about mortgage rules at a May hearing.

But the next skirmish was already on the horizon: an election-year fight over the national debt.

The budget deal that passed the Senate on Wednesday amounts to a handshake agreement to avoid a government shutdown when a temporary funding measure expires Jan. 15. However, the accord does not address the need once again to raise the debt limit, setting up a potentially complicated confrontation in late February or early March.

That fight would come just months before midterm congressional elections, and the GOP is deeply divided over tactics to deal with the debt, a core issue for the Republican base. Some conservatives are calling for another showdown, insisting on an additional round of spending cuts in exchange for granting the Treasury Department more borrowing authority to pay the nation’s bills.

But GOP leaders, especially in the House, have no appetite for another Washington fiscal crisis that could destroy their popularity among voters, aides said. Instead, they are hoping for a more peaceful resolution modeled on the latest budget deal — a bipartisan compromise that solves small problems and aims to offend almost no one.

“Republicans kind of look at this election as probably the best opportunity we’ve ever had at taking control” of the Senate, said Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). As a political message, threatening to default on the debt “hasn’t really worked all that successfully in the past,” he said.

As they rushed to finish work and leave town for a three-week Christmas break, senators were more inclined to bask in the glow of the budget deal than to plot strategy for the debt limit. The agreement draws to a close nearly three years of fighting over agency budgets — battles that repeatedly risked shutting down the government and actually did close parks, museums and federal offices for 16 days in October.

Congressional leaders appointed Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to negotiate a cease-fire. The resulting agreement would roll back sharp spending cuts known as the sequester over the next two years, sparing the Pentagon from more reductions and restoring billions of dollars for domestic programs.

The $62 billion cost would be more than covered by $85 billion in alternative policies, such as higher security fees for airline passengers, deeper cuts for Medicare providers and less generous retirement benefits for federal workers, including military retirees younger than 62.

The deal makes no effort to solve the nation’s biggest budget problem: a social safety net strained by an aging population. But it also would not raise taxes or reduce Medicare benefits, leaving each party’s core ideological commitments intact.

Last week, the deal sailed through the House and, on Wednesday, it easily passed the Senate, 64 to 36. Nine Republicans joined all 55 members of the Senate Democratic caucus in voting yes. Murray stood in the well of the chamber as the vote unfolded, accepting pats on the back from colleagues in both parties.

“The American people are sick and tired of the constant crises we’ve seen here in D.C. over the past few years,” Murray said on the Senate floor. “I am hopeful this deal can be a foundation for continued bipartisan work, because we have so many big challenges we need to tackle for the families and communities we represent.”

Afterward, senators voted overwhelmingly to end debate on a defense bill that sets Pentagon policy and military pay levels. A final vote to approve the National Defense Authorization Act was scheduled for Thursday, with hopes rising that the chamber also would approve several pending nominations and head home Friday.

Meanwhile, leaders of the congressional spending committees immediately began working on 2014 appropriations — the first in two years — to distribute about $45 billion in extra cash to federal agencies.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) was optimistic that she and her House counterpart, Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), could work through some minor disagreements and deliver an omnibus spending bill to Obama's desk by Jan. 15.

“I’m like a Raven: It’s the fourth quarter. There are seconds to go on the clock. And I’m ready to kick a 61-yard field goal,” said an exultant Mikulski, referring to Baltimore’s come-from-behind victory over the Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football.

Once that deadline is cleared, attention will turn to the national debt, which stands at $17.2 trillion. Enforcement of the debt limit has been suspended until Feb. 7, when Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said he will have about a month before he starts running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills.

On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president will not negotiate over the debt limit, sticking to the stance he adopted earlier this year. Although Republicans won $2.1 trillion in spending cuts — including the sequester — in exchange for raising the debt limit in 2011, they suspended enforcement of the debt limit twice this year without significant concessions.

“The president’s position is unchanged. He will not negotiate over Congress’s responsibility to pay the bills that Congress has racked up,” Carney told reporters, adding that administration officials do not expect Republicans “to travel down this road again.”

Republicans have devoted little thought to the debt limit, said senior aides and lawmakers. “There hasn’t been any discussion of it in any of the caucuses or committees that I’ve been on. And I don’t think it’s very clear what might happen,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who served with Ryan and Murray on the special panel tasked with forging the budget deal.

This weekend, Ryan said that the GOP will demand something in exchange for raising the debt limit, but that party leaders had not decided what.

“We don’t want ‘nothing’ out of this debt limit,” Ryan said on “Fox News Sunday.” “So we’re going to meet in our retreats after the holidays and discuss exactly what it is we’re going to try and get for this.”

This week, Senate Republican leaders echoed that view. “The plan is no clean debt ceiling,” said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. “We’re going to fight for some control on spending, and I predict we’ll get it.”

But even some conservatives were skeptical that party leaders would risk another economy-rattling standoff that could alienate voters so close to a critical election — especially after they proved willing to weaken the sequester to avert another shutdown.

“I think they’ll raise the debt ceiling and they’ll punt and try to win the election [by running against] Obamacare. But they’re not going to do anything useful to head off the bankruptcy of the country,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said of GOP leaders.

“The consensus is we gave up on budgetary restraint with this budget deal. And it doesn’t leave me any hope that all of a sudden . . . we’re going to have a spine on the debt ceiling.”

The subject is the hit on federal retirement benefits that could emerge from budget talks on Capitol Hill.

House and Senate negotiators on the Budget Conference Committee are working to resolve differences in their two spending plans by the end of the week. An announcement could come as early as Tuesday.

Federal employees and their supporters on the Hill hope the workers won’t be made to sacrifice more toward government savings — but hope is not the same as expectation.

“That’s really demoralizing for the federal workforce, who have done nothing to cause the financial mess we’re in,” said Jessica Klement, legislative director of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association.

Reports on how much will be sought have included workers paying an additional 5.5 percent of pay toward their retirement, saving the government $130 billion over 10 years. That’s been proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Budget Committee. Another proposal calls for the 1.2 percent increase in pension payments proposed by President Obama, for a savings of about $20 billion over 10 years. My colleague Lori Montgomery reports that Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, are considering another option, one that would require federal workers to come up with less than $17 billion.

Changing the formula for calculating annuities from the highest three years of pay to the highest five reportedly also is under consideration. The 2010 Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction report estimated that change would save $5 billion over 10 years.

Any amount is too much for federal employees.

“NTEU strongly opposes any further cuts in federal compensation, including what would be a pay cut resulting from an increase in pension contributions, and will continue its efforts to see that no further cuts are made,” said Colleen M. Kelley, president of theNational Treasury Employees Union.

“Going after federal employee wages yet again is insulting, demeaning and downright criminal,” said J. David Cox Sr., head of the American Federation of Government Employees. “It is disgraceful for elected officials to think that they can raid a fully funded retirement system to pay down a deficit that federal employees did not create.”

Proposals discussed so far would not take from current annuitants but would hit current employees — the same workers who have already contributed billions to help close the government’s deficit. Employees hired after 2012, however, would not pay more toward retirement under the president’s plan because they already pay its higher rate.

Along with federal employee organizations, members of the regional congressional delegation have been vigorous in their opposition to greater worker sacrifices.

“Over the last several years, federal employees — VA doctors and nurses, CIA, FBI and DEA agents and NIH researchers; and let’s not forget the victims of the recent shootings at the Navy Yard — have repeatedly been used as pawns in negotiations,” Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) complained in a letter last week to leaders of the budget committees. “To date, changes to pay and pensions for the federal workforce have already generated $113 billion in savings.”

The changes in pay, including the three-year freeze on federal employees’ basic pay rates, have led to the purchasing power of their pay falling by about 7 percent since 2010, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Murray does not favor an additional hit on federal workers, and Ryan’s office would not comment on why he thinks that’s okay.

Opposition to employees paying more has not been helped by the president. Obama’s plan to increase their out-of-pocket retirement contributions makes it more difficult for their supporters to argue for no increase.

In part because of that, and Ryan’s push to hit government employees again, there’s little reason for them to be optimistic about the budget process. They face the possibility of additional employee sacrifices through greater retirement contributions with no increase in benefits or continued sequestration budget cuts that could lead to layoffs.

Or “it could be both,” Klement said. “This is unacceptable to us.”

The truth is that many federal employees probably won’t have any choice but to accept what amounts to give-backs. In one form or another, and maybe in more ways than one, the budget agreement likely will make them give back money to their employer. Others, particularly the highly skilled and the highly talented, might choose to leave government, especially if they are eligible to retire.

In January, federal employees are scheduled to get a 1 percent raise. They should not make plans for that money, because an increase in retirement contributions could wipe it out.

Saying it is “dismayed” at the prospect of Congress increasing employee retirement contributions, the Federal-Postal Coalition, a group of more than 30 federal employee organizations, said Monday in a letter to the conference committee that “no other group of Americans has contributed to deficit reduction the way federal employees have.”

It’s a good argument, but it probably won’t stop Congress from telling feds they have to give and give again.

USA TODAY

President Obama met Friday with Senate Republicans

Sen. Susan Collins%2C R-Maine%2C is seeking consensus for a plan to end the shutdown and avert default

House Republicans continue separate negotiations with the White House

WASHINGTON — Negotiations to end the government shutdown and avert default continued into the weekend as House and Senate Republicans traded offers among themselves and with the White House in efforts to find a pathway out of the impasse.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president and Congress are ""obviously in a better place than we were a few days ago in terms of the constructive approach that we've seen of late"" but there was still no agreement. ""We're talking about a very fluid situation.""

President Obama told business leaders on a conference call Friday that he hoped a deal could be struck this weekend. The president also spoke with 25 governors from both parties.

After a meeting Friday at the White House between Obama and Senate Republicans, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said, ""The question is: Can you get something in the next 72 hours? The president seems committed to being engaged in it, and he hadn't been up to this point, so I'm optimistic.""

House and Senate Republicans appear to be pursuing different negotiations with the White House, and it is unclear whether any proposal can win over Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who leads congressional Democrats in the talks.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have been in communication but James Lankford, R-Okla., said House and Senate Republicans are ""working independent"" of each other.

""There's not the sense of 'Let's the two of us have the exact same plan and try to work together,'"" Lankford said.

Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., met separately with McConnell and Boehner on Friday and told reporters they were hopeful the House would move first. ""I think the House going first would be the best thing. That would be the preferred outcome,"" Graham said.

Democrats have resisted GOP efforts, led by Boehner, to engage in budget talks until the government is reopened and the debt ceiling is increased in advance of the Oct. 17 deadline.

Boehner and Obama spoke by phone Friday afternoon but reached no agreement except to keep talking.

The shutdown, in its 11th day, began when Republicans demanded a delay or defunding of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for their votes to keep the government running. The funding discussion has become entwined with proposals to increase the U.S. borrowing limit so the nation can continue to pay its bills on time. Republicans have moved on from focusing on the health care law and seek broader concessions on fiscal issues.

Congress will continue to work through the weekend. House Republicans will huddle Saturday morning, and the Senate is scheduled to vote on a key procedural hurdle to move forward with a 15-month increase in the debt ceiling with no conditions attached.

Boehner has offered a proposal to extend the debt limit for six weeks, but Carney said Obama believes that is too short a time frame and creates the possibility of another standoff right before the Thanksgiving and holiday shopping seasons.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is working with senators in both parties on a budget framework that includes a six-month stopgap funding bill through March and a debt ceiling increase through January. The extensions would give Congress breathing room to reach a broader budget agreement.

""I believe that still gives us plenty of leverage to work out a long-term fiscal plan, but it removes the threat of an immediate default,"" Collins said Friday.

House Republicans have also proposed a short-term stopgap spending bill to reopen the government after Obama rejected their proposal for only a debt ceiling increase.

Senate Republicans seemed more inclined to support a framework with longer-term time agreements than House Republicans seek, suggesting a divide between the two chambers on the way forward. ""I think everybody agrees that the length of time dictates the framework of what's in the agreement, so you don't get as much for a shorter term and you get more for a longer term,"" Burr said.

Some Republicans seem eager to resolve the impasse. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., cited a ""devastating"" NBC/Wall Street Journal polled released Thursday which showed the Republican Party's favorable rating at an all-time low. ""I know that they're reading the polls,"" McCain said of House Republicans.

McCain has been a vocal critic of the GOP's strategy in the shutdown fight, particularly their efforts to dismantle the president's health care law. The senator said the negotiations are lagging because of Obama's wariness of House Republicans.

""The president is very reluctant to commit to anything because he has to deal with the House of Representatives, but I'm encouraged by the attitude that's been displayed,"" McCain said. ""He sees progress, but we're a long way from (a deal.)"""

I Question the Validity of the Public Debt. Repeal Section 4, Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” That section reads: “The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.” As far as I know, the whimsical “protester” was never arrested; he wasn’t breaking any law. Congressional Republicans, if they force the United States into default on its debt, will be.

Even most journalists and policy wonks hadn’t heard of Section 4 until recently. But with a default on “the public debt” increasingly possible, many now find the subject gripping. What if the House Republican majority decides that they are just too angry to authorize repayment of the debt? They’d be violating the Constitution — but what would happen to the country, and to them?

During the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011, a number of scholars, including me, suggested that President Obama could end the standoff by proclaiming that Section 4 required him, as part of his duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” to set aside the debt ceiling and borrow enough money to fund payments on the debt. Obama later said his lawyers told him that was “not a winning argument.” This time around, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has already said that “this administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the power to the president to ignore the debt ceiling.”

Nevertheless, it’s useful to understand the history that brought Section 4 into being. Its story has parallels to the political situation in the United States today, almost a century and a half after the 14th Amendment was adopted.

In April 1865, Abraham Lincoln was killed by a southern assassin. Eight months later, the 13th Amendment was ratified and emancipation became the law of the land. But even amid the ashes of defeat and the triumph of Abolition, the South proclaimed itself not beaten, but triumphant. One influential southern newspaper explained in January 1866 that if the southern states’ population were counted proportionately in Washington, “the political power of the country will pass into the hands of the South, aided, as it will be, by Northern alliances.”

It was all too believable. Freedom for the slaves made their former masters stronger, not weaker, because southern states planned to accept full congressional representation for the freed blacks (as slaves, they had counted only as 3/5 of free people) — while permitting only whites to vote. Freed slaves now would count one for one, giving the South as many as 28 new House seats — and 28 more electoral votes — all to be determined by an all-white electorate.

After the war, the South wanted their state governments to repay the money they had borrowed to fund the Confederate war effort — and they wanted federal help to do it. If the Union would help not help pay back those debts, then they saw no reason why the U.S. national debt should be repaid either. After all, virtually all of it had been borrowed to fund the Union war effort. “If we’ve got to repudiate [the confederate debt], we may as well help the Democrats repudiate the debt on the other side too,” a delegate to Georgia’s new constitutional convention told a reporter, referring to the national debt. “What’s fair for one is fair for the other.” A South Carolina white put it more colorfully: “What, ruin us, and then make us help pay the cost of our own whipping? I reckon not!”

Northern politicians took the threat of resurgent southern power so seriously that they drafted the 14th Amendment, the longest in the Constitution. The former seceded states were excluded from Congress, and only allowed back in when their states ratified the amendment. In its five sections, it sought to systematically dismantle what northerners called “the slave power.” The Bill of Rights would apply in the South. Southern states would not get representation for black residents if the ballot remained all white. Former Confederate leaders could not serve in Congress. There would be no repayment for slaves. There would be no repayment of the Confederate debt. And the U.S. debt, amassed to pay for the war, was never to be repudiated — it was not even to be “questioned.”

Long after Reconstruction ended, the Supreme Court held that Section 4 remains an absolute command. “While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the government issued during the Civil War, its language indicates a broader connotation,” Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote for the Court in a 1935 case called Perry v. United States. “Nor can we perceive any reason for not considering the expression ‘the validity of the public debt’ as embracing whatever concerns the integrity of the public obligations.”

A large number of today’s House Republicans seem to be channeling the ghosts of those long-ago secessionists. Beaten in an election, they still expect to rule, and they seem to recognize only the laws of which they approve. But last January, every member of the House swore to “support and defend” the Constitution, and “bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” They took that obligation “freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.”

There is no “14th Amendment exception” to that oath.

A century and a half ago, nearly a million Americans died to establish the United States as one nation. And when the battle ended, the new nation publicly pledged that it had undergone Lincoln’s “new birth of freedom” — that it would give due process and equality to all within its borders.

And that it would always pay its debts. On time. In full. Whether any willful group of renegades liked it or not.

Costing just around $140 million a few years ago, federal spending on the subsidy has exploded to $2.2 billion.

Created in 1984, under President Reagan, the program is funded by a tax on regular phone service. The program was intended to cover the high capital costs of running telephone lines to remote, rural areas. In 2008, however, the program was expanded, through bureaucratic rule-making, to include cell phones. Today, a number of companies offer “free” cell phones and cell phone service plans to low-income people on welfare or food stamps.

The program seems riddled with waste, however. The FCC recently admitted that an audit found almost 300,000 individuals with more than one subsidized phone. The Agency also testified to Congress that the top 5 companies offering phones and service couldn’t verify the eligibility of 41% of the recipients of the free phones.

The history of this program should caution those embracing a new phone subsidy contained in the “Gang of 8” immigration bill unveiled last week. The program, dubbed “MarcoPhones” by some commentators, would provide grants to people living within 100 miles of the border who “lack cellular service” to purchase satellite phones.

The proposal originated in legislation introduced by Sens. McCain and Kyl in 2011, in response to the murder of a rancher who lived in an area with weak cellular coverage. That proposal had very general eligibility criteria, but restricted funding to just $3 million over 2 years. The “Gang of 8” proposal, however, keeps the broad eligibility criteria, but removes any funding restriction.

The original federal program to provide telephone service to residents in rural areas was well-intentioned. Establishing a dedicated funding mechanism, however, enabled the program to continue long after its goal was achieved. The FCC is considering expanding the program even beyond cell phones to also subsidize broadband internet connections.

Government programs, left on their own, will always expand. The “MarcoPhone” program in the immigration bill is a test case. Applying very broad eligibility criteria with no funding restriction is a recipe for potential fraud and waste. It is a very small part of a large bill, but it could have very real long-term fiscal consequences.

http://news.yahoo.com/senators-student-loan-interest-rates-double-184951507.html,,[],Senators: Student loan interest rates to double,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Student loan rates will double Monday — at least for a while — after a compromise to keep student loan interest rates low proved unwinnable before the July 1 deadline, senators said Thursday.

Sen. Tom Harkin, the chairman of the Senate education panel, said none of the proposals being circulating among lawmakers could win passage, and he urged lawmakers to extend the current rates for another year when they return from the July 4 recess. Harkin said his colleagues could retroactively restore the current rates after the holiday.

""Let's put this off for a year,"" Harkin, D-Iowa, told reporters.

Interest rates on new subsidized Stafford loans are set to go from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on Monday unless lawmakers take action. Congress' Joint Economic Committee estimates the increase will cost the average student $2,600.

""Neither party wants to see rates rise next week,"" said Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C.

But a one-year rate extension isn't an acceptable option, either, he said.

""Last year we kicked the can down the road and passed a one-year extension for only a small group of students. ... Why would we make the same mistake again and just kick the can down the road another year?"" said Burr, who was among a group of senators who worked on a competing proposal with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.

The Manchin-led proposal would link interest rates to the financial markets. It borrowed heavily from a version House Republicans passed earlier and from principles included in President Barack Obama's budget proposal.

Critics called it a bait-and-switch move that would provide students lower interest rates at first before they climb upward as the economy improves.

""Students across this country would rather have no deal than a bad deal,"" said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I. ""We're at the point where we have to do our best to extend the 3.4 percent interest rate while we work on a good deal, not just any deal.""

Republicans blamed Democrats and said they would be responsible for the expected rate hike.

Story continues

""As a result of their obstruction, the Democrat-led Senate will leave town and allow interest rates on some new student loans to increase on Monday,"" said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. ""Senate Democrats continue to block reform and insist on kicking the can down the road.""

Republicans also noted the Manchin-led proposal had many similarities with Obama's, including a link between 10-year Treasury notes and student rates.

""This agreement is very much like the proposal in the president's budget, it is very much like the proposal passed by the Republican House of Representatives and it will save billions of dollars in interest for all 11 million students taking out loans this year by dropping rates on all student loans,"" said Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

Alexander, a former education secretary, called Harkin's proposal ""a short-term, political fix.""

""That's no fix at all when we have a plan to help all students that we can pass quickly,"" he added.

Nothing was happening — quickly or not — before July 1, meaning students who take loans would face higher rates. Senators were heading out of town without a deal, and Harkin said his colleagues would consider a retroactive fix on July 10.

""I think we are nowhere between now and July 1,"" said Rep. George Miller of California, the top Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee. ""It sounds to me like the Senate is going to leave town without dealing with this.""

But Democrats promised to turn back to them when they get back to Washington, first with a short-term fix and then a longer-range measure.

The law that governs college and universities expires this fall and lawmakers planned to rewrite it starting in September. Democrats said they prefer to include a comprehensive student loan measure in it, rather than as a stand-alone bill.

""We need a one-year patch to keep interest rates from doubling on student loans,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. ""That buys us the time.""

Battered by a collapse in real estate prices, a spike in pension and retiree health care costs, and unmanageable debt, this struggling city in the Central Valley has labored for months to find a way out of Chapter 9. Now having renegotiated its debt with most creditors, cobbled together layoffs and service cuts and raised the sales tax to 9 percent from 8.25 percent, Stockton is nearly ready to leave court protection.

But what Stockton, along with pretty much every other city in California that has gone into bankruptcy in recent years, has not done is address the skyrocketing public pensions that are at the heart of many of these cases.

“No city wants to take on the state pension system by itself,” said Stockton’s new mayor, Anthony Silva, referring to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers. “Every city thinks some other city will take care of it.”

While a federal bankruptcy judge ruled this week that Detroit could reduce public pensions to help shed its debts, Stockton has become an experiment of whether a municipality can successfully come out of bankruptcy and stabilize its finances without touching pensions. It is an effort that has come at great cost to city services and one that some critics say will simply not work once the city starts trying to restore services and hire 120 police officers it promised to get the sales-tax increase passed."

They are proposing a blatant violation of the 14th Amendment, which states that “the validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law” is sacrosanct and “shall not be questioned.”

Yet the Obama administration has repeatedly suppressed any talk of invoking the Constitution in this emergency. Last Thursday Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said, “We do not believe that the 14th Amendment provides that authority to the president” to end the crisis. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew reiterated the point on Sunday and added that the president would have “no option” to prevent a default on his own.

In defense of the administration’s position, the legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, who taught President Obama at Harvard Law School, has insisted, as he put it two years ago, that “only political courage and compromise” can avert disaster.

These assertions, however, have no basis in the history of the 14th Amendment; indeed, they distort that history, and in doing so shackle the president. In fact, that record clearly shows that Congress intended the amendment to prevent precisely the abuses that the current House Republicans blithely condone."

Detroit Free Press

Dan Akerson says GM shouldn%27t have to repay Treasury for losses from the bailout

The government lost about %2410 billion

He says the government benefited from its investment

Correction: An earlier version of this story omitted the significance of gender in describing Mary Barra's historical ranking among General Motor CEOs.

WASHINGTON -- The General Motors bailout may have cost the government $10 billion, but GM CEO Dan Akerson rejects any suggestion that the company should compensate for the losses.

He says Treasury officials took the same risk assumed by anyone who purchases stock.

""I would not accept the premise that this was a bad deal,"" Akerson said during a question-and-answer session at the National Press Club in Washington. He also said the government's $49.5-billion aid to GM helped save billions of dollars in tax revenue and government social services.

Akerson spoke in the wake of Treasury announcement last week that it sold its last shares in GM and Akerson's decision to retire in January. The automaker's board of directors named Mary Barra, the company's first woman CEO, to succeed Akerson.

The speech also came as GM announced it is investing $1.2-billion in five U.S. plants, which Akerson said is a recognition that after 15 straight profitable quarters the automaker can't rest on its success.

""We are in a capital-intensive business that demands steady and significant investment,"" Akerson said, as he discussed many of the changes that had to be made to the automaker's corporate structure after exiting a ""quick rinse"" bankruptcy in 2009.

Akerson said it fell to him and his team to restore GM's good name, transform operations and ""put quality and the customer back at the center"" of the company's decision-making, a process he called ""the biggest cultural change we've been able to infuse into the new GM.""

He said GM's bloated and overly complex operations have been streamlined, products are better and, with the government's help, a crushing debt was reduced.

""We've been trying to fix this airplane while in the air,"" he said.

Akerson said that GM repaid all the debt issued by the government beginning in December 2008 when George W. Bush was still president and extending into the first year of Barack Obama's presidency. He added that it was the Treasury's decision -- though one he clearly supported -- to take an ownership stake in the form of company shares.

Asked whether GM should pay the difference between the amount the government provided the company and the return from the sale of the shares, Akerson said the ""die was cast"" by Treasury when it decided to take shares. For GM to make up for any shortfall could result in lawsuits from other shareholders. Those investors expect the company to resume paying a dividend for the first time since it exited bankruptcy in July 2009.

He also defended the deal as one that saved millions of jobs, saying ""net-net, it was a positive for the U.S. economy.""

Now, it will be up to Barra to continue GM's success. Monday's news that the automaker is upgrading and expanding facdtories in Flint, Detroit-Hamtramck and Romulus; as well as others in Toledo, Ohio, and Bedford, Ind., was meant to demonstrate that momentum.

""This will bring the four-year total of investments in our U.S. plants to more than $10 billion,"" Akerson said. He said about 7,500 people already work in those five plants and today's announcements will create or retain more than 1,100 jobs."

Mission accomplished. Why so many long faces?

Advertisement

President Obama and congressional Republicans went through their first round of cutting in 2011, shaving about $1.5 trillion from federal spending. The “fiscal cliff” deal in January brought another $720 billion, mostly in higher taxes on the wealthy.

Now the automatic spending reduction package known as the sequester is projected to cut spending by about another $1 trillion over the decade, with some $85 billion coming this year. Those changes in spending and taxes will save the government an additional $700 billion in interest over the decade by reducing the need to borrow money, bringing the overall total to more than $3.9 trillion.

Earlier cuts have already had an effect. Although polls show that most Americans think the federal deficit is still growing — almost 2 in 3 people said so in a recent Bloomberg poll — the opposite is true: The deficit hit its peak in 2008 and has begun to shrink rapidly.

Red ink totaled $1.2 trillion last year, will fall to about $900 billion this year and will drop to about $476 billion by the end of Obama’s second term, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Though still a large number, that’s less than 3% of the huge U.S. economy, a share below the level most economists consider threatening.

No one expected that achieving a deficit reduction target would prompt a parade. As politicians know, the public disdains deficits in theory, but in practice has a greater dislike for both spending cuts and tax increases. Still, as the sequester put the final piece of the $4-trillion deficit reduction into place, the reaction among both Republicans and Democrats was notable for its bitterness.

Three reasons underlie the negativity. They involve process, timing and the ultimate goal each side seeks to reach. Those disagreements seem likely to shape continued squabbles over federal spending and taxes for at least the next two years and possibly throughout Obama’s second term, starting with a deadline at the end of this month that could lead to a partial government shutdown. (Both sides seem to want to avoid that.)

Advertisement

The process some on both sides had envisioned was the much-discussed “grand bargain” in which Democrats would agree to cut Medicare and, perhaps, Social Security in exchange for Republican agreement on a tax increase.

In August 2011, Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) failed to reach such a deal. Instead, both sides agreed to the sequester as a backup, gambling that they wouldn’t need it. Republicans bet they would win the 2012 presidential election and be able to enact their own budget solutions. Obama believed that if he won reelection, the Republican “fever” to oppose tax increases would abate.

Advertisement

Both lost their bets. Republican opposition to taxes has only hardened as the party has found itself divided and besieged on other issues after Obama’s reelection. The president forced Republicans to accept the tax increase contained in January’s fiscal cliff deal because he gave them no choice — not acting meant an even bigger tax hike. Since then, Obama has offered up cuts in Medicare and Social Security cost-of-living adjustments that Republicans had sought, but Republican leaders have repeatedly said they would not agree to more tax revenue.

Now, Obama has largely given up on reaching a large-scale deal with Republicans, according to former White House officials and others close to him. Where he once talked about the fever breaking, he now tells people that he thinks GOP legislators are unwilling to stand up to their most conservative voters and cannot reach a compromise.

Advertisement

The desire to step away from negotiations is not limited to his side of the aisle. Many Republican policy experts have similarly retreated, advising GOP lawmakers that until they recapture the White House, they can block Obama’s budget priorities but can’t expect to enact their own.

With both sides interested in moving on to other issues, the sequester seems likely to stay in place for the rest of the budget year, which ends Sept. 30, even though it embodies policies that both sides see as their second choice at best.

Advertisement

Both sides also dislike the cuts for a significant timing problem: They begin hitting now, when the economy remains weak, and will probably slow the recovery. At the same time, the cuts do very little to help with the bigger budget challenge down the road.

Sometime in the next president’s tenure, deficits probably will start worsening again. About 40 million more Americans are expected to become eligible for Medicare and Social Security by the end of the decade as baby boomers retire, and as they move onto the rolls, costs will rise fast.

Advertisement

But the political system deals poorly with issues that will come to a head in some future president’s term. Moreover, the size of the problem remains uncertain, dependent on how fast the economy grows and how much healthcare costs rise. Recent data have shown healthcare inflation slowing substantially, causing the budget office to reduce cost estimates by about 15%, or some $200 billion.

No one knows whether that good news on healthcare is permanent, but already it has made liberal Democrats less willing to consider big changes in Medicare right away.

Advertisement

The mistrust each side feels for the other makes a big deal even less likely.

Many Democrats fear Republicans would simply dismantle Medicare if given an opportunity. Republicans feel Democrats lack a sense of responsibility about the government’s long-range financial situation and will spend the government into crisis. And each is unwilling to give up its ideological goals — for Republicans, a smaller government; for Democrats, a more protective one.

Advertisement

All that helps account for Washington’s budget gloom.

As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress last week, “Significant progress has been made recently toward reducing the federal budget deficit over the next few years.” By contrast, “the difficult process of addressing longer-term fiscal imbalances has only begun.”

(CNN) - Today is the day lawmakers have known about since August 2011: the day those forced federal spending cuts kick in.

This Friday is also a day many never expected would come. After all, the cuts known as sequestration were designed to be so draconian that lawmakers would be forced to compromise and avoid them.



But they haven’t, and as lawmakers left Washington to begin their weekend on Thursday, so left any prospect of avoiding the cuts that President Barack Obama and his administration have warned will lead to long airport lines and fewer air traffic safety controllers; federal government furloughs and layoffs; cuts to food inspection and border security programs; and education funding decreases that will shut young students out of Head Start programs.

For all of the dire warnings, Obama acknowledged Wednesday that the cuts are “not a cliff, but it is a tumble downward.” He’ll set the cuts in motion on Friday with a stroke of his pen.

He is required to sign an order enacting the spending cuts by 11:59 p.m. Friday and will do so privately, White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday.

Before that happens, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with top congressional leaders: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

But Friday is seen by many as too late to reach a deal averting the cuts, especially with Congress out of town for the weekend.

After Obama signs the order, the Office of Management and Budget will send to Congress a detailed accounting of the cuts – how much from which agencies and which accounts. Every ""program, project and activity"" has to be trimmed without regard for what it is, according to the OMB.

Those who are employed by the government or rely on federal agencies’ spending are expected to feel the effects first. From there, the effects of the sequester will ripple outward across the economy.

The Obama administration has said the law gives them no leeway to spare one budget line at the expense of another, and insiders expect the cuts to be about 9% for nondefense programs and 13% for defense accounts.

What agencies do have some discretion over is how they roll out the cuts. In some cases, furloughs and other cuts could be backloaded, scheduling them to take effect at a greater rate later in the year in hopes that Congress will reach a deal to replace the sequester that has so far been elusive.

OMB sent affected federal agencies a letter on Wednesday reminding them to prepare for the cuts. Some agencies have already given employees their official 30-day notice of upcoming furloughs. Others are expected to follow soon, and budget uncertainty has already caused some agencies to cut back.

Congress delayed the cuts from triggering in January at the time of the fiscal cliff. The two month delay from January 1 to March 1, however, made the cuts steeper than the original 5% for nondefense spending and 8% for defense programs.

Not everyone is convinced these forced spending cuts are a bad idea. Some deficit hawks see them as one way to reduce ballooning federal spending and others who favor reducing military spending see their virtue, too.

Altogether, the cuts will amount to some $85 billion dollars this fiscal year, which ends September 30.

While today means the end to one fiscal showdown, fans of Washington financial wrangling have another date to anticipate: March 27. That’s the deadline for Congress to extend the continuing resolution that’s funding the government.

24/7 Wall St.

Five states have passed measures to raise the minimum wage this year

Only one of the eight states is has %27right to work%27 law

Highest state minimum wage is %249.19 an hour

The White House recently announced President Obama's support for a Senate bill that would increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. While it remains to be seen whether the bill will make it through Congress, many states are not waiting to take action.

Five states have passed measures to raise the minimum wage this year, according to data published by the National Conference of State Legislators. Only one of these states, California, has passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the states with the highest minimum wages.

Whether or not a higher minimum wage is good for the economy continues to be the subject of debate. The National Employment Law Project (NELP), which advocates raising the minimum wage, maintains that the decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage ""has contributed to the growth of income inequality over the past three decades.""

Other groups maintain that raising the minimum wage is bad for business and jobs. The Heritage Foundation notes that if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, the combined costs of wages, employer penalties for not paying health insurance and taxes ""would raise the minimum cost of hiring a full-time worker to $12.71 per hour.""

A state's cost of living may influence its minimum wage. The cost of living in six of the eight states with a minimum wage over $8 an hour is higher than the nationwide cost of living. In Connecticut, where the minimum wage is currently $8.25, the cost of living is the fourth highest in the nation. The cost of living is similarly high in California, Massachusetts and Vermont.

Another factor keeping the minimum wage high in these states likely involves labor representation. Among these eight states, only Nevada is a ""right to work state,"" meaning workers cannot be required to join a union or pay for a union's costs as a condition of employment.

Many states where current minimum wages are among the nation's highest also have high union membership. In Washington, which currently has the nation's highest minimum wage, 18.5% of workers are union members, fourth highest nationally. Among private sector workers, five of the eight states had among the 10 highest union membership.

Based on information provided by the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the eight states with a minimum wage above $8 per hour. Additional figures on the cost of living in various states are from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC). Data on union membership by state are from the Union Membership and Coverage Database for 2012. Figures on poverty, income and income inequality as of 2012 are from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Unemployment rates are as of October 2013, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

These are the eight states with the highest minimum wages.

8. Massachusetts

> Minimum wage: $8.00 (tied for 7th highest)

> Poverty rate: 11.9% (11th lowest)

> Union participation: 14.3% (12th highest)

> Cost of living: 8th highest

Unlike the many states that tie minimum wages to inflation to ensure earnings keep up with living costs, in Massachusetts the minimum wage has not changed since 2008. The cost of living in Massachusetts is hardly low. Overall, the state is one of the most expensive places to live in the country. The cost of health care, for example, is higher than in every state except for Alaska. That burden, however, may not be felt as much by the state's population because more than 95% of residents are covered by health insurance, the most in the nation. Other high costs may still be affordable for many living in Massachusetts. Median household income last year was among the highest in the United States, at $65,339. Union participation in the state is especially strong. Roughly 64% of public workers are union members, trailing only New York.

7. California

> Minimum wage: $8.00 (tied for 7th highest)

> Poverty rate: 17.0% (18th highest)

> Union participation: 17.2% (6th highest)

> Cost of living: 6th highest

California's minimum wage of $8 per hour is tied with Massachusetts as the seventh highest in the nation. This should change, as California's legislature recently approved plans to increase the state's minimum wage to $9 per hour next year and to $10 per hour by 2016, higher than any other state. The state is among the nation's most expensive, especially due to the high cost of housing, which trails only Hawaii and New York, according to MERIC. While California's poverty rate was just 18th highest among the 50 states, poverty remains an issue. When extending poverty measures to take into account families and individuals that are not reflected in standard poverty rates, California had the nation's highest ""supplemental poverty measure"" from 2010 and 2012, at 23.8% versus 16% nationally, according to a recent report from the Census Bureau.

6. Nevada

> Minimum wage: $8.25 (tied for 4th highest)

> Poverty rate: 16.4% (19th highest)

> Union participation: 14.8% (10th highest)

> Cost of living: 24th lowest

Workers in Nevada must either be paid $8.25 an hour, or the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour if they receive health benefits. Nevada also indexes its minimum wage to annual changes in inflation or the federal minimum wage, whichever increases by more. But because the federal minimum was raised in 2009, the state has not increased its minimum wage in recent years. Still, the state's minimum wage remains among the nation's highest. Nearly 15% of the state's workers, including 11.1% of the state's private workers, were union members last year, 10th and fourth highest nationwide, respectively.

5. Illinois

> Minimum wage: $8.25 (tied for 4th highest)

> Poverty rate: 14.7% (24th lowest)

> Union participation: 14.6% (11th highest)

> Cost of living: 21st lowest

Overall, it is cheaper to live in Illinois than most other states. The state's minimum wage is the highest in the Midwest at $8.25, tied with Nevada and Connecticut. Even so, Governor Pat Quinn has advocated raising the minimum wage to $10 per hour. In some sectors, union membership may be strong enough to improve working conditions without the government. For example, nearly 40% of private construction workers are union members, by far the most compared to other states. Despite the well-being suggested by the relatively low cost of living and the high wages — typical Illinois households earn more than the national median — the state still faces challenges. As of October, the state's 8.9% unemployment rate was one of the highest in the country.

4. Connecticut

> Minimum wage: $8.25 (tied for 4th highest)

> Poverty rate: 10.7% (4th lowest)

> Union participation: 14.0% (14th highest)

> Cost of living: 4th highest

In May, the Connecticut House passed a bill to increase the state's minimum wage to $9 per hour by 2015. Governor Dan Malloy noted the bill would make life ""easier for working people in [the] state without adversely impacting the business community."" However, as of the third quarter of this year, Connecticut was still one of the most expensive states in the nation to live. The state ranked at least sixth highest in every major component factored into the cost of living, including ranking fourth highest for groceries and second highest for transportation, according to MERIC. Income inequality in the state also remains extreme. Last year, only New York had a higher Gini coefficient than Connecticut — the coefficient measures income distribution. The wealthiest 5% of Connecticut households accounted for 24.6% of all state earnings as of 2012, more than in any other state.

3. Vermont

> Minimum wage: $8.60

> Poverty rate: 11.8% (10th lowest)

> Union participation: 10.7% (21st highest)

> Cost of living: 9th highest

Minimum wage is $8.60 per hour in Vermont, the third highest in the nation. While a typical Vermont household income was higher than in most states last year, earnings do not go as far. The state's fuel and food costs are among the highest in the nation. The minimum wage rate in Vermont is partly determined by inflation, as calculated by the consumer price index. The state labor department recalculates the appropriate wage every year. This year, the minimum wage is scheduled to increase by 13 cents to $8.73 an hour. As is usually the case nationwide, poverty in Vermont has been worse in urban areas. In Burlington, the state's largest city, the city council implemented a livable wage ordinance in 2001. The ordinance set a minimum pay of $17.71 per hour when health insurance is not offered and $13.94 an hour when it is. Last year, less than 12% of households lived below the poverty line and only 6.5% of residents lacked health insurance, both among the best rates in the nation.

2. Oregon

> Minimum wage: $8.95

> Poverty rate: 17.2% (15th highest)

> Union participation: 15.8% (9th highest)

> Cost of living: 13th highest

Despite having the nation's second highest minimum wage, take-home incomes in Oregon may be inadequate for many state residents. Median household income was lower than the national rate in 2012, at $49,161. More than one in five households relied on food stamps last year, the highest proportion in the country. Additionally, despite having a higher cost of living than the country as a whole, the state's median income was just over $49,000, more than $2,000 less than the national median income. Soon, however, workers earning minimum wage can expect a moderate improvement. Starting January 1, 2014, the minimum wage will increase by 15 cents to $9.10 per hour. With the increase, minimum wage employees working 30 hours a week will earn an additional $234 annually, according to the state's Bureau of Labor and Industries.

1. Washington

> Minimum wage $9.19

> Poverty rate: 13.5% (19th lowest)

> Union participation: 18.5% (4th highest)

> Cost of living: 15th highest

Washington has the highest minimum wage in the nation at $9.19 per hour. Recently, state officials certified a vote in favor of Proposition 1, the ballot measure to implement a $15 wage floor in the city of SeaTac. The new law, if passed, will affect roughly 6,000 airport and hotel employees in SeaTac, Washington. Union activity is strong in Washington, with 18.5% of the state's workforce active union members, more than all but three other states. Union membership among those working in the manufacturing sector is the highest out of every state. Washington is also among America's wealthier states, with a median household income of $57,573 as of 2012, versus a national median of $51,371.

(CNN) - The Treasury Department does not plan to mint a $1 trillion platinum coin to avert federal government default, a spokesman said Saturday.

The statement from Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Anthony Coley effectively puts to bed speculation that the administration would act unilaterally to avert default. It also puts the onus on Congress – specifically Republicans in the House - to act.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""Neither the Treasury Department nor the Federal Reserve believes that the law can or should be used to facilitate the production of platinum coins for the purpose of avoiding an increase in the debt limit,"" Coley said in a statement.

With the Saturday statement, the Obama administration has shut down two potential legal loopholes by which the executive branch could avoid the Treasury from being unable to pay the nation’s bills.

Defaulting on the nation’s debts would be catastrophic to the economy. Hesitation over the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011 caused the stock market to tumble and led to the downgrade of the nation’s credit rating by Standard & Poor’s.

As that debt deadline loomed, Obama was asked about one potential loophole: reading the 14th Amendment’s requirement that the “validity of the public debt of the United States … shall not be questioned.” If Congress were not to act, some have suggested, the president could act unilaterally, viewing the debt limit as unconstitutional and – in the words of former President Bill Clinton – “force the courts to stop me.""

“I have talked to my lawyers,” Obama said that summer. “They are not persuaded that that is a winning argument. So the challenge for me is to make sure that we do not default.”

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney ruled out that constitutional route on Friday.

“There is no Plan B. There is no backup plan,” he told reporters. “There is Congress’ responsibility to pay the bills of the United States.”

On Saturday, he added, “Congress can pay its bills or they can fail to act and put the nation into default.”

""The president and the American people won't tolerate congressional Republicans holding the American economy hostage again simply so they can force disastrous cuts to Medicare and other programs the middle class depend on while protecting the wealthy,” Carney said. “Congress needs to do its job.""

The second loophole would be to mint a platinum coin of a large denomination, which the Treasury is authorized to do and is not subject to the restrictions placed on coins made of other metals.

Stamped with a denomination such as $1 trillion, that platinum coin would be deposited into the Federal Reserve. Some experts say it would not inflate U.S. currency overall because the coin would be a technical device and not enter into circulation.

The laws which leave this loophole, however, were not designed for this purpose. The authorization to mint platinum coins, for example, was intended to allow production of collectors’ items.

The federal government has already reached the debt ceiling of nearly $16.4 trillion, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said last month.

Right now, his department is staving off default through “extraordinary measures,” which are expected to cover the balance for a few more weeks.

Political analysts are looking ahead to what could be a showdown which rivals the fireworks of the fiscal cliff negotiations of just a few weeks ago.

Obama has called on Congress to raise the debt ceiling without the haggling.

""While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed,"" he said after the fiscal cliff deal passed the House. ""If Congress refuses to give the United States government the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy would be catastrophic - far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff.""

But some Republicans want to see spending cuts balance an increase in the government’s borrowing ability. Among them is Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, who delivered her party’s weekly address on Saturday.

""I believe we cannot agree to increase the borrowing limit without addressing our out-of-control spending,” she said. “That's why Nebraskans sent me here. That's what the American people demand. And that's what our children and our grandchildren deserve.""

Congress is also faced with the March expiration of the resolution funding the government and the sequester, those across-the-board spending cuts created by Congress as an incentive to avoid a future showdown similar to the 2011 debt ceiling fight. But that attempt failed, and Congress avoided the fiscal cliff by, in part, pushing those cuts back to this spring.

The Treasury Department judgment was first reported by The Washington Post.

Schwartz'],Lowest Jobless Rate in 5 Years Raises Odds of a Fed Move,"After years of frustrating fits and starts in the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the United States economy finally appears to be generating jobs at a healthier, more sustainable pace that many analysts now think will continue into 2014. The official unemployment rate fell in November to its lowest level since 2008.

Employers have hired at least 200,000 workers in three of the last four months, including 203,000 in November. By contrast, as recently as July, when the economy seemed stuck in yet another summer swoon, only 89,000 new jobs were created.

The better-than-expected data from the Labor Department on Friday follows other hopeful economic indicators this week, including an upward revision for economic growth in the third quarter on Thursday and an uptick in manufacturing reported on Monday.

The 7 percent unemployment rate last month — down from its most recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009 — is the best reading since President Obama took office, providing one bright spot for a White House beleaguered on many other fronts. The unemployment rate was 7.3 percent in December 2008, the month before Mr. Obama was inaugurated."

In the linked interview where he called for that sale, he also advocated the abolition of farm subsidies and the enactment of a flat tax, and he opposed the enactment of Medicare. In other words, this position was one of a right-wing GOP crank who was throughly demolished by the last New Deal Dem to be elected president.

To see a Dem president coming off a resounding re-election steal a page from Goldwater's playbook (at the same time that he's proposing to cut SS) causes the mind to reel. I'm really not old enough to recall any details of the 1964 campaign, but Goldwater's pledge to sell TVA, along w/ his suggestion to lob one into the men's room of the Kremlin demonstrated his clear lack of seriousness as a prospective president. TVA thereafter became as dangerous of a third rail in American politics as SS.

It's fascinating to note that both of TN's GOP senators opposing this idea. Even Goopers suddenly become ""socialists"" when it's their own ox that's being gored:

The power authority’s bonds fell on news of a potential sale, which was criticized as “one more bad idea in a budget full of bad ideas,” by Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican...A sale of TVA would cost taxpayers money and may boost electricity rates, Alexander said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Both of Tennessee’s Republican senators oppose a sale. “There is by law no federal taxpayer liability for TVA debt,” the senator said. “And after deducting its debt, selling TVA would probably cost taxpayers money.”



It was my understanding that, as exemplified by his dinner last night w/ Johnny Isakson and 11 of his friends, the president is trying to build bridges to GOP senators. Why alienate 2 of them so that you can potentially repudiate FDR's legacy and carry out the agenda of the GOP right? Why is such an insane idea even beingAre there any other equally insane proposals in this budget?

TVA, like any program of its scale, has its obvious flaws. Selling it off to Wall Street, probably at a loss, however, is the worst idea imaginable. The fact that it is even on the table now raises even more questions about exactly what it was that we voted for last November."

Mui', 'December', 'Ylan Q. Mui Was A Financial Reporter At The Washington Post Covering The Federal Reserve', 'The Economy. She Left The Post In January']",Benefits to end Saturday for long-term jobless,"Kathy Biscotti tries to remain positive as she continues to job hunt in person and online in Baltimore, MD on December 23, 2013. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)

Kathy Biscotti cut back to two meals a day after losing her job over the summer. On Saturday, she must swallow an even more bitter pill: the end of her federal unemployment benefits.

An estimated 1.3 million long-term unemployed workers like Biscotti are expected to be affected when the program expires. The extended benefits, staunchly opposed by Republicans, were left out of the bipartisan federal budget agreement reached this month. Senate Democrats have vowed to make the issue a top priority when they return to Washington in January, but Biscotti says she can’t wait that long.

“I could be out on the street by then,” said the 51-year-old Baltimore resident, who lost her job as an office assistant at a real estate company in June. “I have no control over this. It’s all up to Congress.”

The emergency unemployment benefits have been a staple of Washington’s efforts to cushion Main Street from the blows of the recession for the past five years. Lawmakers have extended the program 11 times, never allowing it to lapse — until now.

Support for the benefits waned as the recovery strengthened and hiring picked up. During negotiations over the federal budget, Democrats agreed to cut the program in hopes of averting the political gridlock that led to the government shutdown in the fall. The Senate is expected to vote on a bill next month that would reinstate the benefits for three months, but recipients face, at best, a delay in their checks.

The emergency unemployment benefits were instituted by President George W. Bush in 2008 as the financial crisis ramped up and the jobless rate started up toward the 10 percent peak it would hit the following year. Typically, states provide insurance payments to unemployed workers for up to six months. But as the nation spiraled into recession, and then the recovery struggled to gain traction, the federal government offered repeated extensions, each lasting a period of several months, allowing some people to stay on for 99 weeks. The program has paid out $225 billion in benefits.

The ranks of the long-term unemployed peaked at more than 6.7 million in the spring of 2010, according to government data. The number has since declined to about 4 million, but they still account for more than a third of those who are out of work.

It takes the average job hunter almost eight months to get hired, data show, compared to less than five months before the recession.

Ending the benefits could encourage some workers to take part-time work or lower-paying jobs than they would have otherwise, economists say. But many are expected to give up looking for work altogether. Some may even apply for disability benefits instead.

“This will likely lead to an artificial decline in the overall unemployment rate,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. “It would be giving a little bit of a false signal of the labor market improving.”

Analysts say the decline in the unemployment rate could range from a quarter to a half a percentage point.

Cutting the benefits is also likely to slow economic growth next year, Anderson said. The reduced consumer spending will shave two-tenths to four-tenths of a percentage point from the nation’s gross domestic output — effectively negating the boost from the budget deal, he said.

Still, most economists are calling for stronger growth in 2014, making the benefits program an increasingly tough sell on Capitol Hill. Businesses have created nearly 200,000 jobs during the past four months despite the federal government shutdown and uncertainty emanating from Washington. The economy grew faster than expected during the third quarter, and forecasts for the final months of the year have brightened.

Some economists say that ending the benefits could encourage companies to hire more people because employers would be under less pressure to offer higher wages. But others say the benefits are too small to deter workers from taking a job — and too critical to eliminate.

“Even though those benefits are modest, it’s what puts food on the table and pays the heating bills,” said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. “A lot of people are living on the edge.”

Biscotti receives $332 a week in unemployment insurance — about half of what she was bringing home from her last job. Most of the money goes toward renting the small apartment in Baltimore that she shares with her adult son. Whatever is left is carefully divided between utilities and groceries.

“I just feel like they pulled the rug out from all the unemployed Americans. They need to give us a warning period,” she said.

Biscotti said she spends up to five hours a day on her job hunt, applying for about 30 jobs a week and frequenting career centers and workshops. She estimates she has gone on 20 job interviews since June, but nothing has panned out.

She was hoping to find something that paid at least $9 an hour. But now, facing the end of her benefits, she said she will do anything.

“I’m trying to find a job that will pay my bills. I’m looking for anything that I’m remotely qualified for,” she said. “There’s just nothing out there.”

For most of her life, Biscotti was a waitress. But in 2004, in the middle of the housing boom, she took her first desk job, as an office assistant at Morgan Stanley. She got laid off when the recession hit, and it took two years for her to find her job at the real estate company. Now, she is back at square one.

Her travails underscore the central concern economists have over the lingering number of long-term unemployed: The longer workers have been out of a job, the harder it is for them to get hired. According to a report by the White House, those who have been unemployed for five weeks or less have a 1-in-3 chance of finding a job in a given month. The odds are only 1 in 10 for those who have been unemploy­ed for more than a year.

Academics cite several reasons, including the erosion of skills and professional networks and bias on the part of employers. The result, they worry, is a class of workers that gets left farther and farther behind.

Biscotti said she wants to prove them wrong — but time is no longer on her side.

“The hardest job I’ve ever had,” she said, “is looking for a job.”"

Before Becoming An Editor', 'She Was A Reporter Covering U.S. Economic Policy']","Obama, Republicans in debt talks on two fronts","President Obama opened talks with House Republicans on Thursday about their plan to lift the federal debt limit through late November, raising hopes that Washington would avert its first default on the national debt.

But after a 90-minute meeting at the White House, the two sides remained at odds over how and when to end the government shutdown — now in its 11th day — with Obama insisting that Republicans reopen federal agencies before negotiations over broader budget issues can begin.

In the Senate, top Republicans began crafting a proposal that would reopen the government and raise the federal debt limit for as long as three months — an approach closer to the terms Obama has set to end the standoff.

The developments meant that bipartisan negotiations were suddenly underway on two separate tracks Thursday after weeks of stalemate. Major questions remain, however, about the path ahead.

Both sides described Obama’s evening session with House Republicans as a “good meeting” and said talks will continue.

Graphic House Republicans have proposed funding that amounts to about one-third of discretionary funding. See the bills here.

“The president’s goal remains to ensure we pay the bills we’ve incurred, reopen the government and get back to the business of growing the economy,” the White House said in a statement.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) left the session and returned to the Capitol without speaking to reporters. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said the meeting was “clarifying,” even though it did not produce a resolution.

“He didn’t say yes. He didn’t say no,” said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). “We’re continuing to negotiate this evening.”

White House officials were careful not to characterize the meeting as a negotiation, after the president spent weeks publicly and privately declaring that he would not negotiate over lifting the debt ceiling. According to a Democrat familiar with the meeting, Obama agreed to review GOP proposals for reopening the government but reiterated that he would not make policy concessions.

Republicans, however, did describe the process as a negotiation. The 20 House Republicans — Boehner declined the offer to bring all 232 GOP lawmakers to the White House — gathered in the Roosevelt Room with Obama, Vice President Biden, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and other senior officials.

A similar huddle is slated for late Friday morning when Obama will host Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the Senate Republican Conference. McConnell and Biden have been largely on the sidelines the past few weeks despite having served as the closers for the past three large fiscal compromises.

With the Treasury Department at risk of running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills as soon as next week, the stock market soared Thursday on signs that an end to the impasse may be at hand. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up more than 300 points to close at 15,126.07, recovering most of the value it had lost since the shutdown began Oct. 1. The Nasdaq and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose more than 2 percent.

The House proposal that emerged Thursday would push off the threat of default until Nov. 22, but it would not end the shutdown, an idea that fell flat in the Senate with members of both parties. For the first time since the brinkmanship began in early September, McConnell added into the fray, holding meetings with his rank-and-file members to develop a competing Senate proposal.

The package was being assembled by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who said she is also in talks with Senate Democrats.

“I was surprised that the House decided to deal only with the debt limit and not with the continued closure of government,” Collins said. “I think that we have to deal with both issues, and we need to do so quickly.”

Senate Democrats were intrigued by Collins’s proposal but unhappy with its demand for Democratic concessions. Those would include the repeal of a tax on medical devices that helps fund Obama’s health-care law, the Affordable Care Act, and new

income-verification procedures for people who receive tax subsidies to buy health insurance on the law’s new exchanges.

In addition, Collins’s proposal would maintain deep cuts known as sequestration through at least March, although it would grant agencies greater flexibility to decide where the cuts would fall. Sequestration remains a red flag for the White House and many Democrats, who want to restore funding for domestic programs.

Senior Democrats involved in the talks declined to comment, saying the discussion had reached a sensitive stage.

The Senate, meanwhile, is on track to vote Saturday on a separate Democratic proposal that would suspend enforcement of the debt limit through 2014. It was unclear late Thursday whether that measure would proceed or whether it would be replaced if a deal with Republicans emerged.

Even if such an agreement advanced in the Senate, it could face rough sledding in the House, where a contingent of Republicans remains committed to using the shutdown to undermine the health-care law.

Indeed, Boehner’s offer to temporarily lift the debt limit but keep the government shuttered was engineered in part to satisfy far-right conservatives, who first suggested using the threat of a shutdown to strip funding for the law. Those conservatives have grown anxious in recent days as talk of making this stand singularly about the health law died off among many rank-and-file Republicans.

On Thursday, many creators of that strategy — including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) — voiced support for Boehner’s latest gambit.

“It’s to continue [the] fight on Obamacare, to not leave that as a side issue,” said Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho).

Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group influential with tea party Republicans, said it will not ask lawmakers to vote against raising the debt limit with no strings attached in order to refocus attention on the health-care law. The conservative Club for Growth also announced that it will look the other way on the debt limit vote.

The conservative Madison Project issued a broadside against McConnell, who faces a tough reelection campaign in 2014 and has stayed mainly on the sidelines until now.

“After remaining largely silent when conservatives were fighting Obamacare, Senator Mitch McConnell is, once again, re-emerging from the shadows to sell out conservatives in the eleventh hour,” the project’s Drew Ryun said in a statement.

GOP leaders, meanwhile, appear increasingly eager to extract the party from the health-care fight, which has not only failed to achieve its goals but also has decimated the party’s reputation among voters. According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey released Thursday, 24 percent of voters have a positive view of the GOP — an all-time low in 24 years of polling.

After briefing rank-and-file lawmakers on the details of the latest strategy in a closed-door meeting Thursday, Boehner told reporters that the goal was to offer the president “a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, an agreement to go to conference on the budget, for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government, and to start to deal with America’s pressing problems.”

Asked which problems he hoped to address in that conversation, Boehner did not mention any specific issue, saying only, “I don’t want to put anything on the table, I don’t want to take anything off the table.”

Since the shutdown began, senior Republicans have sought to shift the debate away from the Affordable Care Act and toward goals such as overhauling the tax code and replacing sequestration with cuts to entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicare.

“If you’re in a global negotiation over the entire budget, then [the health-care law] is part of the negotiation. But it’s probably not the only part and may not even be the central part,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.).

The latest House GOP plan calls for suspending the debt limit until Nov. 22, the Friday before Thanksgiving. It would forbid Lew from using “extraordinary measures” to conserve cash, creating a firm deadline when Treasury would be forced to rely solely on incoming revenue to pay bills.

Before holding a vote on that plan, House leaders want Obama to agree to enter budget negotiations. Only then would they talk about reopening the government — and they declined to say what concessions they would demand for funding federal agencies.

Obama has indicated that he could support a short-term debt-limit increase, but he has also demanded that Republicans allow the government to reopen before he would negotiate.

White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Thursday that “the president is happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House, that there at least seems to be a recognition that default is not an option.” However, Carney said, “it would be far better for the economy if we stopped this episodic brinksmanship and . . . mothballed the nuclear weapon here, which is the threat of default, for a longer duration.”

Schultz had been trying for months to rouse the country into thinking hard about why our political system has run aground. “We can’t do this too many more times,” he said, referring to crises like the fiscal cliff. “We are sapping the country’s spirit. Our political system is broken.” He blamed, among other things, the practice of gerrymandering and the big money flowing into campaigns.

He’s right. The incentives to put country over party have vanished. Elected officials who cross party leaders get stripped of their committee assignments — as happened to four Republican legislators this week who were not viewed as “team players.” The combination of gerrymandered districts and a primary system that empowers a small coterie of party hard-liners has meant that representatives and senators who don’t toe the party line get booted out of office. Mickey Edwards, the former congressman from Oklahoma, has written a book, “The Parties Versus The People,” in which he proposes that we move to an open primary system, where all candidates, of every persuasion, run — with the top two finishers facing off in the general election. That would help loosen the grip party extremists now have on their representatives.

Thursday night, after I got home, I had a phone conversation with Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican who first won election in 2010 by campaigning as a modern-day fiscal conservative. That is to say, he believed, as he told me, “that we have a spending problem not a revenue problem.”

But after he got to Congress, he dug deeper, and came to what he calls “a data-driven, analytic conclusion.” Namely: spending cuts alone could not eliminate the deficit. The country needed more tax revenue as well. He showed his data to everyone he could on his side of the aisle. They nodded politely and continued to insist on not raising taxes. Rigell did not revert back, however. “We have to have the courage to critique and refine our own platform,” he said. “That isn’t weakness. It is intellectual honesty.”

I asked him if he had been punished by leadership for his courageous views. “No,” he said.

Give them time, I thought."

Walker, a first-term Republican facing re-election next year, said he would offset the tax cuts and spending increases contained in his 2013-2015 budget by redirecting some funds away from public schools and healthcare, freezing aid to local governments and selling off state assets such as power plants.

Democrats said the proposal would weaken the economic security of the state’s most vulnerable residents.

Walker, who touched off massive protests two years ago when he curbed the collective bargaining rights of public workers, said his proposed income tax cut would save residents $343 million.

“More money in the hands of taxpayers will likely drive greater demand for goods and services, which will likely lead to greater production and eventually more hiring of employees,” he said.

The proposed budget, unveiled in an address to both houses of the Legislature in Madison, included expanded state aid to private schools through voucher programs and the tightening of income eligibility requirements for recipients of publicly funded health programs.

Walker said he also wanted “able-bodied, non-elderly” people receiving food stamps in Wisconsin to be enrolled in mandatory employment training.

“I’m all for providing a temporary hand up,” he told lawmakers. “But … it should not be a permanent handout.

Democrats, who tried unsuccessfully last year to recall Walker, were critical of the proposed budget.

State Senator Kathleen Vinehout, who was a candidate for governor in the Democratic primary ahead of last year’s recall election, said, “Roads and bridges are being paid for by borrowing and raiding money that would otherwise go to schools and universities.

“These are political choices, not the choices voters in Wisconsin would make.”

Walker’s proposed budget will now go to the state Legislature, which is controlled by Walker’s fellow Republicans.

Debate on the measure is expected to continue for months.

But not in North Carolina. The state has taken a very big first step in overhauling its tax code -- enacting its first major reform in 80 years.

The change, signed into law last month, creates a modified flat tax system, with a single income tax rate, an increased standard deduction and fewer tax breaks, as well as the elimination of the personal exemption and a $50,000 deduction for small business owners. It also repeals the state's estate tax.

""It's fairly radical in relation to other states,"" said Kathleen Thies, senior state tax analyst for the tax publisher CCH.

Quiz: How many pages in the U.S. tax code?

The overhaul has been lauded by Republicans, who dominate the state's legislature. They see the changes as a way to attract more business to North Carolina and create jobs.

The big hope: The new economic activity will compensate for the estimated $2.4 billion revenue loss over the next five years as a result of the reforms.

But the overhaul -- which represents a scaled back version of earlier proposals -- has been heavily criticized by many, mostly liberals. They contend its tax cuts will disproportionately benefit the rich and the revenue loss will cut into government services.

Starting in 2014, the individual income tax rate will be 5.8%, and then it will fall to 5.75% in 2015. Those rates are down from the 6%, 7% and 7.75% rates currently in effect.

The standard deduction, meanwhile, will more than double -- to $7,500 for singles, from $3,000; and to $15,000 for married couples filing jointly, from $6,000.

The corporate income tax will also be reduced in 2014 to 6% from 6.9%. It will drop to 5%in 2015. And if revenue growth targets are met, the rate could go as low as 3% thereafter.

Related: States with sweetest corporate tax breaks

For several reasons, North Carolina's reform strays from a pure flat tax system, which would simply apply one tax rate to income and wages, one to business income and a standard deduction for everyone.

Instead, the Tar Heel state's tax overhaul still allows for several tax breaks on top of the standard deduction. Among them: charitable contributions, a child tax credit and a joint deduction for mortgage interest and property taxes.

That combined real estate deduction, however, is capped at $20,000. That could reduce the value of those tax breaks for anyone who's now paying at least a 4% rate on a $400,000 or $500,000 mortgage or for someone who owns multiple properties, according to CPA Rollin Groseclose, who is based in Asheville, N.C.

North Carolina's tax overhaul also strays from a pure flat tax system because individuals still must pay taxes on their investment income, which will continue to be treated as ordinary income.

Lastly, the reform did very little to expand the list of services subject to the state sales tax, noted Groseclose, who is on the board of the North Carolina Association of CPAs.

The independent association, which didn't advocate for any particular proposal, has been calling for a modernized tax code that is less dependent on personal and corporate income taxes, which can be volatile.

The state's biggest opportunity for more revenue would be to apply its sales tax to services, Groseclose said. But the new reforms still leave most of them exempt.

Indeed, he noted, only about 25 or 30 services are subject to tax -- such as dry cleaning. But another 165 to 175 could be -- such as CPA services.

Groseclose sees the new law as a work in progress and expects legislators to continue to make adjustments in the next few years.

It's hard to say yet what lessons North Carolina will hold for lawmakers in Washington as they seek to overhaul the federal tax code.

While the chief tax writers in the House and the Senate may produce tax reform legislation this fall, few expect those proposals to get very far this year or next, a midterm election year.

That's because both parties still can't bridge their most basic differences, such as whether reform should raise more revenue than the current system or not.

But like North Carolina, it's a fair bet if they do get around to passing tax reform, the end product may not be as much of a one-eighty as reformers had hoped."

Labor unions and agricultural industry leaders had been stuck for three weeks on how to legally bring foreign labor into the United States to pick crops and tend livestock at competitive wages. The issue, which is important to California and other farming states, became a major stumbling block in bipartisan efforts to craft a comprehensive immigration bill.

The most two contentious issues were solved, according to officials familiar with the closed-door talks, although they did not release details.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

“We have a wage and cap agreement,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told reporters.

Feinstein is not among the eight senators drafting the overall bill, but she has worked to help design a program to provide legal status to the estimated 500,000 foreign farmworkers in the country.

The eight senators overseeing the bill met Wednesday night and signed off on the outline, leaving staffers to work out final details. Senators were optimistic Thursday that a deal was close.

“All that’s left is the drafting,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).

If passed, the historic bill would expand legal immigration, ramp up border security, tighten sanctions against employers who hire people in the U.S. unlawfully, and open a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants who either entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas.

Border security has been key to the negotiations, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that stopping 90% of those trying to sneak across the border, as the draft bill requires, wouldn’t be difficult to achieve. He said six of the nine sectors on the Arizona border with Mexico already had 90% effective control.

“With technology, it should not be that hard” to seal the rest, McCain said.

Reform efforts got a boost from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is influential with Republican lawmakers. The chamber urged Congress to “take advantage of the unprecedented momentum” and pass an immigration bill this year.

USA TODAY

Most states could exceed federal minimum wage by end of 2014%2C analyst predicts

Low-wage jobs have dominated payroll growth

Opponents say raising minimum wages will mean fewer jobs

The retail-worker strikes that swept the nation in 2013 did not move Congress to raise the minimum wage, but a growing number of states are taking action.

The minimum wage will rise in 13 states this week, and as many as 11 states and Washington, D.C., are expected to consider increases in 2014, according to the National Employment Law Project. Approval is likely in more than half of the 11, says NELP policy analyst Jack Temple.

The trend reflects growing concerns about the disproportionate spread of low-wage jobs in the U.S. economy, creating millions of financially strained workers and putting too little money in consumers' pockets to spur faster economic growth.

On Jan. 1, state minimum wages will be higher than the federal requirement of $7.25 an hour in 21 states, up from 18 two years ago. Temple expects another nine states to drift above the federal minimum by the end of 2014, marking the first time minimum pay in most states will be above the federal level.

""2014 is poised to be a turning point,"" Temple says. ""States are seeing the unemployment rate is going down but job growth is disproportionately concentrated in low-wage industries. (They're) frustrated that Congress is dragging its feet.""

Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island legislatures voted to raise the minimum hourly wage by as much as $1, to $8 to $8.70, by Wednesday. In California, a $1 increase to $9 is scheduled July 1. Smaller automatic increases tied to inflation will take effect in nine other states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

Meanwhile, states such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maryland, Minnesota and South Dakota plan to weigh minimum-wage hikes next year through legislation or ballot initiatives.

In Minnesota, the state House and Senate have each passed bills to raise the minimum wage and plan to iron out their differences early next year after failing to approve similar measures the past two decades.

""You're coming out of a deep recession, and people are landing jobs, but they're low-paid,"" says state Rep. Ryan Winkler, sponsor of the House bill.

The legislative movement has been partly fueled by walkouts this year in at least 100 cities by fast-food workers who are calling for $15-an-hour pay and the right to form unions. Wal-Mart workers have staged similar protests.

While the demonstrations were not explicitly intended to prompt minimum pay increases, they've made the issue ""more urgent,"" Temple says.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 3.6 million hourly paid workers received wages at or below the federal minimum in 2012 — almost 5% of all employees on hourly pay schedules.

President Obama recently said he supports legislation in Congress that would lift the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour in three steps over two years and then index it to inflation. But the measure faces an uphill climb in Congress.

Proponents of minimum-wage hikes note that low-wage jobs have dominated payroll growth in the 4-year-old recovery, and increases over the past four decades have not kept pace with inflation.

Opponents say the increases raise employer expenses and will lead to layoffs. ""If your costs are going up and you can't raise prices, you have to find a way to produce the same product at a lower cost,"" says Michael Saltsman, a research fellow at the Employment Policies Institute.

Where minimum wage is going up

On Jan. 1, the minimum wage in 13 states will increase to these amounts.

State New minimum wage Arizona $7.90 Colorado $8.00 Connecticut $8.70 Florida $7.93 Missouri $7.50 Montana $7.90 New Jersey $8.25 New York $8.00 Ohio $7.95 Oregon $9.10 Rhode Island $8.00 Vermont $8.73 Washington $9.32

While investors are entitled to answers about those conflicts, compensation and reforms, Attorney General Holder and President Obama, by singling out S&P, instead of other bond raters, appear to be engaging in political vengeance and put freedom of speech at risk.

In 2011, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch were accused by a Senate Committee of giving overly rosy ratings on mortgage backed securities in the years prior to the financial meltdown of 2008, and then contributing to the severity of the crisis by hastily downgrading hundreds of securities after the housing bubble burst.

Notably, S&P, alone, in August of 2011 downgraded U.S. government bonds—causing the president considerable embarrassment at a time when his reelection was far from certain. And, this downgrade will raise U.S. borrowing costs, and ultimately curtail federal spending and the president’s progressive agenda, when the Federal Reserve deems appropriate to end quantitative easing, which is artificially depressing all interest rates.

[pullquote]

Often, federal prosecutors, when several firms have engaged in unsuitable practices, will single out one to obtain damages and reforms, and then use that settlement to obtain concessions from the others; however, the selection of S&P certainly creates the appearance of sovereign and political abuse.

By any reasonable measure, U.S. debt and spending has reached an unsustainable level. Simply, the tax increases necessary to bring the federal deficit down to a level that would stabilize the national debt as a percentage of GDP, would certainly cause a deep recession, similar to conditions in Italy or Spain, and not yield the anticipated revenues. Hence, spending, in particular entitlement spending, must be cut; however, the president has neither admitted this situation nor shown any inclination toward real entitlement reform.

By not downgrading U.S. debt, Moody’s and Fitch, have demonstrated the same neglect to investors that all three bond rating agencies practiced during the mid-2000s—now, the Justice Department lets them pass by targeting S&P.

At the heart of the matter is the bond rating agencies business practice of charging fees to the firms, state and local governments who issue bonds, and financial houses that create derivatives. The resulting conflict of interest encourages overly rosy ratings that lag market assessments of company and government financial health.

The rating agencies have refused to return to change this business model—they find the present too lucrative to put their public responsibility above profits—and this requires a legislative solution.

The bond rating agencies have clung to a First Amendment defense, but that has terrible public policy foundations. No individual may rely on free speech to knowingly deceive another for the purpose of financial gain—that is the textbook definition of fraud—and no reasonable assessment of the public or investor interests can justify that defense.

Yet, by singling out S&P—the firm that downgraded U.S. government debt—the Attorney General and president has failed to acknowledge their own conflict of interest and create the appearance of retribution.

In other areas, for example broadcast news coverage, the administration has been quick to use its leverage to send messages to organizations it believes demonstrate a conservative bias, but has kept its hands off those demonstrating liberal bias.

By suing S&P, and not Moody’s and Fitch, the Attorney General and president have failed to exhibit the sovereign restraint necessary to sustain the open and fair criticism of the government to sustain American democracy, and place constitutional protections at grave danger."

The federal minimum wage is %247.25 %28less for some seasonal workers%29

California is set to raise its minimum wage to %2410%2C the highest in the nation

Advocates want a national %2415/hour minimum wage

California's recent decision to raise its minimum wage to $10 an hour by 2016 — a higher minimum rate than any other state has now — may add momentum to the drive for higher hourly rates in at least eight other states in 2014.

New Jersey could become the fifth state this year to increase its state minimum wage if voters approve a measure on Nov. 5 that would boost the hourly rate by $1, to $8.25.

In states as varied as Alaska, Idaho, Massachusetts and South Dakota, advocates are pushing to put minimum wage hikes on state ballots in 2014. Meanwhile, elected officials are leading the charge in Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, and the District of Columbia.

The action at the state level comes as organized labor and liberal groups have backed a wave of strikes by fast-food workers in cities across the country to put a spotlight on hourly wages. Advocates are pressing for a national $15 hourly wage, more than twice the $7.25 federal minimum wage.

States cannot set a minimum wage that is lower than the federal standard, but they are free to establish a higher one. Washington state currently has the highest state minimum wage at $9.19; followed by Oregon ($8.95) and Vermont ($8.60). Connecticut, the District of Columbia and Illinois all have a state minimum of $8.25. In addition, some 120 cities have enacted ""living wages"" that set a minimum standard for businesses that receive city contracts. City minimums range from $9 to $16 an hour.

Under California's plan, the state minimum wage would rise from $8 an hour to $9 an hour on July 1, 2014, and then jump again to $10 an hour on Jan. 1, 2016. Less than 2 percent of California workers who receive an hourly wage make the federal minimum of $7.25 or less (some seasonal employees and other workers are can be paid less than the minimum wage). The state with the highest proportion of minimum wage workers is Idaho, with nearly 8 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau

of Labor Statistics.

Will $10 be model for other states?

California's passage of a $10 minimum wage ""will set the bar for what other states will aim for,"" said Paul Sonn, legal co-director of the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an organization that spearheads a Raise the Minimum Wage campaign.



Momentum at the state level is increasing as efforts to increase the federal hourly wage have gone nowhere. Congress last raised the minimum wage in 2007. Democrats in Congress have called for raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour by 2015, higher than President Barack Obama's call for a $9 hourly wage, but it's unlikely the GOP-controlled House will approve it.

""Once again, California is leading the effort to rebuild our middle class,"" California Assemblyman Luis Alejo, a Democrat, said after the Assembly approved his bill to increase the minimum wage.

Raising the minimum wage is a politically polarizing issue. President Obama and other proponents of a higher federal minimum wage say that while companies are making record profits, the lowest-paid workers have seen their purchasing power plummet because the federal wage floor hasn't kept pace with inflation. If it had, the hourly rate would be $10.74. They say raising the minimum wage will give the economy a boost by putting more money into the pockets of people who are likely to spend it.

But opponents, including Republican House Speaker John Boehner and many business groups, argue that employers won't be able to afford the higher hourly wage and will have to lay off workers. Most businesses that hire minimum wage workers are not big corporations, they say, but rather independently-owned franchises and small businesses that operate on narrow profit margins.

""Many entrepreneurs in our state are just now starting to see signs of recovery by hiring and expanding their businesses, and this bill will cause many to halt those plans immediately,"" said John Kabateck, executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business/California. The group estimated that raising the state minimum wage to $9.25 would lead to the loss of 68,000 California jobs over a 10-year period.

Popular at ballot box

Minimum wage hikes have been popular with voters: Since 1998, proposed increases have been on statewide ballots 10 times in nine states, and all of them were successful. That's one of the reasons Democrats are expected to keep the issue alive for the 2014 midterm elections, when 36 governorships and legislative seats in 46 statehouses will be contested along with U.S. congressional races.

""From an electoral perspective, Democrats want the minimum wage to hang around for a while,"" said Mike Saltsman, a research director at the Employment Policies Institute, a conservative nonprofit think tank. Saltsman has written op-eds to dispute what his group calls myths about the minimum wage, including that higher wages will reduce poverty and stimulate the economy.

The group also recently ran full-page newspapers ads during the fast food strike, warning that higher wages could prompt more automation. ""Why Robots Could Soon Replace Fast Food Workers Demanding a Higher Minimum Wage,"" the headline in an ad in the Wall Street Journal said. The full-page ad in USA Today showed a touch-screen device replacing a worker.

Saltsman said that protestors' call for a $15 hourly rate is ""a bargaining tactic"" so that a $10 hourly rate will seem reasonable to voters and policymakers. But increasing the rate from $7.25 to $10 is still a 40 percent bump, he said.

While the institute and national employer groups, like the National Restaurant Association, have been outspoken opponents of a minimum wage hike, some businesses, large and small, have come out in support of higher hourly rates, arguing if workers earn more, they can spend more, namely on their products.

Top officials at Costco and Starbucks both have called for a higher minimum wage. Meanwhile, a poll earlier this spring showed nearly 70 percent of small business owners support raising the minimum wage as a way to help the economy.

Northeast Sees Most 2013 Action

Nearly a dozen states this year considered setting a state minimum wage above the federal rate, but besides California, only three did so:

• New York raised its minimum hourly rate to $9 from $7.25. The rate will rise to $8 by the end of 2013, $8.75 by the end of 2014, and $9 by the end of 2015.

• Connecticut's minimum wage will go to $9 an hour from $8.25, starting with a bump to $8.70 Jan. 1, followed by a second increase on Jan. 1, 2015.

• Rhode Island increased its minimum hourly rate to $8 per hour, from $7.75, beginning Jan. 1.

When these laws take effect, 20 states and the District of Columbia will have hourly rates that are higher than the federal minimum.

State lawmakers in New Jersey approved raising the minimum wage to $8.50, but the increase was vetoed by Republican Gov. Chris Christie and then put on this November's ballot for voters to consider. Christie said he supported a higher wage, but opposed including automatic annual adjustments for inflation, known as ""indexing.""

Ten other states already use indexing: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. In all of them except Vermont, voters approved the measure with the automatic hike.

Christie's Democratic challenger Barbara Buono has criticized him for vetoing the minimum wage increase. ""For a working parent making $7.25 an hour, life isn't about living. It's about surviving,"" Buono, a state senator from Middlesex County, said as part of her economic plan.

New Jersey is one of two states this November that will elect a governor and state lawmakers (Virginia is the other) and the only one with a statewide minimum wage question.

The White House kicked off ""sequester week"" by putting Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood on Sunday shows to again warn that automatic budget cuts will lead to long lines at airports.

LaHood told CNN's State of the Union that the cuts set to take effect Friday will force the government to furlough many air-traffic controllers, leading to delays of flights and backing up thousands of passengers.

Air-traffic control is ""a big part of our budget,"" said LaHood, who delivered the same kind of message Friday to reporters in the White House briefing room.

On NBC's Meet The Press, LaHood said the Federal Aviation Administration will not compromise safety, but ""we will have to work with the airlines to slow planes down.""

LaHood is a Republican and a former U.S. House member from Illinois. He urged his former congressional colleagues to look for a way to avoid the sequester, telling NBC ""this does not have to happen.""

The $85 billion in automatic budget cuts, known as the sequester, are set to take effect March 1 -- Friday -- unless Obama and congressional Republicans reach a new debt reduction deal.

Expect the White House to spend every day before Friday talking about the impact of cuts that affect defense and domestic programs.

President Obama has proposed avoiding the sequester with a new debt reduction agreement that includes higher taxes on the wealthy as well as budget cuts; the new revenues would come by closing loopholes and ending certain deductions.

Congressional Republicans say Obama got higher tax rates to avoid the last budget standoff -- ""the fiscal cliff"" -- and this deal should focus on reduced spending.

Some Republicans are also accusing the administration of exaggerating the impact of cuts to put political pressure on the GOP; Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said last week that ""the president is making stuff up."""

Nearly half of the recipients who get federal science funding say they've recently laid off or will lay off scientists and researchers, because federal grants are tougher to win, according to a survey by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and 15 other scientific societies.

At Arkansas State University, 30 scientists and researchers have lost or will lose jobs by October from federal budget cuts at the defense and education departments that funded research detecting bombs and nerve agents.

These are just some of the cuts underway thanks to $85 billion in forced spending cuts, called sequester, that kicked in March 1. And as more research grants don't get renewed, the layoffs will get worse, experts say.

""My post-doctoral student is facing losing a job in coming months if no new NIH funding comes in,"" said Professor Yuntao Wu at George Mason University's National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases and the Department of Molecular and Microbiology.

Wu has already laid off one technician at his lab, which works with a compound derived from soybeans to treat HIV. ""We are facing closing the whole lab. That takes many years to build,"" he added.

Some 1,444 of 3,165 scientists reported layoffs are imminent or have taken place at their laboratories, because they couldn't renew federal grants.

About 54% of scientists reported that they know a colleague who has lost a job, according to the survey. The questionnaires went out in June and July.

The layoffs were first signaled months ago by Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. He warned earlier this year that the sequester would eventually cost 20,000 research and technician jobs.

The NIH has lost $1.6 billion from its $31 billion budget in its fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, on top of tighter budgets in 2012 and 2011. The NIH is the largest supporter of biomedical research in the United States, and cuts have led to hundreds of research projects not getting funding.

The National Science Foundation also has said 1,000 fewer grants would be awarded this year, compared to last year. NSF funds research and education in non-medical science and engineering.

The Department of Defense has also cut research funding in its quest to trim $40 billion from its budget by Sept. 30.

Scientists and lobbying groups say the funding climate endangers a generation of future scientists and breakthroughs.

""The data shows that deep cuts to federal investments in research are tearing at the fabric of the nation's scientific enterprise and have a minimal impact on overcoming our national debt and deficit problems,"" said Benjamin Corb, spokesman for the biochemistry group."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/federal-minimum-wage_n_3641162.html,2013-07-24 00:00:00,['Labor Reporter'],Federal Minimum Wage Goes 4 Years Without Budging,"WASHINGTON -- Workers toiling in low-wage jobs marked a dispiriting anniversary on Wednesday: It's now been four years since the last time the federal minimum wage was raised.

The minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour, and it prevails in the 30 states that don't already mandate a higher one. The last time it saw a boost was on July 24, 2009, when it was raised from $6.55. That 70-cent raise marked the last in a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush.

Since then, the legal wage floor has held steady, even as the cost of living has continued to rise. A full-time worker earning the minimum wage now pulls in a salary of about $15,000 per year, far below a living wage in most parts of the country.

President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats have proposed raising the minimum wage and pegging it to inflation, though House Republicans are unlikely to go along with such a hike any time soon. Bills to raise the minimum wage, introduced in the House and Senate earlier this year, have not been voted on by their respective committees. Republican leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), have deemed a minimum-wage raise a job killer. (House Republicans have already voted down a version of the minimum wage raise that was inserted as an amendment to a workforce training bill.)

Labor groups supporting a minimum wage boost planned demonstrations in an estimated 30 cities across the country on Wednesday, calling the four-year lapse reason alone for a raise. According to organizers, the protests would target low-wage employers who've seen employee strikes in recent months, including Walmart and McDonald's. A group of companies that back the Democratic proposal, called Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, launched a petition Wednesday for businesses to pledge their support for a raise.

Over the decades, the minimum wage has gone for spells longer than four years before seeing a raise, according to the Labor Department. The wage floor remained stagnant for a full 10 years leading up to the first increase late in Bush's tenure, in 2007. And during the early 1990s, the minimum wage stood at $4.25 for more than five years before being raised under President Bill Clinton.

But if Congress doesn't send Obama legislation to sign by the end of his second term, he will be the first president since Ronald Reagan who didn't raise the minimum wage at all.

Back on the campaign trail in 2008, Obama stumped for hiking the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011 and pegging it to inflation in perpetuity. That raise never came, however, and the president proposed a more modest boost to $9.00 during his State of the Union address earlier this year. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) soon rolled out their own, more ambitious proposal, which by 2015 would raise the minimum wage to $10.10, closer to its historical high in the late 1960s.

The proposals by both the president and congressional Democrats include one pivotal measure -- the tying of the minimum wage to an inflation index. Ten states have already undertaken this change, choosing to automatically reset the minimum wage each year rather than wrangle politically over a new raise every few years. If Congress adopted an inflation index, the purchasing power of the minimum wage wouldn't erode as it has for the past four years.

According to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, Americans broadly support the idea of raising the minimum wage and pegging it to inflation, with 62 percent of Americans saying it should be boosted to $9. Obama's proposal was supported by a huge majority of Democrats in the poll (86 percent to 6 percent) and a majority of independents (56 percent to 28 percent). Fifty-two percent of Republicans, however, opposed the proposal, compared to 36 percent who supported it."

President Obama%2C congressional leaders fail to reach sequester deal

The sequester%2C %2485 billion in automatic budget cuts%2C begins late Friday

Obama%2C Republicans argue over taxes in new debt cut deal

WASHINGTON -- Leaping into the fiscal unknown, President Obama and congressional Republicans did not strike a deal Friday to avert $85 billion in automatic, across-the-board budget cuts set to begin at midnight.

""These cuts will hurt our economy; they will cost us jobs,"" Obama told reporters after meeting 52 minutes with congressional leaders on the impact of the massive cuts known as the sequester.

The White House, working with its Office of Management and Budget, began the process Friday night of formally notifying Congress and others of specific items to be cut over the next seven months. Letters are also going to out to governors, grantees and others who receive federal money.



At a brief news conference after the morning meeting, Obama attributed the ""dumb, arbitrary cuts"" to a Republican refusal to agree to a new debt reduction plan that includes higher taxes on wealthy Americans through the closing of loopholes and deductions.

""They're saying that it's more important to preserve these tax loopholes than it is to prevent these arbitrary cuts,"" Obama said of the GOP.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said after the meeting that Obama got tax hikes in the January agreement to end the last budget impasse, the so-called fiscal cliff.

""The discussion about revenue in my view is over,"" Boehner said. ""It's about cutting the spending in Washington.""

The parties did appear to make progress on avoiding another potential budget standoff down the road -- the March 27 expiration of the continuing resolution that is funding the government; failing to renew it would lead to a budget shutdown.

In a post-meeting statement, Boehner said Congress is planning to extend the continuing resolution ""to prevent a government shutdown while we continue to work on a solution to replace the president's sequester.""

The president also sounded upbeat about avoiding a shutdown, saying he would sign an extension provided Congress sticks to budget targets it has used in the past.

As for the sequester, Obama said debt reduction should include both spending cuts and higher taxes in the wealthy, calling it a ""balanced plan"" that can end the cuts that will slow the economy, cost people jobs and possibly undermine national defense.

While the sequester will hurt the economy, Obama predicted that the American people will come through it and sustain economic recovery, even though ""Washington sure isn't making it easy."" The president also urged affected Americans to pressure Republicans into reaching an agreement to end a sequester, asking them to appeal to ""a caucus of common sense"" in Congress.

""This is not going to be an apocalypse, I think, as some people have said,"" Obama said at one point. "" It's just dumb. And it's going to hurt.""

Some Republicans said Obama and the White House are exaggerating the impact of the cuts for political effect. Sen.Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said, ""D oes any lawmaker, reporter or citizen believe that the only way to save taxpayer dollars is to hurt children, that every government program is effective and helpful and not one penny is wasted?""

The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, described the White House meeting Friday morning as ""an opportunity to restate our commitment to the American people that we would significantly reduce Washington spending.""

While pledging to try and avoid a government shutdown at the end of March, McConnell said Republicans would work on ""solutions for making spending reductions more intelligently than the president's across-the-board cuts.""

He added: ""I will not be part of any back-room deal and I will absolutely not agree to increase taxes.""

Both McConnell and Boehner attended the Oval Office meeting with Obama and Vice President Biden. So did the top congressional Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

The talks reflected little if any progress on the issue that has divided them in this and previous budget disputes -- the best way to cut a federal debt that now tops $16.5 trillion.

Obama has long called for debt reduction that includes both budget cuts and increased tax revenue by eliminating loopholes and deductions that benefit the wealthy.

Boehner said Obama and Senate Democrats ""are demanding more tax hikes to fuel more stimulus spending.""

The White House meeting took place a day after Senate Republicans and Democrats blocked each other's competing sequester plans.

The sequester originated as part of a 2011 agreement to break yet another Obama-Republican budget impasse, raising the debt ceiling.

The idea: Require a series of automatic cuts, split between defense and domestic programs, so onerous that the parties would be forced to come up with a plan to cut more than $1 trillion off the debt in 10 years. They failed to do that.

How the sequester might play out after Friday, both economically and politically, remains uncertain.

Obama said many Americans may not feel the effects for months, but others face problems ranging from job furloughs to a loss of Head Start services for their children.

Predicting ""a slow grind that will intensify with each passing day,"" Obama said the effects will be felt throughout the government, including the Pentagon, Border Patrol, FBI and social service agencies.

""I don't anticipate a huge financial crisis,"" Obama said, ""but people are going to be hurt.""

So will Washington's reputation, he added.

""You know, this is not a win for anybody,"" Obama said. ""This is a loss for the American people."""

Fahrenthold Is A Reporter Covering The Trump Family', 'Its Business Interests. He Has Been At The Washington Post Since']",How McConnell and Biden pulled Congress away from the fiscal cliff,"With just 35 hours left, there was a phone message for Vice President Biden.

About an hour later, after talking to President Obama, Biden called back. He heard a familiar drawl: “Does anyone down there know how to make a deal?” Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate’s top Republican, wanted to know.

That phone call — the first of at least 13 between the two longtime statesmen — set in motion what became the ugly, unsatisfying last-minute conclusion of the “fiscal cliff” crisis.

It also ended a self-inflicted, nationally televised psychological experiment on Congress.

Two summers ago, politicians tried to concoct a deadline so terrible that even they — mistrustful, divided, weakly led — would be scared into doing something big to solve the nation’s tax-and-spending problems.

View Graphic The impact of tax increases on taxpayers

They misjudged themselves.

In the months leading up to the cliff, and especially in the grueling final two weeks, their mega-deadline only produced more division, not cooperation. There were the usual feuds between the parties, followed by a round of new and bitter battles within them.

An in-depth look at the final four tense days shows that McConnell and Biden resolved the crisis through old-fashioned backroom bargaining. With each call and each new offer, they pared away a little more of the grand ambitions each side had once held so dear, until all that was left was a modest measure that raised some new tax revenue and left most of the deficit problem intact.

Left largely to the sidelines was almost everyone else in Washington — the president, the speaker of the House, the majority leader of the Senate and hundreds of rank-and-file lawmakers anxiously wondering what they might be asked to vote for and how much each of their leaders was giving away.

Congress’s experiment became a parable about the dangers of the way Washington works now — careering from deadline to deadline, panic to panic, no one really happy in the end.

And it concluded in typical fashion — lawmakers set themselves up for another deadline and another panic, this one just two months away.

On Friday, four days before the year-end deadline, President Obama and the congressional leaders from each party gathered in the Oval Office. It was not a happy group.

The Democrats were wary. Two weeks earlier, Obama stunned them by offering to give ground on long-held Democratic positions. The president offered to apply a less generous measure of inflation to Social Security benefits, which would save money by reducing their rate of growth. Obama also backed off a demand that he had championed for five years that George W. Bush-era tax cuts be allowed to expire for people making more than $250,000 per year.

Instead, Obama gave a higher, more Republican-friendly number: $400,000.

“In the blink of an eye, they crossed the Rubicon,” said a Senate Democratic aide.

But, there in the Oval Office, the top Republican in the room was in an even worse mood.

Before the meeting even began, House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio had offered a vulgar insult to Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.).

Boehner’s anger began with a recent, debilitating defeat in his own chamber, when he asked fellow Republicans to cast a vote supporting one of his bargaining positions. They declined, somewhat spectacularly, leaving Boehner to declare that he had done all he could do. It was up to the Senate to avert the cliff.

Reid decided to pile on, calling Boehner a “dictator” on the Senate floor — a so-wrong-it’s-funny insult that provoked snickers in the Capitol.

So when Boehner saw Reid at the White House, the normally amiable speaker was steaming.

“Go f--- yourself,” he said, pointing a finger at Reid, according to both Democratic and Republican aides who were there.

“Excuse me?” Reid responded.

Boehner repeated himself. Reid just stared.

The meeting went ahead. Democrats talked tax rates and trade-offs with McConnell. But Boehner refused to engage, sitting stone-faced on a deep couch.

Reid pestered him with questions. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tried to play good cop.

“John,” she said, “Are you going to try to be a little bit constructive?”

Boehner would not.

“The House has acted,” he said. “It’s up to the Senate.”

On Saturday, McConnell and his staff hunkered down in the senator’s office. Reid did not come in, but his staff got to work in his office.

Only 60 steps separated them, but they were hundreds of thousands of dollars apart on the threshold for raising income tax rates.

McConnell made an offer: The Bush-era tax hikes could expire for people making more than $500,000, or couples making more than $750,000.

Democrats countered with a lower number. On it went, and the numbers got closer together. Republicans went down as far as $450,000 for individuals, $550,000 for couples.

That’s when the bargaining stopped.

Saturday turned to Sunday, and Republicans had still not heard a response to their last offer. Nothing at 11. Nothing at 12. McConnell decided something was wrong. “We couldn’t get the majority leader to counter,” the GOP leader said later. There were now less than 36 hours until the deadline. “The clock was ticking and we were not moving.”

They weren’t moving because Democrats had decided that they had gone as far as they could. Reid and Obama had disagreed privately about what their next offer should be. At one point, Reid was unhappy with an idea that Senate aides said came from Obama — to put the change in Social Security benefits back on the table in exchange for a delay in spending cuts and a rise in the debt limit.

Aides said Reid actually tore up the proposal and threw it into the blazing fire in his ornate green marble fireplace. The paper burned. Reid said he didn’t want evidence that the idea had ever been considered.

Administration officials, for their part, deny that Obama ever considered including the Social Security change in the deal.

Finally, an aide to Reid called an aide to McConnell to make it explicit. There would be no new offer. Take it or leave it.

“It felt like they had chosen the cliff,” a Republican aide said.

McConnell, frustrated, asked an aide to call Biden. The two of them had brokered the deal that set up this mess, during the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011. Now, they would broker the deal that ended it.

When Biden called back, aides in McConnell’s office listening to his side of the conversation could tell that Biden was interested. In fact, Biden had already walked from his office to Obama’s. He got the go-ahead to negotiate.

“Why don’t you get up to speed on this and call me back,” McConnell said, according to the notes of someone in the room.

Deadline day. Over the course of 13 phone calls between Biden and McConnell, and others between lower-level staffers, the deal was getting done.

As the two men talked, they began to kill off the grandest ambitions that both parties had brought into the fiscal-cliff debate. Obama, for instance, had said since 2007 that taxes should go up on people making more than $250,000.

That was gone, now. Biden and McConnell agreed on $400,000, and $450,000 for couples filing jointly.

The men talked about two other key demands the White House had made. One was that the huge budget cuts called the “sequester” would be delayed to avoid hurting the fledgling economic recovery. Obama had also insisted that any cliff deal raise the national debt ceiling. He did not want a repeat of the crisis that nearly pitched the country into default in the summer of 2011.

Gone, and gone. When Reid got news Monday morning that the terms called for a delay of mere months for the sequester, he called the president. What are you going to do in two months, Reid asked Obama, when the sequester is about kick in along with a new deadline on the federal debt limit?

Reid worried that Republicans would demand trillions of dollars in new spending cuts.

I’m not going to negotiate with them, Obama replied. Reid felt it wouldn’t be so easy.

“Mr. President,” he said, according to aides, “We’re setting ourselves up.”



Republican goals, too, were sacrificed. A party that defined itself by its opposition to taxes would now be asked to raise them. Their ambition to save money by changing Social Security benefits was also cut.

The last piece of the puzzle: How, exactly, should they delay the sequester? The cost of paying for it would be $12 billion a month.

They settled on a two-month delay. “If we can’t find $24 billion here to cut, we ought to find another line of work,” McConnell told Biden in one call.

In the end, they made their small deal and then set out to sell it.

McConnell made his pitch to Senate Republicans about 5 p.m. “You could argue persuasively, that — in a government controlled two-thirds by the Democrats — we got permanency for 99 percent of the Bush tax cuts,” McConnell said.

Most of his colleagues were joyous. “Deal, deal, deal,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) chanted to reporters as he exited the room.

Biden made his pitch around 9 p.m. By then, Reid was on board. As he introduced Biden, he told Democrats that he didn’t want anyone to try to block a vote on procedural grounds.

If you don’t like the package, Reid said, you can vote no.

The scaled-down bill passed in the Senate, with just three Democrats and five Republicans voting no.

After a day of hemming and hawing, the House followed suit Tuesday night. The final count was 257 to 167, with most of the support coming from Democrats.

Boehner voted yes. But two of his top deputies, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), voted no.

In the end, it seemed, the lawmakers who had set up this grand experiment had not lost faith in themselves. Instead, they seemed to believe the answer was to hold another experiment, not three months away. Already, politicians from both sides were promising that the next deadline would produce the victories that this one did not.

Obama promised that he would not negotiate over the debt ceiling: “We can’t go down that path again,” he said in a televised address.

Some Republicans seemed certain that they could make him do just that. “Our opportunity here is on the debt ceiling. The president’s made it very clear – he doesn’t even want to have a discussion about it, because he knows this is where we have leverage,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “We Republicans need to be willing to tolerate a temporary partial government shutdown, which is what that could mean.”

President Barack Obama is doing it, by parting with 5 percent of his salary, for the time being.

So, is this ""moving the needle"" and helping to bring both sides ""back to the table""? I'll let the Republican National Committee answer that question for me:

Does @BarackObama actually think giving $20,000 of his salary back to the Treasury will solve anything? #gop — GOP (@GOP) April 5, 2013

I tell you, what a shock.

Look, this salary-reduction strategy is just a stupid idea, all around. And it would be a stupid idea if Obama just gave back his entire salary. Which, by the way, he could do. It's not like he needs the money. In fact, the chances that the United States of America will ever elect a president who authentically needs a salary of any kind is approximately ""the null set"" for the foreseeable future.

And as Alex Pareene points out, the decision to part with a small portion of a salary really doesn't make any sense from a political standpoint: ""If you are trying to convince Republicans to reverse savage government spending cuts that they have all decided that they are fine with, and you are also someone Republicans hate, cutting your own salary seems like an odd negotiating strategy,"" Pareene writes.

Nevertheless, we know the impetus for this salary-giveback comes from being shouted at for months and months and months by Beltway Centrist Hacks, who honestly and authentically believe that Obama needs to make more magical gestures to secure a ""Grand Bargain.""

These pundits want the GOP to give on revenues, and they're even willing to admit that Republicans are being intransigent, but they believe that this is Obama's problem to solve, and that he must solve it with a series of powerful displays of sentimental force. Obama is trying to bridge the gap by offering up substantial cuts to earned benefit programs that would impoverish elderly Americans. Impoverishing elderly Americans is also something that the Centrist Hack set desires, rather badly, but they know that this is a deal Obama would rather not have to make. And that's a huge problem for them -- Obama should want to bargain away Medicare and Social Security, with a smile on his face and a song in his heart. And until he does that, he is not showing ""leadership.""

Naturally, I do not expect even this group of pundit nimrods to look with favor upon Obama's slight gesture of returning 5 percent of his salary. We can all agree that it is woefully insufficient as a means to move legislation of any kind. But it's better in one sense than anything else the ""Leadership Surrealists"" have come up with: actual money ends up in the U.S. Treasury.

Looks like we are back to having a series of really awesome steak dinners to secure a ""Grand Bargain"" that will likely screw most Americans in the short pants, I guess!

The two-year budget agreement, which cleared a key test vote earlier in the day, was expected to get a final vote no later than Wednesday.

Ahead of the final vote, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tried unsuccessfully to use a parliamentary tactic to force a vote on the amendment, which he wrote to undo the cuts for military retirees.

A provision in the already House-passed bill would cut retirement benefits for military retirees by $6 billion over 10 years.

Sessions wanted to instead eliminate an estimated $4.2 billion in annual spending by reining in an IRS credit that illegal immigrants have claimed.

He and fellow senators argued the bill unfairly sticks veterans and other military retirees with the cost of new spending.

“It’s not correct, and it should not happen,” Sessions said on the floor.

""By blocking my amendment, they voted to cut pensions for wounded warriors,"" he said afterwards. ""Senators in this chamber have many valid ideas for replacing these pension cuts, including my proposal to close the tax welfare loophole for illegal filers, and all deserved a fair and open hearing. But they were denied.”

Sessions’ office claimed the vote Tuesday to block the amendment was a vote to ""cut military pensions instead of cutting welfare for illegal immigrants.""

Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Wash.,who brokered the budget deal with House counterpart Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., argued the GOP effort was really an attempt to kill the entire bill.

[audio-clip]

The Republican-led House passed the bill last week in an effort to avoid another stalemate leading to a potential government shutdown, like the one in October that polls showed was largely unpopular with voters.

The two-year budget deal would ease for two years some of the harshest cuts to agency budgets required under automatic spending curbs commonly known as sequestration. It would replace $45 billion in scheduled cuts for the 2014 budget year already underway, easing about half of the scheduled cuts.

In rural Ohio, co-workers at a factory have become encamped into groups over divided views toward Obama and the country.

In rural Ohio, co-workers at a factory have become encamped into groups over divided views toward Obama and the country.

In rural Ohio, co-workers at a factory have become encamped into groups over divided views toward Obama and the country.

On the same day, in the same county of northern Ohio, two new grandparents prepared to drive to the same factory for work. They had started their careers at Arm & Hammer the same year, and for more than two decades, they had stood together on a concrete floor and watched baking soda roll down an 80-foot production line. But, on this morning, what they saw looked nothing alike.

Bill Herr, 61, left a house that had declined in value by 20 percent, in a neighborhood blemished by foreclosures, in a town where he believed the economy for the middle class was “falling apart.” He said goodbye to a wife who was recovering from open-heart surgery, which she blamed in small part on the stress and disappointment of the presidential election. He grabbed a coat purchased for $6 at Goodwill and walked out a front door where he had recently hung a sign created by a local Christian motorcycle group: “AMERICA NEEDS GOD’S HELP! PRAYER OUR ONLY HOPE.”

Cathy Morris, 53, left a home she had bought with the help of a middle-class tax break and then drove by the mailbox where she sent regular $25 checks to President Obama. She passed through a town that she believed was “almost back” and pulled into an Arm & Hammer factory where orders had increased by 5 percent and management was once again hiring. “Obama,” she said. “Thank goodness.”

This is the America that Obama will govern in his second term: A place divided not only by ideology, race and class but also by the very perception of reality. Four years since Obama first took office, is the country better or worse off? Safer or more at risk? Principled or desperately lost?

Here in Fremont, as in much of America, it all depends on whom you ask. In this rural, Rust Belt county where Obama won exactly 50 percent of the vote, located in a state where he won 50 percent, residents expect Obama to either ruin the country or rescue it. The president who spoke ambitiously at his first inauguration about uniting America instead arrives at his second with the country further divided. Fourteen percent of Republicans think he’s doing a good job, compared with 88 percent of Democrats. The goal is no longer to effect sweeping conciliation so much as to find fractional compromise in a diminishing common ground.

Inside an Arm & Hammer factory that billows smoke across the farmlands of Ohio, 180 employees now self-segregate into what Morris calls “ideological islands.” Co-workers who were once moderate Democrats or Republicans shifted fully to their sides over the past four years, intensifying the disconnect.

There are free copies of a National Rifle Association monthly magazine in one break room and, as of late last year, a life-size cardboard cutout of Obama in the other. There are workers who share copies of Obama’s biography, “Dreams From My Father,” and others who distribute the movie-version parody, “Dreams From My Real Father: A Story of Reds and Deception.”

And then there are Morris and Herr, two longtime employees working side by side, each anticipating Obama’s second inauguration as a seminal moment.

For one, it is confirmation that life has gotten better.

For the other, it is proof that life has gotten worse.

‘Obama’s America’

Bill and Sally Herr built their farmhouse on the outskirts of Fremont in the months after Sept. 11, 2001, and they agreed to decorate it in homage to the country they served and loved. They placed two American flags on the lawn, five flag magnets on the fridge, a flag-themed coloring book in the grandkids’ room and a flag throw blanket on the living room couch. They framed another flag just inside the entryway, displaying it under three words that summarized their philosophy: “God Bless America.”

But lately, when they talked about the state of the country, the phrase Bill preferred was something different, something much less reassuring.

“Obama’s America,” he said.

Obama’s America: It was the wood pellets burning downstairs in their latest attempt to lower the energy bill; the constant threats of downsizing at the print shop where Sally has worked for 30 years; the 25 percent drop in tithing at their church; the date nights paid for with gift certificates to Arby’s or Casa Fiesta; the 37-year-old son with a doctorate who had been forced to move back in with them for six months after losing his job as a counselor in Toledo.

What bothered Bill most of all was the way he thought Obama had slighted the military, removing troops from combat zones too quickly and once disregarding Iraq as a “stupid war.” Stupid or not, Bill had been there to fight it when the Army sent orders to a 52-year-old whose military experience consisted mostly of humanitarian missions in South America with the Army Reserve. This time, the orders were to deploy on five days notice for a 12-month tour with a unit out of Chicago. So off he had gone into the desert with men less than half his age, once unloading 190 rounds in a single firefight, ducking behind a tank as his chin strap filled with sweat. “So that was stupid?” he wondered.

Bill and Sally were lifelong Republicans who had been wary of Obama from the start, but it was the frustrations of the past four years that had welcomed Fox News as a constant presence into their living room and tea party members to their annual backyard Fourth of July bash. They wanted friends with whom to share their frustrations. Now they forwarded along e-mails from those new friends suggesting murky details in Obama’s family history and traveled to Glenn Beck rallies across the state.

They had sought out a community of others who thought like them, and immersing in that community had changed what they thought.

“The first time he won, I really just considered him inexperienced and misguided,” Sally said. “This time, I think he is purposely taking us to a place we don’t recognize.”

Obama had said he wanted to raise the federal debt limit; Sally and Bill, meanwhile, were teaching Financial Peace University at their church, where they talked about borrowing $21,000 to buy their first house and then staying there 30 years until the mortgage was paid off.

“The most important lesson is you pay off what you owe before you borrow more,” Bill had told the congregants.

Obama wanted to cover rising costs for food stamps and unemployment insurance; Bill had found a factory job that paid $21 an hour and stuck with it through aching feet, back pain and boredom. He had selected a new Arm & Hammer trinket out of the company catalogue to mark every five years of employment and displayed those gifts proudly around his house. He had continued to fill the vats of glue and load cartons of baking soda boxes onto the line, watching 270 of them get filled every minute, eight hours a day, for 23 years.

On the other side

Cathy Morris, an Arm & Hammer quality supervisor, had worked alongside Bill for every one of those years without ever speaking to him about politics. She had overheard enough of his conversations to know: “He’s way over on the other side,” she said — and she preferred to associate only with her own side whenever possible.

She picked out an elliptical machine at the gym farthest from the TVs, because they were always tuned to Fox News. She deleted conservative friends from her Facebook page. She went on Snopes.com to investigate rumors about Obama and then shared her findings mostly with other liberals — the mechanic at work whom she spotted at a rally for Vice President Biden, her union Democrat father or her two daughters who had graduated from liberal arts colleges. In what increasingly felt like a fight over basic American principles, she decided her role was to reinforce the stakes with liberals already on her side.

“Why waste my breath talking about the president to somebody who is always going to hate him?” Morris said. “If they can’t understand what he’s accomplished, it is already a lost cause.”

How, she wondered, could anyone not see the proof? The local unemployment rate had dropped from 13 percent to just more than 6 percent. The nearby National Machinery Plant, which had nearly closed its doors a few years earlier, now had trucks lining up at the loading docks like floats awaiting the start of a victory parade. The two colleges in town had become more diverse, and Arm & Hammer had begun offering benefits to same-sex domestic partners. Because of health-care reform, Morris’s youngest daughter, 22, has been able to stay on her mother’s health insurance plan. Morris decided to repay the president by doing something she had never done: making regular donations to Obama’s reelection campaign.

In this county of 50-50, she had decided there was no more room for ambivalence. “You are all in for him or against him, and you have to commit,” Morris said.

Local membership had risen for both the tea party and the Democratic Women’s Club, and one disagreement on election night had resulted in an assault charge. Even the area’s once-tranquil town hall meetings had devolved into a shouting match, with one woman suggesting that liberals in Washington should be “shot in the head,” prompting local Democrats to demand a police investigation. Ever since, local politics had all but come to a standstill.

But the line at Arm & Hammer had to keep moving, 270 cartons a minute, so employees had decided to guard the peace by talking sparingly about Obama or his second inauguration.

“I only confide in people who think like I think,” Herr said.

“Smile and stick to your side,” Morris said.

So they stood together in polite silence and watched baking soda roll down the manufacturing line and onto the trucks, where it would be delivered into an economy that was improving or combusting, in a country where life was getting better or worse."

President Obama criticizes the sequester%2C %2485 billion in automatic budget cuts

Obama blames Republicans for allowing sequester by blocking tax hikes on the wealthy

Republicans say Obama would rather raise taxes than cut spending

President Obama blamed Republicans on Saturday for $85 billion in automatic budget cuts over the next seven months, saying the GOP is unwilling to help reduce the federal debt by raising taxes on the wealthy.

""It's happening because Republicans in Congress chose this outcome over closing a single wasteful tax loophole that helps reduce the deficit,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address.

Republicans returned the favor, saying Obama would rather raise taxes than cut major spending programs.

""The American people know full well that if they give this White House more tax revenue, it will be spent on new stimulus projects and government programs,"" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., in the GOP radio address.



The parties hit the airwaves a day after Obama and congressional leaders met at the White House but did not strike a deal to avert the automatic cuts known as the sequester, $85 billion in both domestic and defense programs.

In his radio address, Obama said the cuts will ""inflict pain on communities across the country,"" costing jobs and slowing growth.

Thousands of federal employees, including Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, and Defense Department employees, face furloughs and lost wages, Obama said. The cuts will hurt programs for education, research, and defense.

The White House, working with its Office of Management and Budget, have notified Congress and others of specific items within the $85 billion to be cut over the next seven months, the remainder of the current fiscal year. Letters are also going to out to governors, grantees and others who receive federal money.

The parties did appear to make progress on avoiding another potential budget standoff down the road -- the March 27 expiration of the continuing resolution that is funding the government; failing to renew it would lead to a budget shutdown.

In statements after Friday's White House meeting, Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, expressed optimism that the spending resolution would be extended and a shutdown avoided.

On Saturday, Obama echoed his call for a ""balanced"" budget plan to reduce the federal debt that now exceeds $16.5 trillion. His plan includes both spending cuts -- including reforms to Medicare and other entitlement programs -- as well as eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy.

""That's how we can reduce our deficit without laying off workers, or forcing parents and students to pay the price,"" Obama said.

Republicans said Obama got higher income tax rates as part of the January agreement to end the last budget impasse, the so-called fiscal cliff.

""Instead of campaigning for higher taxes, the president should lead an effort to begin addressing our nation's spending problem,"" said Rodgers, who chairs the House Republican Conference.

The sequester originated as part of a 2011 agreement to break yet another Obama-Republican budget impasse, raising the debt ceiling.

The idea: Require a series of automatic cuts, split between defense and domestic programs, so onerous that the parties would be forced to come up with a plan to cut more than $1 trillion off the debt in 10 years. They have failed to do that."

While the House voted 230 to 189 to pass the measure that Democrats have called unacceptable, Republicans insisted their bill does nothing to shutter the federal government.

""It simply keeps the lights on in our government,"" said Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, on Friday.

Rogers, whose committee is effectively short-circuited by the three-month stopgap bill, said almost nothing about the Affordable Care Act, but House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) made clear that the main point of the measure is to block the health care law.

""This resolution will also protect the working middle class from the devastating effects of Obamacare,"" said Cantor. ""Let's defund this law now, and protect the American people from the economic calamity that we know Obamacare will create.""

The vote marked the 42nd time that the House Republican conference has said yes to gutting Obamacare. While some tweaks have been made to the program, the Senate has ignored nearly everything the House has pushed for.

Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.), who faces reelection in a district that Obama carried in 2012, was the only Republican to vote against the bill. Rigell has bucked his party on fiscal matters before; he appeared with the president at an event in February opposing sequestration and even took a ride aboard Air Force One.

Rigell released a statement in which he said he agreed that Obamacare should be defunded, but couldn't support a bill that would set government spending levels at sequester levels.

""This [continuing resolution] fails to address the sequester that is negatively impacting those who wear our nation’s uniform and is the result of Congress' inability to pass the 12 appropriations bills necessary to properly fund the government on time,"" Rigell said. ""What is needed is a comprehensive solution to our nation’s fiscal challenges, including a replacement for sequestration.""

On the Democratic side, Reps. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.) were the only two lawmakers to vote in favor of the bill. The blue dog Democrats have often voted across party lines in the past.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) slammed the bill in a floor speech ahead of the vote, saying that the measure ""was designed to shut down the government.""

""It could have no other intent. Its purpose is clear,"" Pelosi said. ""It is a wolf in wolf's clothing.""

""Either you don't know what you are doing, or this is one of the most intentional acts of brutality that you have cooked up, with stiff competition for that honor,"" she added, while underscoring the damaging effects the bill would have on a program that provides health insurance to more than 8 million moderate-income children.

The continuing resolution would not only permanently strip the Affordable Care Act of its funding, but would lock in government spending at sequester levels that conflict with the budget passed in the Senate. It also sets up another potentially even more consequential showdown over the nation's debt limit, by including the so-called Full Faith and Credit Act, a measure that Republicans say would allow the Treasury Department to still pay the nation's creditors, and therefore avoid a default, if the debt limit, now at $16.7 trillion, is not raised sometime next month.

Democrats have dubbed that measure the ""Pay China First Act,"" pointing out that it would prioritize payments to U.S. bondholders, which include many foreign governments like China, while obligations such as Medicare and military benefits would be placed on the backburner.

While leaders such as Cantor insisted that the legislation was responsible, many members of his own party, including more than a dozen senators, have called the move ""foolish"" and ""dumb.""

Even Rogers seemed aware of the potential pitfalls of the stratagem.

""I'd like to remind my colleagues … both in the House and the other body that a government shutdown is a political game in which everyone loses,"" Rogers said. ""It shirks one of our most basic duties as members of Congress, and it puts our national security at stake. To be clear, if this legislation is not enacted and we embark on a government shutdown, the consequences are severe.""

""Our brave men and women in uniform don't get paid, our recovering economy will take a huge hit,"" he added. ""A government shutdown, even the illusion of the threat of a shutdown, says to the American people that this Congress does not have their best interests at heart.""

USA TODAY

Liberals doubted Summers over Harvard remarks%2C role in financial deregulation

Business economists preferred Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen%2C a known quantity%2C for the top job

Even Summers recognized a nomination would mean a confirmation fight

For Larry Summers, two camps of rivals apparently proved to be one too many.

Everyone knew liberals didn't want the former Treasury secretary to be President Obama's pick to chair the Federal Reserve. They were sore about his remark as Harvard's president that women were less likely to excel at science. And they were suspicious of his role in Clinton-era financial deregulation -- especially the decision barely to regulate financial derivatives at all. That loosed a monster called the credit-default swap that forced the $85 billion bailout of AIG five years ago this weekend, and nearly brought down all of Wall Street with it.

The surprise was the level of skepticism about Summers from his own crowd -- Wall Street types and business economists.

In a USA TODAY survey, 56% of the 42 economists said they preferred Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen for the top job. Conservatives who favor a good sound business administration wanted the quiet, liberal academic Yellen because she's closely identified with easy-money policies that have served Wall Street well.

Either camp of opponents may not have been able to kill Summers' candidacy. The combination of the two made it untenable, as Summers withdrew his name Sunday.

In his letter to the president, Summers wrote of wanting to avoid a contentious confirmation fight. Such a fight became all the more certain when three Senate Democrats (Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Ohio's Sherrod Brown and Montana's Jon Tester) signaled they would vote against him.

Generally, it has been thought Summers favored less monetary accommodation than Yellen has — which cost him support that might have offset liberal opposition. With Wall Street still nervous about the upcoming process of weaning the economy off reliance on the Fed's easy-money policies, they liked Yellen because they knew Yellen.

Yellen is ""extremely well-qualified and she's been there through the (financial) crisis,"" Mesirow Financial chief economist Diane Swonk said in July. `""We need continuity.""

Bottom line: When the financial market players line up behind the Berkeley professor -- and the professor would be the first woman Fed chair to boot -- there was no constituency left for a Summers pick. He always appeared to be the President's idea, preferred by too few others."

A few prominent voices from the industry have voiced unhappiness with some of the group’s hardball tactics, including running controversial TV ads for conservatives to gain their support for comprehensive immigration reform.

Twitter co-founder Evan Williams tweeted a blog post on his new company Medium’s website which accused Fwd.us of “employing questionable lobbying techniques, misleading supporters and not being transparent about the underlying values and long-term intentions of the organization.”

“The leaders of the technology industry (and of Fwd.us) have built their careers on bringing meaningful change to the world. They should be doing the same in Washington,” wrote startup founder Josh Miller.

Fwd.us spokeswoman Kate Hansen said the organization planned to stay the course.

“We recognize that not everyone will always agree with or be pleased by our strategy,” Hansen said in an emailed statement. “Fwd.us remains totally committed to supporting a bipartisan policy agenda that will boost the knowledge economy, including comprehensive immigration reform.”

Fwd.us has tech all-star backers such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Google’s Eric Schmidt. It has hired a team of seasoned Washington veterans including Rob Jesmer, who was executive director at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Joe Lockhart, a former White House spokesman under President Clinton. But its politics-as-usual gamesmanship seems to be out of step with some in the tech industry, particularly those who invest in clean technology.

“Will Fwd.us prostitute climate destruction & other values to get a few engineers hired & get immigration reform?” venture capitalist Vinod Khosla asked on Twitter, linking to a newspaper article about the controversy over the group’s ads.

Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, is a contributor to Fwd.us. Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla Motors and chairman of SolarCity, is also a contributor.

Technology entrepreneur Anil Dash reflected in a lengthy blog post on what he thinks Fwd.us gets right and wrong, after meeting with its founder Joe Green.

“The tech industry is going to have to reckon with exactly how real the realpolitik is going to get,” Dash wrote. “If we’re finally moving past our innocent, naive and idealistic lack of engagement with the actual dirty dealings of legislation, then let’s try to figure out how to do it without losing our souls.”

The good news about HealthCare.gov, the portal to Obamacare’s health exchange, is that the administration is no longer minimizing its problems. That’s the first step toward fixing the mess—and it will get fixed, although it’s anyone’s guess whether the new promise of a smoothly functioning system by the end of November will be met. We know, after all, that Obamacare is workable, since many states that chose to run their own exchanges are doing quite well. But while we wait for the geeks to do their stuff, let’s ask a related question: Why did this thing have to be so complicated in the first place?

Of all the official reactions to changing mores on marijuana, decriminalization is the best.

I did not say that my decision, and the Supreme Court’s decision affirming it (written, be it noted, by the notably liberal Justice Stevens), were wrong, only that, in common with many other judges, I could not be confident that it was right, since I am one of the judges who doesn’t understand the electoral process sufficiently well to be able to gauge the consequences of decisions dealing with that process. I may well have been wrong in Crawford, because laws similar (I do not say identical) to Indiana’s represent a “type of law now widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention” (emphasis added)—“now” referring to the fact there has been a flurry of such laws since 2007, when my opinion in the Crawford case was issued, and they have been sharply criticized.

Lou Reed, who has died at age 71, will be rightly remembered for creating a canon that was groundbreaking in the scope of its sociological and literary achievement. There was nothing unreasonable about Reed’s 1987 suggestion to Rolling Stone that “all through this, I’ve always thought that if you thought of all of it as a book then you have the Great American Novel, every record as a chapter. They’re all in chronological order. You take the whole thing, stack it and listen to it in order, there’s my Great American Novel.” Yet, Reed was, as well, an artist who understood and engaged in the political struggles of his times. No one who followed the remarkable career of the Velvet Underground co-founder and iconic solo artist over the better part of five decades failed to recognize his determination to speak up—and to show up.

I haven't heard such enthusiastic, downright raucous applause since Texas Gov. ""Oops"" Perry suggested in 2009 that his state just might withdraw from the union. Unfortunately for him, the applauders were not Texans, but the people of the other 49 states. This year, though, Idaho is the recipient of hip-hip-hoorays from across the country. Why? Because it has been selected as the site of an extraordinary new town to be named ""III Citadel."" This will be a walled, heavily-fortified, one-square-mile settlement of some 7,000 armed & angry, ideologically-pure, anti-government extremists drawn from cities, towns and gopher holes all across America. Lucky you, Idaho!

Here’s the mistake made by President Obama and the Democrats that nobody is talking about: They have been too fearful of confronting our country’s three-year obsession with the wrong problem. And here is the tea party’s greatest victory: It has made the wrong problem the center of policymaking. The wrong problem is the deficit. The right problem is sluggish growth and persistent unemployment."

The meeting of the minds took place a little more than a week before lawmakers will return to Springfield for a special session on the issue, though just what their return will accomplish is unclear if there's no plan to vote on.



To that end, Senate President John Cullerton said Quinn has asked him to re-introduce legislation that would combine two differing approaches, the idea being if one portion of the legislation is thrown out by the court the rest of the measure would stand.



One portion of the proposal would push back retirement dates, ask employees to pay more for benefits and scale back annual cost of living increases. The other portion would allow workers and retirees to keep their health care and receive reduced benfits, or keep their current pension plan but give up health care. The measure would not go into effect for another year, meaning it would only need a simple majority to pass instead of three-fifths support.



Cullerton said it was unclear if his new proposal would have the votes needed to pass the Senate. Even if it did, Madigan made no promise to call the measure before the House.



Cullerton acknowledged there was not an agreed way forward, but said ""we're going to proceed anyway.""



Quinn, meanwhile appealed for Madigan and Cullerton to work together to send him a bill, saying they have historically had no problem pushing through legislation addressing their priorities.



""They know how to work together when they want to, so now it's time for them to apply that same approach, that same attitude to comprehensive pension reform,"" Quinn said.

Ahlers'],Budget cuts would hit private air traffic in effort to spare airlines,"Story highlights The Federal Aviation Administration met with airline and airport executives FAA oversees the nation's air traffic system for airlines and private flights Plans include closing some control towers in less busy areas FAA employees have been told they may be furloughed as part of cuts

Federal aviation officials are telling airline and airport executives that they are working to minimize any disruption from imminent government budget cuts to passenger airline service, but warn the mandatory belt-tightening will impact air traffic overall.

At a meeting in Washington on Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would give priority to 77 “core” facilities – large airports and their related air traffic control centers, which it did not identify.

But the agency would reduce staffing system wide and would likely close 238 control towers at less busy airports. Those towers handle 5.8 percent of all commercial air traffic, the FAA said.

Opinion: Cuts too deep? No, not deep enough

“It was clear at the meeting that the brunt of the cuts were at the cost of general aviation (private and business aircraft), and the agency even recognized that,” said Melissa Rudinger of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a group representing private pilots in Washington.

The Transportation Department faces about $1 billion in budget cuts through the end of the fiscal year unless Congress acts by Friday to avert them. The cuts are part of a political impasse affecting spending across the government.

Much of the agency’s austerity will hit the FAA, which employs about 15,000 controllers and oversees traffic at more than 400 airports used by commercial airlines, business jets and private pilots.

Large airports will also be impacted.

All FAA employees have been told they may be furloughed at least one day every two weeks, inevitably meaning that aviation facilities will have fewer controllers.

While the cuts would inevitably reduce the number of operations – take-offs and landings – the FAA said it would maintain the highest level of safety.

The impact would be greatest at the nation’s small- and mid-sized airfields, the FAA acknowledged.

The 238 control towers facing possible closure met a criteria established by the FAA: They have fewer than 150,000 operations a year and fewer than 10,000 commercial airline operations.

Opinion: Cuts will turn off voters GOP is courting

Of those towers, 189 are “contact towers,” operated under FAA supervision by independent contractors. The remaining 49 are staffed by FAA controllers.

FAA officials said it would consider removing a tower on a case-by-case basis if advocates could justify a change. But any towers spared from closure would have to be off-set by cuts elsewhere, they said.

Most of the changes would occur at the start of April, and would ratchet up over a period of months. The first furloughs would begin April 8, according to a meeting participant.

If a tower is closed, operations at those airports would continue. But controller operations would be shifted to other facilities, or to the pilots themselves, who would radio their intentions to take off, land, and maneuver on the ground.

Ground operations could present the biggest danger to pilots, since it would remove from service controllers who are trained to look for conflicting movements on the runways and taxiways.

Critics say the FAA failed to consider important factors when compiling its list of towers, including whether the towers were also used for military operations and for search and rescue missions.

FAA officials also said Tuesday it would suspend development of its NextGen navigation system so it could reassign employees to control towers. And it would suspend its redesign of airspace – an ongoing program to make the area around airports more efficient.

The FAA also said budget cuts would force it to cut back on maintenance and repairs at “non-core” facilities. Only power, voice and navigational systems would be fixed at those facilities, the FAA told the industry executives.

Rudinger said while the FAA disclosed a few new details about its plans to deal with forced spending cuts – known in Washington as sequestration – it was “certainly not as much detail as we were looking for going into the meeting.”

Participants in the meeting questioned whether the FAA is making the smartest cuts.

”Clearly they have to make the cuts,” Rudinger said. “What’s unclear is how they came up with them. There hasn’t been any transparency in the process.”

Mick Mulvaney offered the Senate Democrat budget proposal for a vote in the House. The budget plan was defeated, with 35 Democrats crossing the aisle to oppose it. Thursday night, Dem Sen. Patty Murray responded by offering Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget for a vote in the Senate. The measure failed, 40-59, with 5 GOP Senators joining in opposition. Interestingly, among these 5 were Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee.

Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee are providing the nucleus of an emerging conservative opposition in the Senate. While there are other conservatives in the GOP caucus, these three are establishing themselves as reliable voices to articulate the conservative opposition to an ever encroaching government.

They are becoming skilled at identifying issues to make a stand on principle. I have no doubt that if their votes could have pushed the Ryan budget into passing, they would have voted for it, as it is likely the best option on the table. Frankly, however, the Ryan budget doesn’t go as far as conservatives would prefer. A vote against an amendment that was already going to be defeated was a good moment to stand on that principle.

The Ryan budget doesn’t cut real spending, but instead lowers the growth rate of spending. That is good, but unless you pull out by the roots wasteful spending and programs, they can always be expanded by a future Congress. Cutting real spending requires choices and priorities. Merely slowing the rate of spending growth keeps much of government in place.

The most important, and meaningful, proposal in Ryan’s budget is to transition Medicare into a premium support program. Seniors would be free to select the health insurance that best meets their needs and the federal Medicare program would underwrite some portion of the premiums. It curbs unsustainable entitlement spending, but, best, it gives Seniors greater choice over their health care.

Late Thursday, MI Sen. Debbie Stabenow introduced an amendment that would prevent Medicare being turned into a “voucher” program, the Democrats’ label to describe the Ryan plan. The Stabenow amendment passed 96-3.

Who were the three Senators to vote against Stabenow? Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee. Hopefully, their principled, conservative opposition will catch on with their colleagues.

Steny Hoyer: ""There does not seem to be a serious effort to reach agreement"" A 29-person House and Senate conference committee is tasked with hashing out budget A lack of confidence in the process has moved into higher gear Republicans in D.C. are mindful they took the brunt of the blame in last shutdown

(CNN) —

Hovering above Congress with the unpleasant scent of deja vu are concerns that current budget talks seem poised to fail and that the word “shutdown” is back on the rise.

First, there’s the apparent budget impasse.

“There does not seem to be a serious effort to reach agreement in the budget conference,” House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland told reporters on Tuesday.

The “budget conference” is the 29-person House and Senate conference committee tasked with hashing out basic budget parameters, including total spending for the next two years. They have until December 13 to come up with a deal.

“Many of us are skeptics there ever will be (a deal),” said Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, adding he is confident that the leaders of the budget conference, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, are doing their best.

Battle for the House in 2014: Obamacare vs. shutdown

Personal thoughts about the leaders aside, a lack of confidence in the process has moved into higher gear this week.

On Monday, the 13 top Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee sent Ryan and Murray a letter expressing concern and urging them to at least come up with a topline figure for spending so that appropriators could then start writing the bills that actually spend the money.

The lawmakers behind that letter are worried that they won’t have time to write and pass appropriation bills before January 15, when government funding is set to run out.

They didn’t mince words in the letter: “The failure to reach a budget deal to allow Appropriations to assemble funding… will reopen the specter of another government shutdown.”

“We need that (spending figure),” said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, who signed the letter. “It will probably take a good month (to write the spending bills).”

Shutdown cometh? Some aren’t worried; others are

Frank, like most Republicans with whom CNN spoke, does not believe a shutdown is likely in January. Even without a budget conference deal, the House and Senate could pass simple continuing resolutions to keep government funded.

Appropriators don’t want that because it would trigger blunt, across-the-board budget cuts and block any chance to tailor the cuts agency by agency.

So the lack of a budget deal does not mean a shutdown will happen, but nonetheless, murmurs of shutdown politics are emerging. Wolf and other Republicans are concerned that the mantle of a shutdown, or any threat of one, could again harm their party.

“We probably lost the governor’s race and attorney general’s race in Virginia because of the shutdown,” he said, shaking his head. Polling after the shutdown but before the Virginia elections showed Republicans were more tarnished by the fiscal fight. In a CNN/ORC poll, 52% said Republicans in Congress were more responsible for the shutdown compared with President Barack Obama’s 34%.

Democrats are clearly teeing up the connection between Republicans and another shutdown.

“I think Paul Ryan ought to put a serious proposal on the table,” said Democratic Whip Hoyer. “Paul Ryan ought to lead, not follow his caucus down a road which would lead to shutdown.”

“No one’s talking about a shutdown except for Democrats,” responded Donald Stewart, spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. “Everything they’re doing now is to get them away from the pain and problems of Obamacare, of course they want to talk about something else.”

All of this political debris is again swirling in large part because of the absence of clear progress from Ryan and Murray’s budget conference talks.

The two budget committee chairs and their staff have made pragmatic but hopeful statements in public. Aides from both parties tell CNN the two leaders have been in frequent contact and had face-to-face meetings. But their public words on the matter are few. On Wednesday, Ryan repeatedly donned headphones and holding his hand up as if to say “no comment” on Tuesday.

Budget staffers from both chambers point out that the less that negotiators say during talks, traditionally, the closer they are to a deal. But in this case, the wild politics involved lead many to question whether it’s in Ryan’s interest to cut a deal.

Senate leader pays a House call

Perhaps the most significant sign of concern came from a rare cross-Capitol visit Tuesday when McConnell spoke to a closed-door meeting of the House GOP Conference. According to multiple sources in the room, McConnell talked about the upcoming funding deadlines and made it clear that he wants the overall budget reduction slated for January to go into place.

McConnell’s visit was unusual, one of just a handful he’s made to House conference in his six years as Republican leader. In general, he has a reputation as a practical fiscal negotiator who aims to avoid crisis. He and Vice President Joe Biden were among the final negotiators during the fiscal cliff fight of 2011 and 2012. And in October, Democrats and others pointed to McConnell’s role as critical in ending the shutdown.

His decision to start talking with House Republicans about the January shutdown deadline now is significant.

Meantime, the budget conference committee has a timing problem. The group technically has three weeks on the calendar to hash out a deal. But in reality, Congress leaves at the end of the week for Thanksgiving and after it returns, members will have just eight days in session before that December 13 deadline.

If they miss that deadline, then Congress could go home for Christmas with no plan for how to keep government funded past January 15. Lawmakers would return January 7 and have a week to decide.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — It's Day 3 of the federal government shutdown, with no end in sight. President Obama says he's ""exasperated,"" which probably sums up the feelings of lawmakers in Congress and the rest of the nation. What you need to know for Thursday, Oct. 3:

Obama meets with lawmakers, but shutdown continues

Congress and the White House aren't any closer to ending the budget impasse that sparked the shutdown, but President Obama and top Senate and House leaders met for the first time Wednesday to discuss the situation. The issues are still the same: Obama and Democrats won't accept any stopgap spending bill to fund the government that has restrictions. Republicans aren't budging from trying to affect the health care law signed by Obama. Every day of the shutdown also brings the nation closer to reaching another fiscal crisis on Oct. 17, when the government will reach the debt ceiling.

Children caught in the middle of budget fight

Children are the collateral damage in the shutdown, and its duration could have a devastating impact on some. Pre-kindergarten classes under the Head Start program have been forced to close. Patients with incurable diseases have been turned away from the National Institute of Health's Clinical Center. About 8.8 million women and children are at risk of not getting vouchers through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC.

Freebies to furloughed workers ease the pain

With 800,000 federal employees furloughed from their jobs, companies inside and outside of Washington are trying to lure customers and media attention by offering everything from free cups of coffee to freebie sandwiches and free oil changes. One example: Federal workers who own a Hyundai can stop making car payments for as long as the shutdown keeps them off the job. All the bad political karma is getting reshaped into positive PR by dozens of companies desperately trying to make public relations lemonade out of the government shutdown lemon.

Shutdown clogs pipeline of government data for business

The river of data that federal agencies release daily on everything from job growth to divorce rates is drying up in the shutdown. At the top of the list is the closely watched Labor Department report on U.S. employment in September. Reports on factory orders, retail sales and wholesale prices will likely be postponed if the shutdown goes into next week. Economists and industry officials say the data vacuum will likely affect stock markets and even business hiring and investment if the government is closed for more than a week or two.

Pentagon OKs service academy football games

The Defense Department gave the go-ahead late Wednesday for the military service academies to play their scheduled football games this weekend, including the sold-out Navy vs. Air Force matchup in Annapolis, Md. The games were in jeopardy because the Pentagon suspended all intercollegiate athletics at the shutdown's start. Army is scheduled to play Boston College, but neither athletic department had officially announced the game was happening.

If the country wants to continue paying all its bills, that's not a realistic option for many reasons large and small, legal and practical. Here are just two:

Bills may be delayed but must be paid: Putting off payments to, say, federal contractors wouldn't save the government any money. In fact, it would cost taxpayers more money. The Treasury Department must pay those bills at some point, along with interest penalties for being late.

Spending must be slashed or taxes hiked: The Congressional Research Service estimates that over the next 12 months, the government will spend an average of $30 billion more every month than it takes in.

But if Congress hasn't raised the debt ceiling, borrowing to bridge the difference won't be possible. Instead, lawmakers would have four options to choose from that would have to be implemented abruptly:

Slash discretionary spending (including defense) by 33% every month.

Cut mandatory spending (such as spending on Social Security) by 16% every month.

Raise taxes by 12% every month.

Or some combination of all three

That's the gentle scenario.

The truth is the deficit from month to month can vary greatly. So in some periods the spending cuts or tax increases would have to be far more drastic.

For example, pretend Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling for all of November. What then?

""The Treasury would have no choice but to eliminate its cash deficit, which will run as high as $130 billion in November,"" economist Mark Zandi told the Joint Economic Committee recently. ""The economy would quickly fall into another severe recession.""

Recessions usually increase spending because safety net expenses, such as unemployment benefits, go up. But if the government can't borrow new money to compensate, lawmakers would have to cut further or hike taxes even more. That, in turn, can dampen future growth.

You get the picture."

Republican National Committee says it has funds to hire five security guards

National Park Service employees who work at memorial placed on furlough in government shutdown

Mississippi veterans were first to cross barricades on Day 1 of shutdown

WASHINGTON — The Republican National Committee is offering to pay security expenses so the World War II Memorial is open for visitors during the government shutdown.

Wednesday's offer from RNC Chairman Reince Preibus was dismissed by Democrats as a stunt. Priebus said the GOP has set aside funds to hire five security guards for the memorial.

Barricades have been placed around the World War II Memorial and other popular tourist attractions because of the shutdown. The 330 federal employees who work at the National Mall and its memorials have been placed on furlough.

The World War II Memorial became a visible symbol of the shutdown's impact Tuesday when 91 veterans from Mississippi crossed the barricades with the help of members of Congress so they could tour the site.

The veterans, some in wheelchairs, came to Washington via the Honor Flight program, which sponsors one-day trips for World War II, Korea and Vietnam veterans so they can visit the monuments dedicated to their service.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress were unable to agree on a stopgap spending bill to fund the government before the new fiscal year began on Tuesday, which is why the shutdown began. President Obama has rebuffed House GOP proposals attached to the bill that would gut his health care law.

""The Obama administration has decided they want to make the government shutdown as painful as possible, even taking the unnecessary step of keeping the Greatest Generation away from a monument built in their honor,"" Priebus said. ""That's not right, and it's not fair.""

Mo Elleithee, communications director for the Democratic National Committee, called on Republicans to urge House Speaker John Boehner to allow a vote on a stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, without any restrictions.

""We've already been working on a plan to open the Memorial — and the entire government — after the GOP caused them to close,"" Elleithee said in a statement. ""It's called a clean funding resolution and it sounds like the votes are there if the speaker would just call for a vote. It would save the economy a lot of money and get the Memorial and government open a whole lot faster.""

Veterans from Missouri, Illinois and Michigan entered the closed memorial Wednesday, Day 2 of the government shutdown. National Park Service spokeswoman Carol Johnson told ABC News that the Honor Flights are being granted access to the memorial ""to conduct First Amendment activities.""

""These soldiers gave everything in fighting for our freedom and the thought that they would not be allowed into their memorial because of the partisan divide in Washington is beyond the pale,"" said Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who visited with the Illinois veterans at the memorial.

* Reid ""disappointed"" with lack of Republican budget offers

* Republicans: Obama tax demands a ""sticking point""

By David Lawder

WASHINGTON, July 30 (Reuters) - Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday he was ""disappointed"" with budget talks between Republican senators and the White House, saying President Barack Obama has offered concessions while Republicans refuse to budge.

The discussions have been the only significant channel for communications between the White House and congressional Republicans on the budget in recent weeks as the government faces a possible shutdown if a deal can't be reached by Sept. 30.

Thus far the group, led loosely by Georgia Republican moderate Johnny Isakson and numbering as high as 25, has mainly tried to persuade White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and other top officials that the budget solutions should be designed to tame deficits over a 30-year period, rather than the traditional 10-year budget window used by Congress.

The Republican senators say this would require deeper cuts to expensive federal benefits programs for the elderly, which grow exponentially in the 2020s and 2030s as the massive Baby Boom generation retires in force.

Reid complained that the Republican group had not offered any specific proposals and wasn't working with Senate Democrats to replace automatic ""sequester"" spending cuts or resolve other budget differences.

""I've been disappointed with the meetings the Republicans have had with the president. The last one, as I understand it, was yesterday,"" Reid told reporters on Tuesday.

""All they talk about is, Mr President, what are you going to do?"" Reid said. ""He's already done things a number of people in my caucus, they're not wild about. But he's put forward his proposal. The Republicans refuse to come up with anything in writing.""

Obama has offered Republicans a change in the way cost-of-living increases are calculated, using a less-generous measure of inflation, but has demanded additional tax increases on the wealthy. Many Democrats have balked at the proposal because it would effectively reduce Social Security payments to seniors in future years.

TAX REVENUE ROADBLOCK

McDonough and other members of Obama's economic team are continuing to meet with the Republican group, which also includes Senators Kelly Ayotte, John Hoeven, Lindsey Graham, Bob Corker, John McCain and Tom Coburn, a senior administration official said.

The official said the talks would continue, despite not yielding any results so far. To date the Republican senators have not offered specific proposals and have not agreed to put revenues on the table.

""Obviously the challenge is that the administration wants $583 billion in higher taxes and that just doesn't work for us,"" said Hoeven, of North Dakota. ""Revenues should come through economic growth, not higher taxes. That's the stumbling block.""

He said, however, that Obama's cost-of-living proposal shows there is room for agreement in some areas to reform benefit programs known as entitlements.

A more immediate problem for Congress, however, will be reconciling deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans over spending on discretionary programs ranging from education to the military, and replacing the across-the-board sequester cuts with savings elsewhere.

If these issues can't be resolved before the end of September, the government faces a strong risk of shutting down over lack of funding as the new fiscal year gets underway on Oct. 1.

Time is already running short, as Congress starts a five-week recess on Friday, and has scheduled only nine legislative days in September.

Reid said Democrats were ready to negotiate any size fiscal agreement - ""a big deal, a middle-sized deal, any kind of a deal. But you can't do it unless Republicans agree.""

On Wednesday, Obama will come to Capitol Hill to meet with Democrats in both the House and Senate to discuss his plans for tax reform, job growth and budget issues."

This does not bode well for cooperation in government in the near term. Leaders need to lead.

The people in the video snippet seem to be good people who love America. Listening to them show what receiving of a singular message can do to one’s psyche. They simply cannot see that Ted Cruz’s tactic is holding America hostage. By implication they are holding America hostage.

Polls show that Ted Cruz, the Tea Party, and Republicans are taking the brunt of the blame justifiably for the government shutdown. The financial cost of the shutdown was $24.1 Billion. 800,000 workers were furloughed. Not reported as much is the effect it had on the healthcare of children and on the hungry. Not reported as much is the incalculable damage it has done on scientific research.

In their discussion these issues never came up or were glossed over. In their reality the government shutdown was a good thing; fiscal responsibility by all means necessary, even if it means being fiscally irresponsible and inhumane. That by inference is holding America hostage.

This group which is very representative of the Tea Party believes a government’s budget can be treated like one’s personal budget. They believe the grassroots of America is with them. This delusion is similar to the delusion of the 2012 election when less than favorable polls were replaced by their belief in a newly created ‘un-skewed poll’.

The frustration the gentleman speaks about at the end is real to him. The frustration they all feel is real. The answer is to lay to light the real causes of their frustration. It is not Obamacare. It is not government spending. It is a sect of the body politic that has indoctrinated them to look away from the real problems of the country. In effect the frustration is of their own creation which prevents solving the problems they are rightfully frustrated about.

After drawn-out negotiations, Congress was able to cobble together a fiscal plan and pass it in both chambers Tuesday night. No one walked away getting everything they wanted but that didn’t stop Obama from declaring victory and playing the passage as a ringing endorsement from the American public to push Republicans even harder on taxes in the coming months.

“The agreement leaves substantial scope for reducing tax expenditures for high-income households” during any future debates over tax reform and entitlement programs, the Obama administration said in a ""fact sheet"" released following Tuesday morning's Senate vote.

Obama, during brief remarks Tuesday night after the House passed the bill, reiterated that ""cutting spending has to go hand in hand with further reforms to our tax code so that the wealthiest corporations and individuals can't take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most Americans.""

Many Republicans had complained that the legislation would raise taxes without making any significant cuts in government spending. Conservatives toyed late Tuesday afternoon with tacking on billions in spending cuts. In the end, that idea was abandoned and the House voted on the Senate-passed bill. That bill allows tax increases on households making above $450,000 -- it's a narrower swath of families than Obama was previously looking at, but the president still used it to suggest the dam had been broken on tax hikes.

The Obama administration and Democrats were able to apply pressure Republicans into making a deal, often taking their pleas public. On Monday, Obama held a midday press conference with a group of middle-class Americans standing behind him as he took shots at Congress for its clumsiness in negotiations.

Economist Doug Holtz-Eakin says the House GOP played the only hand it could with a deadline approaching that would have forced the nation to face historic tax increases on virtually every single American in the country.

“They did the best they could,” Eakin said. “Getting a deal is a victory – and that should be recognized – but it’s far from a slam dunk and more work needs to be done.”

Had the House not passed the legislation, tax rates enacted in the last decade would have expired and broad tax increases would have kicked in affecting nearly every working American. An additional $110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending would have also gone into effect -- it has instead been delayed two months.

Republicans say they didn’t get the spending cuts they wanted and plan to continue their fight in the next two months when another round of budget battles take place over the debt ceiling."

January 4th, 2013 4:25PM

It has been four long winters since the federal government, in the hulking, shaven-skulled, Alien Nation-esque form of then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, committed $700 billion in taxpayer money to rescue Wall Street from its own chicanery and greed. To listen to the bankers and their allies in Washington tell it, you'd think the bailout was the best thing to hit the American economy since the invention of the assembly line. Not only did it prevent another Great Depression, we've been told, but the money has all been paid back, and the government even made a profit. No harm, no foul – right?

Wrong.

It was all a lie – one of the biggest and most elaborate falsehoods ever sold to the American people. We were told that the taxpayer was stepping in – only temporarily, mind you – to prop up the economy and save the world from financial catastrophe. What we actually ended up doing was the exact opposite: committing American taxpayers to permanent, blind support of an ungovernable, unregulatable, hyperconcentrated new financial system that exacerbates the greed and inequality that caused the crash, and forces Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to increase risk rather than reduce it. The result is one of those deals where one wrong decision early on blossoms into a lush nightmare of unintended consequences. We thought we were just letting a friend crash at the house for a few days; we ended up with a family of hillbillies who moved in forever, sleeping nine to a bed and building a meth lab on the front lawn.

How Wall Street Killed Financial Reform

But the most appalling part is the lying. The public has been lied to so shamelessly and so often in the course of the past four years that the failure to tell the truth to the general populace has become a kind of baked-in, official feature of the financial rescue...

...

...The bailout deceptions came early, late and in between. There were lies told in the first moments of their inception, and others still being told four years later. The lies, in fact, were the most important mechanisms of the bailout…

…

…So what exactly did the bailout accomplish? It built a banking system that discriminates against community banks, makes Too Big to Fail banks even Too Bigger to Failier, increases risk, discourages sound business lending and punishes savings by making it even easier and more profitable to chase high-yield investments than to compete for small depositors. The bailout has also made lying on behalf of our biggest and most corrupt banks the official policy of the United States government. And if any one of those banks fails, it will cause another financial crisis, meaning we're essentially wedded to that policy for the rest of eternity – or at least until the markets call our bluff, which could happen any minute now.

Other than that, the bailout was a smashing success."

After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, the red ink is receding rapidly in Washington, easing pressure on policymakers but shattering hopes for a summertime budget deal.

Federal tax revenue is up and spending is down thanks to an improving economy, tax increases that took effect in January and the automatic budget cuts known as the sequester.

The sunnier outlook means that President Obama will be able to pay the nation’s bills for months without seeking additional borrowing authority from Congress — probably until Oct. 1, according to independent forecasts.

That might seem like good news, but it is unraveling Republican plans to force a budget deal before Congress takes its August break. Instead, the fiscal fight appears certain to bleed into the fall, when policymakers will face another multi-pronged crisis that pairs the need for a higher debt limit and the fresh risk of default with the threat of a full-scale government shutdown, which is also looming Oct. 1.

In the meantime, Republicans face a listless summer, with little appetite for compromise but no leverage to shape an agreement. Without that leverage, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Tuesday, there is no point in opening formal budget negotiations between the House and the Senate, because Democrats have no reason to consider the kind of far-reaching changes to Medicare and the U.S. tax code that Republicans see as fundamental building blocks of a deal.

View Graphic A new Goldman Sachs forecast predicts that the government will not reach its debt limit until early September or October. Part of the variable is whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac release tens of billions of dollars to taxpayers. The dotted lines show Goldman Sachs's three predicted debt limit scenarios.

“The debt limit is the backstop,” Ryan said before taking the stage at a debt summit organized by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation in Washington. “I’d like to go through regular order and get something done sooner rather than later. But we need to get a down payment on the debt. We need entitlement reform. We’re very serious about tax reform because we think that’s critical to economic growth and job creation. Those are the things we want to talk about.”

Democrats are urging Republicans to initiate talks well before the next deadline and at last resolve the long-standing dispute over whether to tame the debt solely by cutting spending, as Republicans demand, or also by raising taxes on the wealthy, as Obama insists.

“The American people — all of us — are tired of management by crisis,” Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said at the Peterson summit. “We need to start working now.”

But senior Senate Republicans, including several who recently dined with Obama and huddled with administration officials, conceded that it may be tough to bring their colleagues to the table too far ahead of the debt-ceiling deadline.

“I think there’s a better atmosphere for a solution than there’s been in the past, but I’m a little worried about people here in the Senate having fiscal fatigue. There isn’t any sense of urgency right now,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), one of three senators who joined Obama on Monday for a round of golf.

“We need to realize this debt ceiling is out there. It’s inevitable. It’s coming. And [the later deadline] should not relieve pressure,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. But “sometimes we don’t want to act until a gun is at our heads.”

Since 2011, when Republicans gained control of the House and made cutting spending their top priority, Washington has faced a series of economy-rattling showdowns that produced eleventh-hour deals to cut spending, raise taxes and extend the federal debt limit. The most recent came during the year-end “fiscal cliff” fight, when Republicans reluctantly approved more than $600 billion in new taxes on the wealthy over the next decade.

Demoralized by that defeat — it was the first time in more than two decades that congressional Republicans had approved a significant tax hike — House GOP leaders developed a strategy that promised greater success: They would goad Senate Democrats into adopting a budget plan and force them into negotiations, even as automatic spending cuts started to take effect March 1, slashing agency budgets.

Meanwhile, the House took the unprecedented step of suspending the federal debt limit, then set at $16.4 trillion, until May 19. When the debt ceiling goes back into effect next weekend, the limit will automatically be lifted to account for any new borrowing. But Republicans calculated that the Treasury would almost immediately be in trouble again and in need of an even higher debt limit before the August break.

Ryan laid out the strategy for rank-and-file lawmakers at a January retreat in Williamsburg and during listening sessions on Capitol Hill. “These pressure points would come together and force a bargain on the budget,” said a GOP aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings. “This was Ryan’s spiel.”

The strategy, however, failed to account for the improving budget outlook. In February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that this year’s deficit would fall to $845 billion, down from nearly $1.1 trillion in 2012. Goldman Sachs recently predicted that the deficit would fall even further, to $775 billion, and return to sustainable levels within two years.

As a result, the national debt is rising far more slowly than in the frantic days after the 2008 economic crisis: The Treasury Department actually expects to repay a tiny sliver of the $16.8 trillion national debt by the end of June.

Much of the improvement stems from recent budget deals. Over the past two years, Congress has capped agency spending and created the sequester, which is trimming outlays on domestic programs and the military. Lawmakers also agreed to raise taxes on virtually every American this year, letting a temporary reduction in the payroll tax expire and tax rates rise for households earning more than $450,000 a year.

But other factors are at work, too. Defense spending has been declining rapidly with the end of the war in Iraq and the ongoing drawdown of forces in Afghanistan. A surprising — and apparently durable — slowdown in health-care costs has sharply reduced projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid. And the falling jobless rate and improving economy have helped push federal tax collections up 16 percent over last year, according to figures out Tuesday.

As a result, forecasts of the date when the debt is expected to hit the new debt limit have been slipping, from midsummer to late summer to early fall. Forecasters at Goldman and the Bipartisan Policy Center who have been watching the government’s cash-flow situation closely say the Treasury is all but certain to make it to Oct. 1 if Fannie Mae, the taxpayer-owned mortgage giant, and its sibling Freddie Mac turn over tens of billions of dollars as a result of their stronger financial status amid a recovering housing market. A decision is expected this week.

Treasury officials have declined to provide much guidance, citing “forecasting uncertainty.” That could change as May 19 draws near. Meanwhile, the White House has called the date irrelevant, saying that Obama will not negotiate over the debt limit and urging Republicans to act now to broker a debt-reduction deal.

“No one should threaten the default of the United States,” White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said Tuesday at the Peterson summit. “Democrat or Republican, for any reason, no one should use the default of the United States as a budget path or negotiating tool.”"

But Obama’s choice of venue for his remarks of a manufacturing company that makes mining and pumping equipment provided fodder for Republicans. They pointed out that its president had just the day before testified on Capitol Hill in support of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which the Obama administration has delayed for years.

Ellicott Dredges President Peter Bowe says the pipeline, designed to transport crude from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, to the refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast, would pour money into his business.

“For us, it’s all about jobs,” Bowe told members of the House Committee on Small Business on Thursday. The project will generate jobs “every year for decades to come, all related to the production of oil from the Alberta oil sands deposits,” he said.

Obama has spent days trying to manage a rare convergence of controversial stories. He has described how his administration handled the deadly attacks on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya; responded to the IRS’ targeting of conservative groups; and defended the Department of Justice’s digging into the phone records of journalists.

The plan for Friday had been to begin turning the conversation back to jobs, according to veteran Democratic strategists who advised the White House this week.

“They know that’s what people care about,” said one, who requested anonymity to talk about the private discussions. The White House also believes the economy trumps all other subjects, even the current controversies, for most Americans.

Although there was no sign that Bowe brought up the subject as he showed Obama around the manufacturing shop, the choice of venue put some of the spotlight on the Keystone XL pipeline after Republicans circulated a transcript of Bowe’s testimony.

Obama in his remarks alluded to lengthy delays the government often imposes on major projects, without referring to Keystone specifically.

“One of the problems we’ve had in the past is that sometimes it takes too long to get projects off the ground,” Obama said. “There are all these permits and red tape and planning and this and that, and some of it’s important to do, but we could do it faster.”

Obama said that he recently ordered accelerated permitting for 50 big projects across the country, including work on the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York and the Port of Charleston in South Carolina.

“We’ve been able to, in some cases, cut approval times from seven years down to a year,” Obama said, to loud applause from the crowd at the Baltimore plant. “Today I’m directing agencies across the government to do what it takes to cut timelines for breaking ground on major infrastructure projects in half.”

Back in Washington, Republicans scoffed.

“Catching grief for your Keystone delays? Don’t worry, we have just the answer,” said Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “Expedite something. It hasn’t worked before, but maybe the press will buy it this time.”

Corzine, for using “one-shot gimmicks” to balance the budget, called it “unconscionable” to take away property tax rebates and railed against issuing more debt for transportation projects, promising to “start saying no to spending.”

But in four years in office, Governor Christie, a Republican, has relied on the same kind of short-term strategies, diverting money for things like affordable housing and property tax rebates to balance the budget, and tapping funds intended for development of new sources of energy to keep the lights on in state buildings.

Mr. Christie made headlines when he declared he was canceling construction of a tunnel under the Hudson River to halt runaway costs, but he has issued more debt for transportation projects than any of his predecessors. Overall spending has risen 14 percent, and while state surpluses nationwide are growing, New Jersey’s has shrunk to its lowest percentage in a decade. The state’s bond rating is among the worst in the country.

Mr. Christie’s record is drawing scrutiny now, not only because he is emphasizing that he “restored fiscal sanity” to the state as he seeks re-election next week, but also because of his possible presidential candidacy: As a Northeastern Republican, he needs a way to connect with the party’s conservative base, and a strong message of fiscal management could help him offset skepticism about his positions on social issues."

http://news.yahoo.com/social-security-head-program-fraying-neglect-084818485--finance.html,,[],Social Security head: Program fraying from neglect,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Outgoing Social Security Commissioner Michael J. Astrue has some parting shots for Congress, the White House and advocates for seniors. They have all ""really walked away from Social Security,"" he says, leaving the program ""fraying because of inattention to its problems.""

Instead of making the hard choices to fix Social Security's financial problems, policymakers ""use it as a tool of political rhetoric,"" Astrue said.

Astrue, 56, has headed the federal government's largest program since 2007 — he was nominated by former President George W. Bush. By law, Social Security commissioners serve six-year terms, so President Barack Obama will now have the opportunity to choose his own nominee, who must be approved by the Senate. Astrue's last day on the job was Wednesday.

The trustees who oversee Social Security say the program's trust funds will run dry in 2033, leaving Social Security with only enough revenue to pay about 75 percent of benefits. Already the program is paying out more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes.

As commissioner, Astrue served as a trustee. He regularly urged Congress to address Social Security's long-term financial problems but refrained from publicly weighing in on various options to cut benefits or raise taxes — until now.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Astrue said benefit cuts and tax increases are inevitable — despite fierce opposition to both. Yet he questions whether Congress is up to the task.

Q: The president and Republican leaders in Congress have both embraced changes to Social Security as part of negotiations to reduce government borrowing. Should Social Security be part of the deficit and debt discussions?

A: My general perspective is that Washington broadly, and I include the Congress, both parties, the executive branch, the major interest groups, have really walked away from Social Security. ... I think that Social Security is a gem. I think it is the most successful domestic program in the history of the United States government and it is fraying because of inattention to its problems. And I think it's a shame that Washington cannot get its act together to look at Social Security in detail in isolation and say, What do we need to do?

Story continues

Q: There are some in Congress who say only benefit cuts should be considered — no tax increases. Others say benefit cuts should be off the table. Where do you come down?

A: Nothing is going to happen if you establish preconditions for the conversation. I do think that for the people who simply want to tax more, you need to be very mindful of the fact that that tax will fall disproportionately on the younger generation and that if you're not careful, that could be a huge economic drag.

Q: One of the few issues that the president and Republicans in Congress agree on is changing the way the government measures inflation. As you know, this would reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security recipients. Advocates for seniors hate the idea. They want bigger COLAs, not smaller ones. What do you think?

A: As a general matter I do think that the president and the Congress are right that before you start talking about increases in the retirement age and things like that it's appropriate to try to have a conversation about what we might be able to do in terms of COLA adjustments.

Q: The age when retirees can receive full benefits is gradually increasing from 66 to 67. There are proposals to increase it gradually even more, perhaps as high as 70. What do you think of those proposals?

A: I think there's some historical inevitability that we will move in that direction. How far, I don't think is historically inevitable. Part of this we need to remember is not that the system is flawed or that there are evil people around here. I mean, we should celebrate a little bit of good news. Most of the pressure on the system comes from the fact that we've had great medical advances and people are living a lot longer than before.

Q: Social Security payroll taxes only apply to the first $113,700 of a worker's wages. There have been proposals to increase this threshold or even eliminate it, applying the tax to all wages. What do you think of those ideas?

A: I think there's some historic inevitability on at least some lifting of the (payroll tax) cap. I think that most politicians and I think most economists I've talked to generally think that that would have less of a negative impact on the economy than raising the rate itself.

Q: Applications for disability benefits increased dramatically when the economy went bad. Why did that happen?

A: I think a lot of people applied out of economic desperation. Very few of those people actually ended up getting benefits. If you look at the numbers, it's one of the reasons why our approval rates have dropped dramatically in the last few years.

Q: Aren't most disability claims initially denied?

A: Yes.

Q: Why?

A: Because the statutory standard is so stringent. In terms of the percentage who get on, both in the beginning and at the end of the process, it's somewhere usually in most years in the 35 to 40 percent range. Sometimes people talk like nobody gets approved initially, and that's not true. Some people say, Oh, everybody gets on, and that's not true, either. But the statutory standard is you have to be unable to do work that exists in the national economy for 12 months or more.

Q: If your claim is denied, you can appeal to an administrative law judge, but the process can take a year or more. Tell me about your efforts to reduce these backlogs.

A: We've done, I think, some yeoman's work in reducing the backlogs. ... If you look at time to a hearing, what we call average processing time, it peaked very shortly after I started at 542 days and it got down to about 340 (days) and then drifted up a little bit with all the budget cuts in the last couple of years. But it's still about a year on average, and that's a big improvement.

Q: Are you getting enough resources from Congress to address these backlogs?

A: No.

Q: The Association of Administrative Law Judges says that in order to reduce backlogs some judges are deciding more than 500 cases a year. Is that too many cases to do a thorough job on each one?

A: No, not at all. We set for the first time productivity standards in 2007. It was actually done by the chief judge, and it was done looking at best demonstrated practices of existing judges. At that point in time about 40 percent of the judges were doing 500 to 700 cases a year. And so that's what we set as our goal, and that's what it is, it's a goal to shoot for. ... Now, about 80 percent of the judges hit that goal.

True, the president offered many good ideas. But we already know that almost none of those ideas will make it past a hostile House of Representatives.

On the other hand, the G.O.P. reply, delivered by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, was both interesting and revelatory. And I mean that in the worst way. For Mr. Rubio is a rising star, to such an extent that Time magazine put him on its cover, calling him “The Republican Savior.” What we learned Tuesday, however, was that zombie economic ideas have eaten his brain.

In case you’re wondering, a zombie idea is a proposition that has been thoroughly refuted by analysis and evidence, and should be dead — but won’t stay dead because it serves a political purpose, appeals to prejudices, or both. The classic zombie idea in U.S. political discourse is the notion that tax cuts for the wealthy pay for themselves, but there are many more. And, as I said, when it comes to economics it appears that Mr. Rubio’s mind is zombie-infested.

Start with the big question: How did we get into the mess we’re in?

The financial crisis of 2008 and its painful aftermath, which we’re still dealing with, were a huge slap in the face for free-market fundamentalists. Circa 2005, the usual suspects — conservative publications, analysts at right-wing think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute and the Cato Institute, and so on — insisted that deregulated financial markets were doing just fine, and dismissed warnings about a housing bubble as liberal whining. Then the nonexistent bubble burst, and the financial system proved dangerously fragile; only huge government bailouts prevented a total collapse."

These new cuts are in addition to a previously announced reduction of 7,500 jobs. The total job cuts work out to an elimination of about 20% of the drug company's worldwide workforce of 81,000 employees.

None of the job cuts have happened yet, said Merck spokeswoman Kelley Dougherty.

She also said the job cuts are unrelated to Obamacare, the health care plan championed by President Obama but opposed by Republicans in Congress.

""The actions we're announcing today are not driven by any present immediate issue,"" said Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier, in a webcast with analysts and journalists.

Merck (MRK) said the restructuring will result in a pre-tax costs of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. But the company also said it hopes the cuts will help it save about $2.5 billion annually by 2015.

Frazier, who was the company's lead counsel during its problems with the painkiller Vioxx, said that job cuts will be concentrated on selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as some research and development. But he insisted that the company will continue to focus on R&D.

""Our company is still committed to innovative R&D and bringing forward transformative products that make a difference in human health,"" he said.

He said that Merck's ""streamlining"" is ""not about stopping any activity. It's about being more efficient.""

A company press release said that Merck will focus on vaccines and treatments for cancer and diabetes in ""prioritized markets, which account for the majority of revenue in the pharmaceutical and vaccines business."" It identified these markets as the U.S. as well as Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China, Korea, Brazil and Russia.

Shares of Merck, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, were up 3%.

Drug companies are under constant pressure to discover promising new drugs to stock up their pipelines with potential blockbusters. The patent on one of Merck's more lucrative drugs, the asthma treatment Singulair, expired last year, eroding sales as the product is exposed to generic competition.

The company, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., also announced on Tuesday that its headquarters will be moved to its existing facilities in nearby Kenilworth, which is closer to New York City."

For the first time since the New Deal, a majority of Americans are headed toward a retirement in which they will be financially worse off than their parents, jeopardizing a long era of improved living standards for the nation’s elderly, according to a growing consensus of new research.

The Great Recession and the weak recovery darkened the retirement picture for significant numbers of Americans. And the full extent of the damage is only now being grasped by experts and policymakers.

There was already mounting concern for the long-term security of the country’s rapidly graying population. Then the downturn destroyed 40 percent of Americans’ personal wealth, while creating a long period of high unemployment and an environment in which savings accounts pay almost no interest. Although the surging stock market is approaching record highs, most of these gains are flowing to well-off Americans who already are in relatively good shape for retirement.

Liberal and conservative economists worry that the decline in retirement prospects marks a historic shift in a country that previously has fostered generations of improvement in the lives of the elderly. It is likely to have far-reaching implications, as an increasing number of retirees may be forced to double up with younger relatives or turn to social-service programs for support.

“This is the first time that Americans are going to be relatively worse off than their parents or grandparents in old age,” said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research.

Advocates for older Americans are calling on the federal government to bolster Social Security benefits or to create a new layer of retirement help for future retirees. Others want employers and the government to do more to encourage retirement savings and to discourage workers from using the money for non-retirement purposes.

But those calls have been overwhelmed by concern about the nation’s fast-growing long-term debt, which has left many policy­makers focused on ways to trim Social Security and other retirement benefits rather than increase them.

The economic downturn exacerbated long-term factors that were already eroding the financial standing of aging Americans: an inexorable rise in health-care costs, growing debt among older Americans and a shift in responsibility from employers to workers to plan for retirement.

The consequence is that the nation is facing a huge retirement savings deficit — as much as $6.6 trillion, or about $57,000 per household, according to a U.S. Senate report.

Using data on household finances collected by the Federal Reserve, the Center for Retirement Research estimates that 53 percent of American workers 30 and older are on a path that will leave them unprepared for retirement. That marks a sharp deterioration since 2001, when 38 percent of Americans were at risk of declining living standards in old age. In 1989, 30 percent faced that risk.

The center’s findings are similar to those recently uncovered by researchers at the New School, the Heritage Foundation and the Senate’s Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

“There is a mismatch between retirement needs rising and retirement benefits contracting,” said Alicia H. Munnell, director of Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research.

The precarious situation comes after a long period of change that improved life for the nation’s seniors starting with the enactment of Social Security in 1935.

By the 1960s, retirees also benefitted from universal health insurance through Medicare and Medicaid, sharp increases in Social Security benefits and new protections enacted by the federal government for workers who received traditional pensions, which for decades were a standard employee benefit.

The changes rescued millions of retirees from poverty, while lifting millions of others to prosperous retirements symbolized by vacation cruises, recreational vehicles and second homes.

But now problems for future retirees seem to be closing in from all sides. Half of American workers have no retirement plans through their jobs, leaving people on their own to save for old age.

Meanwhile, four out of five private-sector workers with retirement plans at work have only 401(k)-type defined contribution accounts, rather than traditional pensions that pay retirees a fixed benefit for life. Numerous studies have found that workers with defined-contribution accounts often put aside too little money, make too many withdrawals or employ the wrong investment strategies to save enough for old age. Overall, people ages 55 to 64 have a median retirement account balance of $120,000, Boston College researchers have found, which is enough to fund an annuity paying about $575 a month, far short of what they will need.

Officials at money-management firms that handle 401(k)-type investments argue that the tools are in place for Americans to retire comfortably. The problem, they say, is that employers and workers are not using them correctly.

Robert L. Reynolds, president and chief executive of Putnam Investments, noted that 2006 changes in federal law gave employers the power to automatically enroll workers in retirement accounts. But too few choose to do that and even when they do, companies typically set aside only 3 percent of pay — far less than the estimated 10 percent that experts say workers need to set aside to fund a sound retirement.

“I would be adamant that there is nothing wrong with 401(k)s that can’t be fixed by taking better advantage of the current system,” Reynolds said.

Daniel J. Houston, president of retirement, insurance and financial services at the Principal Financial Group, contended that defined contribution accounts are better tailored than old-fashioned pensions to today’s highly mobile workforce. Workers can take them when they switch jobs. But that control also is a weakness, allowing Americans to tap them for non-retirement purposes.

The retirement savings shortfall is revealing an economic divide separating those who are well prepared for retirement from those who are not. Recent policy changes aimed at bolstering Americans’ retirement prospects have only contributed to the growing inequality.

The government grants at least $80 billion a year in tax breaks to encourage retirement savings in 401(k)-type accounts. But the biggest benefits go to upper-income people who can afford to put aside the most for retirement, allowing them to reap the biggest tax breaks.

Someone making $200,000 a year and contributing 15 percent of pay to a retirement account would receive about a $7,000 subsidy from the federal government in the form of a tax break, whereas workers earning $20,000 making the same 15 percent contribution would get nothing because they don’t earn enough to qualify for a deduction. Someone making $50,000 and making the 15 percent contribution would receive only about a $2,100 tax deduction.

Even many of the diminishing share of workers who are enrolled in traditional pension programs face uncertainty as an increasing number of plans are under­funded, causing employers to freeze benefits.

The hits to retirement income come as many Americans are living longer and health-care costs continue to grow, meaning they need to salt away more money for retirement.

Workers have limited options for closing the gap. More are going to have to work longer. After many decades of decline, average retirement ages have already been creeping up in the past 20 years.

A recent survey by the Conference Board found that nearly two-thirds of Americans ages 45 to 60 say they plan to delay retirement. Two years earlier, 42 percent said they would work longer.

Some lawmakers and other advocates say the best way to cope with the growing gap would be to further expand Social Security and Medicare benefits, or to add another layer of taxpayer-subsidized savings that workers could use only for retirement.

“We need to do more to help American families cope with this looming retirement crisis,” Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said at a hearing late last month. “Hard­working Americans deserve to be able to rest, take a vacation and spend more time with their grandkids when they get older.”

But many policymakers are pushing to rein in the nation’s debt by trimming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits. Those programs are the primary drivers of the long-term deficit but are also financial mainstays for the vast majority of the nation’s retirees.

Both Medicare and Social Security already are on course to provide reduced benefits for future retirees — reductions that will grow deeper if lawmakers follow through on new proposals to further trim the programs.

With the Social Security retirement age moving to 67 under a federal law passed in 1983, people who leave the workforce earlier — and the vast majority do — will see smaller payouts.

Health-care costs continue to outpace inflation, meaning more out-of-pocket expenses for future seniors. Retirees are also slated to pay more for their health care with Medicare premiums, which are deducted from the Social Security checks of senior citizens, set to rise from 12.2 percent to 14.9 percent by 2030.

James G. Marzano, 60, was on his way to a comfortable retirement when he lost his job at a telecommunications firm in 2002. “People talk about a lost decade; that’s what I’ve been through,” he said.

Marzano, a Tampa resident who is married to a retail worker and has a son who is a high school senior, spent most of the past decade in and out of contract jobs and other posts that paid far less than he was used to. He was forced to dip into his 401(k) account to make ends meet, and even now that he has found a good job, he says, his savings is maybe 60 percent of what it was 10 years ago.

Annual federal deficits will continue to fall in the short term, the budget office reported in its yearly long-term outlook, because of the recent spending cuts in military and domestic programs and rising tax collections in a recovering economy. The report projected the deficit in 2015 to be equal to 2.1 percent of the economy’s output, or just one-fifth of the peak shortfall at the height of the recession in 2009.

But starting in 2016, deficits are projected to rise again as more baby boomers begin drawing from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security — the fast-growing entitlement programs, which Democrats and Republicans cannot agree on how to rein in.

The accumulating federal debt, which averaged 38 percent of the gross domestic product for the 40 years before the 2008 financial crisis, would rise from 73 percent of the G.D.P. now — above what most economists consider an optimum level — to at least 100 percent in 2038."

Washington (CNN) – Former President Bill Clinton, who sat in the Oval Office during the last government shutdown, supports President Barack Obama's refusal to negotiate with congressional Republicans and argues he should call their ""bluff"" as the government nears a possible shutdown and default.

""He could stop it, but the price of - the current price of stopping it is higher than the price of letting the Republicans do it and taking their medicine,"" he said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

Clinton went on to say that House Republicans, having realized they have little chance of pushing through legislative items their party wants, have dug in and scrapped any plans of negotiating. ""Give us what we want or we're going to shut the government down,"" Clinton said, describing how he sees the GOP strategy.

""I think under those circumstances, the president has to take the position he's taken,"" he continued. ""Which is 'You - not me - you voted to spend this money.' … You can't negotiate over that. And I think he's right not to.""

Obama has repeatedly vowed he won't bargain in the upcoming debt ceiling debate. If the debt ceiling isn't raised by October 17, the government won't be able to pay its bills.

Republicans frequently point to Clinton's tenure, when he negotiated with congressional Republicans over raising the debt ceiling in 1996.

But Clinton argued Sunday that was a different period in time, saying the negotiations then were ""extremely minor"" and the stakes at the time were not as large: ""The economy was growing and the deficit was going down.""

He said while he was criticized for agreeing to lower the capital gains tax during those negotiations, in return he got the children's health insurance program, which ultimately led to coverage for 10 million kids up through Obama's first term.

""That's what lawmaking is. It's that kind of compromise,"" he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's former communications director in the White House. ""There's no opportunity for that in this forum. We don't have enough time. They don't want - they're mad because they don't want to negotiate.""

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was at the helm of the House in the 1995-1996 showdowns, told CNN's Piers Morgan earlier this week that he was able to work with Clinton because the former president was able to ""compartmentalize,"" compared to Obama.

""It wasn't that we were friends, but we both understood that you had to find a way to work for America, even if as political rivals,"" said Gingrich, who's now a co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""We were little bit like two graduate students in that we would get in a room and we started talking and theorizing and remembering books and doing stuff. But in that process, you begin to get away from what you couldn't do and you begin to gradually work your way to what you could do.""

""My guess is that we spent more days together than Obama and (House Speaker John) Boehner has spent minutes together this year,"" he continued. ""The president has to come off with his high horse. Boehner has to also say they may now be able to get everybody in his party to vote for something.""

Clinton, however, encouraged Obama to stick to his stand.

""I think there are times when you have to call people's bluff,"" he said, according to a transcript of the interview.

Republicans have signaled they plan to attach a number of items – including tax reforms and provisions to roll back regulations on businesses - in the upcoming debt limit debate.

""If I were the president, I wouldn't negotiate over these draconian cuts that are going to take food off the table of low-income working people, while they leave all the agricultural subsidies in for high-income farmers and everything else. I just think it's - it's chilling to me,"" Clinton said."

Davidson Previously Was An Assistant City Editor At The Washington Post', 'A Washington', 'Foreign Correspondent With The Wall Street Journal', 'Where He Covered Federal Agencies', 'Political Campaigns.']",Federal workers could pay more for retirement benefits,"Much to the consternation of federal employees, the question has quickly moved from “if” to “how much.”

The subject is the hit on federal retirement benefits that could emerge from budget talks on Capitol Hill.

House and Senate negotiators on the Budget Conference Committee are working to resolve differences in their two spending plans by the end of the week. An announcement could come as early as Tuesday.

Federal employees and their supporters on the Hill hope the workers won’t be made to sacrifice more toward government savings — but hope is not the same as expectation.

“That’s really demoralizing for the federal workforce, who have done nothing to cause the financial mess we’re in,” said Jessica Klement, legislative director of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association.

Reports on how much will be sought have included workers paying an additional 5.5 percent of pay toward their retirement, saving the government $130 billion over 10 years. That’s been proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Budget Committee. Another proposal calls for the 1.2 percent increase in pension payments proposed by President Obama, for a savings of about $20 billion over 10 years. My colleague Lori Montgomery reports that Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, are considering another option, one that would require federal workers to come up with less than $17 billion.

Changing the formula for calculating annuities from the highest three years of pay to the highest five reportedly also is under consideration. The 2010 Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction report estimated that change would save $5 billion over 10 years.

Any amount is too much for federal employees.

“NTEU strongly opposes any further cuts in federal compensation, including what would be a pay cut resulting from an increase in pension contributions, and will continue its efforts to see that no further cuts are made,” said Colleen M. Kelley, president of theNational Treasury Employees Union.

“Going after federal employee wages yet again is insulting, demeaning and downright criminal,” said J. David Cox Sr., head of the American Federation of Government Employees. “It is disgraceful for elected officials to think that they can raid a fully funded retirement system to pay down a deficit that federal employees did not create.”

Proposals discussed so far would not take from current annuitants but would hit current employees — the same workers who have already contributed billions to help close the government’s deficit. Employees hired after 2012, however, would not pay more toward retirement under the president’s plan because they already pay its higher rate.

Along with federal employee organizations, members of the regional congressional delegation have been vigorous in their opposition to greater worker sacrifices.

“Over the last several years, federal employees — VA doctors and nurses, CIA, FBI and DEA agents and NIH researchers; and let’s not forget the victims of the recent shootings at the Navy Yard — have repeatedly been used as pawns in negotiations,” Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) complained in a letter last week to leaders of the budget committees. “To date, changes to pay and pensions for the federal workforce have already generated $113 billion in savings.”

The changes in pay, including the three-year freeze on federal employees’ basic pay rates, have led to the purchasing power of their pay falling by about 7 percent since 2010, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Murray does not favor an additional hit on federal workers, and Ryan’s office would not comment on why he thinks that’s okay.

Opposition to employees paying more has not been helped by the president. Obama’s plan to increase their out-of-pocket retirement contributions makes it more difficult for their supporters to argue for no increase.

In part because of that, and Ryan’s push to hit government employees again, there’s little reason for them to be optimistic about the budget process. They face the possibility of additional employee sacrifices through greater retirement contributions with no increase in benefits or continued sequestration budget cuts that could lead to layoffs.

Or “it could be both,” Klement said. “This is unacceptable to us.”

The truth is that many federal employees probably won’t have any choice but to accept what amounts to give-backs. In one form or another, and maybe in more ways than one, the budget agreement likely will make them give back money to their employer. Others, particularly the highly skilled and the highly talented, might choose to leave government, especially if they are eligible to retire.

In January, federal employees are scheduled to get a 1 percent raise. They should not make plans for that money, because an increase in retirement contributions could wipe it out.

Saying it is “dismayed” at the prospect of Congress increasing employee retirement contributions, the Federal-Postal Coalition, a group of more than 30 federal employee organizations, said Monday in a letter to the conference committee that “no other group of Americans has contributed to deficit reduction the way federal employees have.”

It’s a good argument, but it probably won’t stop Congress from telling feds they have to give and give again.

http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2011/07/obama-white-house-salaries-soar.html,,[],,"In his numerous fund-raising and policy speeches around the country these days, President Obama often bemoans the difficult economic times and uncertainties afflicting millions of Americans, including the nearly 14 million still seeking work unsuccessfully.

The Democrat argues that his administration needs more time to straighten out the economic mess left by somebody else, who's been gone almost 900 days now.

But good news this morning: The challenging Obama era and 9.1% national unemployment rate do not include the 454 people now helping President Obama do presidential things.

This crowd is being paid a total of $37,121,463 this year. That's up seven staff members and nearly $4 million from 2008, the last year of George W. Bush's presidency.

Fully 141 Obama aides -- or nearly one-in-three -- earn more than $100,000 a year. That's also up from the 130 with that scale salary in Bush's last year.

Twenty-one Obama aides earn the top-dollar $172,200.

The staff names and salaries report, required annually by Congress, was released on Friday by the White House. The timing, however, was probably an accident because last Friday most Americans were not watching the news closely and were thinking of not working for a three-day holiday weekend.

Because Americans would no doubt be pleased to know of the Obama staff's economic success amid the bleak national scene for so many others, we saved the information for today, when most Americans who are still employed are back at their own jobs and can share the joy.

The 2011 White House salary report does not include mention of the 41 unidentified Obama staff members who owe the Internal Revenue Service $831,000 in back taxes. That report came out last fall (Scroll down for the link.)

The report comes as Republicans and Democrats, led from behind by Obama, appear stalemated in closed-door negotiations over a package deal to raise the national debt limit by Aug. 2 and begin spending cuts to tame the $14.2-trillion national debt, up 35% since Obama's inauguration. Obama maintains a deal must include new revenues to cover the rising costs of government.

Having Chicago connections appears to be useful for obtaining the maximum $172,200 salary from the Illinois ex-state senator Obama, who is paid $400,000 a year, almost twice the amount paid to Joe Biden for doing whatever he does. But he's only from Delaware.

The top paychecks include:

Chief of Staff William Daley, who is the brother of Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, who just retired and left the top Democratic-machine job there to Rahm Emanuel, who was Obama's chief of staff and before that held the Chicago House seat of Rod Blagojevich, who had given it up to become governor of Illinois, which he no longer is due to impeachment and, now, conviction on 17 counts of fraud.

The Daleys' father, Richard J. Daley, was also a longtime Chicago mayor whose operatives provided Illinois' crucial electoral votes to elect John F. Kennedy president back in 1960 before Obama was born.

Valerie Jarrett has a White House title as long as Chicago's winters (senior advisor and assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs and public engagement). Before this, she was a chief of staff for the most recent Mayor Daley and hired an assistant named Michelle Robinson, who went on, of course, to become Mrs. Barack Obama, whose chief of staff also earns the top $172G paycheck.

This year, the one before Obama's attempted reelection, he reduced his staff by 15 people and $1.7 million.

Some White House aides have already returned to Chicago as campaign employees, including political strategist David Axelrod, who helped elect the most recent Mayor Daley, as well as, briefly, Sen. Obama and then President Obama. Axelrod also made the top salary when he had to live in Washington.

That prospect is not a source of Republican leverage in the debt-ceiling fight; it is the primary source of the Democrats’ leverage. It is a way to distract the press and the public from the reality of our fiscal crisis.

The Democrats’ strategy offers Republicans an opportunity. Since the Democrats insist that the prospect of default is the reason they will not negotiate about spending restraint, Republicans should begin the debt-ceiling fight by permanently eliminating that prospect, turning the debt-ceiling debate into an argument about future spending rather than past borrowing.

The House should pass a bill to redefine the debt limit so that it constrains primary spending but not debt service. Under this reform, a Treasury that had hit the statutory borrowing limit could continue to borrow what it needed exclusively for paying interest on the national debt and to roll over existing debt obligations, but it could not borrow for any other government spending until the limit had been increased. This would take default entirely off the table."

The good news is that the ordinary citizens nearby, who are not the press and who are not obligated to treat Randy Neugebauer Being An Asshole as quite literally just another day at the park, came to the Ranger's defense.



At that point, a crowd of onlookers got involved. ""Ask those questions of the people who aren't passing the budget,"" shouted a voice from the crowd. ""That's who you need to ask these questions to."" ""This woman is doing her job, just like me,"" shouted another. ""I'm a 30-year federal veteran -- I'm out of work.""

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-to-host-top-lawmakers-as-default-looms-160042194.html,,[],Chaos but optimism as Washington gropes toward a deal,"A postponed high-stakes meeting at the White House. A rescheduled closed-door gathering of Republican senators. Leaders of the bitterly divided Congress ducking into each others' offices. President Barack Obama, behind a table of bologna sandwiches, pressing lawmakers to forge an 11th-hour deal to spare the fragile economy from a potentially catastrophic debt default.

And from the chaos, growing optimism about a possible deal — even though it may just set the weary country up for another confrontation in only a few short months.

With the partial government shutdown entering its third week and the United States due to slam into the congressionally set debt ceiling in just days, top lawmakers and Obama sounded uncharacteristically hopeful Monday about an agreement to get back to business and avert a default.

Two Democratic Senate aides cautiously described the emerging deal as including a debt-ceiling hike that would last until Feb. 7 or 15, 2014, providing enough money to keep the government open until mid-January, and securing a commitment from all sides to launch comprehensive negotiations on the nation's finances.

Those broader budget discussions would not take the form of a supercommittee. (That ship has sailed — and sank.) Instead, negotiators from the Senate and House would meet to hash out differences on the budget — a “conference,” as called for under regular congressional procedure when the two chambers disagree. The conference would target an agreement by mid-December.

Democrats hoped those broader discussions would lead to some sort of compromise that would avert the next round of automatic, across-the-board “sequestration” spending cuts due to take effect in January.

Amid the frantic negotiations, the White House scheduled a 3 p.m. ET Oval Office meeting between Obama and the top GOP and Democratic leaders in Congress — then postponed it indefinitely, saying the president hoped to give lawmakers more time to reach a deal.

Story continues

Senate Republicans encountered their own scheduling snafu, first calling a 5:45 p.m. ET closed-door conference to discuss the possible agreement, and then putting it off until Tuesday to accommodate lawmakers not yet returned from their district.

Obama staged a photo-op visit to a local food bank, posing in a green apron with kids and furloughed government employees — and facing a symbolic struggle of his own, as polarized Washington leaders struggled to seal the deal.

“The Ziplock’s not zipping,” the president said, wrestling a sandwich into a plastic bag.

Obama told reporters that he hoped to use the White House talks to gauge “whether this progress is real.”

“And you know, my hope is that a spirit of cooperation will move us forward over the next few hours,” he said. The meeting was postponed not long afterward.

The postponed meeting would have included Republican House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Vice President Joe Biden was also due to attend.

The U.S. Treasury says the government will hit its debt ceiling Thursday, running out of the authority to borrow money to pay for existing programs and risking a debt default that experts warn will send shock waves through the fragile global economy.

“Not only is it untenable for us to continue this shutdown — this week if we don't start making some real progress both in the House and the Senate, and if Republicans aren't willing to set aside some of their partisan concerns in order to do what's right for the country, we stand a good chance of defaulting,” Obama warned. “And defaulting would have a potentially devastating effect on our economy, sending interest rates shooting up, [and] people — whether Social Security recipients or people with disabilities or small-business people who are vendors to government — not getting paid on time.”

“We've already had a damaging effect on our economy because of the shutdown,” the president added. “That damage would be greatly magnified if we don't make sure that the government's paying its bills, and that has to be decided this week.”

Reid and McConnell have been working behind the scenes to cobble together a deal, and a bipartisan group of 12 senators has been doing the same. Ultimately, though, the question is: How will the House GOP respond, with time already running short?



""We're getting closer,"" Reid told reporters after he met privately with McConnell.

The Republican leader agreed: ""We’ve had an opportunity to have some constructive exchanges of views on how to move forward. I share his optimism — we will get a result that will be acceptable to both sides.""

Several other lawmakers have sounded optimistic notes about getting a deal done quickly.

“I think we'll solve this problem over the next few days. I think today may be a very good day,” Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe.""

But Obama said he would keep pushing Congress “until the details are done.”

And the president appeared to refer to public opinion polls that have shown Republicans bearing the brunt of the blame for a shutdown that their tea party-affiliated rank and file triggered by demanding that the president accept some rolling back of his signature health care law, Obamacare.

“There's been some progress on the Senate side, with Republicans recognizing it's not tenable, it's not smart, it's not good for the American people to let America default,” he said."

That, says the Cato Institute’s Michael Tanner, would make more sense than what we do now – and, he says, we’d still have money left over.

Michael Tanner, CATO Institute senior fellow.

Here’s Tanner’s math: By his count, the federal government spends more than $668 billion a year on a total of 126 anti-poverty programs, including those that address housing, hunger, health care, and cash assistance. They range from TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families), which most people associate with traditional welfare, to much smaller programs for Indian tribes, at-risk youth, and others. If you divide Tanner’s total by the roughly 46 million people with incomes below the poverty line, you get nearly $15,000 for every poor man, woman, and child in the U.S.

Tanner acknowledges that poor individuals don’t receive that much money, and that’s his point: government spending isn’t laser-targeted to those most in need. In fact, he says, “throwing money at the problem has neither reduced poverty nor made the poor self-sufficient. It is time to re-evaluate our approach to fighting poverty.”

You’ve taken a fair amount of heat for saying that America should “focus less on making poverty more comfortable.” What do you mean by that? Is poverty ever comfortable?

Poverty is never a good thing. But most of the programs we have to combat poverty are based on taking people who are in poverty and giving them a little more income so their poverty doesn’t feel quite as bad. Instead, we should be focused on how to we get more people out of poverty.

What do you think we are doing wrong?

The problem is that our welfare programs aren’t targeted at the right things: education, pregnancy prevention, and job creation. They’re targeted at giving people who are poor the resources to live in poverty.

We know that if you drop out of high school you’re likely to be poor. If you graduate from college, your chances of escaping poverty are much greater.

We know that if you’re a woman, don’t get pregnant if you’re not married. That’s not a moral judgment, it’s an economic one. It’s simply more difficult to raise a child if you have one income rather than two.

And get a job, any job, even a low-wage job, and stick with it. Even a low-paying job is better than no job at all. People are more likely to move out of poverty if they have a low-paying job than if they are on welfare.

And we need to create more jobs. The fact is, we still have an anti-job atmosphere. Too many taxes, too many regulations. We don’t do a very good job of creating an environment that’s going to create more jobs.

What do we do about the millions of people who are in poverty right now? They are poor, they don’t have skills, they don’t have a good education, they don’t have or can’t get a job. Do we pull the safety net out from under them?

We should target our aid to those people who need the help the most. We have created a situation in which there are a certain number of people who are not going to be able to become an economically viable family unit anytime soon, and we probably have to support them in the short term. In the long term, however, we want to give people in the future more of an opportunity to avoid poverty and to get out of poverty.

It’s unfair to compare my approach to utopia. Let’s compare it to the real world and in the real world, the approach I’m talking about would mean fewer poor people than there are today. Would there be zero? No. I don’t know if a society in the history of the world has ever had zero. Poverty in many ways is the natural condition of man. Throughout most of mankind’s history, most people were poor. The question is, how do you create more prosperity?

People on my side of this have often appeared to be hard-hearted, by arguing on a dollars-and-cents basis. But you shouldn’t measure compassion by inputs. You measure by outcomes. And by that measure, we’re failing. And the burden is on the poor, who are the ones suffering in poverty.

So you think it would be more compassionate to blow up and restructure the system?

It’s not fun to live in poverty. Poor people don’t want to be poor. Most poor people would like to work. Most poor people would like to be non-poor. But we’re not giving them that opportunity. The goal should be that each person gets to achieve their full potential. Most people trapped in the welfare system are not getting to do that.

It was Ronald Reagan who said, we fought a war on poverty and poverty won. Do you agree with that?

Let’s put it this way: We are certainly not beating poverty. We may have had a draw but that’s not where we want to be.

Lawmakers can't seem to agree on anything these days. Except ... sugar? Here's how a relatively small industry manages to win big in Washington. (The Washington Post)

Washington politicians facing a year-end deadline to cut billions in agriculture spending are feuding over the future of food aid for the poor and crop subsidies for farmers.

There is, however, one area of agreement in the contentious negotiations: sugar.

Lawmakers decided to preserve the decades-old government safety net that boosts profits for a relatively small group of growers and has cost consumers billions through artificially high prices.

The special protection is a testament to the enduring Washington clout of one of the country’s wealthiest farming interests, including the politically connected Florida family that controls a substantial share of the world’s sugar market.

Sugar makers succeeded by gaining the support of a wildly divergent collection of lawmakers — rural and urban, tea party and liberal — who have little in common other than the presence of sugar operations in their states.

The industry doles out generous campaign contributions that outstrip those from other agriculture sectors. Its leaders have forged personal ties with senior lawmakers, congressional staffers and high-ranking officials in the executive branch.

A pivotal player is the Fanjul family of Palm Beach, Fla., which commands the world’s biggest refining operation, owns the ubiquitous brands Domino and C&H, and raises millions of dollars for politicians from both parties.

Sugar-beet farmers in the upper Midwest, responsible for about half of the country’s sugar production, have also enhanced the industry’s clout, funding political action committees and leaning on home-state lawmakers from a dozen states.

House and Senate negotiators, after months of struggling, are rushing to reach a farm-bill deal as early as this coming week. The talks have been stymied by rancor over how deeply to cut food benefits for millions of poor Americans and how to curb subsidies for hundreds of thousands of farmers.

Big candymakers and food manufacturers such as Hershey, Mars and Kraft — whose costs rise with sugar prices — waged a lobbying campaign to put sugar on the farm-bill casualty list as well.

But sugar has already won.

Wide range of support

The industry’s power was evident in the unusual alliances that formed in the House and Senate to thwart sugar-related measures over the past two years, turning ideological adversaries such as Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) into teammates operating from the same playbook.

“Removing the protections we have for our domestic sugar producers will do nothing but kill an American industry and outsource jobs to our competitors,” Franken said during a Senate floor debate this spring. Rubio, in the same debate, warned colleagues of the “risks to American jobs if reforms to our sugar program were to pass.”

The program, which has existed in various forms since the Great Depression, uses an elaborate system of import quotas, price floors and taxpayer-backed loans designed to prop up domestic growers, which number about 4,500.

Industry officials and their allies in Congress say the sugar program is needed to protect producers from a world market heavily distorted by subsidies from Brazil, Mexico and other major exporters. Without the program, the industry says, the U.S. economy would lose tens of thousands of jobs and become dependent on foreign sources to meet the nation’s sugar needs.

“It clearly is in the national interest to defend efficient American farmers against subsidized foreign producers,” said Jack Roney, an economist for the American Sugar Alliance, the Washington trade group whose primary mission is defending the sugar program.

Roney said lawmakers have supported the program because of its limited price to taxpayers. The industry has used the slogan “cost-free” as a mantra for years, and sugar backers in Congress frequently adopt it in their floor speeches and conversations with colleagues.

Still, the program does come at a cost. Government and academic studies, often disputed by the sugar industry, have estimated that elevated prices have cost foodmakers and consumers at least $1.9 billion a year.

In addition, taxpayers are on the hook for government loans that companies can choose to pay back in the form of excess sugar instead of cash and interest if prices drop below a certain point. That happened in fiscal 2013 for the first time in more than a decade, costing taxpayers $278 million in direct expenditures to sugar companies.

This year, a well-heeled coalition of sugar-using companies stepped up their lobbying efforts to portray the program as costly to consumers and American workers. Newly elected tea party conservatives vowing to crusade against government meddling in free markets also provided fresh potential support.

“You would have thought that this would have been the year for reform,” said Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Pa.), whose state is home to Hershey and who sponsored measures to roll back sugar support. But, he added, “we were up against a force.”

Liberal sugar advocates included Franken, whose state is home to a large concentration of sugar-beet farmers, along with Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) and Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), whose home areas include Fanjul-controlled refineries.

Nearly the entire Florida delegation — from Rubio, a potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate, to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee — voted to keep sugar protections in place.

Strong support has come from House conservatives, as well, including Rep. Michael K. Conaway (R-Tex.), chairman of a key agriculture subcommittee.

“The sugar guys win votes because they are better at politics than anyone else,” said one lobbyist who is close to sugar executives and requested anonymity to discuss industry thinking. “What other interest group in town do you know that can consistently draw support from hard-core conservatives, ethnic liberals and cost-conscious moderates?”

Campaign spending

The industry is tiny in comparison to other agricultural commodities, but it outspends all other crop sectors combined on political-action-committee contributions to federal candidates. Sugar interests have spent $49 million on federal campaign donations and lobbying over the past five years.

On average, sugar farmers and employees gave more than five times as much money to members of Congress who sided with the industry than to members who did not, according to an analysis of key votes conducted for The Washington Post by the Center for Responsive Politics.

The Fanjuls are the most influential of the growers, according to lawmakers and lobbyists, exerting pressure through political fundraising and personal connections that belie their low public profile.

The family patriarchs, José “Pepe” Fanjul and Alfonso “Alfy” Fanjul, built their empire after fleeing the regime of Fidel Castro, which seized the family’s sugar business in Cuba after coming to power in 1959. Now the brothers grow and process cane sugar on 160,000 acres they own in Florida. Their holdings include refineries in Baltimore, New York, Louisiana and California, and plants in Mexico, Belize and Europe. They control much of the Dominican Republic’s sugar production.

They have also built an unusually broad power base on Capitol Hill. Pepe has donated and raised millions for Republicans; Alfy has done the same for Democrats.

“They come to Washington often, meet quietly with individual members, usually without staff present,” said the lobbyist close to industry executives.

Their high-level access drew rare public notice in the 1990s when Monica Lewinsky described a phone call to the Oval Office from Alfy during one of her private encounters with President Bill Clinton. Under the George W. Bush administration, White House officials expended effort trying to mollify the Fanjuls, who were personally persuading members of Congress to oppose a free-trade pact with sugar-producing Caribbean nations.

Rubio paid tribute to the Fanjuls in his autobiography, crediting Pepe and his wife for a “crown jewel” fundraising event and for hosting a dinner on his boat to introduce Rubio to former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Pepe Fanjul hosted a series of fundraisers for Rubio in March of this year, including a $10,000-per-person dinner at his Palm Beach estate.

Gaston Cantens, a lobbyist for the Fanjuls, said the brothers advocate for their business just as any industry executives would.

Political friendships are built over many years, Cantens said, and do not always result in the family getting what it wants. He said the family supported Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a Cuban American conservative who voted this year to roll back the sugar program.

In addition to the Fanjuls, the industry has retained a core of lobbyists, experts and other advocates that could “fill a stadium,” as one lobbyist put it. Former congressman and House Agriculture Committee chairman Larry Combest (R-Tex.) and former committee deputy chief of staff Tom Sell run a lobbying firm that represents sugar interests.

Independent cane and beet growers from Louisiana and the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota fly to Washington regularly to walk the halls of Congress and make the case for sugar, emphasizing that the program helps family-owned farms stay in operation.

“These guys are disciplined, they know the arguments, and they are organized,” said Rep. Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.), the ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. His district includes the country’s largest concentration of sugar-beet farmers.

As a rule, the industry meets with every incoming freshman member of a new Congress. This year the list included Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), elected in 2012 on a tea party platform.

Yoho quickly gained national recognition for, among other things, pressing House Republicans to cut deeply into farm bill programs such as food stamps.

But on sugar subsidies, the livestock veterinarian said he has grown to support the industry view. He is sponsoring a sugar-backed resolution that favors giving up the sugar program only when other countries end their subsidies.

“I ran on limited government, fiscal responsibility and free enterprise,” Yoho said, “but when you’ve got programs that have been in place and it’s the accepted norm, to just go in there and stop it would be detrimental to our sugar growers.”

She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of “Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pot in America.” She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000.

(CNN) —

After the vote in the House of Representatives to slash the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, I wrote a column against cutting food stamps. This column generated more than 5,200 online comments and hundreds of e-mails.

Comments reflected, not surprisingly, the tone and tenor of the political debate: a lot of partisan passion, some mutual understanding, animosity based on stereotypes and a lot of misinformation.

I would like to address some of the typical concerns that were expressed.

For example, “Willis CurryFans” wrote, “These wealthy Republicans spend a lot of time RUNNING from the typical black person this affects. If they came and visited some of these neighborhoods, they would see folks that they KNOW they won’t give a job to.”

JUSTIN LAROSE/cnn Donna Brazile

But who are the people using food stamps? They’re us.

The Census Bureau, which gathers statistics house by house, reports that Americans on food stamps are 49% white, 26% African-American and 20% Hispanic. The Pew Research Center, a nonprofit polling firm, found in a July survey that self-identified liberals, moderates and conservatives who receive food stamps are in a statistical tie.

A lot of people who commented on the column wanted to regulate what foodstuffs program participants can buy – often not realizing that alcohol and prepared foods are banned. And many respondents bashed food stamp recipients, declaring they should “get a job,” “stop having kids on my dime” or giving a variation on such cliches.

“Chiefpr” writes to one reader who’s been out of work: “Get training to better yourself and DO NOT have kids until you can feed them. But do not demand I do all that and support you …”

But the truth refutes the cliches: Feeding America says participation in SNAP, or the food stamp program, “historically follows unemployment with a slight lag.”

Unemployment increases food stamp rolls, not people with children who go looking for aid.

And unemployment has been abnormally high because of the recession that began under the previous president. In fact, USA Today found that “under President George W. Bush, the number of recipients rose by nearly 14.7 million. Nothing before comes close to that.”

With employment increasing, “the Congressional Budget Offices projects SNAP participation to begin declining in 2015.”

Shaun Kirkpatrick commented: “There was a work requirement for welfare. Bill Clinton did that during his welfare reform that most working people applauded. To make sure he got the votes and make Republicans look greedy and evil, Obama removed the work requirement …” Kirkpatrick’s perception is prevalent on the Web.

But that information comes from a 2012 Mitt Romney political ad that got it dead wrong. Obama actually encouraged the states to strengthen their work requirements. Also, of course, welfare is not the same as food stamps.

As for food stamps, more than 72% of all SNAP beneficiaries are families with children. Most of the recipients are children (48%), the elderly (8%) and the disabled. Less than 10% of food stamp recipients receive welfare payments.

“John in WNY” wrote, “Yes, many do work, but many of them make sure they never make enough to lose their benefits …”

Again, the facts refute the assumption.

SNAP has strict time limits for unemployed workers: Able-bodied adults without children can only get three months worth of food stamps in a three-year period, unless working in a qualifying job training program.

And how much are the benefits, anyway?

The average monthly SNAP benefit per person is $133.85, or less than $1.50 per person per meal. Those benefits are low, and for many families, SNAP benefits don’t last the whole month.

Why do we need to support the food stamp program?

Because low-income families experience unemployment at a far higher rate than other income groups. Because cutting nutritional assistance programs is immoral and shortsighted and protecting families from hunger improves their health and educational outcomes. Food stamps are an investment in our future.

Being on food stamps can be demeaning.

Cashiers know the difference between the new plastic SNAP cards and a credit card. Some food stamp recipients say some cashiers have made them feel uncomfortable and embarrassed.

Maybe we should focus on rewards rather than punishments. Behavioral psychologists say that’s more effective.

Why not add benefits for making healthy food choices, provide a transition bonus for getting off food stamps or increase job training opportunities and income – raising minimum wage?

Doing so takes courage, compassion and believing in “We, the people.”

Not long ago, this was considered an unlikely outcome.

Republicans in the House, trying to force Obama to accept deep cuts, had come close to shutting down the government before and appeared primed to do so again.

But House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has united his rambunctious majority ever so tenuously around a strategy that, for now, sets aside the cycle of crisis politics to aim for long-range objectives.

Not only did lawmakers hold their fire to approve the legislation, they did so ahead of schedule — without the midnight-hour brinkmanship that has come to characterize Congress and its dealings with the White House.

That let politicians slip past a crucial fiscal deadline without damaging their reputations or the economy. The bill, which needs to become law by Wednesday, keeps the government open through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. The parties agreed to continue the deep “sequester” cuts, but lawmakers found common cause and created bipartisan coalitions to lessen the effects on their favored programs.

When Republicans in the House shifted money to ensure embassies are secured and the Border Patrol stays at full force, the Democrats who control the Senate obliged.

Senators, meanwhile, reached across the aisle to craft amendments to keep meat inspectors on the job, fund a tuition assistance program for service members and spare a few thousand children from child-care cuts. The Republican-led House did not flinch, though Boehner did need Democratic votes to get it over the finish line.

This display of pragmatic governing, however, may be fleeting. The deal Boehner made with his party’s conservative majority also sets up the next clash.

Even as the House voted Thursday to fund the government for the next six months, Republicans also pushed through an austere budget plan that would balance revenue and spending in 10 years. Drafted by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the former vice presidential nominee, the proposal would overhaul Medicare and the social safety net, while dropping taxes for the wealthy and corporations.

In the Senate, Democrats are expected to approve their own 10-year budget plan Friday that goes in the opposite direction. Democrats want wealthier Americans and corporations to pay more to lower the deficit while investing some new revenue in transportation, education and public employees to create jobs.

“Even though we got two political parties with competing ideologies, the American people expect us to find common ground,” Boehner said Thursday.

In the Senate, Democrats have shown little interest in negotiating as Republicans have used almost every procedural weapon to push an agenda in stark contrast to one advocated by Obama.

Hostage-taking, as the White House has called the GOP approach, has its limits, and polls show voters agree.

Earlier this year, at a tony retreat in Williamsburg, Va., Boehner tapped Ryan, along with the House’s top conservatives, to engineer a strategy that could provide a more measured approach to the Republican goals.

Advertisement

The outcome has become known as the Williamsburg accord. The House GOP would fast-forward past day-to-day battles — such as keeping the government running — to a more lofty one: approval of a balanced budget.

“It is the primary reason that I ran for Congress, and I think it is the defining issue and the most critical argument of our day,” said freshman Rep. Chris Stewart, a Republican from Utah, as he urged his colleagues this week to vote for the GOP budget.

Boehner’s accord with his restive troops is fragile and could come undone, particularly as patience among the most conservative Republicans wears thin.

In a matter of months, Washington will face its next deadline, when Congress will be asked to raise the federal debt limit, an essential step to avoid a default that could have serious economic ramifications.

Advertisement

Tea-party-aligned deficit hawks want to use the limit, which will be reached May 18, as leverage to pressure the White House to negotiate on an overhaul of Medicare, Medicaid and other safety net programs.

“Some people in this conference believe that the plan is just to pass the Paul Ryan budget,” said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), a conservative. “My goal is not to pass a meaningless document by itself, unless we actually implement the policies that will get us to a 10-year balance.”

But conversations on making that happen, Boehner acknowledged, have just begun.

“At this point in time,” he said, “I don’t know how we go forward.”

The threat of a government shutdown starting on Tuesday appeared more real as the clock ticked and Congress remained split on the contents of a temporary spending measure.

At risk is Friday's release of the monthly jobs report, one of the most-widely watched pieces of economic data.

Bureau of Labor Statistics' commissioner Erica Groshen has indicated that it might not be possible to release the data, because the agency will ""suspend all operations"" during a shutdown and its ""staff will be furloughed.""

She said all surveys will ""cease"" and the ""website will not be updated.""

Investors will have to deal with more uncertainty and ""fewer guide posts"" on the economy, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.

Uncertainty over the shutdown cast a pall over markets last week, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 down over 1% for the week. It was the first losing week of the month for both indexes, which had recently hit record highs. The Nasdaq managed a slight gain.

Private jobs data: Investors will have to whet their appetite on the state of U.S. employment via private researchers such as payroll processor ADP's report on Wednesday, followed by the Challenger job cuts report on Thursday.

The government's September employment report, if it is released on Friday, is expected to show a gain of 180,000 jobs in the month. Economists surveyed by Briefing expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 7.3%.

Other economic reports: Other government reports are also in jeopardy in a shutdown. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release reports on construction and factory orders this week. Spokeswoman Sarah Horowitz said the department would not release economic indicators in the event of a shutdown.

Europe: Investors will also get a peek at how the European economy is weathering the austerity measures via the Eurozone unemployment report, due out Tuesday.

Asia: The Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be closed on Tuesday, while the Shanghai Stock Exchange is closed from Tuesday to Friday for a National Day celebration.

Obamacare launches: Back in the U.S., despite congressional Republicans' efforts to block the law, the Obamacare health insurance exchange markets for individuals are set to open Tuesday."

The sequester was supposed to be something new in Washington: a budget cut you couldn’t beat. Once it hit, it hit. The money was gone, and nobody could get it back.

That turned out to be true — for about three weeks. Then somebody beat it.

Last week, President Obama signed a spending bill that gave the Agriculture Department’s food inspectors what everybody else wanted: a get-out-of-the-sequester card. Their program got $55 million in new money, which replaced almost all of what the sequester took.

There’s a story there, about how power and lobbying can still make money appear in Washington, even in this age of austerity. It started with sharp political theater.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack insisted that the sequester would force him to shut down all U.S. meat production on at least 11 days.

View Graphic How sequestration will impact federal departments

The inspectors union didn’t believe that. Neither did many in the powerful meat lobby. But they were too worried not to help Vilsack anyway. After an extensive campaign, the Senate gave Vilsack the money.

So the sequester can be hacked. Now, other interest groups are waiting: police officers, airport executives, Border Patrol agents. The question is: Can it be hacked again?

“It is those who make the most noise that sometimes succeed,” said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who failed in his push to exempt small air traffic control towers from the effects of the sequester. “I thought I’d made a lot of noise,” Moran said. Until he saw he had lost and the meat lobby and Vilsack had won.

This was not, of course, the way sequestration was supposed to turn out. Back in 2011, it was designed to exempt some areas of government: welfare, food stamps, Social Security, veterans programs. But where it cut, it was supposed to cut like a razor, clean and even:

Defense programs lose 7.3 percent across the board. Non-

defense spending programs lose 5.1 percent.

Nobody could get out. Because then, everybody would want out. And the sequester was meant to force a gridlocked Washington to come up with something else.

“We need a big fix. And once you start making everybody happy, you lose the leverage in a negotiation” for a bigger deal, said a Republican aide in the House, speaking anonymously to explain the GOP leadership’s thinking. The even spreading of the pain “was the whole point of sequestration to begin with,” the aide said.

Of course, Washington is not a place where people sit back and accept equal treatment. Since sequestration began taking effect on March 1, some programs have lobbied for little victories, taking a bigger piece of their department’s smaller pie.

Corrections officers persuaded the Justice Department to shift more money their way, eliminating the threat of furloughs. The Pentagon found $10.4 billion, so furloughs for civilian employees were reduced. But none of them got Congress to give them money to replace what the sequester took. That trick was pulled off, somehow, by the workers who inspect animal carcasses.

The campaign to do it began in early February, when the sequester was still weeks away. Earlier than many other Cabinet secretaries, Vilsack began describing in detail how badly his department would be hit.

“In our food safety area . . . we will have to furlough workers for a period of a couple of weeks,” Vilsack said, speaking to an agriculture industry conference in Las Vegas. “The problem is, as soon as you take an inspector off the floor, that plant shuts down.”

He had details: There could be $10 billion in lost production and more than $400 million lost worker wages. Diners would be affected, too; beef and poultry would get scarcer. “Food safety could be compromised,” he said.

In the world of meat, people took notice. But a lot of them thought Vilsack was stretching the truth.

Even the meat inspectors’ union doubted he would make good on the promise of shutting plants down. Federal law requires the Agriculture Department to provide inspectors when a plant is running. A budget cut is not a valid excuse to stop, said Trent Berhow, an official with the inspectors union. “If the federal government truly did put the inspectors out of the plant, the industry would sue the hell out of them,” he said.

But Vilsack kept insisting, although he reduced the number of possible furlough days from 15 to 11. In a House hearing, lawmakers tried to get him to admit there were other, less drastic alternatives. Couldn’t he cut other costs instead? Couldn’t he furlough inspectors one region at a time, instead of nationwide?

No, Vilsack said. The sequester law tied his hands. There was one solution: “Just give us the resources,” he said.

“That’s not the option, Mr. Secretary, as you well know,” said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).

“Well, see, now, that’s a choice you all are making, all right?” Vilsack said.

His strategy worked. The union — although still skeptical — began urging that the furloughs be prevented. The meat industry also began to worry. What if Vilsack really did pull the inspectors and shut the plants?

Living animals would start backing up, unable to be slaughtered on schedule. They would consume extra feed, extra space, extra money.

“We had accused the secretary of using America’s cattlemen and women as pawns in his political wrangling of Congress,” said Chase Adams of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. “We still stand by that.”

But despite that, the cattlemen started to advocate for Vilsack’s cause. So he succeeded?

“There, you got us,” Adams said. “Because that’s it. He got what he wanted.”

The effort was joined by the National Chicken Council, the National Turkey Federation and the American Meat Institute, heavyweights of one of Washington’s powerful agriculture lobbies. In the Senate, their cause was picked up by two influential senators from strongly agricultural states: Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).

Those two found a solution: $55 million in new money that had been meant for other Agriculture Department programs. Blunt and Pryor wrote an amendment that would give it, instead, to the meat inspection program. This was sequester-proofing. After the sequester took its cut, the meat-inspection program would be left with almost as much money as it had before.

They built support in the Senate. They checked with the House to make sure that GOP leaders would go along with the idea there. It all worked. “Fortunately, chickens know no political boundaries,” said one Democratic aide involved in that process.

Finally, the day came. The victory — like most in the backroom-dealing Senate — appeared utterly undramatic when it happened.

“All those in favor say ‘Aye,’ ” said Sen. William “Mo” Cowan (D-Mass.). There was a chorus of ayes. “The amendment is agreed to.” Last week, after Obama signed the bill, the Agriculture Department passed the good news to the inspectors: The furloughs won’t happen. There will be meat.

Now, leaders in both houses of Congress insist that no more exceptions will be made. But a number of other interest groups believe they will be the next. “We’re going to keep fighting with our friends on the Hill to find a solution,” said Spencer Dickerson, executive director of the U.S. Contract Tower Association. “Aviation safety shouldn’t be politicized.”

His cause is the same as Kansas’s Sen. Moran: 149 control towers at small and medium-size airports that the Federal Aviation Administration announced it will shutter. It has lost out, so far — partly because the administration says it wants a long-term solution, not just a short-term stay of execution for these towers.

U.S. Park Police officers, facing 14 days of furloughs, are also hoping to get themselves protected. Their union is seeking $5 million, far less than the meat inspectors.

They don’t have a powerful lobby behind them. But now they know it can be done.

“The only thing we can do is try to get our message out to members of Congress to fund us, like they funded the other agencies that got a break,” said Ian Glick, the union’s chairman.

http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/getting-to-tax-reform/,2013-05-28 00:00:00,['Bruce Bartlett'],Getting to Tax Reform,"Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of “The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform – Why We Need It and What It Will Take.”

In recent weeks, the odds favoring tax reform in the not-too-distant future have improved somewhat.

Today's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.

The improving deficit means that tax reform need not raise net revenues, as President Obama has demanded ; the controversy about aggressive tax avoidance by Apple and other multinational companies has focused Congress’s attention on a key goal of tax reform, which is fixing the multinational tax regime; and the furor over the Internal Revenue Service and accusations that it targeted conservative groups almost certainly means there will be bipartisan legislation to make sure this doesn’t happen again, thus providing a legislative vehicle for tax reform.

What is missing, unfortunately, is the outline of an actual tax reform bill. Some progress, however, has been made.

The Joint Committee on Taxation has recently published a 568-page report on various tax reform options based on the work of House Ways and Means Committee working groups. The committee has even released draft tax reform legislation involving financial derivatives, small businesses and the international sector.

The Senate Finance Committee has released a number of tax reform options papers related to family taxation, business investment and innovation, international competitiveness and other topics. Many insiders also believe that the recently announced retirement of the committee’s chairman, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, improves the prospects for tax reform because his precarious position as a Democrat from a heavily Republican state limited his ability to lead a contentious debate on the subject.

Almost everyone agrees that the ultimate goal of tax reform should be to lower statutory tax rates and that it should be revenue-neutral, that is, neither raising nor lowering net federal revenues over some reasonable time period. This will require the elimination of many tax expenditures benefiting both individuals and businesses.



But at present, no one has put a single specific, significant tax expenditure on the table for elimination, and that is the rub. The tax reform bills that have been introduced thus far are mostly grandiose, utopian plans to completely replace the entire tax system; they have no chance whatsoever of enactment.

In public discussions of tax reform, commentators and politicians tend to blithely assume that all tax expenditures are equivalent to tax loopholes – illegitimate provisions of the tax code that benefit only special interests. But as I have explained previously, all of the really large tax expenditures benefit broad segments of the population or are regarded as legitimate components of the federal tax system that serve vital national interests, like home ownership, helping people save for retirement or providing them with health insurance.

To be sure, many tax loopholes cannot be defended. But they tend to be small and do not provide much revenue to pay for more than a trivial reduction in tax rates.

One problem for tax reformers is the disparate impact of specific tax deductions on different people. For starters, only about a third of tax filers itemize; the rest use the standard deduction. Among those that itemize, those with high incomes are much more likely to do so than those with more modest incomes. This fact is illustrated in the following table from a recent Congressional Research Service report.

Moreover, use of certain deductions depends on one’s income. For example, the very wealthy get little value from the mortgage interest deduction because the law limits it to mortgages of less than $1 million. But the wealthy are much more likely to use the charitable contributions deduction and to deduct large amounts. The average charitable deduction for those with incomes above $1 million was almost $140,000 in 2010.

Consequently, ending or restricting particular deductions will have very different economic and distributional effects at different income levels. Some of these effects are reviewed in a May 21 report from the Congressional Research Service.

The report notes that the most commonly discussed option for raising revenue by restricting itemized deductions wouldn’t abolish them entirely but would limit their availability in some way. The total amount of deductions claimed could be limited by a dollar amount, they could be limited to a certain percentage of income, there could be floors that allow deductions only over a certain amount and various other schemes.

One problem is that phasing out deductions in some way creates disincentives equivalent to raising marginal tax rates. According to the report, simply eliminating all itemized deductions would be equivalent to raising the top income tax rate by 4.4 percentage points. Eliminating the deductions for state and local taxes or for charitable contributions is equivalent to raising the top rate by 2.2 percentage points.

This means that even if statutory rates are simultaneously reduced, there may not be any reduction in effective marginal tax rates, depending on what deductions are restricted or eliminated and how it is done. Only careful analysis can determine the net impact of any particular proposal.

This is why it is essential to have a detailed tax reform plan to analyze. Vague talk about broadening the tax base and lowering statutory tax rates is insufficient to guide legislation. And it takes more time than most people imagine to work through all the effects of various tax reforms, especially when many provisions of the tax code are being changed simultaneously that may move in opposite directions, economically.

Thus far, the Obama administration has been disengaged from the tax reform effort. But if it is going to happen, this must change. That is one lesson of previous tax reform efforts in 1969, 1976 and 1986, all of which were guided into enactment by strong Treasury Department leadership."

James Hamilton's claim the United States is in a much deeper financial hole than many realize comes as Congress gets ready for another budget battle when lawmakers return in September. Both sides have been digging in on their policy positions over the debt, spending and the country's future fiscal health.

Hamilton believes the government is miscalculating what it owes by leaving out certain unfunded liabilities that include government loan guarantees, deposit insurance, and actions taken by the Federal Reserve as well as the cost of other government trust funds. Factoring in those figures brings the total amount the government owes to a staggering $70 trillion, he says.

Hamilton believes important areas of federal off-balance-sheet commitments include loans for post-high school education, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve System.

“The biggest off-balance-sheet liabilities come from recognition of the fiscal stress that will come in the form of an aging population and rising medical expenditures,” Hamilton says, adding, “It is worth noting that there are many historical episodes in which off-balance sheet liabilities ended up having quite significant on-balance sheet implications.”

For example, he says, fiscal problems stemming from the saving and loans crisis from the 1980s.

“Losses at these institutions ended up dwarfing the capabilities of the now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to honor its promise to guarantee depositors,” he says.

The final on-balance-sheet cost to taxpayers honoring those guarantees came out to $124 billion.

Hamilton isn’t the first economist to say the government understates how much it owes. Claims that the real liability facing the government is $70 trillion date back several years.

David Walker, former U.S. Comptroller and CEO of the Comeback America Initiative, made similar claims in 2012. Walker’s calculations include unfunded Social Security, Medicare and retiree pension promises.

Boston economists Laurence Kotlikoff and Scott Burns warned in a 2008 Forbes article about what could happen if the government doesn’t curb its spending.

“The earthquake will come via a collapse in the market for U.S. government bonds as domestic and foreign investors realize that the only way Uncle Sam can meet his future spending obligations is to print massive quantities of money,” they said. “The result will be sky-high inflation and interest rates and, most surely, a prolonged reduction in output and employment. This could happen today. It could happen tomorrow. But it will happen here just as it has happened in every other country that tried to spend far beyond its ability to pay.”"

The two leaders spent much of Saturday discussing the issue, which has gained prominence in recent months as private security firms and U.S. officials have become increasingly willing to speak publicly about alleged Chinese activities.

White House National Security Adviser Tom Donilon said the issue was ""at the center of the relationship"" between the two countries.

""It is not an adjunct issue,"" he said. ""It's an issue that is very much on the table at this point.""

Donilon said much of the discussion was focused on the theft of intellectual property -- a prime concern of the U.S. business community.

""It's quite obvious now that the Chinese senior leadership understand clearly the importance of this issue to the United States,"" Donilon said.

China has consistently denied any involvement in cyberattacks.

Xi said at a press conference Friday that China has itself been the victim of cyberattacks, but expressed optimism about working with the U.S. on the issue.

But no firm commitments on cyber-related issues were secured at the conference. Instead, the leaders announced a joint effort to combat climate change.

The United States has recently adopted a new strategy for combating what officials see as a persistent threat to the American military and economy: It has started naming China -- and its armed forces -- as the source of cyberattacks that pilfer military, trade and industry secrets.

The change in tactics follows years of virtual silence from American officials on the issue. The government's claims have been bolstered by a growing chorus of security firms and companies who say they have been attacked by Chinese hackers.

The New York Times and Wall Street Journal have said they were hacked. Cybersecurity firm Mandiant said it has traced other attacks to a Chinese military unit. A second security firm, Kaspersky Lab, fingered a China-based cyber-espionage group that has attacked more than 350 victims in 40 countries.

China is not the only country believed to be involved in cyberattacks. The existence of several other state-sponsored cyberweapons has also been reported in recent years, with names like Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame. The U.S. government is widely believed to have played a role in developing some of those viruses, with an eye toward containing Iran."

Now, as President Obama has observed, the nation is divided by a different threat: widening income inequality. He could respond much as Mr. Johnson did — with an executive order aimed, this time, at raising the pay of millions of poorly paid employees of government contractors.

Recent studies have shown how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts, grants, loans, concessions and property leases currently flow to companies that pay low wages and provide few if any benefits, even as executive pay among federal contractors has risen. In effect, tax dollars are being used to fuel the low-wage economy and, in the process, worsen inequality.

This research has been underscored by a recent complaint filed with the Labor Department by Good Jobs Nation, a group representing low-wage workers employed under federal concession agreements. The complaint alleges that food franchises operating at federal buildings in the District of Columbia have ignored minimum-wage and overtime laws. The group has also organized walkouts by low-wage workers of vendors licensed to operate at Smithsonian museums, actions that have dovetailed with recent walkouts by fast-food workers around the nation.

Many laws and executive actions, mostly from the 1930s and 1960s, require fair pay for employees of federal contractors. But over time, those protections have been eroded by special-interest exemptions, complex contracting processes and lax enforcement. A new executive order could ensure that the awarding of contracts is based on the quality of jobs created, challenging the notion that the best contractor is the one with the lowest labor costs."

Claims that spending cuts would actually boost employment by promoting confidence have fallen apart. Claims that there is some kind of red line of debt that countries dare not cross have turned out to rest on fuzzy and to some extent just plain erroneous math. Predictions of fiscal crisis keep not coming true; predictions of disaster from harsh austerity policies have proved all too accurate.

Yet calls for a reversal of the destructive turn toward austerity are still having a hard time getting through. Partly that reflects vested interests, for austerity policies serve the interests of wealthy creditors; partly it reflects the unwillingness of influential people to admit being wrong. But there is, I believe, a further obstacle to change: widespread, deep-seated cynicism about the ability of democratic governments, once engaged in stimulus, to change course in the future.

So now seems like a good time to point out that this cynicism, which sounds realistic and worldly-wise, is actually sheer fantasy. Ending stimulus has never been a problem — in fact, the historical record shows that it almost always ends too soon. And in America, at least, we have a pretty good record for behaving in a fiscally responsible fashion, with one exception — namely, the fiscal irresponsibility that prevails when, and only when, hard-line conservatives are in power.

Let’s start with the common claim that stimulus programs never go away.

In the United States, government spending programs designed to boost the economy are in fact rare — F.D.R.’s New Deal and President Obama’s much smaller Recovery Act are the only big examples. And neither program became permanent — in fact, both were scaled back much too soon. F.D.R. cut back sharply in 1937, plunging America back into recession; the Recovery Act had its peak effect in 2010, and has since faded away, a fade that has been a major reason for our slow recovery."

Thune discussed national debt%2C spending and tax reform at town hall

Senator defended vote on maintaining tax rates for those making %24400%2C000

Congress faces vote in next six weeks to lift debt ceiling beyond %2416.3 trillion

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- Republicans in Congress could take President Barack Obama to court if the president decides to lift the nation's debt limit without congressional approval, Sen. John Thune said Wednesday.

Thune said the president doesn't have the constitutional authority to lift the debt ceiling, even though Democrats in Congress are encouraging the president to try.

A divided Congress faces another nasty showdown in the next six weeks to lift the debt ceiling beyond $16.3 trillion. The president this week framed the debate as Congress needing to pay the debts it's incurred. But Thune said the debate also should include spending cuts to address the reasons why the nation has the debt, and he said past spending reforms have been tied to the debt ceiling.

""I don't know when it happens, but this thing is going to blow up on us if we don't do something,"" Thune said of the debt.

Thune made his comments at a town hall meeting Wednesday that focused on the national debt, spending and tax reform.

The only way to address the national debt in a substantial way is to make reforms to entitlement programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Thune said. Solutions to Medicare include phasing in age adjustments so that younger people wouldn't be eligible to join the program until later in age, and to require wealthier Medicare recipients pay into the systems in order to get benefits.

The senator defended his New Year's Eve vote on a package that left taxes on income rates in place for all but those making $400,000 or more a year, or couples making $450,000. The measure also locked into place exemptions on estate taxes, which Thune said was important for farmers and ranchers who worried a large estate tax meant the loss of the family farm.

Conservatives, however, criticized the package because it didn't include spending cuts to government programs. When asked why he voted for the measure, Thune said he did it to keep taxes low for 99 percent of Americans.

""There's been a lot of criticism, and I understand that,"" Thune said. ""There are things in there I absolutely hated.""

Several people at the town hall expressed frustrations about Republicans in Congress being unable to get their messages out and to effectively block the Obama administration and Senate Democrats.

""I'm concerned for our country, and I just feel like we're losing it every day,"" said Jim Holiway of Sioux Falls. Holiway asked Thune what actions he would take to prevent the federal government from becoming more centralized.

Later, following the town hall, Holiway said he wished Republican elected officials would make speeches and take to the airwaves the way Democrats did when they were in the minority.

""When they were in the minority, they would holler to high heaven,"" Holiway said.

Politicians have become more reluctant to hold town halls for fear angry voters will confront them and the exchanges will be used in campaign commercials. Thune is the only member of the South Dakota delegation who consistently holds town halls.

At least one Democrat, former state lawmaker Darrell Solberg, asked Thune to clarify whether Medicare and Social Security were separate funds and their relations to the national debt.

Democrat Tom Cool said Republican presidents Reagan and Bush tripled the national debt, but Republicans didn't worry about it then. Cool said the debt won't be brought under control by Republicans in the House refusing to extend the debt ceiling.

""I don't know how elephants can have such poor memories,"" Cool said.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/sequestration-coming-now-203925006--politics.html,,[],Sequestration is coming. Now what?,"The Senate on Thursday voted to reject all proposals for an alternative deficit-reduction plan that would avoid sequestration, a process that will trim $85 billion in across-the-board spending from the federal budget this year.

Barring a sudden and unexpected outbreak of bipartisan cooperation (LOL) over the next 12 hours, most federal departments on Friday will begin the process of shaving about 2.5 percent from their projected budgets as part of the sequestration order. Over the next decade, if the policy remains in effect, the federal government will spend about $1.2 trillion less than projected, although spending will still increase over that time.

There has been a lot of noise coming from Washington about the consequences of the sequestration plan, which was originally voted into law in 2011 to encourage lawmakers to pass a ""grand bargain"" replacement that would achieve the same amount of deficit reduction.

The White House on Sunday released an alarming state-by-state breakdown of possible consequences if sequestration occurred. Hawaii Democratic Gov. Neil Abercrombie warned that Pearl Harbor would be less secure. California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters cautioned that ""over 170 million jobs"" were at risk. (That would mean negative employment, considering there aren't even that many jobs right now in the U.S.) In all likelihood, sequestration will not be nearly as bad as advertised, something even President Barack Obama suggested on Wednesday night.

In seeking an alternative, lawmakers failed to bridge the divide between the Democrats' demand for more tax increases and the Republicans' insistence that the deficit be narrowed by cutting spending alone. On Thursday—one day before the deadline—Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid put a Republican bill and a Democratic bill on the floor to avoid sequestration. Both failed. (Even if the Republican version had passed, Obama had already vowed to veto it anyway. If the Democratic bill passed, the House would likely have rejected it.)

Story continues

Washington has long known that this day would come. But instead of working in recent weeks to replace the across-the-board-style cuts with smarter methods of achieving some deficit reduction, the parties waged a public relations campaign against each other. Republicans focused on ensuring that Democrats took the blame for proposing the sequestration idea in the first place. Democrats worked to highlight the potential impact the cuts would have on federal services across the country, and accused Republicans of protecting tax loopholes for wealthy Americans at the expense of everyone else.

Regardless of who is really to blame, the deadline is here and sequestration will happen. What does that mean for most Americans? Actually, not much, at least in terms of effects people will immediately see and feel.

Yes, federal agencies will be forced to do more with a bit less. Over the past few months, everyone from Capitol Hill aides, military service members, federal workers and government contractors have been told to prepare for cuts. If you fall into any of those camps, Washington's inaction will likely have an effect on your bottom line. Civilian employees who work with the U.S. military may not secure as many contracts in the year ahead, for instance, and anyone who works under most federal agencies will be forced to prioritize their department's spending.

There are also plans to furlough workdays for some federal employees, so some can prepare for three-day weekends—but in return for less take-home pay. State and local government employees will also face budget hurdles as part of sequestration. State governments will have fewer federal dollars to subsidize local projects. Federal grants will become more competitive, and federal loans could become more scarce.

But here's the good news: Congress can vote at any time to replace the sequester with an alternative. The March 1 deadline merely sets the process into motion, and it will be gradual—perhaps so gradual that most people won't even notice.

As Obama put it this week, sequestration is “not a cliff, but it is a tumble downward.” There will be plenty of branches along the way for lawmakers to latch onto. The question is, how far will they let the country tumble before they finally grab one?"

Instead, with the fiscal cliff deal he signed in President Obama raised his income tax rate from 35 to 39.6 percent and his capital gains tax rate to 20 from 15 percent. And not content to rest there, Obama's proposed budget for fiscal year 2014 would reduce or eliminate several tax breaks benefitting the wealthiest Americans—a group which happens to include himself. Joe Scarborough's mythmaking notwithstanding, Obama has in fact called on Congress to pass the so-called ""Buffett Rule"" to ensure that those earning over a million dollars a year, like Obama will and Mitt Romney already does, will pay at least 30 percent of their income to Uncle Sam. Just as important, President Obama has proposed capping charitable deductions at 28 percent, a change that would cost him and would-have-been President Romney some serious coin.

President Romney, in contrast, would have given himself and his family a massive tax cut windfall of staggering proportions. Romney not only wanted to make the Bush tax rates permanent, he wanted a 20 percent across-the-board tax cut on top of that. That would have proven quite helpful to him even in those years when his speaking fees of $374,000 were ""not that much."" At no point did Romney publicly commit to a single tax deduction he'd close, even when he suggested capping their total value. On top of that, Romney called for ending the estate tax, a giveaway to the Romney clan potentially worth at least $80 million.

It's also worth recalling that Mitt Romney's 10 percent church tithe reduces his tax bill every year. (But Romney wants credit for that, too, claiming that once his charitable contributions and so-called double-taxation of corporate profits are taken into account his real tax rate is ""45 or 50 percent."") Last August, Mitt announced that he never paid less than 13 percent in taxes (which ones he didn't say) over each of the last 10 years. Mitt insisted that get credit for the dollars donated to the LDS:



""Every year, I've paid at least 13 percent, and if you add, in addition, the amount that goes to charity, why the number gets well above 20 percent.""

As it turned out, for his 2011 return Romney did not claim the full charitable tax break to which he was entitled (claiming only $2.25 million of the $4 million he donated) in order to keep his word about that 13 percent rate.

In contrast, as President Obama explained during the campaign last year:



""To give me another tax break, or to give Warren Buffett another tax break, or to give Mitt Romney another tax break -- that would cost about a trillion dollars"" in the federal budget, Obama told people in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ""We can't afford it,"" he said. ""Not at a time when we're trying to bring down our deficit.""

Apparently, the likes of Erin Burnett and Joe Scarborough not only want to forget the result of the 2012 election; they are pretending it never happened at all."

My usual answer is a shrug and an admission that there’s no silver bullet. There are many possibilities — campaign spending limits, term limits, nonpartisan primaries, nonpartisan redistricting, a third party — but most aren’t politically or legally feasible, might not make much of a difference or, as with Harry Reid’s rewriting of Senate rules, have the potential to make things even worse.

But one change, over time, could reverse the problems that have built up over the past few decades: We should mandate military service for all Americans, men and women alike, when they turn 18. The idea is radical, unlikely and impractical — but it just might work.

A Congressional Quarterly count of the current Congress finds that just 86 of the 435 members of the House are veterans, as are only 17 of 100 senators, which puts the overall rate at 19 percent. This is the lowest percentage of veterans in Congress since World War II, down from a high of 77 percent in 1977-78, according to the American Legion. For the past 21 years, the presidency has been occupied by men who didn’t serve or, in the case of George W. Bush, served in a capacity designed to avoid combat.

But an exception, Switzerland, is instructive: On Sept. 22, the Swiss voted 73 percent to 27 percent to keep their conscription army. It has less to do with security than with national identity in a land of 26 cantons and four official languages. The government argued that military service teaches people “how to live and work with compatriots from all regions, all linguistic groups and all social strata,” which “contributes enormously to the national cohesion.”

In Switzerland, the sons of bankers and farmers alike do basic training for several months and then are recalled to service for brief periods. But the structure is less important than the service itself. My former colleague Tom Ricks proposes bringing back the draft in the United States but allowing for a civilian national service option — teaching, providing day care and the like — for those who don’t want to join the military.

There’s no mass movement for mandatory service, but the idea has gained a diverse group of supporters, including retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal and Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y). Gun-rights groups would cheer an armed citizenry, and an article published by the libertarian Cato Institute argued that compulsory service “can be a pillar of freedom.”

The costs would be huge. But so would the benefits: overcoming growing social inequality without redistributing wealth; making future leaders, unlike today’s “chicken hawks,” disinclined to send troops into combat without good reason; putting young Americans to work and giving them job and technology skills; and, above all, giving these young Americans a shared sense of patriotism and service to the country.

It would take some time, but this new generation of Americans, once again asking what they can do for their country, would undo much of the damage today’s crop of self-interested leaders is doing to our politics.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/22/Washington-Wall-Street-Living-in-the-Bitcoin-Economy,2013-12-22 00:00:00,['Christopher Whalen'],"Washington & Wall Street: 'Bitcoin Economy' Surges, Real Economy Deflates","Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) told the financial markets what they wanted to hear, namely that the Federal Reserve is going to moderate massive purchases of Treasury debt and mortgage securities.

The news of the “tapering” of Fed bond purchases sent stock prices soaring, this on the notion that the US economy is improving. Would that it were so.

Cardiff Garcia of FTAlphaville reports that the FOMC reduced slightly the rate of bond purchases:

Beginning in January, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than $45 billion per month.

The trouble is that Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen, and the rest of the FOMC remain in fantasy land when it comes to the causes of our shared economic malaise. While parts of the US economy are doing pretty well, the housing and financial sectors are in a terrible funk. Read the last installment of Washington & Wall Street, “Regulation Likely to Slow the Housing Recovery in 2013,” if you want the gnarly details.

There are a couple of basic problems with how American economists and investors look at the economy and issues such as consumer demand. For example, consider this statement by the FOMC last week:

Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint may be diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Really? The liberal/socialist view of demand-side economists championed by the likes of Paul Krugman holds that a failure by government to spend (and borrow) more is somehow restraining the US economy. In reality, however, we are in a period of extended economic hangover following from the housing boom of the 2000s, when many jobs were supported by speculative credit creation and equally dicey housing activity, both in the US and internationally. Just read the frightening article from The New York Times, “Irish Try to Eradicate Ghosts of a Housing Crash,” and the idea is clear. All of the bad debt behind the housing boom ultimately came about due to the irresponsible Fed money expansion policies under Alan Greenspan.

Decelerating consumer spending (and higher saving) in the private sector and shrinkage of credit private are causing poor job creation, but the good news is that real production and real job creation are slowly coming back. Yet the neo-Keynesian socialists led by Krugman et al. want to put the US economy back on a heroin drip of public spending and higher deficits to immediately stimulate consumption.

Truth be told, the only way to really fix the US economy in a stable, long-term fashion is to focus on fiscal reform and deficit reduction. When they consider the statement above that inflation is running below the Fed’s targets, all economists should be given pause.

Even though the US central bank has grown its balance sheet 300% since 2008, the pace of economic activity continues to fall even as financial bubbles proliferate around the world. Even with interest rates near zero and the Fed monetizing most of the Treasury’s debt issuance, the only accomplishment of the FOMC has been to create financial bubbles in everything from single-family homes to the ersatz currency known as Bitcoin. In a very real sense, the soaring value of Bitcoin vs. the dollar tells you that financial inflation is brisk even as deflation haunts the real economy.

The cost of living for all Americans continues to rise, but the volume of spending and all transactions generally is still anemic, even falling. Consider this chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showing the velocity of money, which has been falling rapidly since 2007 and is now at the lowest level since the Great Depression.

“The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period,” notes the St. Louis Fed. “In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy. The frequency of currency exchange can be used to determine the velocity of a given component of the money supply, providing some insight into whether consumers and businesses are saving or spending their money.”

While the majority of the FOMC thinks or at least says they believe that the reduction in government spending is responsible for the lax economic environment, in fact it is a function of the end of 20 years of credit-fueled boom facilitated by the Fed. The speculative “Bitcoin Economy” is surging – at least for now – but the real economy continues to deflate. Americans are shunning the consumer economy, paying down debt, and pulling back on spending more than they earn. The members of the FOMC think this is bad for some reason. Only when the Fed and Congress focus on spurring real growth via tax and spending cuts will we see growth in real jobs and spending that is sustainable."

As Congress considers legislation that would boost the federal minimum wage, at least 13 states will be raising the wage floor on their own next week. They're led once again by Washington state, which will continue to have the highest state minimum wage in the nation, at $9.32 per hour.

A few cities and counties around the country will be raising their minimum wages as well, including San Francisco, which will set its at $10.74. San Francisco's base will no longer be the highest municipal minimum wage in the country, however, after voters in SeaTac, Wash., approved a ballot measure setting a $15 wage floor for an estimated 6,000 airport workers. The SeaTac minimum wage is set to go into effect Jan. 1, although it's currently being challenged in court.

Most of next week's increases will come courtesy of an inflation index. Ten states have tied their minimum wages to the index, guaranteeing that they rise with the cost of living each year. Other states, such as New Jersey and Connecticut, passed legislation in 2013 that will nominally raise their minimum wages. (California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the state's minimum wage to $10 by 2016, but the first increase, to $9, won't come until July.)

The federal minimum wage prevails in the 31 states that don't currently mandate a higher one. The federal rate hasn't been raised since 2009, after the last of a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush took effect.

The federal minimum wage is not tied to an index, but Democrats in Congress, as well as President Barack Obama, have said that it should be. The minimum wage bill put forth by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 and peg it to inflation. Obama, who previously suggested raising the wage floor to $9 and indexing it, has since gotten on board with the $10.10 proposal from Harkin and Miller.

The annual minimum wage raises in states and cities are routinely praised by low-wage worker advocates and panned by business-friendly groups. The Employment Policies Institute, a vocal critic of higher minimum wages, argued in a press release Monday that raises like the ones that will go into effect next week have ""disastrous results for the most vulnerable jobseekers."" Republicans on Capitol Hill have shown party-line opposition to the Harkin-Miller proposal, with leadership declaring a minimum wage increase a job-killer.

Most voters, however, don't seem persuaded by the critics' economic arguments, as they continue to approve higher minimum wages on the local level. The idea of raising the minimum wage tends to poll extremely well, including among Republicans who are not members of Congress. Most polls show that around two-thirds of respondents support raising the federal minimum wage. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, half of Republicans who responded said it should be raised.

Here are the state and local increases that will go into effect next week, as compiled by the Employment Policies Institute:

Arizona: $7.80 to $7.90

Colorado: $7.78 to $8.00

Connecticut: $8.25 to $8.70

Florida: $7.79 to $7.93

Missouri: $7.35 to $7.50

Montana: $7.80 to $7.90

New Jersey: $7.25 to $8.25

New York: $7.25 to $8.00

Ohio: $7.85 to $7.95

Oregon: $8.95 to $9.10

Rhode Island: $7.75 to $8.00

Vermont: $8.60 to $8.73

Washington State: $9.19 to $9.32

Albuquerque, N.M.: $8.50 to $8.60

Bernalillo County, N.M.: $8.00 to $8.50

San Francisco, Calif.: $10.55 to $10.74

San Jose, Calif.: $10.00 to $10.15

SeaTac, Wash.: $9.19 to $15.00"

That question is at the heart of the warring Republican and Democratic budget plans coming out this week — with Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin vowing to eliminate the federal deficit within 10 years, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington State setting a more modest goal of bringing spending closer in line with revenue over time.

While economists generally agree that narrowing the government’s deficit and limiting the size of the debt are necessary in the long run, most argue that balancing the budget would not restore the nation’s still-weak economy to health in the near term. Indeed, rushing to do so with unemployment still elevated and the economy growing at only a sluggish pace could even set back the effort to reduce the deficit.

“There’s nothing magic about exact balance,” said Alice M. Rivlin, a Democratic economist at the Brookings Institution who has worked with Republicans like former Senator Pete V. Domenici on bipartisan deficit-reduction proposals. “The really important thing is to keep the debt from growing faster than the economy.”

The question of whether to balance the budget and when is a new staging ground in the long-running fiscal fight between Republicans and the White House. Mr. Ryan, whose previous budget proposals did not bring spending below revenue for decades, vowed this time to do so by 2023, in part to satisfy the demands of the more conservative members of the Republican Caucus."

""There are not votes in the House to pass a clean CR,"" Boehner said in an interview with ABC's ""This Week.""

Contrary to Boehner's claim, several House Republicans have signaled willingness to pass a bill to fund the government with no strings attached to Obamacare's funding and implementation.

As of Wednesday afternoon, the number of those Republicans hit 21 -- surpassing the magic 17 votes needed to pass a clean funding bill if all 200 Democrats stick together and team up with them. Of course, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put that bill on the floor in the first place. But if he did, the votes appear to be there for passage, at which point the bill would sail through the Senate and be signed by President Barack Obama, ending the shutdown.

In the ABC interview, Boehner pushed back on the vote estimates for the bill, saying negotiations still needed to happen.

""The American people expect in Washington when we have a crisis like this, that the leaders will sit down and have a conversation,"" Boehner said. ""I told my members the other day — there may be a back room somewhere, but there's nobody in it.""

Boehner criticized President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for their unwillingness to budge on the CR, saying Reid is demanding ""complete surrender.""

Turning toward the looming debt ceiling deadline, the House Speaker said his chamber would not pass a measure to raise the limit without an Obamacare-related provision.

""We are not going to pass a clean debt limit [bill],"" Boehner said. ""The votes are not in the House.. We are not going down that path.""

Boehner added that he had no indication of when the standoff would end.

""If I knew, I'd tell you,"" he said."

Some of the hardest hit would be 2.1 million federal workers who could be spending up to 22 business days at home without pay on a furlough.

The impact of federal food inspectors, park rangers, airport traffic controllers and security personnel staying away from work would be felt by many more Americans.

An important caveat: Congress still may avert the spending cuts, and they aren't expected to bite right away. Experts expect agencies to do all they can to delay the start of furloughs, in some cases by several months.

But these seven cuts would be really felt by many Americans.

1. Shrinking unemployment benefits. Some 3.8 million Americans estimated to collect unemployment checks between March and September will feel the pain the most. That's because unemployment benefit checks are being pared by 9.4%. On average, it would mean a cut of $400 over that period.

2. Beef and chicken to cost more and even face a shortage. A $51 million dollar cut to food safety programs means food inspectors will be furloughed and lead to closures of meat and poultry plants for up to 15 days. Americans will have to pay more and deal with shortages of chicken, eggs, pork and beef, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""Food safety could be compromised,"" he said in a letter. There will be less food available -- by as much as 2 billion pounds of meat, 3 billion pounds of chicken, 200 million pounds of eggs.

3. Granny won't get her lunch. More than 4 million home-bound and disabled seniors may have to go without supper this year because of cuts to Meals on Wheels programs. Just in Erie County, New York, it could mean 36,000 fewer meals will be delivered, according to the Meals On Wheels Association of America.

4. Your preschooler could be stuck at home. Some 70,000 children from lower income families will not be able to enroll for pre-schools and daycare centers run by Head Start programs this fall, thanks to at least $400 million in cuts.

5. National parks will close campgrounds or open late. The National Park Service will lose $110 million from its annual budget. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee plans to close five campgrounds and picnic areas affecting over 54,000 visitors. Two of the main thoroughfares into the Grand Canyon will remain closed until later this year, including the popular West Rim Drive, known for its breathtaking beauty. The delays will affect about 250,000 visitors.

6. Longer lines at the airport. Domestic travelers can add an extra hour to airport security lines, while international travelers may have to wait four hours to clear customs. That's because federal agencies that handle airport security and customs are warning that worker furloughs will increase the time it takes to check passengers.

7. Roofs blown off by Hurricane Sandy won't get repaired. About $3 billion has been cut from a supplemental bill for Hurricane Sandy victims. The cut includes ""crucial funding"" for repair and recovery of some 10,000 homes and small businesses, said HUD Secretary Shaun Donavan last week."

In a lengthy speech about income inequality in America, Obama declared it the “defining challenge of our time” to make sure the economy works for rich and poor alike.

“I take this personally,” Obama said. “I’m only here because this country educated my grandfather on the GI bill.”

When his father left and his mom hit hard times trying to raise two children while going to school, he said, “this country helped make sure we didn’t go hungry.”

And when Michelle Obama’s working-class parents wanted to send her to college, he said, “this country helped us afford it until we could pay it back.”

“What drives me as a grandson, a son, a father, as an American,” he said, “is to make sure that every striving, hardworking, optimistic kid in America has the same incredible chance that his country gave me.”

In what sounded at times like a preview of a State of the Union address, Obama spelled out his economic priorities and outlined his approach as he enters negotiations with congressional Republicans over budget and fiscal matters.

He lowered deficit reduction on his administration’s priority list, arguing that slashing government programs doesn’t attack the most serious problems facing the nation’s middle class. A “growing deficit of opportunity” is a greater threat to the country’s future than its “rapidly shrinking” fiscal deficit, he said.

Obama also made clear that he will push publicly for an increase to the minimum wage, an initiative that currently doesn’t stand much of a chance of passage.

In his address to the liberal Center for American Progress, Obama called upon Republicans to help fight the growing gap between rich and poor by either supporting his plans or offering alternatives.

“If Republicans have concrete plans that will actually reduce inequality, build the middle class, provide moral ladders of opportunity to the poor, let’s hear them,” Obama said. “I want to know what they are.”

But as Obama spoke, Republican leaders took issue with the remedies he proposed. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) suggested that Obama’s policies are to blame for the problems he describes.

“He promotes more government instead of more freedom,” Boehner wrote on Twitter. “The American Dream is certainly more in doubt than in decades,” he went on in a linked statement, “but after more than five years in office, the president has no one to blame but himself.”

http://news.yahoo.com/federal-workers-brace-furloughs-193020586.html,,[],Federal workers brace for furloughs,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- First there was a two-year pay freeze. Now furloughs loom, as federal agencies make personnel costs a prime target for across-the-board budget cuts that went into effect last week. The result: anxiety and low morale in a workforce often envied for its job security.

""It would certainly put a strain on things,"" said Jonathan Schweizer, 61, an environmental engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency in Chicago who could be forced to take up to 13 days of unpaid leave this year. ""I'd probably have to run up some credit card debt or defer maintenance on my home that I'd otherwise consider important.""

Government agencies vary widely in how they are dealing with the ""sequester,"" as the automatic cuts are called, according to labor unions that represent federal workers. Federal workers could face seven days of furloughs at the Housing and Urban Development Department, while Homeland Security personnel might see twice that number.

More than half of the nation's 2.1 million federal workers could be furloughed over the next six months. The federal government is the country's single largest employer, with its employees making up about 1.2 percent of the nation's work force.

""A lot of people think federal employees are fat-cat bureaucrats in Washington, but they don't realize more than 85 percent of these workers live outside of D.C.,"" said Tim Kauffman, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees. ""A lot of them are not highly paid folks, like VA nurses and emergency response workers.""

AFGE, which represents more than 600,000 federal workers, is trying to keep track of all the different furlough plans as their members face the prospect of lost wages during mandatory time off without pay and growing frustration about getting work done.

It seems the federal workforce is under constant attack these days, particularly from Republican lawmakers who want to shrink government and contend federal employees are overpaid with more generous benefits compared to the private sector. Even President Barack Obama supported the pay freeze, though he has issued an executive order that will give workers a 0.5 percent cost-of-living raise set for April. Still, Congress could take action that prevents the raise from happening.

Story continues

The latest unemployment numbers offered even more bad news for government workers as federal employment, excluding the U.S. Postal Service, shrank by 4,200 jobs last month. That's the fifth straight month of cuts, which may reflect a trend towards greater belt-tightening.

Schweizer conceded that working for the federal government remains a lot more stable than other industries, but he said the comfort level has changed.

""We've definitely been squeezed financially,"" he said. ""People have left and haven't been replaced. That puts more pressure on us as far as getting the job done and it certainly hurts morale in my office.""

Some agencies, including the Justice Department, already have sent out formal furlough notices to workers indicating furloughs of up to 14 days could begin as soon as April. All furloughs are subject to 30-day notices and to bargaining with unions representing government workers.

While the unions can't stop the furloughs, they can try to ease the pain for employees by negotiating different times, allowing employees to swap days, or other changes. Unions are also trying to persuade agencies to make other cuts that don't affect worker pay, such as cutting government contracts with private companies.

The Social Security Administration, for example, says it hopes to avoid furloughs altogether, instead saving money by terminating more than 1,500 temporary and other workers and losing more than 5,000 other positions through attrition.

""In some cases, the agencies can figure out ways to slow down federal contracts instead of taking it out of federal personnel,"" said Patrick Lester, director of fiscal policy for the Center for Effective Government.

But there are limits on flexibility. ""If they are largely personnel-driven, there's no way to avoid personnel-related cuts,"" Lester said.

Meat and poultry inspectors at the Agriculture Department initially were told they might be furloughed for 11 consecutive days between June and July, possibly leading to a meat supply shortage and higher prices. But Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack backed away from that at a House hearing this week, telling lawmakers that the furloughs would not be consecutive after all.

""Furloughs are going to cause disruption,"" department spokeswoman Courtney Rowe said Wednesday. ""We're looking to do it in ways that cause the minimum impact.""

At the EPA, officials are planning up to 13 furlough days, with the first four coming between April and June 1, said John O'Grady, president of AFGE local 704. There also would be mandatory furlough days on May 24, July 5 and Aug. 30 — coming around the Memorial Day, July Fourth and Labor Day holidays — that would shut the agency entirely, he said.

Some of the longest furloughs are expected at the Defense Department, where about 800,000 civilian employees face up to 22 unpaid days off over the next several months. The agency has not yet specified when those will happen, but some agencies may try to put off furloughs for several months in hopes that Congress will come up with a budget fix.

More flexibility could be coming soon. A House measure passed Wednesday that prevents a shutdown of federal agencies on March 27 also would grant the Pentagon greater latitude in implementing its share of short-term spending cuts. Senate Democrats could try to expand that flexibility to other agencies, potentially reducing the number of workers who are furloughed.

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he plans to introduce legislation that would allow the Obama administration to exempt from furloughs essential federal employees, such as those who perform food inspections and other urgent functions, so the consequences of the budget cuts would not harm the economy or public safety.

Border Patrol agents at the Homeland Security Department, for example, face up to 14 days of furloughs and a moratorium on regular overtime pay, which could mean a 35 percent decline in wages for the rest of the fiscal year. Union officials warn that could mean trouble for border security, as agents aren't used to stopping work just because their shifts end, especially if they are chasing drug or gun smugglers.

Lawmakers let these tax breaks lapse almost every year, even though they save businesses and individuals billions of dollars. And almost every year, Congress eventually renews them, retroactively, so taxpayers can claim them by the time they file their tax returns.

No harm, no foul, right? After all, taxpayers filing returns in the spring won't be hurt because the tax breaks were in effect for 2013. Taxpayers won't be hit until 2015, when they file tax returns for next year.

Not so far. Trade groups and tax experts complain that Congress is making it impossible for businesses and individuals to plan for the future. What if lawmakers don't renew the tax break you depend on? Or what if they change it and you're no longer eligible?

""It's a totally ridiculous way to run our tax system,"" said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel for the National Retail Federation. ""It's impossible to plan when every year this happens, but yet business has gotten used to that.""

More On This...

Some of the tax breaks are big, including billions in credits for companies that invest in research and development, generous exemptions for financial institutions doing business overseas, and several breaks that let businesses write off capital investments faster.

Others are more obscure, the benefits targeted to film producers, race track owners, makers of electric motorcycles and teachers who buy classroom supplies with their own money.

There are tax rebates to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from a tax on rum imported into the United States, and a credit for expenses related to railroad track maintenance.

A deduction for state and local sales taxes benefits people who live in the nine states without state income taxes. Smaller tax breaks benefit college students and commuters who use public transportation.

A series of tax breaks promote renewable energy, including a credit for power companies that produce electricity with windmills.

The annual practice of letting these tax breaks expire is a symptom a divided, dysfunctional Congress that struggles to pass routine legislation, said Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.

""It's not fair, it's very hard, it's very difficult for a business person, a company, to plan, not just for the short term but to do long-term planning,"" Lewis said. ""It's shameful.""

With Congress on vacation until January, there is no chance the tax breaks will be renewed before they expire. And there is plenty of precedent for Congress to let them expire for months without addressing them. Most recently, they expired at the end of 2011, and Congress didn't renew them for the entire year, waiting until New Year's Day 2013 -- just in time for taxpayers to claim them on their 2012 returns.

But Congress only renewed the package though the end of 2013.

Why such a short extension? Washington accounting is partly to blame. The two-year extension Congress passed in January cost $76 billion in reduced revenue for the government, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Making those tax breaks permanent could add $400 billion or more to the deficit over the next decade.

With budget deficits already high, many in Congress are reluctant to vote for a bill that would add so much red ink. So, they do it slowly, one or two years at time.

""More cynically, some people say, if you just put it in for a year or two, then that keeps the lobbyists having to come back and wine-and-dine the congressmen to get it extended again, and maybe make some campaign contributions,"" said Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst for CCH, a consulting firm based in Riverwoods, Ill.

This year, the package of tax breaks has been caught up in a debate about overhauling the entire tax code. The two top tax writers in Congress -- House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont. -- have been pushing to simplify the tax code by reducing tax breaks and using the additional revenue to lower overall tax rates.

But their efforts have yet to bear fruit, leaving both tax reform and the package of temporary breaks in limbo. When asked how businesses should prepare, given the uncertainty, Camp said: ""They need to get on board with tax reform, that's what they need to do.""

Further complicating the issue, President Barack Obama has nominated Baucus to become U.S. ambassador to China, meaning he will soon leave the Senate, if he is confirmed by his colleagues.

As the Senate wound down its 2013 session, Democratic leaders made a late push to extend many of the tax breaks by asking Republican colleagues to pass a package on the floor of the Senate without debate or amendments. Republicans objected, saying it wasn't a serious offer, and the effort failed.

So should taxpayers count on these breaks as they plan their budgets for 2014?

""The best thing I would say is, budget accordingly,"" said Jackie Perlman, principle tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. ""As the saying goes, hope for the best but plan for the worst. Then if you get it, great, that's a nice perk. But don't count on it."""

There is a lot to say about the Congressional budget deal, and we do that later on the editorial page. For now I wanted to dwell on the outrageous failure of Congress to extend federal long-term unemployment benefits.

After Jan. 1, 1.3 million Americans will lose their benefits, so extending them is vitally important. In addition to simple fairness, the benefits are an economic boon since those who receive them spend the money on essentials such as food and shelter; they don’t save it or give it to a hedge fund.

As Ezra Klein pointed out today in The Washington Post, unemployment for five weeks or less has dropped nicely, but long-term unemployment, which lasts more than 27 weeks, has not.



“No one has a very good answer for these workers,” he wrote. “They’re often stuck in areas of the country where jobs are scarce. They face a vicious cycle of employment discrimination in which employers don’t want to hire them because they’ve been unemployed for so long, which in turn extends their unemployment and makes it even harder for them to find a job. And now we’re just cutting them loose.”

To be clear, the benefits extension was not even included in the budget talks. Paul Ryan and the other Republicans bet that Democrats, eager for a sequester deal, wouldn’t insist on unemployment at this stage. And they were right.

But don’t mistake this for a problem with Congressional process. It’s not. It comes from deep ideological opposition among right-wing Republicans to the very idea of unemployment benefits. Their view is that these benefits coddle people who should just by golly go out and find a job.

It will be a national disgrace if Congress does not help people who simply cannot find new jobs after being thrown out of work by the recession.

There’s a chance that Democrats can get the extension through before Friday, when lawmakers stop pretending to do something in Washington and go off on vacation so they can slurp up more cash from the campaign-finance troughs back home. But I’m not betting on it."

Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of “The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform – Why We Need It and What It Will Take.”

In recent weeks, the odds favoring tax reform in the not-too-distant future have improved somewhat.

Today's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.

The improving deficit means that tax reform need not raise net revenues, as President Obama has demanded ; the controversy about aggressive tax avoidance by Apple and other multinational companies has focused Congress’s attention on a key goal of tax reform, which is fixing the multinational tax regime; and the furor over the Internal Revenue Service and accusations that it targeted conservative groups almost certainly means there will be bipartisan legislation to make sure this doesn’t happen again, thus providing a legislative vehicle for tax reform.

What is missing, unfortunately, is the outline of an actual tax reform bill. Some progress, however, has been made.

The Joint Committee on Taxation has recently published a 568-page report on various tax reform options based on the work of House Ways and Means Committee working groups. The committee has even released draft tax reform legislation involving financial derivatives, small businesses and the international sector.

The Senate Finance Committee has released a number of tax reform options papers related to family taxation, business investment and innovation, international competitiveness and other topics. Many insiders also believe that the recently announced retirement of the committee’s chairman, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, improves the prospects for tax reform because his precarious position as a Democrat from a heavily Republican state limited his ability to lead a contentious debate on the subject.

Almost everyone agrees that the ultimate goal of tax reform should be to lower statutory tax rates and that it should be revenue-neutral, that is, neither raising nor lowering net federal revenues over some reasonable time period. This will require the elimination of many tax expenditures benefiting both individuals and businesses.



But at present, no one has put a single specific, significant tax expenditure on the table for elimination, and that is the rub. The tax reform bills that have been introduced thus far are mostly grandiose, utopian plans to completely replace the entire tax system; they have no chance whatsoever of enactment.

In public discussions of tax reform, commentators and politicians tend to blithely assume that all tax expenditures are equivalent to tax loopholes – illegitimate provisions of the tax code that benefit only special interests. But as I have explained previously, all of the really large tax expenditures benefit broad segments of the population or are regarded as legitimate components of the federal tax system that serve vital national interests, like home ownership, helping people save for retirement or providing them with health insurance.

To be sure, many tax loopholes cannot be defended. But they tend to be small and do not provide much revenue to pay for more than a trivial reduction in tax rates.

One problem for tax reformers is the disparate impact of specific tax deductions on different people. For starters, only about a third of tax filers itemize; the rest use the standard deduction. Among those that itemize, those with high incomes are much more likely to do so than those with more modest incomes. This fact is illustrated in the following table from a recent Congressional Research Service report.

Photo

Moreover, use of certain deductions depends on one’s income. For example, the very wealthy get little value from the mortgage interest deduction because the law limits it to mortgages of less than $1 million. But the wealthy are much more likely to use the charitable contributions deduction and to deduct large amounts. The average charitable deduction for those with incomes above $1 million was almost $140,000 in 2010.

Consequently, ending or restricting particular deductions will have very different economic and distributional effects at different income levels. Some of these effects are reviewed in a May 21 report from the Congressional Research Service.

The report notes that the most commonly discussed option for raising revenue by restricting itemized deductions wouldn’t abolish them entirely but would limit their availability in some way. The total amount of deductions claimed could be limited by a dollar amount, they could be limited to a certain percentage of income, there could be floors that allow deductions only over a certain amount and various other schemes.

One problem is that phasing out deductions in some way creates disincentives equivalent to raising marginal tax rates. According to the report, simply eliminating all itemized deductions would be equivalent to raising the top income tax rate by 4.4 percentage points. Eliminating the deductions for state and local taxes or for charitable contributions is equivalent to raising the top rate by 2.2 percentage points.

This means that even if statutory rates are simultaneously reduced, there may not be any reduction in effective marginal tax rates, depending on what deductions are restricted or eliminated and how it is done. Only careful analysis can determine the net impact of any particular proposal.

This is why it is essential to have a detailed tax reform plan to analyze. Vague talk about broadening the tax base and lowering statutory tax rates is insufficient to guide legislation. And it takes more time than most people imagine to work through all the effects of various tax reforms, especially when many provisions of the tax code are being changed simultaneously that may move in opposite directions, economically.

Thus far, the Obama administration has been disengaged from the tax reform effort. But if it is going to happen, this must change. That is one lesson of previous tax reform efforts in 1969, 1976 and 1986, all of which were guided into enactment by strong Treasury Department leadership."

That money, the officials said, could be used to finance the investment in jobs.

The revenue would result from the transition to a revised code — for example, as companies paid a one-time fee on profits they earned overseas but did not bring home because they did not make them subject to American tax rates.

For two years, Republicans have rejected most of Mr. Obama’s initiatives to create jobs, in part because, to avoid increasing the budget deficit, he has paired those ideas with proposals to repeal or reduce tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations, especially oil companies.

By presenting the tax-rate cut as a stand-alone proposal, the White House hoped to make it more appealing to Republicans — or, failing that, to depict them as obstructionists. Both Republicans and the administration have said that an overhaul of the corporate code should be “revenue neutral,” meaning it does not add to or subtract from the annual budget deficit.

The White House and Republicans also clashed over Mr. Obama’s contention that he was making a concession by calling for an overhaul of the corporate tax code separate from one for individual taxes. In truth, analysts said, both the White House and Republicans have been increasingly open to separating the two, although neither likes to advertise it.

In February 2012, Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, said the administration’s plan was devised so that the corporate tax code could be overhauled separately."

JPMorgan Chase has secured important concessions in a $13 billion settlement over its mortgage practices, allowances that could ultimately reduce the bank’s financial burden and leave the government itself on the hook for a small portion of the cost.

The concessions emerged on Friday in an agreement with one of the federal regulators suing JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank. The regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, ran ahead of a broader deal that the Justice Department and other authorities were negotiating with the bank.

The housing agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, extracted a $5.1 billion payout on Friday.

But unlike other regulators pursuing the bank, it did not require JPMorgan to admit wrongdoing. And in a provision buried in the settlement, the agency effectively allows JPMorgan to try later to recoup about $1 billion from another federal regulator: the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Related Links Graphic: Tracking the JPMorgan Inquiries

The results show that, even as JPMorgan is facing an onslaught from the government, the bank is seeking to contain the fallout — and is succeeding on some fronts.

In a statement, JPMorgan called the deal “an important step towards a broader resolution” with the Justice Department and the other government authorities.

And for its part, the housing agency, while not responding to questions about the wording of the agreement, also heralded the settlement. “This is a significant step as the government and JPMorgan Chase move to address outstanding mortgage-related issues,” Edward J. DeMarco, the acting director of the housing agency, said in a statement. Yet the housing agency’s announcement also suggests that the government may be split over how to punish the bank for misrepresenting the quality of mortgage securities it sold to investors before the 2008 financial crisis. The Justice Department, which has orchestrated the $13 billion settlement, is conversely demanding that JPMorgan not pass on its liabilities to the F.D.I.C.

JPMorgan has been locked in a legal battle with the F.D.I.C. over mortgage securities sold by Washington Mutual. In a deal that the F.D.I.C. orchestrated, JPMorgan bought the failed bank at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, just months after it acquired Bear Stearns. By JPMorgan’s account, the F.D.I.C. agreed that it would shoulder some liabilities from Washington Mutual. The agency disputes that notion and is fighting the bank in court.

The bank’s legal stance has now carried over into the negotiations over the $13 billion mortgage settlement.

Because the settlement deal with the housing regulator involves mortgage securities sold by Washington Mutual, JPMorgan could try to push some of the settlement cost onto the F.D.I.C. And the deal with the housing agency does not explicitly prevent the bank from doing so.

“Nothing in this agreement shall be used as an admission or concession that JPMorgan,” the deal said, “contractually assumed or is otherwise liable for any alleged liabilities or wrongdoing of Washington Mutual Bank.”

Armed with that wording, JPMorgan could file a claim against Washington Mutual’s receivership fund, which is maintained by the F.D.I.C. Such a claim could be for more than $1 billion, given that Washington Mutual accounted for a third of the disputed mortgage securities. It is unclear whether the bank would receive the full amount. The receivership contains about $2.7 billion, according to the F.D.I.C.’s Web site. And it already faces other large claims.

The settlement with the housing agency does prevent JPMorgan from making any claim on the agency’s deposit insurance fund. But some government officials worry that if JPMorgan consumes what’s left of the receivership, a few other claimants could take the bold step of pursuing the insurance fund.

The Justice Department, which wants to include other Washington Mutual-related investigations into the $13 billion deal, continues to fight with the bank over the F.D.I.C.

Some bank lawyers questioned whether it is fair for the $13 billion settlement to include any payouts related to Washington Mutual. The company, the lawyers argued, sold the dubious securities before JPMorgan bought it.

As both sides continued to wrangle over a final deal, the housing agency decided to announce its own settlement. By settling now, people briefed on the talks said, the agency can move on to negotiating with other banks it has sued.

For JPMorgan, the housing regulator settlement resolves only one element of the bank’s legal woes. The bank, which is also facing investigations into whether it turned a blind eye to Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and hired the sons and daughters of China’s elite to win business in that nation, said earlier this month that since 2010 it had set aside $28 billion for litigation expenses.

Still, the housing regulator’s case was one of the costliest.

In a 2011 lawsuit, the regulator accused JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual of misrepresenting the quality of the mortgage securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing finance companies. The banks, the agency claimed, did not fully disclose the risks of the securities, which ultimately imploded.

To settle the mortgage securities case, the bank paid $4 billion. It paid another $1.1 billion to the regulator to settle demands that the bank repurchase soured loans it sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from 2000 to 2008.

The $13 billion deal with JPMorgan also involves a number of other state and federal authorities. Under the current terms, the bank would pay a roughly $2 billion fine to prosecutors in California, commit $4 billion to help struggling homeowners reduce their mortgage balances and dole out billions more to state attorneys general and other officials who will then funnel the money to investors who sustained losses on mortgage securities.

The deal could embolden the Justice Department as it takes aim at other big banks suspected of similar mortgage breakdowns. Using the JPMorgan case as a template, the Justice Department is planning to take action against other big banks suspected of selling troubled mortgage securities, people briefed on the matter said.

The Justice Department’s cases rely on a law that extends the legal deadline for filing certain financial fraud cases to 10 years from five. The law also led a federal jury this week to find Bank of America liable in a mortgage case.

A spokesman for Eric T. Schneiderman — the New York attorney general who is expected to collect more than $500 million from JPMorgan — praised the housing regulator’s pact on Friday. “Five years after the financial crisis, it is critical that we continue to share resources to maximize the relief provided to struggling homeowners and ensure accountability for those who created the crisis in the first place,” said the spokesman, Damien LaVera."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/28/congress-austerity_n_4509179.html,2013-12-28 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Here Are All The Times Congress Screwed Americans This Year In The Name Of Austerity,"WASHINGTON -- As the year winds to a close, Congress is cautiously celebrating passing a year-end budget that relieves just about a third of the sequestration cuts. But those cuts, along with a slew of other fiscal measures enacted by Congress, amounted to a year of fiscal austerity that took money out of the economy, slowed GDP growth and cut the number of jobs that could have been created.

The tightening began on the first of the year, when the ""fiscal cliff"" deal passed both houses of Congress and was signed by President Barack Obama. While the deal did stop some sharp tax increases that would have put a real drag on economic growth, it allowed the payroll tax holiday to expire, meaning all workers got less money in their paychecks. Predictions made around the time the deal was crafted estimated it would shave between 0.4 and 0.6 percent off of GDP growth in 2013.

That deal delayed sequestration cuts for two months, and they began on March 1. The plan mandated $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts until Oct. 1. The cuts damaged the public defender system, stalled cancer research and cut scientific research. The cuts also hit programs for the most vulnerable, including Head Start and Meals on Wheels.

The economic effects of these policies are tangible. According to the most recent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, made in early 2013, sequestration was expected to cost around 750,000 jobs that would have been created or retained if not for the cuts. CBO also estimated that sequestration along with fiscal tightening would cost about 1 ¼ percentage points in growth from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013. The CBO also estimated that without sequestration, the economy would have been expected to grow faster in 2013 by about 0.6 of a percentage point.

Independent research firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimated in October that budget tightening had reduced annual GDP growth by 0.7 of a percentage point since 2010 and raised the unemployment rate by 0.8 percent.

Repealing the sequester would create economic dividends. Canceling sequestration would increase third quarter GDP in 2014 by 0.7 percent and increase payrolls by 0.9 million, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate from July. The budget deal signed by President Barack Obama this week replaces about a third of these draconian cuts that were scheduled -- eliminating $63 billion out of an estimated $180 billion in cuts in 2014 and 2015.

On Oct. 1, Congress did not pass an appropriations bill, and the government shut down for 17 days. During that time, more than 800,000 federal workers were furloughed without pay, and nonessential federal offices were closed.

Congress passed an appropriations bill funding the government at current levels on Oct. 17. Federal workers received back pay, and the government reopened. However, the shutdown had economic costs. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, it shaved off an estimated 0.25 percent of annualized GDP growth in the fourth quarter, or about $10 billion.

On Nov. 1, food stamp benefits were cut by $5 billion when legislation from 2010 that reallocated funding went into effect. The cut affected 47 million Americans, and reduced the maximum benefit from 11 to 36 dollars, depending on family size. With the cut came a jump in the need at soup kitchens and food banks.

The costs to the economy could be more than $5 billion -- Moody's Analytics has estimated that every additional dollar spent on food stamps generates about $1.74 in economic activity. JPMorgan Chase Chief Economist Michael Feroli estimated that the cuts could shave 0.1 of a percentage point off the annual growth rate of the nation's GDP in 2013.

Despite the cuts, the economy grew at a relatively fast pace of 4.1 percent in the third quarter of 2013, up from 1.1 and 2.5 percent in the quarters before. However, the growth rate may not reflect true economic activity. As Slate's Matt Yglesias points out, real gross domestic income -- an alternative measure for GDP measuring all incomes of an economy -- grew by a much lower 1.8 percent. Plus, with all of the cuts enacted by Congress, many Americans hardly feel like the economy is getting better. Moreover, the economy remained about 3.1 percent below its potential output in 2013, according to OECD, and about 5 million jobs short of full employment, according to CBO.

The cuts will continue into 2014. On Saturday, 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits, as Congress failed to extend the benefits before adjourning for the year. Federal benefits tend to kick in after state ones expire, which in most places is 26 weeks. Congress could reinstate the benefits retroactively once it returns at the beginning of next year, but recipients will at least face a lapse. The White House Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that not extending the benefits would cost 240,000 jobs in 2014. Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and JP Morgan have pegged the cost to GDP growth at 0.2 to 0.4 percent."

Paul Ryan thinks the second-highest child poverty in the developed world and sequestration are a great start, but there's more to be done.

But the picture looks even worse when you examine just how far below the relative poverty line these children tend to fall. The UNICEF report looks at something it calls the “child poverty gap,” which measures how far the average poor child falls below the relative poverty line. It does this by measuring the gap between the relative poverty line and the average income of poor families. Alarmingly, the United States also scores second-to-last on this measurement, with the average poor child living in a home that makes 36 percent less than the relative poverty line.

The United States ranks 34 out of 35 on a UNICEF measure of relative child poverty in developed nations. To be clear, that's 34 out of 35 in the bad way—second highest level, doing better than only Romania with more than 20 percent of children living in a household with an income below half the median.This is the context before the start of sequestration, as Bryce Covert points out. With the full effects of sequestration yet to come, we've already seen kids cut from Head Start programs , less housing assistance available to families struggling to stay off the street, and homeless shelters losing funding among the sequester's effects that will hit poor kids directly.

Of course all of this is just a tiny taste of what Republicans would like to deal out to poor and struggling families through Paul Ryan's Republican budget. That's why Republicans wanted the sequester to happen to begin with, their whining about airports and White House tours notwithstanding."

These tourists will not be able to take a tour of the White House, and if they scheduled a tour, the tour is cancelled.

The rules committee in the House is currently deciding whether or not they will allow amendments to be included in the CR. If they decide to allow amendments, Gohmert will attach his amendment.

Gohmert’s amendment reads: None of the funds made available by a division of this Act may be used to transport the President to or from a golf course until public tours of the White House resume.

Suppose that a government imposes fiscal austerity in a realistic fashion, with spending cuts getting steadily deeper relative to baseline over a period of several years. If the negative impact of these cuts is fairly large — which all the evidence coming in suggests is the case under current liquidity-trap conditions — and if the country starts from a fairly high level of debt — as the austerity countries do — something alarming is likely to happen. Instead of falling, the ratio of debt to GDP is likely to rise for years.

In part this is because a weaker economy shrinks revenues, offsetting a large part of the direct austerity. What pushes it over the top is the weakening of GDP, which increases the ratio.

I ran my own version of their simulations for a hypothetical country — call it Osbornia — which starts with debt at 100 percent of GDP and a budget deficit that would, left to itself, be consistent with a stable debt ratio thanks to 2 percent growth and 2 percent inflation. On this economy I impose 5 years of tightening at the rate of 1 percent of potential GDP each year, with a multiplier of 1.3 (which is about where recent estimates have been converging). Output ends up 6.5 percent below the baseline; debt looks like this:

Why does this matter? As the paper says,

Although this effect is not long-lasting and debt eventually declines, it could be an issue if financial markets focus on the short-term behavior of the debt ratio, or if country authorities engage in repeated rounds of tightening in an effort to get the debt ratio to converge to the official target.

(My emphasis).

And, of course, this destructive behavior is especially likely if said country authorities are firm believers in the notion that austerity does not depress output; they’ll see the weak performance either as “structural” or as showing the need for more confidence. Either way, they’ll see it as a reason to tighten even more.

Sound like anyone you know?"

Americans have been living under Republican policies since Ronald Reagan. It is true that President George Herbert Walker Bush and President Clinton were far more fiscally responsible than the mathematically challenged and reality deficient Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. George Herbert Walker Bush and Bill Clinton raised taxes in light of exploding deficits which ultimately resulted in a ""nominal"" budget surplus.

America went from voodoo economics to a form of fiscally responsible supply side economics. They cleaned up Ronald Reagan’s fiscal mess. They however did not clean up his flawed middle-class-pilfering supply-side economics. In fact it could be argued that Clinton was complicit by signing the ""repeal"" of Glass Steagall even as he allowed further erosion of the social safety net.

When George W. Bush got appointed president in 2000 by the Supreme Court, the era of fiscally irresponsible supply side economics returned on steroids. It was tax cuts justified by the discredited Laffer Curve all over again.

Enough Democrats never fought against the irresponsibility of the Republicans. Who wants to be on record opposing tax cuts? Republicans never worry about deficits if they are attributed to tax cuts or corporate welfare. Deficits only matter when related to the social safety net (Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, etc.)

Since the inception of supply side economics, the income and wealth of the middle class have been on a steady decline. This occurred even as the wealth and income of the top one percent have been increasing way above the rate of inflation. Even during the prosperous 1990s and parts of the 2000s, the working middle class was living a semblance of prosperity aided by financial bubbles and easy credit that ultimately disintegrated. This is best explained by Professor of Economics Emeritus Richard D. Wolff. His documentary Capitalism Hits The Fan is also informative.

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. As you can read below the fold, this applies to both Democrats and Republicans."
http://news.yahoo.com/iowa-governor-calls-agents-firing-fair-just-175818192.html,,[],Iowa governor calls agent's firing 'fair and just',"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Gov. Terry Branstad on Thursday called the firing of a veteran criminal investigator ""fair and just,"" asserting that it had nothing to do with the agent's complaint about speeding by the governor's vehicle.

Branstad rejected what he called ""false accusations"" that his administration retaliated against Larry Hedlund. The governor called on Hedlund to allow the release of a 500-page investigative report into his conduct, saying that would tell the public the full story.

Hedlund was fired Wednesday by the Iowa Department of Public Safety after a 25-year career over what it called discourteous behavior. A termination document said Hedlund, a special agent in charge with the Division of Criminal Investigation, sent emails to subordinates making ""negative and disrespectful comments"" about department leaders and policies.

Hedlund was placed on leave May 1, days after he filed a complaint to superiors about a high-speed pursuit involving Branstad's SUV. Hedlund contends his firing was retaliation for filing that complaint and intends to file a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination.

Branstad said he was comfortable with Hedlund's firing after department officials briefed him Thursday. He said the problems with Hedlund started before the speeding incident, and department officials didn't think lesser disciplinary action would solve them.

""They felt for morale and for safety and the well-being of the department, this was action that was necessary,"" Branstad said at a news conference. ""I believe what they did was a fair and just decision.""

Hedlund, 55, initiated the pursuit after an SUV that zipped past him April 26 doing ""a hard 90"" mph on Highway 20, a major four-lane highway that runs east-west across the state and has a 65 mph limit. He asked dispatchers to send a trooper to make a stop. A trooper clocked the SUV at 84 mph and raced to catch up, but didn't stop the vehicle after seeing it was another trooper who was driving Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds.

Hedlund sent DCI Director Chari Paulson an email April 29 complaining that the pursuit endangered public safety and that the governor shouldn't be above the law. She responded by asking Hedlund why he was driving his vehicle on a scheduled vacation day. Within days, he was removed from duty and facing misconduct allegations.

The department launched a review of the two troopers involved in the pursuit only after audio and video of the incident was made public this month. Branstad said that review should be completed next week.

Hedlund's attorney, Tom Duff, said that he and his client have not been given the full investigative report, which he will release as long as he can review the document first. State rules treat personnel documents as confidential.

""If there's some suggestion that we're trying to hide the ball, nothing could be further from the truth,"" Duff said.

He said it will be up to a jury to decide whether the firing was retaliation against Hedlund, who had no prior discipline.

Rep. Clel Baudler, R-Greenfield, a retired trooper who chairs the Public Safety committee, said it was unfortunate that Hedlund's complaint put two troopers under scrutiny. Asked whether he supported Hedlund's firing, he said, ""If you have a cancer, you cut it out.""

""I bleed brown so I'm a little prejudiced,"" Baudler said, referring to troopers' uniforms.

Amid criticism that he lived by a special set of rules on the road, Branstad announced steps to address other issues the case raised.

Branstad said he met with the leader of the Iowa State Patrol unit that provides his transportation and security, telling him to instruct troopers to always follow speed limits except in emergency situations.

Branstad ordered the Iowa Department of Transportation to review a policy that allows government vehicles involved in sensitive work to receive license plates that are kept out of computerized databases. The designation is meant for security but also means cities with red light and speed cameras do not issue them tickets.

Branstad said it was unacceptable that 3,200 plates have been issued with that designation, a fact revealed by The Associated Press this week, and the review should reduce that number.

""Nobody is above the law,"" he said. ""We public servants need to lead by example.""

Branstad said his own vehicle's plates — which could not be identified by troopers who pursued it — would be part of the review. When Branstad was governor from 1982 to 1998, he noted his car was easily identifiable, with the plate, ""1.""

The executive director of Progress Iowa, a liberal group that has been lambasting Branstad over the case, said he was disappointed that Branstad didn't take personal responsibility for speeding. The group has been handing out yellow ""Branstad on Board"" bumper stickers — a spoof of ""Baby on Board"" stickers — that read: ""Speed limits do not apply.""

""Today was just about getting political heat off the governor,"" Matt Sinovic said."

Chris Christie of New Jersey is resigning after state lawmakers questioned whether lane closings on the George Washington Bridge that led to extensive traffic backups in September were politically motivated.

The official, David Wildstein, will resign as the director of interstate capital projects at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on Jan. 1, according to a letter he wrote to the agency’s deputy executive director, Bill Baroni. The resignation was first reported by The Record newspaper, of northern New Jersey. Mr. Wildstein said in the letter that the lane closing issue had become “a distraction.”

The agency reduced the number of access lanes to the bridge without prior notice, causing traffic delays in Fort Lee, N.J., from Sept. 9 to 13. Mr. Baroni told a panel of lawmakers last month that Mr. Wildstein had ordered the lane closings as part of a traffic study.

But Democrats raised concerns that the decision could have been political because Fort Lee’s mayor, Mark Sokolich, declined to endorse Governor Christie for re-election. Mr. Christie has denied any involvement in the closings."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/02/farm-bill-2013_n_3534276.html,2013-07-02 00:00:00,"['Senior Politics Editor', 'Senior Reporter']","Tom Vilsack To GOP: The '80s Called, They Want Their Attacks On Food Stamps Back","WASHINGTON -- Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Republicans' obsession with cutting food stamps is symptomatic of a 1980s state of mind.

""This is not a situation where we're back in the '80s where there was this push for welfare reform because people were perceived to be gaming the system,"" said Vilsack. ""That's not the case here.""

In an interview with The Huffington Post, Vilsack said House Republican leadership's failure to move a farm bill, which included nearly $80 billion per year in food stamp subsidies, could pose major harm to the agriculture community.

He also predicted that the GOP was harming itself politically, having spent the last election lambasting President Barack Obama as the ""Food Stamp President"" to no success.

""I think the reason why they haven't been particularly successful with this argument is that maybe the American people recognize these food assistance programs are helping people who are struggling through no fault of theirs,"" Vilsack said, ""or who have worked their entire lives but are now living on a very small and meager Social Security check, or dealing with a disability that makes it very difficult if not impossible for them to work. I think Americans have understanding and compassion for these people.""

Republicans in Congress disagree. Last month, GOP leadership brought to the floor a bill that would have cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by more than $20 billion and given states leeway to drug test recipients. To the surprise of leadership itself, the measure failed to pass, as conservative Republicans argued the cuts weren't deep enough and that the rest of the bill represented a giveaway to agribusiness. Democrats, for their part, said the food stamp cuts went too far and only a handful of them ended up supporting the legislation.

It's the second consecutive year the traditional alliance between urban and rural lawmakers has failed to get a farm bill through the House. With lawmakers now at an impasse, Republicans are entertaining the idea of splitting the bill in two, and attempting to pass agricultural subsidies and food stamp payments separately.

""I'd be very concerned if I were a farmer or rancher or producer if these bills were split,"" Vilsack said, adding that food stamps don't need congressional reauthorization to continue. ""On the other hand, some of these farm programs, they come up every five years and historically the way they get passed is for that coalition between urban suburban and rural legislators understanding that there's something in this bill that speaks to their constituents.""

Vilsack said that if Republicans wanted to reform nutrition assistance or crop subsidies, keeping them together in a farm bill is their best chance to do so. Agriculture and nutrition advocacy lobbyists generally agree that the nutrition and farm assistance should stay together.

The top Democrat in the House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), argued a twin-bill package would fail to make it through the lower chamber. (He himself said he would vote against the food stamp portion of such a package, arguing the cuts would be too deep.) Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), meanwhile, urged House leadership to simply take up the Senate's version of the farm bill, pledging that he would not support a stopgap fix like the one-year extension that was passed last year.

Vilsack said that if current agriculture laws are allowed to expire at the end of September it would have damaging effects, both globally, by harming trade relations, and locally, by raising milk prices.

""We spend a lot less on our food as a percentage of our income than most people around the world do,"" Vilsack said. ""It gives us a lot of flexibility with our paychecks that sometimes we fail to recognize or appreciate farmers for what they get to us."""

Mr. Stone owns the Atlas Cafe in the city’s Mission District, and the new law directed him to provide his 21 employees with one hour of paid time off for every 30 hours worked, up to nine days a year. “Basically, it’s just going to make it more expensive to operate your business,” Mr. Stone told NPR at the time. “Small business is going to have to pass that cost onto their customers.”

Six years later, Mr. Stone admits to having been a little alarmist about paid sick leave. “As a small restaurant business, it’s really hard to make money, and when they add another requirement, it makes you nervous,” Mr. Stone said in a recent interview. “But all and all, I actually think it’s a good thing.”

This spring, paid sick leave came up for vigorous debate in cities around the country. Portland, Ore., passed a law in March, and New York followed suit last week when the City Council overrode a veto by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. In Philadelphia, sick-leave legislation died after Mayor Michael Nutter vetoed it. In each case, the same concerns about the bill — that it is unnecessary and intrusive, and especially expensive and burdensome for small businesses — have surfaced.

At a contentious six-hour New York City Council meeting in March, representatives of at least a dozen trade associations testified against the bill. Jay Peltz, representing independent grocers, called it “a de facto annual $800 million tax increase.” Those arguments appeared to carry the day in the half-dozen states that have passed laws this year prohibiting cities and towns from enacting their own sick-leave laws. But in San Francisco, the District of Columbia and the state of Connecticut, places that have had such laws in force for more than a year (Seattle adopted one in September), it can be difficult to find small-business owners who say they have been hampered by the law’s obligations — though some object in principle."

Looking back, what I should have done the day after the election was to make it clear the House has passed a bill to extend all of the current tax rates, the House has passed a bill to replace the sequester with cuts in mandatory spending, and the Senate ought to do its work. We’re ready, able and willing to work with the Senate as soon as they produce a bill. It should have been what I said. You know, again, hindsight is 20-20.

Instead, Boehner opened the negotiations with a press conference announcing Republican concessions. In an attempt to appear temperate and moderate, Boehner discarded the principle that Republicans would not embrace higher taxes – a move that Obama quickly turned against Boehner, insisting that higher taxes would be the solution to any debt crisis.

Boehner now recognizes the problem with his strategy, and vows not to engage in any one-on-one negotiations with Obama in the future; instead, he says he will only allow bills to be passed in the House, then in the Senate, as provided for by the Constitution. The House threat to Boehner’s speakership, which was covered in depth by Breitbart News, apparently frightened Boehner enough to change course. “You have no idea the suspicions and the undercurrents that [negotiations with Obama] caused, frankly, a lot of my members,” said Boehner. “It really has, in fact, caused somewhat of a breach that I’ve been in the middle of trying to repair.”

Boehner is engaged in rehabilitating his image, attempting to overcome perceptions that he has the tendency to cave to President Obama:

Some of our members don’t realize that while I may be a nice enough guy, and I get along with people, when I was voting I had the 8th most conservative voting record in the House. But a lot of our newer members – they don’t know that. And so, you know, they think I’m some squish, that I’m ready to sell them out in a heartbeat, when obviously, most of you in this room know that that ain’t quite who I am.

The best way to overcome that perception is to stand up to the bully president. Unless Boehner embraces that truth, he will continue to lose favor among members of his own caucus.

Bergo, director of contracting at Joint Base Andrews, speaks about the importance of using the Federal Acquisition Regulation manual. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)

This past week, the Department of Veterans Affairs bought $562,000 worth of artwork.

In a single day, the Agriculture Department spent $144,000 on toner cartridges.

And, in a single purchase, the Coast Guard spent $178,000 on “Cubicle Furniture Rehab.”

This string of big-ticket purchases was an unmistakable sign: It was “use it or lose it” season again in Washington.

All week, while Congress fought over next year’s budget, federal workers were immersed in a separate frantic drama. They were trying to spend the rest of this year’s budget before it is too late.

The reason for their haste is a system set up by Congress that, in many cases, requires agencies to spend all their allotted funds by Sept. 30.

If they don’t, the money becomes worthless to them on Oct. 1. And — even worse — if they fail to spend the money now, Congress could dock their funding in future years. The incentive, as always, is to spend.

So they spent. It was the return of one of Washington’s oldest bad habits: a blitz of expensive decisions, made by agencies with little incentive to save.

Private contractors — worried that sequestration would result in a smaller spending rush this year — brought in food to keep salespeople at their desks. Federal workers quizzed harried colleagues in the hallways, asking if they had spent it all yet.

“The way we budget [money] sets it up,” said Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.). “Because instead of being praised for not spending all your money, you get cut for not spending all your money. And so we’ve got a perverse incentive in there.” But, Coburn said, “nobody’s talking about it but me and you.”

View Graphic Agencies are rushing to spend their remaining budget before Sept. 30.

Coburn said he had meant to mention it in his floor speech Wednesday. Then, when he got to the podium, he forgot.

“Use it or lose it” season is not marked on any official government calendars. But in Washington, it is as real as Christmas. And as lucrative.

And — it appears — about as permanent.

“We cannot expect our employees to believe that cost reduction efforts are serious if they see evidence of opportunistic spending in the last days of the Fiscal Year,” President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote to underlings in May 1965. Even then, Johnson said an end-of-year binge was “an ancient practice — but that does not justify it or excuse it.”

Today, government spending on contracts still spikes at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

In 2012, for instance, the government spent $45 billion on contracts in the last week of September, according to calculations by the fiscal-conservative group Public Notice. That was more than any other week — 9 percent of the year’s contract spending money, spent in 2 percent of the year.

Much of it is spent smartly, on projects that had already gone through an extensive review.

But not all of it.

In 2010, for instance, the Internal Revenue Service had millions left over in an account to hire new personnel. The money would expire at year’s end. Its solution was not a smart one.

The IRS spent the money on a lavish conference. Which included a “Star Trek” parody video starring IRS managers. Which was filmed on a “Star Trek” set that the IRS paid to build. (Sample dialogue: “We’ve received a distress call from the planet NoTax.”)

“That is a major problem,” acting IRS commissioner Daniel I. Werfel told Congress in June, explaining the role of “use it or lose it” in that debacle.

Other end-of-year mistakes are less spectacular — but they still cause problems. One recent study, for instance, found that information technology contracts signed at year’s end often produced noticeably worse results than those signed in calmer times.

And late-September waste also weighs on its witnesses, federal workers. After President Obama set up an online suggestion box for federal workers, many asked to get rid of the “use it or lose it” system. They suggested “rolling over” money for use in the next year. And they listed dumb things they had seen bought: three years’ worth of staples. Portable generators that never got used. One said the National Guard bought so much ammunition that firing it all became a chore.

“When you get BORED from shooting MACHINE GUNS, there is a problem,” an anonymous employee wrote.

“People want to do the right thing,” said Dean Sinclair, a former State Department employee who is crusading to change the system. “It’s not that the federal workforce is filled with bad people. The system sort of forces them to make bad decisions.”

He suggests giving bonuses to managers who return leftover money to the Treasury at year’s end. “It takes time and effort to waste money,” Sinclair said. “Remember that.”

Obama, like presidents before him, has exhorted agencies to plan better and avoid rushed decisions at year’s end. But the White House says Congress is making that job harder.

Instead of approving full-year spending bills, the gridlocked legislature has been handing out money with “continuing resolutions” that last only a few weeks or months. So nobody’s certain about their funding until later in the year. So the rush gets more rushed.

This year, finally, September came.

For contractors around Washington — battered by sequestration, budget cuts and the end of wars — this was the month they had been waiting for. “The flush,” one analyst called it. A flood of money had been backed up inside agencies hampered by furloughs.

“Twenty-five percent of my business, right, will happen in this month. Twenty-five percent of my year,” said Art Richer, the president of ImmixGroup, a contractor in Tysons Corner that helps software and computing companies seeking government business.

September in Washington used to be a time for selling face to face. Contractors visited the Pentagon. Small-town mayors queued up in the hallways at the Commerce Department, waiting to make a late-night pitch for grants.

But those buildings are off-limits now. So you sell from your desk. You sell with your voice. You sell with empathy, for the poor harried bureaucrat on the other end of the line. “Answer the phone smiling,” Richer tells his people.

Of course, the feds were stressed.

“We see them in the hallway, and you go, ‘How much money are we going to lose?’ ” one Army officer said this past week. That officer was involved in setting budgets for future years, and the meaning was clear: How much money are you not going to spend? Whatever that number was, it would be taken out of budgets for fiscal 2015, too.

This is not normal math. But this was not a normal time in Washington: You didn’t save money to spend it later. You spent now, to spend later. “They know they’re under the gun,” the officer said, who spoke anonymously to talk about internal budgeting discussions.

On Monday, Immix began bringing its sales team three catered meals a day. If workers walked to Subway, they might lose a sale. On that day, Immix handled $16 million in business. A normal Monday is about $2 million.

Across the government, agencies were making big-ticket purchases — buying things with this year’s money that could be used next year.

On Monday, VA paid $27,000 for an order of photographs showing sunsets, mountain peaks and country roads. They would go into a new center serving homeless veterans in Los Angeles; a spokeswoman described the art as “motivational and calming, professionally designed to enhance clinical operations.”

On Tuesday, the USDA bought $127,000 worth of toner cartridges (“end of year,” the order explained). VA spent another $220,000 on artwork for its hospitals.

On Wednesday, the Coast Guard paid $178,000 for cubicle furniture, replacing high-walled cubes with low-walled ones to improve the air flow in a large office area.

“Other higher-priority projects were not able to be executed, so they moved [money] to this lower-priority project” before the year’s end, said Coast Guard spokesman Carlos Diaz. “The money was going to be spent anyway.”

On Thursday, VA was buying art again. It spent $216,000 on artwork for a facility in Florida. In all, preliminary data showed that the agency made at least 18 percent of all its art purchases for the year in this one week. One-sixth of the buying in one-52nd of the year.

On Friday, the end was in sight.

“I feel good. Four days, right?” said Corey Forshee, a contracting officer at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Forshee was part of a team at Andrews that had done its best to beat the September rush.

The commander, trying to avoid a last-week rush, set his own deadline of Sept. 20. The pizza came early. The chaplain’s office visited early (“use it or lose it” season is traditionally stressful enough to get the chaplain involved). The buying was nearly done.

Now, they had to wait for the last act of the last act: the “fall-out money.”

This was cash that other parts of the Air Force had not been able to spend. It would be redistributed to this office at the last minute.

“We’re waiting for money for that,” Forshee said, going down a list of unfunded projects. A roof for the workout area. A bathroom renovation. “Just waiting for money,” he repeated.

Across Washington, everybody had to wait.

“It’s going to come down to Monday,” said Richer, at ImmixGroup. On Friday, he said his sales had been about equal to last year’s, despite worries about sequestration.

On Monday, Richer’s people will sell until midnight. Then they will keep selling. “Money rolls across the continent,” the feds say. Cash not spent in Washington might be spent by federal offices in California in the three hours before it is midnight there.

When it is midnight in California — 3 a.m. in Washington — they will keep on. There are federal offices in Hawaii, after all. And it will still be three hours until midnight there."
http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2013/10/16/Senate-Debt-Deal-Includes-Provision-Taking-Away-Congress-Power-To-Increase-Debt-Ceiling,2013-10-16 00:00:00,['Kerry Picket'],Senate Debt Deal Weakens Congress on Debt Ceiling,"Capitol Hill talk regarding the Senate deal apparently includes a provision that would take away the Congress’ power to increase the debt ceiling. According to Politico, it looks like the buzz appears to be true.:

The plan includes a proposal offered by McConnell in the 2011 debt ceiling crisis that allows Congress to disapprove of the debt ceiling increase, which means lawmakers will formally vote on whether to reject a debt ceiling increase until Feb. 7. Obama can veto that legislation if it passes. If Congress fails as expected to gather a two-thirds majority to override the veto, the debt ceiling would be raised.

National Journal reported last week:

Whether it’s four weeks from now or in one year, there’d be even less reason to put faith in a last-minute deal next time the U.S. is up against the debt limit.

There’s only one foolproof way to avoid a future crisis: Fundamentally change the way the debt ceiling works.

This approach isn’t all that radical. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., proposed a reform in January that would change the debt-ceiling mechanism so that Congress would vote to disapprove of an increase, as opposed to approving one. Such a change would limit debt-ceiling negotiations to a veto-proof majority, while still leaving Congress with some power.

The most interesting part of this proposal? It was originally floated in 2011 by Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell. The potential for a bipartisan deal here that fixes the debt-limit problem is real. Sen. Boxer continues to advocate for the change. Right now though, Harry Reid’s office says the senator is not considering any disapproval mechanism. But that could change as this process moves on.

Such a plan would be obviously good for Democrats, as they can get the immediate gratification of not having to risk default in order to fully implement the Affordable Care Act. But it’d be good for Republicans too, who could not only avoid the stigma of blame for a default, but also presumably reap the ruling-party rewards in future Congresses and presidencies. It would also put an immediate political target on President Obama, and Democrats by association, for being the sole entity responsible for raising the debt limit by over a trillion dollars. That opportunity has got to sound pretty good to Republicans ahead of 2014."

As Robert Schleshinger at US New & World Report explains:



DeMint, Cruz and their allies like to pose as champions of ""the American people"" battling against Washington elites trying to tell said populous what it should do. But DeMint here is taking arrogant Washington elitism to a whole new level, essentially telling ""the American people"" that they don't know what they really want or aren't capable of expressing their desires at the ballot box. Pay no mind to that pesky election, DeMint is saying, I know what the country wants better than some group of voters who weren't smart enough to understand esoteric concepts like ""Day one. Job one. Repeal Obamacare."" DeMint thinks he knows what voters want better than voters do. [...] DeMint, Cruz and their tea party pals don't need polls. Their certainty that they have a special knowledge of what America really wants is redolent of former half-term Gov. Sarah Palin's infamous remark about ""the real America"" and ""pro-America areas of this great nation."" It also stems from the same warped view of the country that prompted GOP megadonor Foster Friess to suggest earlier this year that urban votes should be discounted when measuring the size of President Obama's victory. DeMint, Cruz and Palin may well speak for what they view as the ""real America,"" but unfortunately for them they don't get to unskew the country any more than they get to unskew the results of last year's election.

The U.S. economy needs a national policy, not a patchwork of state and local laws. It’s time for a grand bargain on the federal minimum wage, one that recognizes that both sides in this seemingly endless debate have a point. A decent society can afford neither to price entry-level workers out of jobs nor to leave them completely without leverage in the labor market. The first step in reforming the federal minimum wage is to index it to inflation, thus eliminating the need for an act of Congress — and a rehearsal of the shopworn arguments — before every increase. Since there is a national consensus in favor of some minimum wage, if not its precise level, let’s take the politics out of maintaining its purchasing power. Both business and workers would benefit from stability and certainty; a federal minimum that kept up with inflation might also discourage state and local governments from acting separately. The second step is an increase, to make up for some of the purchasing power that has been lost in recent years. House Democrats want $10.10, which is a return to 1968’s all-time high in real terms; President Obama has suggested $9, the 1981 level. Given GOP opposition, neither is politically feasible.

Speaking of the economy, The Washington Post pens an editorial in favor of a national raise in the minimum wage:"

However, after Markos's new front page diary where he states ""The ONLY leverage Democrats have in this fight is tax rates,"" I feel like this is worth posting:

There is a lot of outrage on our side for ""giving up leverage"" and not tackling all of the major fiscal issues facing us, like the debt ceiling and sequestration, and instead focusing mainly on the tax cuts portion of the deal. Here's what I don't understand: For the last month, isn't this exactly what our side has been advocating for?

Post-thanksgiving, those of us on the left, from the president, to labor, to progressive organizations, and this website, had all been advocating for Congress to ""extend the middle class tax cuts now."" The President used the bully pulpit to call for the House to vote on the Senate bill to extend the Bush tax cuts for those making $250k or less. Nancy Pelosi tried to force a discharge petition through the House to force a vote. We were all asked to sign petitions and call our Congressperson to demand that taxes for the middle class be extended first, outside of the framework of the rest of the deal.

The logic for that was simple. If we extend the middle class tax cuts, two things are accomplished: 1. We take a significant part of the cliff worries off the table, which is that there were going to be major tax raises on the middle class and the poor. 2. We gain leverage because we just got one of our major priorities accomplished, which was to raise tax rates on the rich without having to deal with anything else in the deal first.

Both of these things gave us some protection if we went over the sequestration cliff, since it wouldn't be the big combination of factors that could push us into recession.

Now, as a side note, keep in mind that the Senate bill we were asking the House to vote on was only a one year extension of the middle class tax cuts. So instead of making the rates permanent, we would have kicked the can down the road till the end of this year and had to deal with more drama all over again.

Flash forward to yesterday: a deal emerged between the Vice President and Senate Republicans to handle part of the fiscal cliff, particularly on taxes, outside of dealing with the bigger issues. What did this deal include? We did give up one major concession, which is to increase the Bush Tax cuts for the first $450k of income instead of 250k income that we would have gotten under the Senate bill we've all been pushing. But we also got a heck of a lot of other stuff in return.

We extended unemployment benefits for a year without having to give an offset, we extended research and development tax credits for things like wind energy another year, while extending stimulus tax credits for lower income families another five. We also got the Medicare doc fix patched, so reimbursements don't get cut by 27%, the AMT patched, oh yeah, a freaking FARM BILL EXTENSION PASSED (which I have heard very few people mention, but is as huge a part of this deal as anything else).

So in order to get everything mentioned in the last paragraph, we compromised on the tax rates. How much did we really give up in terms of actual revenue? The answer is, not that much.

Again, the Senate middle class tax cut bill was only for a year, so it would have generated less revenue in an apples to oranges comparison. Let's make it an apple to apple comparison, and we would have extended them permanently. That would have generated about $700b in revenue over 10 years. How much did we end up getting in the tax cut deal? About $600b. So we ended up getting 85% of the original revenue we were aiming for.

Say what you want, but getting 85% of your original target in any negotiation where you don't hold all the cards (and despite what some may think, we don't. We don't control one of the three chambers, and until we fix the filibuster, we don't have full control over the second), is pretty damned good.

So now that we have this deal in place, everyone has changed their tune. Extending the middle class tax cuts on their own went from being our goal to being a bad thing. It went from something that strengthens our hand to something that weakens it? How and when exactly did this happen? Are you really going to tell me because we get 15% less revenue than we originally wanted that it went from a great idea to a bad idea?

We still have to deal with sequester. We still have to deal with debt ceiling. We were still going to have to deal with those even if we passed the Senate middle class tax cut bill.

These are things we are going to have to deal with, but in whatever deal we make, it's also going to be an opportunity to raise more revenues.

No one knows exactly how those negotiations are going to go, but the blueprint laid out in the mini-sequester deal was a pretty good one. It called for reducing the sequester by 50% new revenue, 25% defense cuts and 25% domestic spending. That's a pretty good blueprint moving forward. The President backed up this blueprint by holding that press conference before the vote letting Republicans know that if they vote for this deal, it's not all she wrote on revenues, and that 1:1 is the ratio he expects going forward on deficit reduction.

Many of you here believe the President will cave (which for some appears to mean not getting 100% of everything he asked for). Maybe he will, maybe he won't. My money is on getting most, but not all, of what he asks for going forward, but no one really knows. But conceding defeat before those negotiations even begin is really crappy political strategy.

I'm not saying the debt ceiling/sequester fight will be easy. It will be another shit show, going to the 11th hour, taking our country to the brink of default. But guess what? Be prepared for a lot of those over the next two years that the lunatics are still in charge of the House of Representatives. We're going to have government shutdown threats, more farm bill fights, and more fights on anything where the Republicans think they can use the well-being of the American people as a bargaining chip.

All this could be for naught if the Republicans go through with blowing up the deal. But if we get the deal we cut in the Senate, we are ahead going into the second quarter of a game with a lot left to play. Taking care of the tax cuts first was what we have been advocating for all along, and we should celebrate if it gets taken care of, not mourn it."

President Roosevelt signs Social Security Act on Aug. 14, 1935.

On August 14, 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, the foundation upon which the nation's social insurance guarantee to its citizens was built. A brilliant system, Social Security was designed so that everyone would contribute and everyone would receive. It was given a dedicated source of revenue, and has never contributed to the deficit. It's also saved millions from abject poverty. Like it's doing now

More than 60 million retired and disabled people are receiving Social Security. It provides more than half the monthly income for nearly 78 percent of those people. And it has kept a third of those people out of poverty.

Without Social Security, 21.4 million more Americans would be poor, according to the latest available Census data (for 2011). Although most of those whom Social Security keeps out of poverty are elderly, nearly a third are under age 65, including 1.1 million children. [...] Almost 90 percent of people aged 65 and older receive some of their family income from Social Security. Without Social Security benefits, 43.6 percent of elderly Americans would have incomes below the official poverty line, all else being equal; with Social Security benefits, only 8.7 percent do. These benefits lift some 14.5 million elderly Americans—including 8.7 million women—above the poverty line. [...] Social Security is important for children and their families as well as for the elderly. About 6 million children under age 18 (8 percent of all U.S. children) lived in families that received income from Social Security in 2011, according to Census data. This figure includes children who received their own benefits as dependents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers, as well as those who lived with parents or relatives who received Social Security benefits. In all, Social Security lifts 1.1 million children out of poverty.

In 2010, households whose income was in the middle fifth percentile of incomes had, on average, only $34,981 in individual retirement savings, while households in the top fifth of incomes averaged $308,674. Other than high-income households, who receive most of the federal subsidies for IRAs and 401(k)s, virtually no one has enough savings to generate substantial retirement income. Social Security wealth and retirement income, on the other hand, are broadly shared.

The Economic Policy Institute has more on the necessity of Social Security for the vast majority of Americans. Only the wealthy, EPI has found, can count on having enough income from private retirement accounts for financial security in old age.Social Security is essential. It has been for eight decades and will be even more so in the next few, as the nation lurches out of the Great Recession. It shouldn't be made a bargaining chip, it should be made a lure to try to make Republicans do the fiscally responsible thing.

It should be strengthened to last at least another 78 years.

Please join with Daily Kos and CREDO in telling the Senate to strengthen Social Security by INCREASING benefits."
http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/pension-proposal-aims-to-ease-burden-on-states-and-cities/,2013-07-09 00:00:00,['Mary Williams Walsh'],Pension Proposal Aims to Ease Burden on States and Cities,"Christopher Gregory/The New York Times

As states and cities wrestle with mounting pension woes, some even seeking refuge in bankruptcy, Washington has mostly stayed on the sidelines.

By law, the 50 states are sovereigns, so even though federal officials have regulated company pension plans for decades, they have had little interest in telling the states how to run theirs.

Now, one United States senator wants to change that. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has devised a way for states and cities to exit the pension business while still giving public workers the type of benefits they want. It involves a tax-law change that would enable governments to turn their pension plans over to life insurers.

Big players like MetLife and Prudential, to cite just two, might thus step into shoes now occupied by the likes of Calpers, California’s giant state pension system. Any such change would be voluntary, said Mr. Hatch, who plans to introduce enabling legislation on Tuesday. He and the Finance Committee’s Democratic chairman, Max Baucus of Montana, are committed to working on a tax overhaul package this year, and the public-pension change could be one part of that.

“America cannot continue sleepwalking into the financial disaster that awaits us if we do not get the public-pension debt crisis under control,” Mr. Hatch said. “The problem is getting more serious every day.”

Working with insurers would not suddenly make trillions of dollars appear, but Mr. Hatch said it would make costs more predictable and protect both retirees and taxpayers. The proposal “does not include an explicit or implicit government guarantee,” he said.

Aides said emphatically that insurers did not come up with this idea and talk the senator into promoting it. Mr. Hatch has been concerned about public pensions for some time, having issued his own study of their problems early last year. His report stated, among other things, that state pensions were a valid issue for federal lawmakers because of the likelihood that Washington would be called upon to bail one out at some point. Specialists working for the finance committee’s Republicans devised the insurance arrangement after extensive discussions with public-pension stakeholders, particularly unions that represent public workers.

In those talks, a committee staff member said, union officials were adamant about holding onto their members’ defined-benefit pensions, the type where workers receive a stream of predetermined monthly payments from retirement to death. In corporate America, many companies have been discontinuing such pension plans, not wanting to bear the investment risk they pose, especially as the population ages. Companies often give their workers 401(k) plans as a replacement, passing the investment risk to them.

Police unions in particular — an important constituency for Republicans — said their workers would not accept anything like that.

That is what prompted finance committee staff members to think about insurance companies. They, too, provide lifelong income to their customers — they just don’t call it a pension; they call it an annuity. Annuities can be devised in any number of ways, including precisely duplicating the terms of a worker’s pension. Senator Hatch’s staff eventually decided that shifting the states’ pension business to insurers was the only way to continue providing the monthly checks that public retirees want without forcing local taxpayers to come up with more money every time the stock market plunges. Life insurers would bear the investment risk, shielding both retirees and taxpayers.

Life insurers can also lose money over soured investments. But the states, which regulate insurance, have guarantee programs to protect policyholders in such cases. No backstop like that exists for public pensions, which is why benefits for older retirees in places like Prichard, Ala., and Central Falls, R.I., have been cut sharply after their municipal pension funds ran out of money.

Perhaps more important, state insurance regulators provide a kind of oversight unknown in the world of public pensions. They require insurance companies to meet capital requirements, taking into account the riskiness of their investments. Insurers are also required to hold more assets than they estimate they will need, and if they burn through their surpluses, state regulators can close them down.

Public pensions, by contrast, have no capital requirements and can make themselves look stronger by taking on more risk.

If Senator Hatch’s proposal were to become law, a local government that opted for insurance would hold competitive bidding once a year. The winning carrier would give each worker a contract, guaranteeing a retirement-to-death annuity amount for a year’s worth of work. Public employees’ unions would no longer negotiate the size of their members’ pensions; instead, they would negotiate how much the local employer would pay the insurer upfront. The annuity contracts would be portable, meaning workers would take theirs with them when they changed jobs.

This way, a worker retiring at the end of a 40-year career would have 40 annuity contracts, each representing the retirement income earned from a year’s work. An aide to Senator Hatch said an administrative body would have to be created to combine the contracts and issue a single check so the retiree would not receive 40 of them every month. But it would be not be a federal entity. The measure does not expand federal powers or impair states’ rights.

The real change would be in the federal tax code. The money that local governments set aside in public pension funds now clearly receives preferential tax treatment; money that it might pay an insurer does not. If a city or a state tried it, the Internal Revenue Service could say the money constituted income for the workers and require them to pay taxes on it.

If the bill became law, it would give the same tax preference to insurance premiums.

Insurers and their trade associations have already sent letters telling Senator Hatch they support his goals and will work with him on the legislative proposal. So has the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the trade association that represents the state guarantee systems. The biggest opposition is likely to come from public pension systems themselves. They now rely on contributions from workers to help close shortfalls and would lose some of that every time a local government shifted its business to the insurance industry. As envisioned by Senator Hatch, the annuity premiums would be paid solely by public employers; no employee contributions would be allowed."

Peters']",Bipartisan Budget Deal Forged in House Faces Opposition in Senate,"But considering the deal has been hailed for days as a critical turning point in Washington’s dysfunctional descent, its difficulties are a surprise. So far, Senator John McCain of Arizona is a declared Republican supporter, with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, a likely yes, at least to end debate and allow a final up-or-down vote.

“I’m not O.K. with it, but I think it’s better than shutting down the government,” Mr. McCain said.

The trouble with the budget deal came as the Senate worked past another political crisis. The partisan tension over a rules change that limited the power of the filibuster and infuriated Republicans eased Friday as both parties said they were calling a weekend cease-fire that will allow them to move on to more pressing issues next week like the unfinished budget and a major Pentagon policy bills.

If the mood for most of the week was sour, on Friday senators seemed more exhausted than anything else, having endured two late-night sessions in a row. Because senators were on the floor at virtually all hours, they worked in shifts. Democrats occupied the presiding officer’s chair while Republicans took turns speaking from the floor to denounce what they said was an effort to stifle debate and dissent.

But the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, announced late Friday morning that he would allow senators to go home for the weekend and return Monday evening to continue voting on a backlog of President Obama’s nominees. By Tuesday they could start debating the budget bill. They also would likely vote on the nomination of Janet L. Yellen to lead the Federal Reserve.

“We’re doing our utmost to finish our business here a week from today so that we can go home for Christmas,” Mr. Reid said. “I personally thank the senators for their cooperation this week.”

Mr. McCain summed up the thaw, saying: “Both sides didn’t want to work over the weekend. Come on! The zeal sometimes dissipates when you get into Thursday. And by Friday, it’s gone.”"

Although the poll shows that people generally are looking forward to the new year with optimism and no blatant sense of foreboding, it also unmasks pent-up worries about international crises and instability, and concerns at home about the standard of living, health care and schools.

What the public thought of 2013:

GOOD YEAR OR GOOD RIDDANCE?

On the whole, Americans rate their own experience in 2013 more positively than negatively. But when asked to assess the year for the United States or the world at large, things turn sour.

—All told, 32 percent say 2013 was a better year for them than 2012, while 20 percent say it was worse and 46 percent say the two years were really about the same. Young people were more apt to see improvement: 40 percent of people under age 30 called 2013 a better year than 2012, compared with 25 percent of people age 65 or older.

—The public splits evenly on how the year turned out for the country, 25 percent saying it was better than 2012, 25 percent saying it was worse. As with most questions about the state of affairs in the U.S. these days, there's a sharp partisan divide. Democrats are more apt to say the U.S. turned out better in 2013 than 2012 (37 percent) than are Republicans (17 percent).

—Thinking about the world at large, 30 percent say 2013 was worse than 2012, while just 20 percent say it was better.

But the outlook for the new year is positive: 49 percent think their own fortunes will improve in 2014, 14 percent are anticipating the new year to be a downgrade from the old. Thirty-four percent say they don't expect much to change.

WHERE'S THE PARTY?

Most Americans — 54 percent — say they'll be ringing in the new year at home, while 1 in 5 are heading to a friend's or family member's house. Only 8 percent say they'll go to a bar, restaurant or other organized event.

Story continues

—Younger Americans are least apt to spend the holiday at home: 39 percent of those under age 30 will celebrate at home, 33 percent at someone else's home, 13 percent at a bar or other venue.

—Regardless of their own time zone, nearly 6 in 10 say they'll watch at least some of the celebration from New York City's Times Square.

COUNTDOWN COMPANIONS

Wherever they're spending the holiday, most Americans prefer the company of family. Asked with whom they want to be when the clock strikes midnight, 83 percent name a family member.

—On a holiday often sealed with a kiss, nearly 4 in 10 say they most want to be next to their spouse, and 13 percent cite a significant other or romantic interest as a preferred companion. Parents like to be with their children, more than the children like to be with their parents.

—Less conventional choices: 2 percent cite their pets, 3 percent God, Jesus or their religious congregation, and less than 1 percent said they wanted to ring it in with their co-workers.

—Of course, some opt out altogether: 18 percent say they're not planning to celebrate on New Year's Eve, and 9 percent say there's no one with whom they'd like to party, preferring instead their pillow, TiVo or their own thoughts.

WHAT MATTERED IN NEWS

Asked to name the most important news story of the year, 26 percent of Americans cited the implementation of the health care law. That story also came out on top in an Associated Press survey of news directors and editors, in which 45 of 144 journalists surveyed called the health care roll out their top story.

In the AP-Times Square poll, the death of former South African President Nelson Mandela occurred as the poll was underway. It rose quickly, with 8 percent naming it as the most important news of the year, matching the share citing the federal government's budget difficulties or shutdown.

A separate question asked respondents to rate the importance of several news stories for them personally. The budget fight, which led to a partial shutdown of the federal government in October, was rated extremely or very important by 60 percent of Americans, and prompted rare bipartisan agreement. About two-thirds in each major party — 65 percent of Republicans and 63 percent of Democrats — rated it highly important.

A majority said the Boston Marathon bombings were extremely or very important, and 47 percent considered the national debate over gun laws that important.

POP CULTURE: MOSTLY FORGETTABLE MOMENTS

Miley Cyrus's MTV Video Music Awards performance. The launch of ""Lean In."" Apologies from Paula Deen and Lance Armstrong. Walter White's exit and the entrance of the Netflix series ""House of Cards."" What do they all have in common? More Americans say these pop culture moments were more forgettable than memorable.

Just one pop culture moment was deemed more memorable than forgettable: The birth of Prince George to Britain's Prince William and his wife, Kate.

—Among men, 64 percent called the debate on work-life balance sparked by the book ""Lean In"" and other writings forgettable. About half of women agreed.

—About 1 in 5 younger Americans said the launch of original programming through streaming services like Netflix or Hulu was a memorable moment, about doubling the share among those age 50 and up.

—Residents of the West were more likely than others to consider memorable the San Francisco ""Batkid"" (31 percent) or the final season of the series ""Breaking Bad"" (19 percent).

The AP-Times Square New Year's Eve Poll was conducted by GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications from Dec. 5-9 and involved online interviews with 1,367 adults. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for all respondents. The poll is a cooperative effort between AP and the organizers of the Times Square New Year's Eve Celebration, the Times Square Alliance and Countdown Entertainment. The Alliance is a non-profit group that seeks to promote Times Square, and Countdown Entertainment represents the owners of One Times Square and the New Year's Eve Ball Drop.

The survey was conducted using KnowledgePanel, a probability-based Internet panel designed to be representative of the U.S. population. Respondents to the survey were first selected randomly, using phone or mail survey methods, and were later interviewed online. People selected for KnowledgePanel who didn't otherwise have access to the Internet were provided with the ability to access the Internet at no cost to them.

It%27s not so clear that unequal incomes are the biggest problem America faces.

More serious is the divide between people with jobs and those who live off of government benefits.

This problem of %22work inequality%22 isn%27t addressed by Obama%2C and%2C in fact%2C is exacerbated by his programs.

Last week, President Obama gave a much-touted speech on ""income inequality."" But while inequality is a valid concern, it's not so clear that unequal incomes are the biggest problem America faces.

More troubling -- as figures as distinct as Slate's Matthew Yglesias and National Review's Mark Steyn both noted -- is the growing divide between an America where people have jobs, and an America where people live off of government benefits.

As Yglesias observed:

The Washington, D.C., metropolitan area has become an island of prosperity in an ailing country. But D.C. itself has an 8.9% unemployment rate even as it sits at the center of a metro-area unemployment rate of just 5.4%. For people who haven't gone to college — the kind of people who live in the neighborhood where Obama was speaking — the unemployment rate is 20%. That's a disaster. And while Obama talked about plenty of things that could help those unemployed families — subsidized health care, better schools for their kids — he didn't really talk about anything that would get them jobs. The biggest applause line of the speech was about raising the minimum wage, which is great, but also doesn't help you very much if your current wage is $0.

And Steyn weighs in on a similar note:

'Work' and 'purpose' are intimately connected: Researchers at the University of Michigan, for example, found that welfare payments make one unhappier than a modest income honestly earned and used to provide for one's family. 'It drains too much of the life from life,' said Charles Murray in a speech in 2009. 'And that statement applies as much to the lives of janitors — even more to the lives of janitors — as it does to the lives of CEOs.' Self-reliance — 'work' — is intimately connected to human dignity — 'purpose.' So what does every initiative of the Obama era have in common? Obamacare, Obamaphones, Social Security disability expansion, 50 million people on food stamps. ... The assumption is that mass, multigenerational dependency is now a permanent feature of life. A coastal elite will devise ever smarter and slicker trinkets, and pretty much everyone else will be a member of either the dependency class or the vast bureaucracy that ministers to them.

Even if incomes are equal, in other words, they're not really equal if one is earned, and the other is merely bestowed. (This is often true even when the incomes in question are large ones, as trust-fund types are notoriously prone to being aimless and dissolute.)

This problem of ""work inequality"" isn't addressed by President Obama, and, in fact, is exacerbated by his programs. Increased dependency on the government may have its political advantages -- as The Rainmakers sang in their 1980s hit, Government Cheese, ""They'll turn us all into beggars 'cause they're easier to please"" -- but it's incompatible with the notion of social equality that underlies American democracy. Beggars, even if they're doing pretty well, are dependents, and a dependent class can never really be equal members of the polity.

In science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle's future history from the 1970s, 21st century America became divided into two classes: ""Citizens,"" dependent on government, mostly residing in ""welfare islands"" where drugs and sex provided a substitute for purpose, and ""Taxpayers,"" who actually had jobs and enjoyed certain additional legal privileges. That future seemed farfetched, then. It seems less so now, as President Obama talks about ""Promise Zones"" for the poor.

So why is President Obama less interested in the shortage of jobs and more focused on mere ""income inequality?"" I think there are two reasons. First, while expanding the dependency class might be bad for America (and for the dependents), it's good for the political party that passes out the pork. And second -- and this is more troubling -- I think that Obama has no idea how to address the underlying jobs problem. Let's hope our next president has some better ideas.

http://news.yahoo.com/factbox-happen-u-government-shuts-down-234308708--business.html,,[],Factbox: What would happen if the U.S. government shuts down?,"(Reuters) - A partial shutdown of the U.S. government will begin at midnight on Monday if Republicans and Democrats fail to agree on a funding bill. In a government shutdown, spending for essential functions related to national security or public safety would continue along with benefit programs such as Medicare health insurance and Social Security retirement benefits for seniors. But civilian federal employees - from people who process forms and handle regulatory matters to workers at national parks and museums - would be furloughed. The last government shutdown ran from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996, putting about 800,000 federal workers on furlough. Here is a roundup of the expected impact of a shutdown. FEDERAL WORKERS Up to 1 million U.S. federal workers could face furloughs without pay beginning on Oct 1. Most federal agency workers would be furloughed, but a small number of ""excepted"" employees must continue to work. These include security workers such as air traffic controllers and prison guards. Congressional staffers could work if requested by the lawmaker or committee that employs them. Congress has previously paid federal workers for their furlough days. Federal workers could face penalties if they tried to do any work during the furlough. FINANCIAL MARKET CONSEQUENCES Apart from potential market swings, companies hoping to raise money in an initial public offering could face delays. Businesses will still be able to file certain documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but the agency said on Friday that processing and approving applications will be discontinued during a shutdown. ""Capital-raising will have a huge hiccup if the SEC shuts down as it has said,"" said Eric Jensen, a partner with law firm Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, California. Drug companies waiting for a decision from the Food and Drug Administration could also see delays. The FDA said it would continue ""limited activities"" related to programs that are paid for by user fees from drug approval applications. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS A shutdown lasting less than two weeks would not hurt big defense contractors, which can survive temporarily without federal contract payments, said ratings agency Standard & Poor's. But a longer shutdown could weaken the financial profiles and liquidity positions of smaller defense contractors. ""It is felt a heck of a lot more keenly by small contractors,"" said Bradley Wine, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster's government contracts practice. MEAT INSPECTORS Meat inspectors for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, considered necessary to national safety would stay on job. U.S. ARMED SERVICES All military personnel would continue in a normal duty status. But a large number of civilian employees would be temporarily furloughed, according to the Pentagon. Official furlough notices would be issued on October 1 if no agreement to fund the government has been reached. FEDERAL COURTS Federal courts will remain open for about 10 business days. By October 15, the Judiciary will need to provide more guidance. The Supreme Court, which is scheduled to start its fall 2013 session on October 7, declined to comment on whether it has plans for a government shutdown. But a court spokesman noted that in past shutdown situations, the court continued operating as normal. IRS The Internal Revenue Service has a major tax due date on October 15 for Americans who got an extension to file their 2012 taxes, which were due on April 15. The IRS will be accepting tax returns and other tax payments during a shutdown, but will suspend many other activities, including audits. About 90 percent of the IRS's 90,000 workforce would be furloughed, the agency said on Monday, meaning call centers would be closed and audits halted. HEALTHCARE LAW President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law is scheduled to debut on October 1 when people can start shopping for health insurance. Money to fund implementation of the healthcare law, known as Obamacare, has already been committed. (Complied by Washington bureau reporters.)"

Burdened with college debt or toiling in low-wage jobs, they are delaying careers, marriage and having children. Waiting anxiously for their lucky break, they are staying put and doubling up with roommates or living with Mom and dad, unable to make long-term plans or commit to buying a home — let alone pay a mortgage.

Many understood after the 2007-2009 recession that times would be tough. But few say they expected to be in economic limbo more than four years later.

""I'm constantly looking for other jobs,"" says Jeremy Bills, 27, of Nashville, Tenn., who graduated from Vanderbilt University in May 2011 with a master's degree in human and organizational development. Originally from Tampa, Fla., Bills has stayed put in his college town in hopes of finding a job in management consulting or human resources. Instead, he has mostly found odd jobs like pulling weeds and dog-sitting.

Bills says he pursued a master's degree to bolster his credentials after getting his college diploma in 2008, shortly before the financial meltdown. Instead, he finds himself still struggling financially and worrying that the skills he learned in school — where he incurred $20,000 in student loan debt — are ""kind of atrophying right now.""

""It's not like riding a bicycle. You can't just jump into a career position so many years after training,"" said Bills, who now works at a nonprofit organization making $12 an hour and is looking for a second job.

Among adults ages 25-29, just 4.9 million, or 23.3 percent, moved in the 12 months ending March 2013. That's down from 24.6 percent in the same period the year before. It was the lowest level since at least 1963. The peak of 36.7 percent came in 1965, during the nation's youth counterculture movement.

Story continues

The past year's decline in migration came after a modest increase from 2011 to 2012, a sign that young adults remain tentative about testing the job market in other cities.

By metropolitan area, Portland, Ore., Austin, Texas, and Houston were among the top gainers in young adults, reflecting stronger local economies. Among college graduates 25 and older, Denver and Washington, D.C., topped the list of destinations.

Demographers say the delays in traditional markers of adulthood — full-time careers and homeownership — may prove to be longer-lasting.

Roughly 1 in 5 young adults ages 25 to 34 is now disconnected from work and school.

""Young adulthood has grown much more complex and protracted, with a huge number struggling to reach financial independence,"" said Mark Mather, an associate vice president at the private Population Reference Bureau. ""Many will get there, but at much later ages than we've seen in the past. More and more we're seeing many young adults routinely wait until their 30s to leave the parental nest.""

The overall decline in migration among young adults is being driven largely by a drop in local moves within a county, which fell to the lowest level on record. Out-of-state moves also fell, from 3.8 percent in 2012 to 3.4 percent, but remained higher than a 2010 low of 3.2 percent.

Young adults typically make long-distance moves to seek a new career, while those who make local moves often do so when buying a home.

While homeownership across all age groups fell by 3 percentage points to 65 percent from 2007 to 2012, the drop-off among adults 25-29 was much larger — more than 6 percentage points, from 40.6 percent to 34.3 percent. That reflects in part tighter lines of credit after the 2006 housing bust. Declines in homeownership for those ages 40 and older over in that five-year period were more modest.

The District of Columbia, with its high share of young adults, had the lowest homeownership rate across all age groups at 41.6 percent, followed by New York at 53.9 percent. West Virginia had the highest homeownership rate at 72.9 percent.

In terms of births, the birth rate for all women of childbearing age — 63 births per 1,000 women — was essentially flat in 2012 from the year before.

Meanwhile, overall migration among adults 55 and older held steady at 4.4 percent from 2012 to 2013, up from a low of 4 percent in 2011. Metro areas with the biggest gains included Phoenix, Atlanta, Denver and several in Florida. Many cities in the Northeast, Midwest and coastal areas posted losses.

""The post-recession period has given a bigger boost to seniors than to young adults in their willingness to try out new places for retirement,"" said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who analyzed the figures. ""Many young adults, especially those without college degrees, are still stuck in place.""

""For them, low mobility might be more than a temporary lull and could turn into the 'new normal.'""

The wait continues for Eric Hall, 30, of Decatur, Ga. After picking up a master's degree in public health in 2008, Hall moved from California to the Atlanta suburb with the plan of living with his parents for about six months.

Five years later, after struggling to find work in his field and switching his career path last year from health management to teaching kindergarten, Hall has opted to remain at his parents' home until he can pay off more debt. He is now studying to earn a doctorate in education, amassing college debt of more than $110,000.

""It's a bit restraining after going away to college two times, but I'm saving and my mom's been very understanding,"" said Hall, who is optimistic he'll soon be financially stable enough to live on his own. ""Maybe next summer.""

The demand came as a Senate subcommittee approved a Democratic plan to cut commercial property taxes that takes a different approach than the one backed by the Republican governor.

After several years of failed efforts to pass property tax cuts, Sen. Matt McCoy, D-Des Moines, said Branstad shouldn't try to ""cram his plan down our throats.""

""We are a separate and co-equal branch of government and we will insist that our views be considered with the same degree of respect,"" McCoy said. ""We won an election too. If we're going to have property tax relief it's going to have to involve compromise.""

Under the Democrats' plan, commercial property owners would gradually get a tax credit equivalent to a roughly 40 percent tax cut on their first $324,000 in assessed property value. Democrats said roughly 80 percent of the state's 116,900 commercial properties are assessed at or below $324,000 and that their plan would give bigger tax breaks to those businesses than Branstad's plan.

Branstad's plan gradually cuts taxable property assessments by 20 percent for all businesses at a cost of $350 million.

The Democratic proposal would cost $250 million over five years and funding would not go to the credit if the state's revenues don't grow by at least 4 percent more than the previous fiscal year.

Tim Albrecht, a spokesman for Branstad, said the governor will support property tax legislation that permanently reduces taxes for all classes. To the call for negotiation, Albrecht said Branstad is prepared to work with lawmakers but ""does not believe finger-pointing and accusations are particularly helpful to this debate.""

Mayors from two Iowa towns testified before the subcommittee about the proposal. Carlisle Mayor Ruth Randleman told a Senate subcommittee that the plan would help her town.

""My local businesses are impacted positively by this kind of approach. It does address the small businesses in my community,"" Randleman said.

Story continues

John Stineman, executive director of the Iowa Chamber Alliance, raised concerns about the fact that the credit won't definitely be funded every year, calling it ""conditional relief.""

McCoy said the Democrats want to create legislation that they know the state can afford.

""We've got to put a budget together that's balanced,"" he said.

McCoy said he expects the tax proposal will go to the full Senate committee for a vote within the next week."
http://news.yahoo.com/congress-letting-55-tax-breaks-expire-end-171342891--finance.html,,[],Congress letting 55 tax breaks expire at year end,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In an almost annual ritual, Congress is letting a package of 55 popular tax breaks expire at the end of the year, creating uncertainty — once again — for millions of individuals and businesses.

Lawmakers let these tax breaks lapse almost every year, even though they save businesses and individuals billions of dollars. And almost every year, Congress eventually renews them, retroactively, so taxpayers can claim them by the time they file their tax returns.

No harm, no foul, right? After all, taxpayers filing returns in the spring won't be hurt because the tax breaks were in effect for 2013. Taxpayers won't be hit until 2015, when they file tax returns for next year.

Not so far. Trade groups and tax experts complain that Congress is making it impossible for businesses and individuals to plan for the future. What if lawmakers don't renew the tax break you depend on? Or what if they change it and you're no longer eligible?

""It's a totally ridiculous way to run our tax system,"" said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel for the National Retail Federation. ""It's impossible to plan when every year this happens, but yet business has gotten used to that.""

Some of the tax breaks are big, including billions in credits for companies that invest in research and development, generous exemptions for financial institutions doing business overseas, and several breaks that let businesses write off capital investments faster.

Others are more obscure, the benefits targeted to film producers, race track owners, makers of electric motorcycles and teachers who buy classroom supplies with their own money.

There are tax rebates to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from a tax on rum imported into the United States, and a credit for expenses related to railroad track maintenance.

A deduction for state and local sales taxes benefits people who live in the nine states without state income taxes. Smaller tax breaks benefit college students and commuters who use public transportation.

Story continues

A series of tax breaks promote renewable energy, including a credit for power companies that produce electricity with windmills.

The annual practice of letting these tax breaks expire is a symptom a divided, dysfunctional Congress that struggles to pass routine legislation, said Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.

""It's not fair, it's very hard, it's very difficult for a business person, a company, to plan, not just for the short term but to do long-term planning,"" Lewis said. ""It's shameful.""

With Congress on vacation until January, there is no chance the tax breaks will be renewed before they expire. And there is plenty of precedent for Congress to let them expire for months without addressing them. Most recently, they expired at the end of 2011, and Congress didn't renew them for the entire year, waiting until New Year's Day 2013 — just in time for taxpayers to claim them on their 2012 returns.

But Congress only renewed the package though the end of 2013.

Why such a short extension? Washington accounting is partly to blame. The two-year extension Congress passed in January cost $76 billion in reduced revenue for the government, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Making those tax breaks permanent could add $400 billion or more to the deficit over the next decade.

With budget deficits already high, many in Congress are reluctant to vote for a bill that would add so much red ink. So, they do it slowly, one or two years at time.

""More cynically, some people say, if you just put it in for a year or two, then that keeps the lobbyists having to come back and wine-and-dine the congressmen to get it extended again, and maybe make some campaign contributions,"" said Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst for CCH, a consulting firm based in Riverwoods, Ill.

This year, the package of tax breaks has been caught up in a debate about overhauling the entire tax code. The two top tax writers in Congress — House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont. — have been pushing to simplify the tax code by reducing tax breaks and using the additional revenue to lower overall tax rates.

But their efforts have yet to bear fruit, leaving both tax reform and the package of temporary breaks in limbo. When asked how businesses should prepare, given the uncertainty, Camp said, ""They need to get on board with tax reform, that's what they need to do.""

Further complicating the issue, President Barack Obama has nominated Baucus to become U.S. ambassador to China, meaning he will soon leave the Senate, if he is confirmed by his colleagues.

As the Senate wound down its 2013 session, Democratic leaders made a late push to extend many of the tax breaks by asking Republican colleagues to pass a package on the floor of the Senate without debate or amendments. Republicans objected, saying it wasn't a serious offer, and the effort failed.

So should taxpayers count on these breaks as they plan their budgets for 2014?

""The best thing I would say is, budget accordingly,"" said Jackie Perlman, principle tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. ""As the saying goes, hope for the best but plan for the worst. Then if you get it, great, that's a nice perk. But don't count on it.""

In February Texas republican Governor Rick Perry made a trip to California. His supposed intent was to lure California businesses to Texas. The premise is that Texas is more business friendly than California. To be sure, Texas is a state that gives away over $19 Billion in taxpayer dollars even as it cuts basic and higher education. Instead of reinvesting its surplus in human capital, it is attempting to change the Texas constitution to return surplus dollars.

California has been seen as a basket case with regards to its exploding budget deficits. Interesting enough this was occurring during the administration of Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. He attributed the deficits to reduced tax revenues and overspending. He cut programs in draconian fashion but could never escape the reality that he was making the problem worse. Ultimately he did what both Reagan and Bush did, leave exploding deficits to their successors.

California now has a budget surplus. Depending on whose numbers one uses, it is anywhere from $1.2 billion according to the Governor or $4.4 billion according to the Legislature’s independent financial analyst. How did California do it and what should they do about the surplus?

Democrats President Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, and Governor Jerry Brown did not attempt an ideological game with blinders to the actual results. They tried basic arithmetic. They raised taxes. Interesting enough, the results were the same.

Bill Clinton got a balance budget with a surplus. Barrack Obama is seeing a budget deficit that is shrinking much faster than anyone expected and much faster than advised by economist for proven Keynesian economic reasons. Suffice it to say that the budget deficit hole left by two wars, two massive tax cuts, and a massive drug program on the credit card by the previous administration along with an irresponsible & intransigent Congress cannot be solved in two terms.

Jerry Brown remembered basic arithmetic as well as he brought California to a budget surplus. He raised taxes on the wealthy and cut programs (some more than he should). Does this sound familiar, the balanced approach? Time and time again the evidence is out there that it works and it improves the economy for all.

While Texas has a low unemployment rate comparatively, low regulations comparatively (effects?), low taxes comparatively, and tax dollar giveaways that are great for businesses in the short term, California must not attempt to remake its new found surpluses in Texas’ image. After all, rain in the desert makes for some of the most beautiful flora for a few weeks. We know exactly what happens after that. They dry up and die. The Texas flora may be flourishing as all the nutrients are being sucked out of the middle class. Twenty five percent of its people are without healthcare even as Governor Perry refuses to accept expanded Medicaid from Obamacare. Teachers’ wages are stagnant. Quality of public schools as measured by national tests is substandard and falling. Yet, the Texas governor wants to return surpluses.

The director of external affairs for the California Department of Finance, H. D. Palmer believes that a good deal of the surge in revenues are from a one time realization of capital games by wealthy individuals at the end of 2012 that is unlikely to reoccur. The Governor and many Democrats thus do not support significant increases in spending.

Some believe the governor simply want to leave a legacy of a budget solver and that inasmuch as the office of the independent legislative analyst believes there is a much bigger budget surplus, he is willing to err on the backs of the poor. Others believe because of the volatility of revenue gyration, much caution is needed. Speaker of the Assembly John A. Perez seem to have the most pragmatic solution. Put some of the revenues in a contingency fund and increase spending on scholarships to middle class students.

Maybe the reason back in February California companies did not bite on Governor Perry’s “sell Texas” tour is that inasmuch as they may love that the Governor of Texas is willing to pilfer the middle class to bring them to Texas, they know a pilfered middle class does not make the best workforce. California spending its surplus not on tax cuts, or abusive business incentives but instead on human capital in the form of education and improved healthcare is a sustainable long term solution.

California has a lot more work to do. A budget surplus is not enough. Policy that taxes appropriately and the wise investment of those dollars is of utmost importance. The governor must be commended for a job well done and the necessary caution in the use of his good fortune.

He later was pressured to walk back some of his remarks, but after winning the Open Championship on Sunday–and earning $1.43 million–Mickelson may have to reassess his options.

Mickelson backed off after complaining about the California state tax rate being raised to 13.3 percent for those earning over $1 million, which occurred when voters approved of Proposition 30 in November of 2012. ESPN reported regularly that Texas’s zero percent state income tax rate, for example, may have had a role in pushing Dwight Howard to ultimately sign with the Houston Rockets (see Breitbart Sports’ table of state taxes before California’s hike). Forbes Magazine is now reminding Mickelson that California will benefit greatly from Mickelson’s British Open win Sunday. Tiger Woods is another athlete who has publicly said he moved out of California, where he was born and raised, because of the state’s high tax rate.

One report suggests Mickelson may pay over 60 percent of his $1.43 million out in taxes to the UK, IRS and California. As Breitbart Sports reported, athletes are taxed based on where they earn the money (away games go to the state in which a game was played, etc.), but whether California collects their 13.3 percent of the $1.43 million since Mickelson decided not to leave the state is small change compared to what California may get from him after the win in Scotland.

Forbes points out the that the bigger impact of Mickelson’s win will be in extending and potentially even expanding the $36 million a year he gets from endorsements from companies such as KPMG, Barclays, and Callaway. If the British Open win increases his sponsorship by just $2 million, California would receive $5 million in state taxes from him.

The $5 million tax payoff the state of California could receive from Mickelson almost matches the $5.8 million the state could continue to keep after Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson was able to stop the Kings from moving to Washington, where the players would have kept the $5.8 million a year even under their relatively low $44 million team salary."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/federal-minimum-wage_n_3641162.html,2013-07-24 00:00:00,['Labor Reporter'],Federal Minimum Wage Goes 4 Years Without Budging,"WASHINGTON -- Workers toiling in low-wage jobs marked a dispiriting anniversary on Wednesday: It's now been four years since the last time the federal minimum wage was raised.

The minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour, and it prevails in the 30 states that don't already mandate a higher one. The last time it saw a boost was on July 24, 2009, when it was raised from $6.55. That 70-cent raise marked the last in a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush.

Since then, the legal wage floor has held steady, even as the cost of living has continued to rise. A full-time worker earning the minimum wage now pulls in a salary of about $15,000 per year, far below a living wage in most parts of the country.

President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats have proposed raising the minimum wage and pegging it to inflation, though House Republicans are unlikely to go along with such a hike any time soon. Bills to raise the minimum wage, introduced in the House and Senate earlier this year, have not been voted on by their respective committees. Republican leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), have deemed a minimum-wage raise a job killer. (House Republicans have already voted down a version of the minimum wage raise that was inserted as an amendment to a workforce training bill.)

Labor groups supporting a minimum wage boost planned demonstrations in an estimated 30 cities across the country on Wednesday, calling the four-year lapse reason alone for a raise. According to organizers, the protests would target low-wage employers who've seen employee strikes in recent months, including Walmart and McDonald's. A group of companies that back the Democratic proposal, called Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, launched a petition Wednesday for businesses to pledge their support for a raise.

Over the decades, the minimum wage has gone for spells longer than four years before seeing a raise, according to the Labor Department. The wage floor remained stagnant for a full 10 years leading up to the first increase late in Bush's tenure, in 2007. And during the early 1990s, the minimum wage stood at $4.25 for more than five years before being raised under President Bill Clinton.

But if Congress doesn't send Obama legislation to sign by the end of his second term, he will be the first president since Ronald Reagan who didn't raise the minimum wage at all.

Back on the campaign trail in 2008, Obama stumped for hiking the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011 and pegging it to inflation in perpetuity. That raise never came, however, and the president proposed a more modest boost to $9.00 during his State of the Union address earlier this year. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) soon rolled out their own, more ambitious proposal, which by 2015 would raise the minimum wage to $10.10, closer to its historical high in the late 1960s.

The proposals by both the president and congressional Democrats include one pivotal measure -- the tying of the minimum wage to an inflation index. Ten states have already undertaken this change, choosing to automatically reset the minimum wage each year rather than wrangle politically over a new raise every few years. If Congress adopted an inflation index, the purchasing power of the minimum wage wouldn't erode as it has for the past four years.

According to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, Americans broadly support the idea of raising the minimum wage and pegging it to inflation, with 62 percent of Americans saying it should be boosted to $9. Obama's proposal was supported by a huge majority of Democrats in the poll (86 percent to 6 percent) and a majority of independents (56 percent to 28 percent). Fifty-two percent of Republicans, however, opposed the proposal, compared to 36 percent who supported it."

WASHINGTON, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama poked fun at the media, his critics and himself on Saturday at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner, a star-filled event where journalists and celebrities mixed with the Washington elite.

Joined at the dinner by his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, the president gently knocked Republicans for not working with him on policy priorities and made a rare reference to his race when urging the opposition party to be cooperative.

""I know Republicans are still sorting out what happened in 2012, but one thing they all agree on is they need to do a better job reaching out to minorities,"" Obama said.

""And look, call me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with. Hello? Think of me as a trial run, you know?"" he said.

Obama, a Democrat and the first black U.S. president, won re-election in November with overwhelming support from minority voters including blacks and Hispanics.

He took a swipe at people who have doubted his religion and accused him of being a radical leftist, while he made light of his graying hair.

""These days, I look in the mirror and I have to admit, I'm not the strapping young Muslim socialist that I used to be,"" Obama said. ""Time passes. You get a little gray.""

The president is a Christian who was born in Hawaii, but he included some material for so-called ""birthers"" who falsely assert he was born abroad.

""I'm also hard at work on plans for the Obama Library, and some have suggested that we put it in my birthplace, but I'd rather keep it in the United States,"" he said.

Obama made light of his own rapid rise to power by comparing himself to Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Hispanic from Florida who is touted as a potential presidential candidate in 2016.

""One senator who has reached across the aisle recently is Marco Rubio, but I don't know about 2016. I mean, the guy has not even finished a single term in the Senate and he thinks he's ready to be president,"" Obama joked. ""Kids these days.""

Obama began running for president during his first term as a U.S. senator from Illinois.

In a room filled with journalists, the president saved some of his most biting jokes for the press.

""I know CNN has taken some knocks lately, but the fact is I admire their commitment to cover all sides of a story, just in case one of them happens to be accurate,"" he said, drawing applause.

""Some of my former advisors have switched over to the dark side. For example, David Axelrod now works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod.""

Axelrod was the chief strategist for Obama's re-election campaign and a former White House adviser. MSNBC is considered to be a liberal-leaning television network.

Obama also made light of his wife's new bangs, drawing laughter from her when he showed mock pictures of himself with the same hairdo. (Additional reporting by Elwina Nawaguna and Peter Cooney; Editing by Paul Simao)"

Rick Snyder and the bankruptcy specialist he appointed to fix Detroit’s unprecedented financial problems put the blame Sunday squarely on the city and defended their decision to file for Chapter 9.

The Republican governor said Detroit created the problems and stood steadfast behind his decision to file Thursday for bankruptcy, with the city roughly $19 billion in debt.

“This is a tragic, difficult decision, but a right one,” he told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" “It’s not about just more money, it’s about accountable government.”

He said corruption and city leaders ignoring warning signs for 60 years contributed to the problems. Among his biggest concerns, Snyder said, is the decline of municipal services for Detroit’s remaining 700,000 residents, including police response times of nearly one hour.

Snyder said the state cannot help and asking for a federal bailout is “not the right answer,” though Washington has that option.

More On This...

The Obama administration has extended no offer to help, after Congress and the White House agreed to bail out Chrysler and General Motors during the recent recession.

“Can we help Detroit? We don’t know,” Vice President Joe Biden said last week. His remarks followed White House Press Secretary Jay Carney appearing to rule out such assistance.

“That's something that local leaders and creditors are going to have to resolve,” he said. “But we will be partners in an effort to assist the city and the state as they move forward.”

Among the emerging concerns is that the federal government would have to help repeatedly, considering Chicago reportedly has an unfunded pension liability of at least $19 billion while Los Angeles’ is estimate to be as much as $30 billion.

“There are a lot of other cities right behind Detroit,” Republican strategist Ron Bonjean told Fox News on Sunday.

Kevyn Orr, the emergency manager and bankruptcy lawyer appointed by Snyder, made comments similar to the governor’s on Sunday but avoided questions about a possible government bailout.

“This is the only way,” he told “Fox News Sunday.” “We were compelled to file for bankruptcy.”

Orr said his goal is to restructure the debt, including roughly $3.5 million in underfunded pension liabilities, and to get Detroit on its feet again by fall 2014.

He also said he has appealed a judge’s ruling Friday that the bankruptcy violates Michigan's constitution, which protects government employees' pensions.

Orr also said that his plan would extend full payments only to pensioners for the next six months and acknowledge the hardship it will cause.

“This is very personal to me,” he said. “My mother is a pensioner.”

Still, he said Detroit “dug this hole,” in part by not addressing its problems earlier.

With a population of 1.8 million in the 1950s, Detroit’s slow decline started with residents migrating to the suburbs in the 1960s and was accelerated by automakers leaving Detroit, which diminished the city’s tax base and made it difficult for officials to provide basic services such as police protection.

The filing makes the city the largest in the United States to file for bankruptcy.

Orr also defended criticism from the financial sector, saying potential investors will look at an improved Detroit, not the old one.

I remember when people said “nobody will ever buy a car from a bankrupt automaker,” Orr said."

So far, Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Arizona and New York have jumped at the deal. Governors in other states were trying to gauge Friday what would be the bigger economic hit — paying to keep the parks operating or losing the tourist money that flows when the scenic attractions are open. South Dakota and several corporate donors worked out a deal with the National Park Service to reopen Mount Rushmore beginning Monday. Gov. Dennis Daugaard said it will cost $15,200 a day to pay the federal government to run the landmark in the Black Hills.

Arizona officials said a deal reached Friday will mean visitors should be able to return to Grand Canyon National Park on Saturday. In Utah, federal workers rushed to reopen five national parks for 10 days after the state sent $1.67 million to the U.S. government with the hope of saving its lucrative tourist season. Just over 400 national parks, recreation areas and monuments — including such icons as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite — have been closed since Oct. 1 because of the partial government shutdown.

Officials in some states were not happy about paying to have the parks reopened.

In Arizona, Republican Gov. Jan Brewer balked at spending about $112,000 a day for a full reopening of the Grand Canyon. She said a partial reopening would be much cheaper while allowing tourists to visit and businesses to benefit. “The daily cost difference is enormous, especially without assurances that Arizona will be reimbursed,” said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Brewer. In the end, Arizona agreed to pay the Park Service $651,000 to keep the Grand Canyon open for seven days. The $93,000 a day is less than the $112,000 the federal government had said was needed to fund park operations each day.

“Wyoming cannot bail out the federal government and we cannot use state money to do the work of the federal government,” Mead spokesman Renny MacKay said.

Well isn't that exactly what conservatives want - private donations to keep unessential things like 'monuments' functioning? Just like we're supposed to rely on charity for our healthcare?Well of course not! It's the Federal Government's job to pick up the tab for running these places, we are just supposed to reap the benefits of the money that pours in from the tourism!Of course Arizona's Jan Brewer is at the head of the line to feed at the trough:Missouri's governor is working on a proposal to reopen its national monuments including the Gateway Arch. Nevada and Washington will not. Wyoming has said it can't afford to 'bail out' the federal government.Good one. Nice to know that the parasitic federal government is actually expected to do something. While blue states are also ponying up to keep their monuments and attractions open, it is well known that red states take more money from the federal government than they put in while the reverse is true of blue states. So it's a bit of an irony that they scream the loudest about intrusion from the nanny state and another bit of schadenfreude when they learn just how much they count on it."

Tax refund fraud has exploded in recent years. Scammers typically use stolen names and Social Security numbers to file phony electronic tax forms for IRS refunds.

About 1.6 million Americans were victims of ID theft/tax refund crimes this year through June, up from 1.2 million taxpayers in all of 2012, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or TIGTA, said in a report.

""Identity theft is a growing epidemic,"" said J. Russell George, TIGTA's chief.

Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, a hot spot for these crimes, said in a statement that TIGTA's analysis shows the IRS is making progress, but much remains to be done.

TIGTA said that while the number of frauds has risen, the amount of federal revenue lost to these crimes has decreased. In 2011, the government lost $3.6 billion in potentially fraudulent tax refunds, down from $5.2 billion in 2010.

The thieves are increasingly working from abroad, TIGTA found. In 2011, someone using a single mailing address in Lithuania made more tax filings with fraudulent Social Security numbers than any single U.S. address, TIGTA said.

The Lithuanian address received $220,489 in fraudulent IRS refunds; an address in Shanghai received $156,533.

""The constantly evolving tactics used by scammers to commit identity theft continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing the IRS,"" the agency said in a statement on Thursday.

TIGTA said the IRS must do more to spot red flags signaling potential fraud in tax filings, such as multiple filings from the same address, and to help victims more quickly.

The IRS said it agreed with TIGTA's recommendations."
http://news.yahoo.com/knew-shutdown-casualties-shatter-stereotypes-071219238--finance.html,,[],Who knew? Shutdown casualties shatter stereotypes,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Taking out a mortgage. Getting married in a park. Going for a fall foliage drive. Cashing a check.

Who knew that so many random activities of daily life could be imperiled by a shutdown of the federal government?

Americans are finding that ""the government"" entails a lot more than the stereotype of faceless D.C. bureaucrats cranking out red tape.

And so it is that two dozen October weddings, including nine this week, are in jeopardy because they're scheduled for monument sites on the National Mall. Ditto for a New Jersey couple planning to marry at the Grand Canyon.

Mike Cassesso and MaiLien Le's permit to get married Saturday on the lawn near the Jefferson Memorial looks to be among the casualties, giving rise to a new Twitter hashtag for their #shutdownwedding. They're looking at alternate sites, including the restaurant booked for their reception.

Also canceled: a weekend Ku Klux Klan rally at Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania.

Want to take a drive along Virginia's popular Skyline Drive to take in the fall colors in Shenandoah National Park? Not till the government reopens.

It's not just romance, tourism and public events that are in jeopardy.

Consider the Wisconsin farmer who can't cash a check for a cow he sold.

Ben Brancel, the state's agriculture secretary, said that because the farmer has a loan from the Farm Service Agency, he can't cash the check without both his own signature and one from an FSA official, unavailable during the shutdown.

""Our advice to him was he was going to have to wait, that there wasn't anything he could do about it,"" Brancel said.

Ready to buy your first house?

Borrowers applying for a mortgage can expect delays, especially if the shutdown is prolonged. That's because many lenders need government confirmation of applicants' income tax returns and Social Security data. Mortgage industry officials say they expect bottlenecks on closing loans if the shutdown stretches on for more than a few days.

Story continues

In addition, low- to moderate-income borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-insured mortgages for single-family homes from the Federal Housing Administration can expect longer waits because of sharp reductions in FHA staffing.

Even workers who get their paychecks from a state government aren't safe from the ripple effects of a federal shutdown.

An assortment of state workers around the country are on furlough because the money for their jobs includes dollars from Washington. Among those are hundreds of workers at Arkansas' Military Department and one at the Crowley's Ridge Technical Institute, a vocational school in Forrest City, Ark.

In Illinois, the furloughs include 20 workers in the state Department of Employment Security and 53 in the Department of Military Affairs.

""These are the first, and there may be more,"" said Abdon Pallasch, the state's assistant budget director.

Want to escape the shutdown worries with a bike ride on the C&O Canal, a popular 184-mile trail and national park between Washington and Cumberland, Md.?

Closed. Those thinking of ignoring the closure notice and going anyway should consider this: Restrooms will be locked and handles removed from water pumps along the way.

One possible silver lining to shutdown annoyances writ small and large: The whole thing could serve as a teachable moment for all those people who tell pollsters that they want budget cuts — as long as they aren't directly affected.

""As time goes by, more and more people see these little things that they took for granted,"" said Ed Lorenzen, a policy adviser at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group pushing for spending discipline.

He said the shutdown could serve as a reminder that ""you're not going to be able to the balance the budget just by cutting spending in Washington that doesn't affect people.""

Not much new there.

Half of those surveyed think that the across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect on Friday with the sequester will be too severe. And a smaller proportion of Americans say that they are necessary to reduce the deficit. Democrats would, unsurprisingly, prefer a plan that had fewer cuts and a majority of Republicans and independents show support for the cuts even if they do think the sequester is a bad idea (which they do).

To be sure, the impact of the sequester on the American psyche vis-à-vis economic outlook is a valuable addition to the budget battle discussion. But the finding that I see as most crucial in this poll is one that I have heard little about.

[pullquote]

As Neil King Jr. writes, “By a more than 2-to-1 margin, poll participants say Mr. Obama is doing more than the GOP to unify the country in a bipartisan way. The poll found 48% of respondents saw Mr. Obama as trying to unify the country, compared with 22% who said that of Republicans and 37% who said that of the Democratic Party.”

More On This... Despite Washington angst, officials appear resigned to sequester cuts

That the electorate believes the president to be a unifying force for the country, and by no small amount, is completely incongruous with his actions on the campaign trail, through the fiscal cliff dispute, his inauguration speech, his State of the Union speech and now during the sequester negotiations.

Recent comments from President Obama include, “Republican leaders will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy” during a press conference on the debt ceiling in mid-January. And in his inaugural address while discussing climate change, he called Republicans neocons who don’t understand that “enduring peace and lasting security do not require perpetual war.” These are hardly the statements of a man working towards a united America.

Indeed, the president’s relentless engagement in identity politics – on the basis of race, gender, religion, and economic standing – has made him far from the bipartisan, solution-driven president he promised to be.

President Obama told Americans that we “have to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again” and while I agree with the sentiment behind his statement, he has certainly not held up his end of the bargain.

Earlier last week, Speaker Boehner said, “Mr. President, you got your tax increase. It’s time to cut spending here in Washington.” And Speaker Boehner is right – it’s what the country needs and the American people want.

But history told us that there would be no last minute arrival of a compromising, balanced Obama. We are seeing a President Obama who is riding high on the popularity of his social policies and continually eschewing the importance of finding meaningful and substantive compromises with the GOP on the economy. This is not the mark of a unifying force, but a president who is clearly playing a partisan agenda.

What’s more is that the results of this survey continue to show a wildly out of control GOP. Though there were flashes of moderation in the wake of Romney’s loss from key players like Governor Jindal and Senator Rubio, but still only 22 percent of those surveyed think that the Republicans are trying to unify the country.

In light of this, the popularity of New Jersey's Republican Gov. Chris Christie is hardly surprising. A conservative politician in policy choices has been able to become a bipartisan force because he embraced the president when he came to hurricane ravaged New Jersey and because he has agreed to take ObamaCare Medicaid expansion.

It is a very scary reality that the most divisive president in recent history is viewed as a unifier. The American people have been starved of the kind of bipartisan, compromising lawmaking that we need to the point that they believe a man who has done nothing but divide them is working for their best interest above his own agenda.

Nothing could be further from the truth."

Despite the fanfare -- and the spectacle of senators lingering for hours into the weekend to vote on dozens of amendments before the final tally -- the budget passed by the smallest of margins, 50-49. Four Democrats facing tough re-elections voted against it.

The resolution also stands no chance of passing Congress in its current form. The nonbinding but politically symbolic measure caters to party stalwarts on the liberal edge of the spectrum just as the House GOP measure is crafted to appeal to more recent tea party arrivals.

The vote, though, follows four years of pressure and taunting by House Republicans who excoriated the Senate for failing to approve a formal year-long budget throughout most of President Obama's first term. The government has been limping by on a series of partial-year budget bills, the latest of which was approved this week to fund the rest of fiscal 2013.

The final vote early Saturday morning was preceded by a marathon session of votes on dozens of amendments to the 2014 budget proposal. Many of the proposals were offered in hopes of inflicting political damage on Democratic senators up for re-election in GOP-leaning states like Alaska and Louisiana.

More On This... Bipartisan push to repeal medical device tax gains traction in Senate

The two main budget proposals produced by Senate Democrats and House Republicans are miles apart. The Senate plan does not attempt to balance the budget at all, though it does claim to reduce the deficit by imposing nearly $1 trillion in tax increases on top of more than $600 billion in higher taxes on top earners enacted in January. It also includes $875 billion in spending cuts, generated by modest cuts to federal health care programs, domestic agencies and the Pentagon and reduced government borrowing costs.

The House plan -- by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., his party's vice presidential candidate last year -- claims $4 trillion more in savings over the period than Senate Democrats by imposing major cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and other safety net programs for the needy. It would also transform the Medicare health care program for seniors into a voucher-like system for future recipients.

""We have presented very different visions for how our country should work and who it should work for,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Budget Committee. ""But I am hopeful that we can bridge this divide.""

Congressional budgets are planning documents that leave actual changes in revenues and spending for later legislation, and this was the first the Democratic-run Senate has approved in four years. That is testament to the political and mathematical contortions needed to write fiscal plans in an era of record-breaking deficits that until this year exceeded an eye-popping $1 trillion annually, and to the parties' profoundly conflicting views.

""I believe we're in denial about the financial condition of our country,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, top Republican on the Budget panel, said of Democratic efforts to boost spending on some programs. ""Trust me, we've got to have some spending reductions.""

Though the shortfalls have shown signs of easing slightly and temporarily, there is no easy path to the two parties finding compromise -- which the first months of 2013 have amply illustrated.

Already this year, Congress has raised taxes on top earners after narrowly averting tax boosts on virtually everyone else, tolerated $85 billion in automatic spending cuts, temporarily sidestepped a federal default and prevented a potential government shutdown.

By sometime this summer, the government's borrowing limit will have to be extended again -- or a default will be at risk -- and it is unclear what Republicans may demand for providing needed votes. It is also uncertain how the two parties will resolve the differences between their two budgets, something many believe simply won't happen.

Both sides have expressed a desire to reduce federal deficits. But President Barack Obama is demanding a combination of tax increases and spending cuts to do so, while GOP leaders say they won't consider higher revenues but want serious reductions in Medicare and other benefit programs that have rocketed deficits skyward.

Obama plans to release his own 2014 budget next month, an unveiling that will be studied for whether it signals a willingness to engage Republicans in negotiations or play political hardball.

In a long day that began Friday morning, senators plodded through scores of amendments -- all of them non-binding but some delivering potent political messages.

They voted in favor of giving states more powers to collect sales taxes on online purchases their citizens make from out-of-state Internet companies, and to endorse the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that is to pump oil from Canada to Texas refineries.

They also approved amendments voicing support for eliminating the $2,500 annual cap on flexible spending account contributions imposed by Obama's health care overhaul, and for charging regular postal rates for mailings by political parties, which currently qualify for the lower prices paid by non-profits.

In a rebuke to one of the Senate's most conservative members, they overwhelmingly rejected a proposal by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to cut even deeper than the House GOP budget and eliminate deficits in just five years.

The Democratic budget envisions $975 billion in unspecified new taxes over the coming 10 years. There would be an equal amount of spending reductions coming chiefly from health programs, defense and reduced interest payments as deficits get smaller than previously anticipated.

This year's projected deficit of nearly $900 billion would fall to around $700 billion next year and bottom out near $400 billion in 2016 before trending upward again.

Shoehorned into the package is $100 billion for public works projects and other programs aimed at creating jobs.

http://news.yahoo.com/grand-bargain-budget-2013-032011344.html,,[],Don't expect a 'grand bargain' in 2013,"Americans wishing for a ""grand bargain"" this Christmas are likely to be disappointed.



The bipartisan conference committee established by last week’s 11th-hour agreement to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling probably won’t produce a truly groundbreaking bipartisan deal that would end the nation's debt problem once and for all, nor are the members aiming that high.

At best, the budget resolution that comes out of the committee may serve as a ""down payment"" on that debt and provide Congress an opportunity to fulfill its most basic function of setting spending levels so the appropriations committees can fund the government.

In other words, it is likely to be literally the least lawmakers could do — which would be quite an achievement for this unpopular, do-nothing Congress.

As part of the agreement to temporarily keep the government open, the House and Senate have appointed 29 lawmakers to a conference committee tasked with reconciling the House and Senate budget proposals that passed earlier this year. The panel's leaders, Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray and Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, who each chair the Budget Committees in their respective chamber, must report back to Congress by Dec. 13 with the final version of the budget.

When the new conference committee members held their first meeting last Thursday, both sides kept expectations low.

“Chairman Ryan knows I’m not going to vote for his budget. I know that he’s not going to vote for mine,” Murray said at the Thursday meeting. “We’re going to find the common ground between our two budgets that we both can vote on. That’s our goal.”

“Our job,” she added, “is to make sure that we have put forward a spending cap and a budget path for this Congress in the next year or two, or further if we can.”

That common ground, as one aide close to Ryan described it to Yahoo News, would amount to little more than “small things.”

At the end of these formal negotiations, Republicans want modest changes made to the nation’s entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare — the primary drivers of U.S. debt — which they say are necessary to keep those programs sustainable for future generations. Democrats want sequestration eliminated, or at least reformed to give federal agencies more flexibility to find savings.

Story continues

And yes, there is some common ground on this.

Unlike in years past, this time Ryan won’t insist that Democrats hand over the holy grail of Republican entitlement reform: a controversial plan to transform Medicare into a system that provides vouchers for seniors to buy health care in a private market. (Sound familiar?) Instead, as Yahoo News reported earlier this month, Ryan intends to seek more realistic tweaks to entitlement programs that Democrats, including Obama, already have proposed.

Ryan outlined some of his ideas in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. Although he wrote the piece in the context of the ongoing debt-limit debate at the time, aides close to Ryan say it revealed how he plans to approach the budget conference.

“We could ask the better off to pay higher premiums for Medicare. We could reform Medigap plans to encourage efficiency and reduce costs. And we could ask federal employees to contribute more to their own retirement,” Ryan wrote. “Rep. Dave Camp (R., Mich.) and Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.) have been working for more than a year now on a bipartisan plan to reform the tax code. They agree on the fundamental principles: Broaden the base, lower the rates and simplify the code. The president himself has argued for just such an approach to corporate taxes. So we should discuss how Congress can take up the Camp–Baucus plan when it's ready.”

As part of the deal, Republicans appear willing to loosen up the tight reins of sequestration, which is their strongest piece of leverage.



“The sequester offers that nice opportunity” to make structural changes to entitlement spending, a Ryan aide told Yahoo News. “In [Ryan's] mind, it's how he can do everything in his power to forge a good down payment on this debt. If you're just cutting government agency spending, you can't get much, but if you go into entitlement programs, that’s where the bigger structural problems are.”

The opportunity is indeed a long time coming. This year marks the first time both the House and Senate have passed budget resolutions since 2009.



Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, both chambers are supposed to pass their own resolution that sets spending levels, and then each side appoints members of a conference committee to negotiate their differences. The resolutions are not technically law — the president, who submits his own budget annually, never “signs” a “budget” — but they serve to reveal priorities, force Congress to regularly re-examine its spending and set spending levels for appropriators. For most of President Barack Obama’s time in office — and during three years under former President George W. Bush — Congress has instead funded the government through a series of stopgap bills that set the spending levels for short periods of time

The government currently operates based on spending levels set by the Budget Control Act of 2011, the law that ushered in sequestration, which indiscriminately cut billions across most of the federal government. Democrats hate sequestration outright, and despite the many Republicans who give sequestration lip service because it reined in spending, plenty of them can’t stand the defense cuts.

In March, the Republican-majority House passed its version of a budget resolution, which cut enough spending to balance the federal budget in a decade. The Senate responded two days later with its own resolution (after Republicans threatened to withhold lawmakers’ pay if they didn’t.)

But then seven months passed and nothing happened. Senate Democrats called repeatedly for a budget conference, but Republicans resisted, saying that there was too much disagreement between the parties for formal negotiations to begin. Democrats, who had spent the past four years getting hammered by Republicans because they hadn’t passed a budget resolution of their own, were furious. Finally, last week, as the nation neared its borrowing limit, Republicans agreed to talk.

Striking a deal this year would help the government avoid yet another bout of brinkmanship over a shutdown when the latest round of short-term government funding runs out in January.

But here’s where the hope for a final resolution could fall apart: Traditionally, Congress only really acts when it must. Like schoolchildren and journalists, politicians need deadlines, and severe consequences for not meeting them. (Think back to the ominous-sounding “fiscal cliff,” “government shutdown,” and “Taxmageddon.”)

In this case, there are no hard deadlines for the budget committee.

Yes, the agreement hashed out last week asks the panel to report back to Congress in December, and if they fail, perhaps they’ll find coal in their stockings from Santa Claus at Christmas. Hopefully, the potential for an agreement is more than just a figment of our imagination."

The Military Coalition, some 27 military groups, wrote to leaders in Congress and President Obama late Wednesday about their ""strong objection"" and ""grave concern"" over the budget deal.

The deal cuts pension cost of living raises by 1 percentage point for military retirees who aren't disabled and not yet 62 years old. Cost of living hikes are automatic raises intended to keep up with inflation.

The problem is, most military retirees are a lot younger than private sector retirees. They enlist in their 20's and retire in their 40's. Very few stay on till they are 62 -- those who may be lucky enough to escape major injuries at war, or rose to higher echelons in the military system.

When compounded, the 1 percentage point cut could result in much more than a 20% reduction in retiree pensions over 20 years.

Related: 5 things the budget deal doesn't do

The average cut in pension payouts, including compounding interest, for a retiring Army Sergeant first class, would be about $3,700 each year, according to the Military Officers Association of America. Over 20 years, the total losses could balloon to more than $80,000.

""While portrayed as a minor change, a 20% reduction in retired pay and survivor benefit values is a massive cut in military career benefits,"" wrote groups, including the Air Force Sergeants Association, Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America and the Marine Corps League, among others in the letter.

The change is infuriating to military retirees like Army Col. Michael Barron, who retired nearly 4 years ago, after 30 years of service, which included being deployed to both Iraq wars.

""It's not fair at all. I spent a 30 year career in the military. I clearly understood what the (cost of living increases) would be,"" said Barron, deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. ""This is the worst kind of example of a shady, backroom deal.""

The cut is forcing some to reconsider how much longer they will continue to work with the military.

Rebekah Sanderlin's husband is two years away from hitting his 20 year retirement mark with the Army and she's wondering if its worth it. He's served in Afghanistan four times, among other places, and has many injuries.

""The war has been very hard on our family,"" said Sanderlin, a writer. ""We'd like to stay in, but it seems stupid to give more time to a government that goes back on their word.""

Military groups say the cut is particularly unfair because the changes will affect those who have already put in their years of service.

""To tax the very men and women who have sacrificed and served more than others is simply a foul,"" the letter stated.

Related: A new normal for government retirees

Washington leaders, and House Republicans, in particular, have been worried about the cost of military retiree benefits.

In 2012, the Pentagon spent $52.4 billion on 2.3 million military retirees and survivors, a cost that is expected to rise over the next few decades, according to the Department of Defense Office of the Actuary.

House budget chief Rep. Paul Ryan's website states that military retirement ""provides an exceptionally generous benefit, often providing 40 years of pension payments in return for 20 years of service,"" as it explains why benefits should be trimmed.

""Current levels of military compensation are incompatible with the overall demands on the defense budget,"" according to a House Committee on the Budget Report.

Military groups say they're open to reforms, but they'd like such changes to go through the normal legislative process that allows time to review and ""assess any recommendations that could significantly impact retention and readiness.""

Barron said groups like his were ""blindsided"" by the cuts to military pensions.

The cut ends up saving the budget $6 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Congress would also make newly hired civilian federal workers contribute 1.3% more of their paychecks to pensions if the budget deal becomes law.

The Department of Defense wouldn't comment on the Military Coalition letter and pointed to a statement by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel saying the budget deal provides greater ""budget certainty,"" while reducing the impact of massive cuts from so-called sequester.

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly characterized the cost of living cut as 1%. In fact, it is a cut of 1 percentage point."

He Left The Post In July']",Montgomery Council votes to increase minimum wage,"The Montgomery County Council voted overwhelmingly to establish the county’s own minimum wage Tuesday, approving a historic increase that will lift the hourly rate to $11.50 by 2017 — far above the current state and federal minimum of $7.25.

The council’s action, which followed nearly four hours of tense and occasionally acrimonious debate, is the leading edge of an unusual regional effort by Montgomery, Prince George’s County and the District to raise the wage. The Prince George’s County Council is expected to vote Wednesday, and an initial vote by the D.C. Council is set for Dec. 3.

It is also part of a national movement by state and local governments to address growing wage inequality where Congress has not. The federal minimum has not been raised in four years. New Jersey, California and New York have all approved minimum wage increases this year.

The Montgomery bill increases the wage in annual steps to $8.40 in October 2014, $9.55 in 2015, $10.75 in 2016 and $11.50 in 2017.

During debate, the measure was amended to extend the phase-in period from three to four years, reflecting concerns that the wage was being raised too high and too fast. At $11.50, an individual’s annual income is $23,600 — still well below what it takes to subsist in Montgomery, where living costs are significantly above the national average.

Council member Marc Elrich (D-At Large), the bill’s chief sponsor, said that it was not politically possible to do more at the moment and that he was satisfied.

“I’m very happy. It’s substantively what I wanted,” he said. “You can make a big difference to people.”

Two of his co-sponsors, Council President Nancy Navarro (D-Mid-County) and Valerie Ervin (D-Eastern County), expressed concern that the addition of the fourth year would damage the ­chances for regional action. But D.C. and Prince George’s leaders said Tuesday evening that plans remain intact.

“In 2016 or even 2017, it’s a victory for the region,” said D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), who made calls to Montgomery council members Tuesday in advance of the vote.

On Monday, a D.C. Council committee unanimously passed a measure to reach $11.50 by 2016, and a super­majority of council members said afterward that they would support the bill in the initial vote by the full council next week.

Prince George’s postponed action last week to wait for Montgomery’s vote. Council Chair Andrea Harrison (D-Springdale) said through a spokesman Tuesday that the council “will likely make changes to mirror Montgomery County, as long as it lessens the impact on retail businesses in Prince George’s County.”

Council member Eric Olson (D-College Park) said he was “confident” Wednesday’s vote would end in approval.

“The objective here is to improve the economic conditions of our lowest-paid workers, and this would improve the situation. Legislation sometimes is about compromises. It would still be a big step forward for our lowest-income workers,” he said.

Montgomery’s vote represents a significant legislative achievement for Elrich, a former elementary school math teacher who is regarded as the most liberal on the left-leaning, all-Democratic council. As such, he has often been the lone opposing vote on many issues.

He received a chilly reception when he first announced his intention to introduce minimum wage legislation in late August, shortly before Labor Day. Many Montgomery council members maintained that the wage was strictly a state and federal matter.

But Elrich persisted and said he developed the idea of a regional approach after speaking with business leaders who expressed concern that unilateral action by Montgomery could put the county at a competitive disadvantage. He said he reached out to Harrison at a meeting of the Maryland Association of Counties in the summer and later spoke to Mendelson.

Elrich’s cause also benefited from a national and regional political climate favorably disposed to raising the wage. National polls showed Americans overwhelmingly in favor of President Obama’s unsuccessful attempt to secure an increase.

The Montgomery council’s final 8 to 1 vote — Phil Andrews (D-Gaithersburg-Rockville) opposed the measure — papered over serious differ­ences and legal uncertainties surrounding the bill.

County attorneys told council members that the bill was limited to covering employees doing work in the county for firms “operating and doing business in the county.” Council attorney Robert Drummer said some situations — such as a landscaping company from outside the county sending workers into Montgomery — might be “problematic” from a legal standpoint and vulnerable to a court challenge.

Andrews and council member Craig Rice (D-Upcounty) unsuccessfully pressed for the council to wait for the Maryland General Assembly to act.

But others maintained that delay was not an option.

“Delaying the bill is killing the bill,” Ervin said. “Let’s have the courage to do the right thing.”

The turning point came when council member Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda) proposed amending Elrich’s bill by raising the wage to $10.75 in 2016 and the lesser of $11.50 or $1 over the state minimum in 2017. Rice, who was expected to join Andrews, Nancy Floreen (D-At Large), Hans Riemer (D-At Large) and George L. Leventhal (D-At Large) on Berliner’s resolution, suddenly switched and agreed to back $11.50 over three years.

Berliner’s motion passed 5 to 4, but Rice’s defection effectively collapsed the coalition, setting the stage for an amendment by Elrich to raise the minimum to $11.50 over four years with no conditions attached.

His amendment passed 6 to 3, allowing the final vote to approve the wage increase."

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama indicated a willingness Wednesday to agree to a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, if Republicans will accept it, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN.

The president signaled more “give” to the idea of a six-week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private White House meeting with House Democrats, said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The revelation comes amid a stalemate that has Republicans trying to use spending and debt limit deadlines as leverage to wring concessions from Obama and Democrats.

One thing any budget resolution won’t include, it appears, is provisions targeting the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

CNN has been reporting that senior House GOP sources are signaling openness to the idea of a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, as long as Democrats agree to negotiations on how to reduce the debt and deficit during the time the debt ceiling is increased.

Talking about a short-term solution, Obama told the group “if that’s what (House Speaker John) Boehner needs to climb out of the tree that he’s stuck in, then that’s something we should look at,” according to the lawmaker, who attended the meeting.

’Measure of hope’

The lawmaker left the White House meeting with a “small measure of hope that this becomes an exit strategy.”

The president warned if Republicans want to propose a short-term fix and Democrats say no, then the firm ground Democrats think they’re standing on now would soften.

Boehner and Republicans are demanding that Obama and Senate Democrats negotiate on deficit reduction steps that would be part of legislation to reopen the government and raise the limit on federal borrowing needed to pay the bills.

Obama has refused to enter formal talks until the shutdown ends and the debt ceiling has been raised to remove the threat of default.

A senior House Republican told CNN that GOP members may be willing to go for a short-term debt ceiling hike – lasting four to six weeks – as long as the president agrees that negotiations will occur during that time.

However, no specifics were immediately available about how such legislation would take shape or how the talks would occur.

But Republican sources have also told CNN the parameters of those talks have to be specific enough to sell to their skeptical GOP members.

So what would Democrats be willing to talk about? The lawmaker said House Democrats are open to hearing what Republicans have in mind with a short-term deal.

GOP seeks leverage

The shutdown began when Congress failed to pass a spending plan for the new fiscal year that started October 1. Now another deadline looms – the need to increase the federal borrowing limit by October 17 or risk a U.S. default.

Days of back-and-forth rhetoric and jibes between the leaders have brought no direct negotiations, but plenty of accusations and political spin.

On Wednesday, GOP leaders appeared to shift their focus from efforts to dismantle Obama’s signature health care reform, the initial driving force behind the shutdown, to securing spending cuts elsewhere.

Boehner, who earlier this year told his GOP colleagues that he was finished negotiating one on one with the president, has called for Obama to sit down for what he calls a “conversation” on how to reopen the government and prevent what would be the first-ever U.S. default as soon as next week.

But when Obama invited the entire House Republican caucus to the White House as part of a series of meetings with legislators, Boehner’s office responded that only the GOP leadership and committee chairmen would attend the Thursday gathering.

“It is our hope that this will be a constructive meeting and that the president finally recognizes Americans expect their leaders to be able to sit down and resolve their differences,” said a statement by a Boehner aide.

Obama’s invitation was intended to demonstrate outreach to Republicans just eight days from when the Treasury says Congress must increase the federal debt ceiling or risk default.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was disappointed that Boehner was limiting attendance at Thursday’s meeting to fewer than 20 of the more than 200 House Republicans.

“The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country” about the potential harmful impacts from the shutdown and a possible default, Carney said in a statement, repeating that Obama “will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job.”

Meanwhile, GOP leaders were distancing themselves from demands by tea party conservatives to also make dismantling Obamacare a condition for agreement.

Ryan’s plan drops Obamacare

Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman who was the party’s vice presidential nominee last year, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Democrats and Republicans should focus on “modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.”

“Right now, we need to find common ground,” Ryan wrote in the column posted online Tuesday night. “We need to open the federal government. We need to pay our bills today – and make sure we can pay our bills tomorrow. So let’s negotiate an agreement to make modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.”

However, Ryan’s column never mentioned Obamacare, focusing instead on forced spending cuts to domestic and military programs, as well as reforms to Medicare.

Ryan’s Obamacare omission appeared to anger conservatives, who took to Twitter in response.

“Much like White House press, Paul Ryan doesn’t mention Obamacare in WSJ oped,” tweeted Dan Holler, spokesman for the conservative group Heritage Action.

Perhaps in response to a conservative backlash, Boehner made a brief statement Wednesday on the House floor that focused on the GOP message that Obamacare was detrimental to the country. He stopped short of linking it to any negotiations on ending the shutdown and raising the debt ceiling.

Boehner insists that the government must reduce deficits, declaring that Republicans won’t raise the debt ceiling without steps toward that goal.

Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase

But a House GOP leadership source told CNN on Wednesday that Obama’s rejection of linking negotiations to raising the borrowing limit meant Republicans would likely be forced to agree to a “clean” debt ceiling limit proposal in exchange for setting up talks on deficit reduction steps.

According to the source, the economic implications of a U.S. default “scares people” to make such a deal acceptable to enough House Republicans in order to get negotiations started.

The source acknowledged Boehner may lack support from some or most of his GOP caucus, requiring Democratic votes for the proposal to pass.

Democrats planning

Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN his side already was mulling over “what we will discuss, what we will negotiate over, what things will be on the table.” Obama also met with the House Democratic caucus at the White House.

The GOP-led House passed a measure on Tuesday to set up a special negotiating team comprising members of both parties from the House and Senate, but Obama and Democrats rejected the concept as the latest Republican gimmick to force talks before raising the debt ceiling.

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats announced they will propose a measure to increase the debt ceiling beyond next year’s congressional elections with no additional issues attached.

While many Republicans are certain to oppose it, Democratic leaders hope increased pressure for Congress to prevent a default next week will cause some GOP senators to vote for it.

A GOP source told CNN on Tuesday that the White House was having corporate chief executives call Republican leaders. The business community has called for resolving the Washington stalemate to avoid a default that would spike interest rates to impact the economy.

Without a breakthrough, the shutdown would continue at a cost estimated at up to $50 billion a month. Failure to raise the debt ceiling by next week’s deadline would leave the government unable to borrow money to pay its bills for the first time in its history.

All the partisan bickering – and lack of progress – is taking its toll not just on furloughed workers, shuttered government facilities and programs, but also on Americans’ confidence in their government.

Poll: Most angry at both parties

Shutdown forecast: Week two and clouds ahead

In a national poll released Monday, most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country.

The CNN/ORC International survey indicated that slightly more people were angry at Republicans than Democrats or Obama for the shutdown, though both sides took a hit.

According to the poll conducted over the weekend, 63% of respondents said they were angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown, while 57% expressed anger at Democrats and 53% at Obama.

“It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around, and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown,” said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

According to a new Gallup poll Wednesday, the Republican party’s favorable rating dropped to 28%, down 10 percentage points from September. The 43% for Democrats was a 4-percentage-point drop from last month.

Will 2014 election solve anything?

Senate Democrats sought to keep up the pressure, holding a rally on the Capitol steps on Wednesday to demonstrate their unified stance in calling for House Republicans to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.

A CNN survey indicates enough Republicans in the House would join Democrats in voting for a Senate-passed spending plan to end the shutdown.

All 200 Democrats and 19 Republicans support passing a continuing resolution with no additional legislative strings attached .

With two vacancies in 435-member House, 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the House.

However, not enough Republicans are willing to join Democrats in a procedural move to force Boehner to hold a vote on the Senate plan.

Boehner has said the measure would fail to pass in the House, a contention rejected by Obama and Democrats.

The speaker has previously allowed measures to pass the House with mostly Democratic support, which has weakened his leadership among conservatives. Doing so now could cost him his leadership post due to the conservative backlash in would likely unleash, analysts believe.

About $85 billion will be cut from discretionary spending over the next seven months, reducing defense programs by about 8 percent and domestic programs by about 5 percent. Only a few things will be spared, including some basic safety-net benefits like Social Security, as well as pay for enlisted military personnel.

The sequester will not stop to contemplate whether these are the right programs to cut; it is entirely indiscriminate, slashing programs whether they are bloated or essential. The military budget, for example, should be reduced substantially, but thoughtfully, considering the nation’s needs. Instead, every weapons system, good or bad, will be hurt, as will troop training and maintenance.

These cuts, which will cost the economy more than one million jobs over the next two years, are the direct result of the Republican demand in 2011 to shrink the government at any cost, under threat of a default on the nation’s debt. Many Republicans say they would still prefer the sequester to replacing half the cuts with tax revenue increases. But the government spending they disdain is not an abstract concept. In a few days, the cuts will begin affecting American life and security in significant ways.

While some departments may have exaggerated the dire effects of their reductions, Congressional budget experts say they have little doubt that the size and pervasive nature of the sequester will inflict widespread pain. Here are some examples from the government departments most affected:

NATIONAL SECURITY Two-week furloughs for most law-enforcement personnel will reduce Coast Guard operations, including drug interdictions and aid to navigation, by 25 percent. Cutbacks in Customs agents and airport security checkpoints will “substantially increase passenger wait times,” the Homeland Security Department said, creating delays of as much as an hour at busy airports. The Border Patrol will have to reduce work hours by the equivalent of 5,000 agents a year."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/food-stamp-cuts_n_3957509.html,2013-09-19 00:00:00,"['Senior Reporter', 'Senior Congressional Reporter']",House Votes To Cut Food Stamps By $40 Billion,"WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives on Thursday approved sweeping reforms to the nation's food stamp program that would cut some $40 billion in nutrition aid over 10 years and deny benefits to millions starting in 2014.

By 217 to 210, the House said yes to the measure, with its Republican backers arguing it would help more people find jobs.

""This bill is designed to give people a hand when they need it most. Most people don't choose to be on food stamps. Most people want a job,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) ""Most people want to go out and be productive so that they can earn a living, so that they can support a family, so that they can have hope for a more prosperous future. They want what we want.""

While most proponents of the bill similarly argued that they were just promoting work, there was also an undercurrent of accusation that many Americans are abusing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to sponge off taxpayers.

""If you're a healthy adult and don't have someone relying on you to care for them, you ought to earn the benefits you receive,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). ""Look for work. Start job training to improve your skills or do community service. But you can no longer sit on your couch or ride a surfboard like Jason in California and expect the federal taxpayer to feed you.""

That would be Jason Greenslate, the California food stamp recipient who likes to surf and play rock music but not look for work. Fox News profiled him last month in a segment that said America has been on an epic ""food stamp binge."" The network made sure everyone in Congress saw the segment.

The House vote sets up a showdown with the Democratic-controlled Senate, which previously approved a much more modest reduction in food stamp spending as part of a broader bill that included agricultural subsidies. A traditional ""farm bill"" likewise combining the two issues failed in the House during the summer, at which point House Republicans set nutrition aside and passed a bill with just the agribusiness subsidies.

House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) almost seemed desperate to get the measure passed, noting that it was only part of the process of passing the normally noncontroversial farm bill.

""I admit to you, this has been an unusual process. But it remains my goal to get a five-year farm bill enacted. I'm doing everything possible to make sure that happens this year,"" Lucas said, emphasizing the ""everything.""

Before the earlier attempt to pass a farm bill failed, Lucas had worked hard to accommodate conservatives by allowing an amendment that made the food stamp provisions harsher. Nearly all of them voted against the bill anyway, and the amendment cost Democratic supporters.

""We have a responsibility to get this done, and quite simply, and I repeat, quite simply, it shouldn't be this hard to pass a bill that ensures all of us in this economy has enough to eat,"" Lucas said. ""And that's what a farm bill does.""

Members from each chamber will have to reconcile the differences between their separate pieces of legislation in a conference committee this fall. The White House has repeatedly said it would veto the House GOP's food stamp demands.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the House legislation would deny benefits to 3.8 million Americans next year and save $39 billion over 10 years, or roughly 5 percent of the SNAP program's cost in that time. Enrollment doubled to 47 million in the wake of the Great Recession as incomes plummeted and more Americans qualified for benefits, which average $133 per month. Most beneficiaries are children, elderly or disabled.

The bill is packed with changes to SNAP: It would require more beneficiaries to pass income and asset tests to prove their poverty. It would allow states to require drug tests. It would allow states to deny benefits to able-bodied adults who don't work or enroll in training for at least 20 hours per week.

""Work is not a penalty,"" Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) said, citing the Book of Genesis. ""Work is a blessing.""

Regardless of what President Obama ultimately signs into law, benefits will drop for all SNAP beneficiaries in November after the expiration of a 13 percent benefits increase that had been granted by the 2009 stimulus bill.

Democrats called the House measure a useless assault on the poor.

""Today's exercise is nothing more than a waste of our time and an insult to every American in need,"" said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio). ""The fact that we are considering this legislation makes me question whether the Republican leadership even wants a farm bill.""

She added that the bill ""guts nutrition for those most in need and says to the poor, to hungry children, to the disabled, seniors and our veterans, 'You don't matter, you are not worthy of our help.' They deserve better.""

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) asked Lucas if he would try to spare veterans from the cuts in the probable conference committee, saying they deserve special support ""in these economic times."" Lucas argued that veterans were already protected.

However, a recent Huffington Post review of military records found military families rely on more than $100 million in food stamps a year. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated that 170,000 veterans would feel the pinch from the bill."

http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/03/news/economy/april-jobs-report/index.html,2013-05-03 00:00:00,['Annalyn Kurtz'],April jobs report: Hiring picks up,"The U.S. economy seemed to be headed for a spring slowdown this year. Then the April jobs report was released Friday morning, and now some economists are doing a double-take.

The economy added 165,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That was more than the 140,000 jobs economists expected, and it marked an improvement over March.

The even bigger story, though, came from large revisions to earlier numbers. It's a common practice for the Labor Department to revise its data for the two prior months, and this time, those revisions showed an additional 114,000 jobs were added in the U.S. economy over February and March alone.

Previously, March hiring had looked particularly weak, with only 88,000 jobs added that month. Now, the Labor Department says 138,000 jobs were added in March.

February job growth, which had already looked solid, now looks even stronger. About 332,000 jobs were added in February, making it the strongest month for hiring since the Census hired temporary workers in 2010.

The report goes a long way ""toward soothing fears of another spring slowdown,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics.

Economists had been warning of a spring swoon for the third year in a row, this time driven largely by government spending cuts and global economic weakness. Retail sales slumped unexpectedly in March, the manufacturing sector stalled in April, and signs abroad point to a global deceleration. China's rapid economic growth has lost some steam and Europe is still mired in a recession.

But those fears eased following the report. Stocks jumped. For the first time ever, the Dow topped 15,000 and the S&P 500 climbed above 1,600.

Service jobs boom: The strongest job growth in April came from restaurants and bars, which added 38,000 jobs; temporary services, which added 31,000 jobs; and retailers, which added 29,000 jobs. On the flip side, the government is now the biggest drag on the job market. Overall, federal, state and local governments cut 11,000 jobs in April.

The bigger picture, however, remains static. About 11.7 million people remain unemployed, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.5% in April, but that's still high compared to historical levels. Before the recession hit, the unemployment rate was 4.5%.

""This is a classic 'hold-steady' report -- enough job growth to keep the unemployment rate stable but not much more,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. ""In good times, this would be fine, but at a time like this, it represents an ongoing disaster.""

A big question still hangs in the air about how many jobless Americans are simply not being counted in the unemployment figures. The unemployment rate only includes people who have looked for work in the prior four weeks. Workers who have given up on the job market are not counted.

Only 63.3% of the civilian population, over age 16, is either working or looking for a job. That's the lowest labor force participation rate since May 1979.

Blue-collar jobs take a hit: Over the last six years, the labor force has declined most dramatically in auto manufacturing states like Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. While some veteran workers may simply be retiring, the trend could also reflect former blue-collar jobs transforming into fewer high-skill, technical positions.

""These jobs pay more, but there aren't as many of them either,"" said Mark Vitner, senior economist for Wells Fargo. ""In order to fill those jobs, workers may need to be retrained.""

Nationwide, manufacturing hiring came to a halt in April.

Construction firms also cut 6,000 jobs. The sector had been adding jobs for the prior 10 months, fueled mainly by the housing recovery. But, as of April, job cuts by commercial firms were large enough to offset jobs added by homebuilders. Those job cuts are most likely tied to recent declines in government-funded construction projects, for example on infrastructure and schools.

Health care remained a strong sector, adding 19,000 jobs in April. Hospitals and doctors' offices hired more workers, and demand for more health care for the elderly is driving a surge in home health care services. That industry added 6,000 jobs in April. The Labor Department expects home health aide to be the fastest growing occupation in the country this decade.

How far we've come: Overall, the U.S. economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the financial crisis, and since then has added back about 6.2 million jobs.

Once you factor population growth into the mix, Shierholz estimates there is still a gap of 8.6 million jobs ""missing"" from the U.S. economy. If hiring keeps up at its current pace, it will take about five more years to get back to a pre-recession job market."

Should America cut off the money for Super Twiggy, the cartoon squirrel?

At that time, across-the-board budget cuts called sequestration were kicking children out of Head Start and leaving FBI agents without gas money. Congress was still supposed to be looking for smaller, smarter ways to trim the budget — so it could replace that big, dumb cut.

So it came to Super Twiggy. The squirrel starred in Web videos in Spain, touting the health benefits of California-grown walnuts. U.S. taxpayers had paid more than $3 million for Spanish walnut promotions, as part of a $200 million-per-year Agriculture Department program that promotes U.S. farm goods overseas.

“The Republican majority was supposed to end this kind of nonsense, not perpetuate it,” said Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), trying to kill the broader program with an appeal to his party’s small-government soul. “It is a test of the determination and sincerity of the House majority.”

It didn’t work. After other members touted the program’s value to farmers, the cut was rejected, 322 to 98.

Jackie Kucinich takes a look at some of the wasteful government spending listed in Sen. Tom Coburn's (R-Okla.) annual ""WasteBook."" (Thomas LeGro/The Washington Post)

There — in a vote and, in fact, in a nutshell — was the story of the American austerity wars in 2013.

Republicans in Congress had forced a historic shift: Washington, for the first time in years, was focused on cutting, not growing, the budget. But then, politicians in both parties choked on the decisions that came next: Where to cut. Who to hurt. What to kill.

Instead, they allowed sequestration, a policy that — at least in theory — cut the good and the bad equally. That created odd contrasts: Meals on Wheels was cut, and Army units reduced training; Washington kept paying for dubious expenses such as a plane that didn’t fly, an airport with no passengers and farm subsidies in Manhattan. And a private industry’s “spokes-squirrel.”

This month, Congress canceled sequestration’s across-the-board cuts and gave itself another chance to demonstrate that legislators can make smarter, more judicious cuts. But so far, it has mainly demonstrated the power of old Washington habits, the political reflexes that make cutting government so hard.

“The only way Congress can make cuts is across the board, because they have trouble making decisions,” said Robert L. Bixby of the Concord Coalition, a group seeking to reduce the federal deficit. “If you’re trying to limit the scope of government, or the function, it doesn’t accomplish that goal at all. It just gives you less money to accomplish the same goals, which is why it doesn’t really work over the long term. [Either] the money grows back, or you provide a declining level of service.”

Three years after deficit-driven Republicans took the House, Washington’s experiment with budget-cutting has produced mixed results. Politicians have, indeed, had historic success cutting numbers — the abstract, friend-less figures at the bottom of the federal balance sheet.

In the next fiscal year, for instance, the government’s “discretionary” spending will be limited to $1.012 trillion. That figure was set by the budget deal agreed to last week. That’s down about 13 percent from 2010, adjusting for inflation.

There has been very little change in “mandatory” spending programs, which account for the vast majority of federal spending.

But the budget deal signed in August 2011 was projected to save about $2.1 trillion by 2021, as compared with the levels of spending projected before. And to some conservatives, that’s victory enough. The big number went down.

“I’d much rather have [that] than to break my pick on some of this completely small-ball stuff,” said anti-tax advocate Grover G. Norquist. He said that it was unrealistic to expect Republicans to win many of those little battles, anyway: “You can’t line out anything. Because the Democrats run the Senate. The president has the veto.”

But to many other people — conservatives and liberals both — this is a dispiriting outcome. They expected more from austerity.

It was supposed to force Washington to face decisions about how the country really ought to spend its money. Finally, legislators would eliminate the duplicative, wasteful or profligate programs that they’d ignored in fatter times.

Or not.

In 2011 and 2012, for instance, at least 84 federal programs were either eliminated or defunded by Congress. In large part, however, these were not major reforms. The programs cut were often small, redundant, outdated or all three. In 72 of those cases, the cuts had been suggested by the Obama administration.

The suggestions included a scholarship named in honor of Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), another named for Byrd’s wife, as well as an anti-drug center championed by Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), and a scholarship named for the son of Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.). At the time, Stupak had already retired. Byrd and Murtha were dead.

For many conservatives, that adds up to an unsatisfying result. They had wanted a government that was cheaper, smaller and smarter.

Suddenly, they were being asked to settle for just cheaper.

“Have we eliminated anything? No. We haven’t,” said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), a conservative in his second term. “I can’t think of a single major agency that we’ve gotten rid of. Or a role of government that we’ve gotten rid of.”

So how did Congress manage to cut the budget overall, while leaving so much of government’s parts intact?

One answer was an old Washington trick: budget gimmicks, which cut money on paper but made little difference in the real world.

In 2011, for instance, Congress and President Obama trumpeted a budget deal that included $37.8 billion in budget cuts. But upon close inspection, many of those cuts were only-in-Washington illusions, paper money that was unlikely to ever be spent. The “cuts” in that case included $6 billion for a census that wasn’t necessary, $280 million for a tunnel that was already canceled and $375,000 for a road that didn’t exist (the money had been allotted to a fictional road because of a typo).

Another answer was distraction and theatrics in Congress — another bad habit, which left legislators little time to dig into the details of the budget and agree on what was too wasteful or extraneous to keep.

In early 2011, Democrats blocked many of the biggest cuts that Republicans had proposed, including defunding Planned Parenthood and NPR. After that, the two sides began a cycle of hair-pulling crises, each of which was resolved in a series of last-minute deals. Often, the outcome of the showdown was a “continuing resolution,” a stopgap measure that mainly continued funding levels at levels set previously.

And finally, even when legislators focused on a real-world cut, even small-government Republicans often found reasons to keep government doing the same things it did before.

So it was with Super Twiggy, one of several controversial giveaway programs that legislators couldn’t cut loose.

The program that funds Super Twiggy — the USDA’s Market Access Program — has been criticized for spending taxpayer money to advertise for private business interests. But it lives, partly because its benefits are spread among so many farmers in so many states.

Since 2008, the program has paid more than $3.1 million to help the California Walnut Commission advertise in Spain. First, the money paid for ads with a live squirrel, Twiggy, who snacked on walnuts and then water-skiied behind a miniature boat.

“Then, Twiggy retired. The real squirrel. So we reinvented, I guess, a digitized Twiggy,” said Dennis Balint, the walnut commission’s chief executive.

Now the commission produces Web videos where the new, digital squirrel has adventures inside the human body, hurling walnuts at villains who symbolize cholesterol. It is a bit of an odd metaphor — because having either a live squirrel or a walnut inside one’s blood vessels would probably be a more immediate concern than hardening of the arteries.

But the walnut commission thinks it’s a worthwhile use of their aid money. Their research shows that Spaniards, in particular, respond well to squirrels.

“Twiggy being inside the blood vessel is a way of demonstrating the fact that cholesterol — bad cholesterol — can be beaten with walnuts,” Balint said.

On the House floor this summer, proponents of the Market Access Program brushed aside the mention of Super Twiggy and argued that the program should stay because it helps farmers.

“Since the creation of this extremely successful agricultural export program, it has increased America’s export by over 500 percent. That is a success story by any measure,” said Rep. Jim Costa (D), who represents a heavily agricultural district in California. Two Republicans and another Democrat also spoke in opposition to the cut.

When the vote came, 142 Republicans and 180 Democrats voted to keep it.

Now — in theory — Congress has a chance to hit the reset button and find new ways to cut the budget. Last week, legislators approved a deal that canceled the sequester and gave the House and Senate appropriations committees the chance to write a new bill with specific, targeted reductions.

But some conservatives — inside and outside the House — say they’ve already seen enough to doubt.

“At some point, nothing’s going to change. So why keep saying it?” said Tad DeHaven, a Cato Institute analyst who helps run the Web site DownsizingGovernment.org. For 14 years, he has pushed for Washington to rein in spending and the size of government.

Next year, as Congress begins its new effort, he will quit and go into business with a friend in Pennsylvania.

“I got tired of being asked on radio shows and such, ‘What can we do about it?’ Because I couldn’t continue to pretend that there’s a lot that can be done,” DeHaven said in a telephone interview. “You’re going up against an aircraft carrier with a slingshot.”"

Now, it wasn't that long ago that pundits were calling California a failed state and saying it was ungovernable. But in 2010, when other states were busy electing whatever Tea Partier claimed to hate government the most, we elected a guy who actually liked it — Jerry Brown. And without a Republican governor and without a legislature cock-blocked by Republicans, (audience laughter) a $27 billion deficit was turned into a surplus.

How? Well it's amazing, really. We did something economists call cutting spending and raising taxes. (audience applause) I know, it sounds like crazy science fiction, but you see, here in California, we're not just gluten-free and soy-free and peanut-free, we're Tea Party free! (massive audience cheering and applause)

Yes, we can live in reality! I mean, Texas could do it too, but they love ""freedom"" too much. Like when that unregulated fertilizer plant blew up. In California, when things blow up, it's because we're making a Jason Statham movie. No, California is not perfect, but it is in our nature to try new things. For example, now that it's clear Obamacare is going to be a success here, the movement to just go all the way to single payer is gathering steam. (audience applause)

In lots of areas, California has decided not to wait around for the caboose part of America to get on board. Yokels can mock ""European style democracies"" all they want. We're building one here — gay marriage, pot smoking, regulating carbon. And people like it. The same way when Americans come back from a vacation in Europe, they all say the same thing: ""I saw titties on the beach!"" (audience laughter) But they also remark on the modern airports and train stations over there, and the absence of beggars in the street, and food that tastes like food. (audience applause) And they wonder, ""Why can't we get that here?""

Well, you will be getting that here, courtesy of the Golden State. Why? Because we're huge. We're huge! 40 million of us! (audience cheering) When we demand something, the market must supply it. Like when California set a high mileage standard for cars sold in this state, Detroit had to make more efficient cars. California by itself is the 8th largest economy in the world, the fifth largest agricultural exporter, and of course, #1 in laser vaginal rejuvenation. (audience laughter) Oh, I pat myself on the back.

You know, it's so ironic, the two things conservatives love the most — the free market and states rights — are the two things that are going to bend this country into California's image as a socialist fagtopia. (audience cheering and applause) Maybe our constipated Congress in Washington can't pass gun control laws, but we just did. Because we don't give a shit about the NRA. Out here, that stands for ""Nuts, Racists, and Assholes."" (massive audience cheering and applause)

And while other state governments are working with Jesus to make abortion more miserable — because otherwise women would just use it for weight loss (audience oohs) — California is making it easier. And while immigrants are demonized in Washington and elsewhere, in California we just OK'd driver's licenses for undocumented aliens. (audience applause) That's right, we're letting them drive cars — just like white people! Because we can't be worrying about all the nonsense that keeps Fox News viewers up at night, when they should be in bed adjusting their sleep apnea mask. (audience laughter)

So in conclusion, my message to the rest of America is just this: DO NOT RESIST!! Kneel before Zod! California has been setting the trend in America for decades, and it's not going to stop now. We say jump, you say, ""Please, sell me new exercise clothes for jumping."" (audience applause) We said put cilantro in food, and dammit, you did, you put cilantro in food, even though neither one of us knows what it is. And almond milk? Come on! We just had some extra almonds and thought we'd fuck with you. (audience laughter)"

(CNN) - The disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov and the sluggish economy have done President Barack Obama no favors, with a new poll showing just two in five Americans approve of his job performance.

According to the survey from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 41% of those polled approve of Obama’s job performance while 65% disapprove specifically of his handling of the economy.



Conducted October 30 through November 6, two days before the most recent job numbers were released, the poll shows that of the 2,003 individuals 18 and up interviewed by telephone, just 31% thought the President had done a good job in his handling of the economy.

Obama’s overall job approval rating represents a 14 point slide from where he stood last December, according to Pew. In the latest survey, 53% disapproved of Obama's handling of his job.

On health care, the survey indicates Americans are dissatisfied overall with Obama’s policies, 59% disapprove compared with the 37% who approve.

The approval rating is actually slightly higher than Obama’s Gallup numbers from earlier this week, which showed him nearing an all-time personal low at 39%. Those numbers have since ticked up slightly. Obama’s lowest Gallup approval rating came in 2011 when the number of Americans saying they approved of his job performance hit 38%.

Obama’s approval ratings are slightly higher than those of his most immediate predecessor at the same point, but they are much lower than two other presidents.

A year into his second term, Pew gauged President George W. Bush with a 36% job performance approval rating.

Former President Bill Clinton had a 58% job approval rating at this point in his second term. Americans under Ronald Reagan five years in said they approved of the Gipper’s job performance 62% of the time."

This is one of the many interesting issues facing Congress that we probably will not have time to debate once Congress actually comes back next month. Then it’ll be nothing but Obamacare and government shutdowns and the occasional discussion about whether Senator Ted Cruz has managed to dispose of his recently discovered dual Canadian citizenship.

Which I am personally looking forward to a lot. But today let’s consider the American space program.

Space exploration is one of the extremely few areas in which there is a lot of bipartisan agreement in Washington. For instance, both parties believe that the United States should be trying to get to Mars. Eventually. Nobody thinks this will happen anytime soon — partly because the technology is so challenging and partly because Congress keeps cutting the space budget. So far, NASA has not shown any interest in the tactic being used by a Dutch company that hopes to establish a Martian colony in about 10 years, with money that would come in part from producing a reality series, somewhere along the lines of “Big Brother"" or perhaps “Real Housewives of the Red Planet.”

The third point of wide bipartisan agreement is that nobody wants their constituents to be clobbered by an asteroid. Really, this is a priority. The Obama administration is currently promoting an “asteroid grand challenge,” in which we’re invited “to find all asteroid threats to human populations” and figure out what to do about them."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/28/1251355/-For-a-Budget-That-Is-Both-Morally-and-Economically-Sound,2013-10-28 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",For a Budget That Is Both Morally and Economically Sound,"Further, when we talk about the national budget, it is vitally important that we remember how we got into this fiscal crisis in the first place and who was responsible for it. Let us never forget that when Bill Clinton left office in January of 2001, the U.S. had a budget surplus of $236 billion with projected budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. During that time, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projected a 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion, enough to erase the entire national debt by the end of 2011.

What happened? How did we, in a few short years, go from a large budget surplus into horrendous debt? The answer is not that complicated. Under President Bush we went to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- and didn't pay for them. We just put them on the credit card. The cost of those wars is estimated to be between $4 trillion to $6 trillion. Further, Bush and Congress passed an expensive prescription drug program that was unpaid for. They also reduced revenue by giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations. On top of all that, the Wall Street collapse and ensuing recession significantly reduced tax receipts and increased spending for unemployment compensation and food stamps, further exacerbating the deficit situation.

Interestingly, the so-called congressional ""deficit hawks"" -- Congressman Paul Ryan, Senator Jeff Sessions and other conservative Republicans -- all voted for those measures that increased the deficit. These are the same folks who now want to dismantle virtually every social program designed to protect working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. In other words, it's okay to spend trillions on a war we should never have waged and large defense budgets, and provide huge tax breaks for billionaires and multi-national corporations. It's just not okay when, in very difficult economic times, we try to protect the most vulnerable people in our country.

Where do we go from here? How do we now draft a federal budget which creates jobs, makes our country more productive, protects working families and lowers the deficit?

For a start, we have to understand that, from both a moral and economic perspective, we cannot impose more austerity on the people of our country who are already suffering. The time is now for the wealthy and multi-national corporations who are doing phenomenally well to help us rebuild America and lower our deficit.

At a time when the richest 1 percent own 38 percent of the financial wealth of America, while the bottom 60 percent own a mere 2.3 percent -- we cannot balance the budget on the backs of people who have virtually nothing. When 95 percent of all new income during 2009 through 2012 went to the top 1 percent, while tens of millions of working Americans saw a decline in their income, we cannot cut programs that these workers depend upon.

Instead of talking about cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, we must end the absurdity of one out of four corporations in America not paying a nickel in federal income taxes. At a time when multi-national corporations and the wealthy are avoiding more than $100 billion a year in taxes by stashing money in tax havens like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, we need to make them pay taxes just like middle-class Americans. The truth of the matter is that according to the most recent information available profitable corporations are only paying 13 percent of their income in federal taxes which is near a 40-year low.

While in January 2013, we successfully ended Bush's tax breaks for the richest 1 percent, the truth is that they continue to exist for the top 2 percent, those households earning between $250,000 and $450,000 a year. That must end.

At a time when we now spend almost as much as the rest of the world combined on defense, we can afford to make judicious cuts in our military without compromising our military capabilities.

Frankly, it is time that Congress started listening to the ordinary people. Recently, the Republican Party learned a hard lesson when the American people stated loudly and clearly that it was wrong to shut down the government and not pay our bills because some extreme right-wing members of Congress do not like the Affordable Care Act. Well, there's another lesson that my Republican colleagues are going to have to absorb. Poll after poll make it very clear that the American people overwhelmingly do not want to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, according to a recent National Journal poll, 81 percent of the American people do not want to cut Medicare at all; 76 percent of the American people do not want to cut Social Security at all; and 60 percent of the American people do not want to cut Medicaid at all. Meanwhile, other polls have made it very clear that at a time of growing income and wealth inequality, Americans believe that the wealthiest among us and large corporations must pay their fair share in taxes.

It is time to develop a federal budget which is moral and which makes good economic sense. It is time to develop a budget which invests in our future by creating jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure improvement and expanding educational opportunities. It is time for those who have so much to help us with deficit reduction. It is time that we listen to what the American people want, and not just respond to the billionaire class and major campaign contributors."

the important point about these particular bad predictions is that they came from people who constantly invoke the potential wrath of the markets as a reason we must follow their policy advice. Don’t try to cover America’s uninsured, they told us; if you do, you will undermine business confidence and the stock market will tank. Don’t try to reform Wall Street, or even criticize its abuses; you’ll hurt the plutocrats’ feelings, and that will lead to plunging markets. Don’t try to fight unemployment with higher government spending; if you do, interest rates will skyrocket. And, of course, do slash Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid right away, or the markets will punish you for your presumption. By the way, I’m not just talking about the hard right; a fair number of self-proclaimed centrists play the same game. For example, two years ago, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson warned us to expect an attack of the bond vigilantes within, um, two years unless we adopted, you guessed it, Simpson-Bowles. So what the bad predictions tell us is that we are, in effect, dealing with priests who demand human sacrifices to appease their angry gods — but who actually have no insight whatsoever into what those gods actually want, and are simply projecting their own preferences onto the alleged mind of the market.

In a vote just before Mr. Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky, tried to blockade the nomination of John Brennan as director of central intelligence over drone policy, the Senate failed to end debate on the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan of New York to a seat on the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia. The filibuster of Ms. Halligan didn’t blow up on Twitter the way Mr. Paul’s impressive 12-hour stand did. But of the two, it was the one that could renew a feud over rules governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level judicial nominations — an issue that has torn the chamber for years. Democrats are already in discussions on how to respond to the Halligan filibuster. They believe Republicans are dead set against confirming qualified Obama administration nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They accuse Republicans of exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a filibuster under a 2005 agreement that short-circuited the last partisan showdown over filling judicial vacancies.

Finally, while Sen. Rand Paul's filibustering speech on drones stole headlines regarding the vote for John Brennan to become the next director of the CIA this week, it's a Senate report on the use of enhanced interrogation techniques that could pose a greater problem for Brennan either now or early in his tenure. Though the report remains classified, The New York Times reports that Sen. John McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, will push for at least parts of it to be made public. Insiders note the report offers a scathing criticism of CIA interrogation programs like those portrayed in the film Zero Dark Thirty revealing a pattern of failure to disclose details or grossly distorting the success of the program. If Zero Dark Thirty's performance at the Oscars is any indication—it was nominated but failed to win in any major categories—the American public doesn't care much to discuss the uncomfortable lessons of our involvement in Iraq over the past decade. As always, we avoid them at our own peril. As the saying goes, those who ignore the past are doomed to repeat it.

Seemed like every time we met, Carl Levin was wearing the same suit -- not quite gray, not quite brown, always a little wrinkled. Add the ever-present plastic reading glasses on the end of his nose and a wild swirl of gray hair that covered less of his head every year, and this was either a carefully cultivated professorial image or a guy who had more important things on his mind than how he looked. After just a few of the regular meetings we had during my years on the Free Press editorial page, I knew it was the latter. But that's not to say there wasn't some of the former in the mix. In an era when politicians take courses in telegenics and sound bites, Carl Levin was pretty much ... Carl Levin, and that was apparently OK with the voters of Michigan, who elected and re-elected him six times to the U.S. Senate and would probably have given him a seventh term next year if Levin hadn't said Thursday that he's done running.

At the surrender ceremony after the British defeat at Yorktown in 1781, the British band played “The World Turned Upside Down.” Republicans, like the British, will realize that America has changed only after they lost the battle and the war. A new generation of selfless voters, the millennials have replaced the baby boomers as the focus of American politics but Republicans are stuck in a time warp in the 1980s. As the world changes, Republicans cling to the past as hard as Fox News hangs onto the myth that it is fair and balanced."

During his successful 2010 campaign for Florida governor, Republican Rick Scott adopted a rescue Labrador retriever and named the pooch Reagan. Scott won the election, but the dog isn't living it up in the governor's mansion.

So where the heck is Reagan? Has the dog entered the witness protection program?

[Related: Lucky the dog reunited with owners after 5 months, 380 miles]

The Tampa Bay Times vowed to find out—and eventually did.

Reporters who noticed that Reagan hadn't been seen since early 2011 asked members of the governor's staff for answers, but were rebuffed. The paper then conducted a Woodward and Bernstein-style investigation into the missing dog, and the resulting article is definitely worth a read, especially for the passive-aggressive back and forth between the governor's director of communications and the reporters.

Reporters doggedly pursued the story, and Brian Burgess, who served as communications director during the Scott campaign and now works for the Florida GOP, dodged questions.

""At one point an exasperated reporter asked Burgess if he had killed the dog,"" wrote the paper, ""and Burgess denied ever killing a dog, but still wouldn't say where Reagan was.""

And then comes the money quote:

Late Wednesday, Burgess testily emailed that he was working on an answer and recognized ""the potential for a PR nightmare if the Tampa Bay Times doesn't receive a photo of Reagan next to today's copy of the Tampa Bay Times. So take it to the bank I'm getting you every bit of info I can lay my hands on.""

At last, the reporters asked Gov. Scott about Reagan. The governor said, ""He was a rescue dog, and he couldn't be around anybody that was carrying anything, and so he wouldn't get better."" Scott said that Reagan ""scared the living daylights"" out of people at the governor's mansion. A kitchen employee, he added, threatened to quit and a photographer was scared of the pooch's barking.

[Related: Dog who wouldn't die home after surgery]

So Reagan was sent back. The Scott family now has a new dog, Tallee, who comes with his own set of challenges.

""This dog is the neediest dog,"" said Scott. ""When I worked out this morning, he wants to be right next to you the whole time. If you do a pushup, he wants to be underneath you as you do a pushup. He's a sweet dog."""

But Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has often talked about his own cost-cutting credentials, was told on Wednesday that the state had been a bit too generous under his watch.

Over a 22-month period, New Jersey paid nearly $24 million in unemployment, welfare, pension and other benefits to 20,000 people who did not qualify for them because they were in prison, according to a report from the state comptroller released on Wednesday.

In one case, a former state employee collected more than $37,000 in pension benefits while in prison for the sexual assault of a minor. In another, a man began receiving unemployment benefits three months after he was imprisoned for illegal gun possession — despite a state law that requires people who receive benefits to be “available for work.”

The report blames “a lack of adequate internal controls” at state agencies. In most cases, the agencies that administer the benefits did not check the list of beneficiaries against available databases of county or state prisoners. Instead, the division of pensions and benefits said it relied on tipsters and newspapers to determine whether people receiving benefits had been sentenced to prison."

Even conservatives want to leave the God stuff out of government.

FreedomWorks commissioned a national survey of registered voters last month, shared first with POLITICO, that finds 78 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents self-identify as fiscally conservative and socially moderate [...] The poll asked Republican voters what they are most interested in: 40 percent said “individual freedom through lower taxes and reducing the size and scope of government,” 27 percent picked “traditional values” and 18 percent chose a “strong national defense.""

Hmmm ...Freedomworks is pushing this poll in support of its ""defund the government if Obamacare isn't killed"" effort. Per their telling, Republicans want their elected officials to ""stick to their principles"" and not compromise with Democrats. But on social issues? Forty-one percent of Republicans don't rank gay marriage as a top-10 issue, and only a third rank abortion as a top-3 issue (another third ranks it top-10, and the last third doesn't give a shit).

It's one poll, but it seems to confirm trends inside the GOP's strife-torn tent. The neocons are on the outs. We first saw it with the sequester—where the $800 billion in defense cuts was supposed to prod the GOP to negotiate in good faith for a grand bargain. Instead, the bulk of the GOP nodded in approval and left the military-industrial complex slack-jawed, abandoned despite the mounds of campaign cash they shipped into GOP coffers. But their irrelevance has only been confirmed with the Syria debate, with war hawks grossly outnumbered even inside their own caucus. (Sure, support would be higher with a Republican administration, but that's cold comfort for a crew who exist to bomb shit in the Middle East.)

The Theocons are being marginalized by a society that left them behind a long time ago. And while the 2013 ""rebranding"" efforts have failed, they'll be back the next time Republicans lose a national election. And fact is, they're not going to get single women and youth voters without chucking the Religious Right's agenda overboard. It's inevitable. And if Freedomwork's poll is to be believed, doing so would actually be popular within the GOP.

The ""Jesus rode a dinosaur"" nuts may be loud but not loved, not even by their supposed allies."

Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- one of the chief proponents for using the budget bill to target ObamaCare -- said he would not filibuster even though he doesn't like the agreement.

Senators have been scrambling since Tuesday night to hammer out a proposal, following the collapse of a plan in the House of Representatives.

Talks were led by Reid and McConnell.

The framework on the Senate side would raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7, and include a spending bill meant to last through Jan. 15. The plan would not include any provision relating to the ObamaCare medical device tax, as prior plans did; instead it would include a single provision meant to verify the income of those receiving ObamaCare subsidies. It would also instruct a bipartisan budget committee to report back on a broader plan by mid-December.

The House could be preparing to move the measure quickly, with a Thursday deadline to raise the debt ceiling looming.

On Tuesday, House Republicans failed to move on an alternate budget plan. House GOP leaders, after initially planning to vote on their plan sometime before midnight, shelved the proposal after leaders struggled to round up the votes. ""It is over,"" one GOP aide told Fox News late Tuesday.

With that decision, focus shifted back to the Senate.

Amid discontent on the House side, conservatives were also unhappy with the Senate version and raised concerns that Senate Republicans would go along with it.

But with House Speaker John Boehner losing support for the latest House plan, the odds increased that the chamber could be left taking up whatever the Senate might send over.

Some Democrats urged Republicans to throw in the towel. ""You have two options -- you can get bowled over by the Senate or you can get bowled over by the Senate,"" said one House Democratic aide.

Senate negotiators are racing against a Thursday deadline to raise the debt ceiling.

While the Senate had originally been crafting a bipartisan bill to address the budget impasse, House Republicans surprised Senate negotiators earlier Tuesday when they announced they were pursuing their own framework. Moving quickly, Boehner's office announced late Tuesday afternoon that the chamber would vote by the end of the night.

But a vital meeting of the House Rules Committee, which prepares bills for the floor, was then postponed -- a signal that House leaders were lacking the necessary votes.

Fox News is told that a decision by conservative group Heritage Action to come out against the emerging bill drove some Republicans to oppose the plan -- and helped sideline the proposal. Others said GOP leaders were losing votes on the plan even before the Heritage Action statement came out.

Heritage Action complained that the House plan would ""do nothing"" to stall ""massive new entitlements"" in ObamaCare.

The revised House plan was aimed at both ending the partial government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling, but also imposing one ObamaCare-related provision.

Though Republicans have considered over the last several weeks a range of provisions relating to ObamaCare, the one they settled on in this package would force Congress, the president, and many other administration officials and staff onto ObamaCare without additional subsidies. GOP lawmakers described the proposed mandate as a matter of ""fairness.""

""If the president and Senate Democrats are going to force the American people to live under ObamaCare, then they and all Washington leaders should not be shielded from the law,"" one GOP aide said.

The House plan also would have ended the partial government shutdown by funding the government through Dec. 15. And it would also raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7 -- in turn averting the looming Thursday deadline to raise the debt cap.

Republicans earlier claimed the details of their plan were not so far off from a bipartisan approach being crafted in the Senate. Republicans urged Democrats to give it a chance, and questioned why they would preemptively reject it.

""To say, 'absolutely categorically not, we will not consider what the Republicans in the House of Representatives are doing,' in my view, is piling on,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on the Senate floor, as Democrats lined up against the House plan. ""Let's sit down and work this out.""

White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage called the House approach a ""partisan attempt to appease a small group of Tea Party Republicans who forced the government shutdown in the first place.""

In A bridge falling into the water and a vision for the future gone missing, Laura Clawson points out that the collapse of the Skagit River Bridge on Interstate 5 is symptomatic of a deeper, systematic problem in America today. Public construction spending as a share of GDP is the lowest it's been in decades. And as The Huffington Post reports, more than 700 bridges in Washington State alone are in worse shape than the one that collapsed.

This is a symptom of the slow-motion collapse of American civilization. What is happening to our society is much like watching a rotting log gradually crumbling into dust.

In his epic Middle Eastern history novel The Source, James Michener had a chapter near the end called ""Twilight of an Empire,"" about the decline of the Ottoman Empire because of corrupt and ineffectual government. Political officials had given up hope for positive change, and an elaborate system of bribery prevented most legislation or public works from moving forward. As one government leader said to his protege:



""What we must do is permit no change and hope that things work out for the best."" At that moment his desk was heavy with petitions covering matters of health, schools... and an ingenious plan for clearing the harbor of silt, but during his remaining tenure none would be moved forward.

History moves in cycles, and I think most early 21st century Americans can feel in their gut that this country is on the downslope of its historical trajectory. The question is, can we turn it around, or is it too late? Will American civilization as we know it cease to exist, much like the collapse of the Ottoman Empire a century ago?

One thing is for sure: Our government is fundamentally broken. An honest description of the current normative functioning (or lack thereof) of the U.S. Congress would go something like this:



Every year, one party demands and succeeds in cutting government spending and preventing spending on new projects through two mechanisms: 1. Threats to refuse to raise the ""debt ceiling,"" which would cause America to default on its debt and crash the world economy. 2. The ""silent filibuster"" in the Senate, in which a 60% supermajority is always required to pass any bill or even to debate it. The filibuster also prevents many appointees to courts and government agencies from being confirmed, leading to an ongoing, increasing vacancy rate and inability for executive and judicial institutions to function. Legislation that does pass the Congress is usually drafted by lobbyists for corporations and the wealthy, ensuring that their private interests rather than the public interest is protected. Lobbyists have this power because they provide most of the funds for the reelection campaigns of elected officials. In return for their cooperation in this system, politicians are typically hired by lobbying firms and given generous compensation packages upon leaving elected office.

I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2007

Under this system of government in which we are now living -- a system of institutionalized inaction and bribery in all but name -- spending the necessary funds to repair America's crumbling roads and bridges is considered an extravagant luxury that our country cannot afford.""Too expensive... let it rot."" ""Too difficult to have a functioning government... let it do nothing."" Infrastructure and institutions of a once proud nation, dwindling away into embarrassment and farce. Our leaders no longer care about providing the American people with even basic public goods that can be relied upon. So we -- supposedly the greatest country in the world -- let roads and bridges in major American cities collapse.

Schools, libraries, parks, advanced weather forecasting, and other features of great modern civilizations? Forget about it! All being cut to the bone.

So few jobs being created that labor force participation is the lowest since 1979 and food stamp eligibility is the highest ever? Who cares! It sure isn't the government's responsibility to do anything about unemployment, right? -- the reaction from America's politicians on this score is as deafening as John Cage's infamous symphony of silence.

Even spending money on disaster relief for American cities destroyed by a hurricane or a tornado is no longer an automatic thing, but instead a political football. Our politicians are so tight, the unreformed Ebenezer Scrooge would be proud.

It used to be that America put men on the moon.

We have become a society deeply in decline. And for anyone who is proud to be an American, it is sickening to watch it unfold.

The only question that remains is this: Will the American people rise up, with renewed pride in what their country once was and could be again, and demand better of its leaders?"
http://news.yahoo.com/5-things-obama-tried-during-state-union-address-220559135--politics.html,,[],5 Things Obama Tried to Say During His State of the Union Address -- But Didn't,"Some words missing from tonight's State of the Union address: Iraq. Famine. Sudan. Moon. Mars. Assault rifles. Keystone XL. Videogames. Clinton. Fracking.



The State of the Union is the most public of events but it’s also filled with hidden meanings. The president is explicit at times saying he wants this or that--a higher minimum wage, a “National Energy Trust”--and at other times it’s more obtuse, deliberately so. Omissions mean as much as commissions.



So here are five moments of the State of the Union address, decoded for greater understanding:



1. Deflating the deficit. Obama said: “Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction.”



What he meant: Reality check. Technically he's right; Congress has made cuts from future growth. But the deficit has grown remarkably under Obama’s watch to over 100 percent of GDP. Whether you blame the president or the recession for that is one issue. What’s indisputable is that Obama wants to portray the deficit as a problem that’s on its way to resolution and one that can be worked out with more bipartisanship.



But the effort to reframe the debate is a tricky one. Republicans have made the deficit and spending the centerpiece of all they do, and while it didn’t help them in the last election, it’s still a message that rallies their base and their legions in Congress. Obama could have adopted some of their urgency but he chose not to, instead making spending and deficit reduction less of a priority. This will play well to Democrats and Paul Krugman readers but it may not be the best way to win GOP votes that he’ll need for passage. After all, the tax increase he got through Congress was a lucky break, the result of the Bush tax cuts expiring. It won’t be nearly so easy this year as he attempts to get a GOP-controlled House to sign on to his “balanced” approach to deficit reduction.



2. The clock is ticking on immigration. The president said this about immigration: “In other words, we know what needs to be done. As we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts. Now, let’s get this done. Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away.”



What he meant: The president doesn’t have a lot of time to get this done. There’s a rare burgeoning bipartisan consensus for immigration reform and the longer time passes before a vote, the more likely the idea is likely to die. It’s the basic law of congressional inertia that ideas rarely gather strength over time. Obama is also signaling to Hispanic groups that he understands their urgency. The president kicked immigration reform to his second term and some of his erstwhile allies are still miffed.



3. Drones, what drones? What he said: “Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. Different al-Qaida affiliates and extremist groups have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. But to meet this threat, we don’t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations.... Where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.”



What he meant: President Obama faces a tricky moment on al-Qaida. He has to declare enough victory in Afghanistan to justify leaving while pointing America towards a long twilight challenge from a constellation of al-Qaida franchises. It’s telling that he uses the mealy-mouth phrase “a range of capabilities” when he surely means drones, special forces, and the like. He doesn’t want to define this new phase of the war too specifically.



4. Gun control is about a vote. The president said: They deserve a vote. They, of course, are gun-violence victims. The vote is on some of his proposals. It’s not surprising he brought up the issue. What is interesting is the way he framed it.



What he meant: The president’s rousing call for a vote on gun issues puts the onus on his opponents and spares him having to promise success. Just a vote is all he asks. And by mentioning the slew of mass shootings in disparate corners of the country he made it a national problem. It’s probably the best play for a president who doesn’t have an easy way to get this through.



5. Tax Reform: I’m for it. Now show me a plan. The president talked up tax reform: “Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.”



What he meant: Hey, I’m not going to send you a comprehensive tax plan, you gotta come up with it. That may be too lax. The Reagan Treasury Department goosed tax reform in 1986 and the president is already counting on Congress to work up an immigration plan. This is one area where he could help Congress from taking too much shrapnel by proposing some reforms. What he told us is that he won’t."

The Fed%27s easy-money policies have not produced many jobs.

They have produced a persistent%2C low rate of inflation that is choking the American middle class.

They are a godsend for a Republican Party in search of a middle-class economic policy.

Opposing Janet Yellen's nomination as chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is both good policy and good politics for Senate Republicans.

In her remarks Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen made it clear that she will keep interest rates low and the Fed's balance sheet growing in an effort to boost employment. What remains less clear is whether this policy will actually work. After all, labor participation rates remain near 20-year lows despite the Fed's nearly $4 trillion balance sheet.

While the Fed's easy-money policies have not produced many jobs, they have produced a persistent, low rate of inflation that is choking the American middle class. Since the asset purchases began five years ago, the average American family has experienced rising prices and stagnant wages. The resulting decline in living standards explains why voters ranked rising prices nearly tied with unemployment as their top economic concern during the 2012 election.

As the middle class struggles, America's wealthy are benefiting from the Fed-induced rally in asset prices. Given the selection of New York City apartments now listing in the $100 million range, it is with good justification that Andrew Huszar, the former Fed official who managed its quantitative easing program, called the Fed's policies ""the greatest backdoor Wall Street bailout of all time."" Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a Democrat on the banking committee, reinforced this point in Thursday's hearing, flatly stating that the ""trickle down"" the Fed has been expecting hasn't happened.

Worst of all for those focused on limiting the size of government, Yellen's easy-money policies are encouraging Washington's continued fiscal irresponsibility. With the Fed as a ready buyer of Treasury debt, even the Tea Party Republicans have not been able to meaningfully shrink the government's size.

While Yellen's easy-money policies are a problem for America, they are a godsend for a Republican Party in search of a middle-class economic policy. Yellen's extremism offers the Republicans the perfect opportunity to embrace sound money and send a clear signal to voters that they are listening to their concerns about rising prices and falling living standards.

If easy money delivers what it always has throughout history — growing inflation, growing inequality and growing government — a Republican embrace of sound money will offer America a way back to prosperity and the GOP a way back to a governing majority.

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/12/22/1264127/-Unemployment-benefits-and-the-fight-for-the-liberal-empowerment-agenda,2013-12-22 00:00:00,"['Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags', 'Showtags Popular_Tags']",Unemployment benefits and the fight for the liberal empowerment agenda,"1) Liberal groups will launch a national TV ad campaign that hits Republicans for letting benefits expire for over one million Americans, to be launched the day after Christmas and run on national cable through at least December 28th, the day benefits are set to expire. The ads will also highlight GOP priorities by spotlighting GOP opposition to nixing loopholes enjoyed by the top one percent even as a lifeline expires for over one million far less fortunate Americans. There may also be a second round of ads launched when Congress returns in early January. The ads — backed by a “significant” buy, a source says — will be run by Americans United for Change. Other groups involved in the broader campaign include the National Employment Law project, AFSCME, the AFL-CIO, SEIU, and UAW. 2) House Democrats are planning a big push in local media, with the goal of using local coverage to dramatize how constituents in Republican districts will be impacted by the expiration of benefits. This is hyper-granular stuff: I’m told Ways and Means Committee Dems are collecting county-by-county data on the number of people who will be kicked off benefits, and pushing local press outlets to reflect these numbers in their coverage.

The idea is to make it harder for individual lawmakers to escape the direct consequences, in their districts, of failing to renew benefits, bringing it home ... 3) Liberal groups are drawing up lists of House Republicans who are both vulnerable and reside in states where unemployment is high. The targeting of them will take various forms, such as conference calls — directed at local media in their states and districts — that feature people who are losing benefits. Meanwhile, labor unions are planning events in states, and liberal groups are planning polls on unemployment benefits in both marginal districts and nationally. Results should be released next week.

Sargent notes that the ultimate objective of this campaign is to convince voters, despite the media's automatic inclination to blame ""Congress"" for any gridlock or federal inaction, that the blame for failing to pass an extension of this popular program and hurting 1.3 million Americans in the process falls squarely on the Republican Party. And just as with the contrast between Democrats and Republicans on maintaining current levels of food assistance programs for the neediest, there is certainly room to gain political ground from the electorate by campaigning on conservative heartlessness toward the poor—especially when said conservatives insist on having poor kids sweep school floors to earn their lunches while their wealthier counterparts stand idly by.

Without question, maintaining food stamps and unemployment benefits is an unqualified good. But there is room for debate on whether focusing on the safety net nearly exclusively is harming the liberal project at large. At the New York Times, Thomas Edsall cribs substantially from a post by Roosevelt Institute Fellow Mike Konczal to argue that doubling down on the ""social safety net"" strategy actually detracts from the progressive agenda at large:



In practice, Konczal writes, the political left has abandoned its quest for deep structural reform — full employment and worker empowerment — and instead has “doubled-down” on the safety net strategy. The result, in his view, is “a kind of pity-charity liberal capitalism.” Konczal’s poignant description of the problem goes a long way toward explaining the current struggles of the left. The question is whether there is an effective worker empowerment strategy at a time of globalization, offshoring and robotization. Insofar as Democrats concentrate the bulk of their efforts on means-tested transfer programs (on the extension of long-term unemployment benefits, Medicaid and food stamps, for example), they leave the most needy and vulnerable to the vagaries of public opinion. Survey data find that during hard times people become less altruistic and more inclined to see the poor as undeserving. They turn to the right, not the left, in periods of economic stress.

Edsall makes the case that business interests are more than happy to have the social safety net in place because the welfare state allows them to pay wages that would otherwise be completely inadequate while expecting government to pick up the tab and ensure that these workers have enough resources to prevent the fabric of society from fraying completely. Meanwhile, the current political debate is occurring between Democratic elites who support ""pity-charity liberalism"" despite the lack of a broader empowerment agenda, and a Republican Party infected with such a case of Social Darwinism that it seems to want to see the poor starve, seemingly out of spite if nothing else.

Edsall concludes:



The call of Konczal and his colleagues on the progressive left for an empowerment agenda — for structural economic reform — faces roadblocks far higher than many people realize. The loss of a political movement (economic liberalism) and its political vehicle (a stable progressive coalition) has put the left into a position of retreat, struggling to protect besieged programs that are designed explicitly for the poor and that therefore lack strong public backing. The shift of the Democratic Party from economic to “pity-charity” liberalism has put the entire liberal project in danger. It has increased its vulnerability to conservative challenge and left it without a base of politically mobilized supporters. Progressives are now dependent on the fragile possibility that inequality and socioeconomic immobility will push the social order to the breaking point and force the political system to respond.

Now, none of this is to argue that Democrats and progressive allies should not continue to fight tooth and nail for extensions of the social safety net. Obviously, common decency, economic justice, and the maintenance of the social fabric depend on the continuance of these programs. But especially now that Republicans have been using their control of the House of Representatives to chip away at the social safety net at every opportunity, playing defense is not enough. It is critical to go on offense and fight for a broader empowerment agenda and fundamental structural economic reform, rather than continue to simply defend the social safety net while austerity and economic inequality force ever-increasing numbers of people to rely on it.

Edsall is correct that the political power of the bottom half of the economic spectrum has been gutted and hollowed out; that we have lost a political movement and a political vehicle at the nationwide level. At the local level, however, there are signs of coalescence as minimum wage increases take hold across the country, and as fast food strikes spring up organically across the country. And in Senator Elizabeth Warren, we have one nationwide leader who is willing to not just defend the social safety net, but put fundamental economic reform at the top of her agenda.

The progressive movement is starting to see the energy and leadership necessary to stop simply playing defense, and start advocating for an empowerment agenda that can reverse the decades of squeezing and fracturing endured by the middle class. The question is whether we can sustain enough organizational strength to capitalize at both the local and the federal level and bring about the type of fundamental economic change we need."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/opinion/a-republican-ransom-note.html,2013-09-27 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],A Republican Ransom Note - The New York Times,"On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew sent the House a very serious warning that, for the first time, the United States would be unable to pay its bills beginning on Oct. 17 if the debt ceiling is not lifted. House leaders responded on Thursday with one of the least serious negotiating proposals in modern Congressional history: a jaw-dropping list of ransom demands containing more than a dozen discredited Republican policy fantasies.

We’ll refrain from deliberately sabotaging the global economy, Speaker John Boehner and the other leaders said, if President Obama allows more oil drilling on federal lands. And drops regulations on greenhouse gases. And builds the Keystone XL oil pipeline. And stops paying for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And makes it harder to sue for medical malpractice. And, of course, halts health care reform for a year.

The list would be laughable if the threat were not so serious. A failure to raise the debt ceiling would cause a default on government debt, shattering the world’s faith in Treasury bonds as an investment vehicle and almost certainly bringing on another economic downturn. Unlike a government shutdown, a default could leave the Treasury without enough money to pay Social Security benefits or the paychecks of troops.

The full effects remain unknown because no Congress has ever allowed the government to go over the brink before. The Government Accountability Office estimated that simply by threatening to default in 2011, Republicans cost taxpayers $1.3 billion in higher interest payments because of that uncertainty. The 10-year cost of those higher-interest bonds is $18.9 billion."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-washington-taken-eye-off-economy-213406962.html,,[],Obama: Washington has 'taken eye off' the economy,"GALESBURG, Ill. (AP) — Seeking to build momentum for looming fiscal fights, President Barack Obama on Wednesday cast himself as the champion for middle-class Americans struggling to make ends meet. He chided Washington for having ""taken its eye off the ball"" and declared that the economy would be the ""highest priority"" of his second term.

Obama, in an hour-long address that was at times deeply partisan, also accused Republican lawmakers of succumbing to ""an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals."" He said gridlock had only gotten worse since his re-election.

""I am here to say this needs to stop,"" Obama said in a speech at Knox College. ""This moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates.""

Obama, as he often does when criticizing Washington, glossed over his own status as the inhabitant of the city's most powerful office.

GOP leaders quickly panned the president's remarks as a series of repackaged ideas and empty promises.

""It's a hollow shell, it's an Easter egg with no candy in it,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said.

Indeed, the president's remarks were void of new policy proposals or fresh solutions for breaking Washington stalemates. And there were no new approaches presented for resolving potential showdowns with Republicans this fall over raising the nation's borrowing limit and curtailing across-the-board federal budget cuts known as ""the sequester.""

For the president's advisers, a central goal of the speech was simply to refocus Obama's agenda squarely on the economy ahead of the fall deadlines. The first six months of his second term largely have been consumed by priorities like gun control and immigration, as well as an array of foreign policy crises and domestic controversies, including the National Security Agency's domestic spying programs and IRS scrutiny of political groups.

While official Washington's attention was elsewhere, the economy was slowly but steadily improving. The housing market is recovering, the stock market is soaring, and unemployment, while still high at 7.6 percent, is falling.

Story continues

But the White House fears that standoffs this fall over the debt ceiling and the sequester could upend that progress. The president has declared that he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling and expects Republicans to lift the borrowing limit without concessions. He's also pushing to end the federal budget cuts before they extend into the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.

The president panned the sequester as a ""meat cleaver"" that has ""cost jobs, hurt our military and gutted investments in American education.""

Obama will seek to keep up his renewed economic focus in the coming weeks with a series of speeches on manufacturing, education, housing, retirement security and health care. Advisers say some of those speeches will contain more specific policy proposals, both for congressional legislation and executive action.

The president said he welcomed ideas from lawmakers of both parties, but wouldn't stand for reflexive opposition to his own initiatives.

""I'm laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot,"" he said. ""Now it's time for you to lay out your ideas.""

For Obama, the day trip to Knox College marked a return to the site of his first major economic address. He spoke at the school's graduation ceremony in 2005 as a newly elected U.S. senator.

His remarks back then were strikingly similar to the themes he outlined Wednesday in Illinois and later in Missouri, including the government's role in ensuring all Americans have opportunities to get ahead and the need for the U.S. to be better prepared to compete internationally. Barring action now, Obama said, ""We will be waving the white flag while other countries forge ahead in the global economy.""

The economy in the surrounding Galesburg community reflects much of the underlying economic concerns facing many Americans. A Maytag plant in the town shut its doors in 2004, leaving hundreds of people unemployed. Today, the factory still sits vacant. Galesburg's unemployment rate is just under 8 percent, and nearly a quarter of its population lives in poverty.

""Those old days aren't coming back,"" Obama conceded. He said the proposals he will outline in speeches later this summer will be aimed at adapting the U.S. economy to an increasingly competitive and interconnected world.

On education, the president promised ""an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families.""

During the second stop Wednesday, Obama highlighted a program at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg that gives students education and skills at a faster pace while lowering the costs. Students earn a bachelor's degree in two years.

""You are a laboratory for this innovation. ... I want the entire country to notice it,"" Obama said. ""I've asked my team to shake the trees all across the country for some of the best ideas out there for keeping college costs down.""

The president also said he would use the speeches he'll give in the coming weeks to renew his calls for increasing the minimum wage and giving all 4-year-olds access to pre-school programs. The first of those speeches will come Tuesday, when Obama visits an Amazon distribution center in Chattanooga, Tenn.

Obama also pledged to take steps to encourage home ownership, make it easier for people to save for retirement and to continue to put in place the elements of his health care law in the face of efforts by Republicans in Congress to repeal, delay or eliminate funding for its various parts.

Riordan', 'Tim Rutten']",A Plan to Avert the Pension Crisis - The New York Times,"In our version of the plan, the program would essentially serve as an insurance agency. It would not bail out distressed local retirement plans. Instead, cities, and perhaps states, would be permitted to sell bonds to cover their pension liabilities, with the federal government guaranteeing repayment. Participants would pay fees — a kind of insurance premium — to finance the program, so there would be no net cost to Washington. The program would give cities access to low-cost, long-term capital. But in exchange for what would amount to federal bond insurance, the cities would have to agree to certain reforms of their pension and health care programs for current and former workers. At a minimum, those reforms should include a single national standard for projecting returns on pension investments — remarkably, there isn’t one — and negotiated reductions in current benefits.

Some will argue that the causes of Detroit’s epic civic failure are unique: white flight on an unprecedented scale, the collapse of auto manufacturing, decades of inept, often corrupt, municipal government. One significant cause of its financial debacle, however, is unfortunately shared by an alarming number of other cities, and that’s the burden of unaffordable pension and retiree health costs.

Detroit’s municipal debt is around $18.2 billion, or more than $26,000 for each of its 700,000 residents. Employee pension and retiree health schemes account for $9.2 billion of the liabilities. Until recently, officials thought the programs were fully financed. Now it appears they are short by at least $3.5 billion. That’s because Detroit consistently overestimated investment returns on its pension funds.

It is not alone in this kind of wishful actuarial accounting. California’s giant state pension fund, the world’s sixth largest, continues to assume it will earn 7.75 percent on its investments, even though its actual returns have been less than half that for a decade. Los Angeles continues to project similar annual yields on its investments, when the actual average returns are closer to 5 percent. As a consequence, the city’s unfunded pension obligations probably will grow to around $15 billion over the next four years.

According to Moody’s, the credit-rating agency, Illinois’s net public-employee pension liabilities now amount to $133 billion, or 241 percent of the state’s total annual revenues; in Connecticut, 190 percent; in New Jersey, 137 percent; and in New York, 17 percent."
http://news.yahoo.com/boehner-obama-why-break-businesses-174549696.html,,[],Boehner to Obama: Why a break for businesses only?,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Framing a new argument against President Barack Obama's health care law, congressional GOP leaders called Tuesday for a delay in the law's requirement that individual Americans carry health insurance.

If the White House can grant a one-year delay for employers — as the administration did just last week — individuals should get the same consideration, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and other senior Republicans said in a letter to the president.

""Your decision to delay one part of the law affecting employers and leave in place provisions regulating individual and family health care creates many new questions and concerns,"" the GOP leaders wrote. ""We agree with you that the burden was overwhelming for employers, but we also believe American families need the same relief.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration has no intention of delaying the individual mandate. He said the law provides financial aid to low-income Americans and is flexible so that people facing financial hardships aren't punished for going without coverage.

The criticism from top Republicans, he said, is ""pretty rich coming from leaders who have now voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act going on 40 times, and who promised to do it again, to charge up that hill, only again not to reach the top, rather than focus on the work that the American people want done because they have no alternative.""

Asked whether public confidence in the law could be eroded by delays and by the change in the smoking provision, Carney said, ""A piece of legislation like this, to be responsibly implemented, needs to be implemented in a flexible way.""

Nonetheless, Republicans hope their new argument will gain traction in next year's congressional elections, as the law's big push to cover the uninsured gets underway. Foes are betting the coverage rollout will be full of problems, particularly since about half the states have refused to support the federal effort.

Story continues

Under the law, middle-class people with no access to job-based coverage will be eligible for subsidized private insurance, while low-income uninsured people will be steered to an expanded version of Medicaid in states that accept it.

The health care law contains coverage requirements for individuals as well as companies with 50 or more workers. Both requirements were originally scheduled to take effect next Jan. 1.

Last week, the White House unexpectedly announced a one-year delay in the employer requirement, saying the administration needed more time to work out technical details that employers find too burdensome. Some saw a political motive, since Republicans have criticized the requirement on businesses as a ""job killer.""

But administration officials said that the individual mandate would remain in place.

The two requirements are different. While the mandate on individuals is expected to play a major role in getting people to sign up for coverage, the employer requirement is more of a backstop, designed to deter companies from shifting to the government their traditional role in providing health benefits.

The individual mandate applies to virtually every U.S. resident, with exceptions for financial hardship, people who entered the country illegally, and prison inmates. The coverage requirement survived a determined legal challenge by ""Obamacare"" opponents. A divided Supreme Court upheld the mandate last year, reasoning that the penalties which enforce it are taxes constitutionally levied by Congress.

Those individual penalties start small — as little as $95 next year — but they build up with time. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year some 4 million individuals without insurance will pay about $55 billion in penalties over the course of nearly a decade. The overwhelming majority of Americans already have coverage — through an employer, a government program, or by buying their own plan — and will not have to worry about the fines.

The GOP leaders' letter also requested that the administration provide detailed information on the impact of its decision to delay the employer mandate.

http://news.yahoo.com/treasurys-lew-congress-needs-pass-131656283.html,,[],Treasury's Lew: Congress needs to pass debt limit,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress needs to raise the debt limit and take away the ""cloud of uncertainty"" about the nation's ability to pay its bills, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in an interview broadcast Sunday.

""The fight over the debt limit in 2011 hurt the economy, even though, in the end, we saw an extension of the debt limit. We saw confidence fall, and it hurt the economy,"" Lew said on NBC's ""Meet The Press."" :Congress needs to do its job. It needs to finish its work on appropriation bills. It needs to pass a debt limit.""

Senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill are trying to come up with must-do legislation to keep federal agencies running after Sept. 30 and prevent the possibility of a government shutdown. At issue is what is normally routine: a plug-the-gap measure to fund the government for a few weeks or months until a deal can be worked out on appropriations bills giving agencies their operating budgets for the full 2014 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.

However, some Democrats don't want to vote to continue to fund the government at new, lower levels mandated by the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. And some conservatives are making a last stand against President Barack Obama's new health care law. In addition, Senate Democrats are resistant to a $20 billion spending cut sought by many Republicans.

The issue has divided Republicans between those who think it's appropriate to use the threat of a government shutdown as a negotiating tactic, and those who don't.

Rep. Peter King, R.-N.Y., said Republicans should be searching for ways to de-fund or repeal the Obama health care act. But he called threatening to shut down the government ""terror politics"" and said the strategy wouldn't work. Others have worried that the gamesmanship could cause Republicans to lose control of the House.

Some observers say it's an idea doomed to fail anyway, since Obama brings both a veto pen and the White House podium to the battle.

Story continues

""We should not be closing down the government under any circumstances,"" King said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has taken just that tack, rounding up fellow conservatives to pledge to oppose any budget extension that funds implementation of the health care law. Sunday, he said it was unfair to implement a law that many Americans don't want and that still has wrinkles that need to be ironed out.

""I understand that there's some in the Washington establishment, some from both political parties, that weren't happy with me over this,"" Lee said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ''And in this instance, I'm going to take that as a compliment, an indication that I'm doing something right.""

""The fact is that we can delay this bill,"" he added. ""And if we can delay it, we can stop its consequences, at least for now.""

Lew maintains that the president won't negotiate over the debt limit.

""The mere fact of negotiating over the debt limit, after 2011, would introduce this notion that somehow there's a question about whether or not we're going to pay our bills, whether or not we're going to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,"" Lew said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos."" ''Well, it's not OK to default. Congress can't let us default.""

""(Congress) has to stop looking for what's the last possible moment,"" Lew told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''They should get back after they take their time off in August and they should finish their work and get it done so that there's no uncertainty about America's ability to pay its bills.""

Separately, Lew said no federal bailout is in the works for the city of Detroit, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection. Pressed as to why the government chose to bail out big banks, the auto industry and others, but isn't assisting the city, Lew said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the government has been giving Detroit technical advice and has made resources available to help take down blighted properties through federal programs.

But Lew said that the situation during the financial crisis that warranted the other bailouts was ""unique,"" and that the current problems that Detroit has with its creditors, ""it's going to have to work out with its creditors."""

He Began His Column With The Post In', 'He Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In His Latest Book', 'The Conservative Sensibility', 'Was Released In June']",George Will: Break up the big banks,"With his chronically gravelly voice and relentlessly liberal agenda, Sherrod Brown seems to have stepped out of “Les Miserables,” hoarse from singing revolutionary anthems at the barricades. Today, Ohio’s senior senator has a project worthy of Victor Hugo — and of conservatives’ support. He wants to break up the biggest banks.

He would advocate this even if he thought such banks would never have a crisis sufficient to threaten the financial system. He believes they are unhealthy for the financial system even when they are healthy. This is because there is a silent subsidy — an unfair competitive advantage relative to community banks — inherent in being deemed by the government, implicitly but clearly, too big to fail.

The Senate has unanimously passed a bill offered by Brown and Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, directing the Government Accountability Office to study whether banks with more than $500 billion in assets acquire an “economic benefit” because of their dangerous scale. Is their debt priced favorably because, being TBTF, they are considered especially creditworthy? Brown believes the 20 largest banks pay less when borrowing — 50 to 80 basis points less — than community banks must pay.

In a sense, TBTF began under Ronald Reagan with the 1984 rescue of Continental Illinois, then the seventh-largest bank. In 2011, the four biggest U.S. banks (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo) had 40 percent of all federally insured deposits. Today, the 5,500 community banks have 12 percent of the banking industry’s assets. The 12 banks with $250 billion to $2.3 trillion in assets total 69 percent. The 20 largest banks’ assets total 84.5 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product.

Such banks have become bigger, relative to the economy, since the financial crisis began, and they are not the only economic entities to do so. Last year, the Economist reported that in the past 15 years the combined assets of the 50 largest U.S. companies had risen from around 70 percent of GDP to around 130 percent. And banks are not the only entities designated TBTF because they are “systemically important.” General Motors supposedly required a bailout because a chain of parts suppliers might have failed with it.

But this just means that the pernicious practice of socializing losses while keeping profits private is not quarantined in the financial sector.

To see why TBTF also can mean TBTM — too big to manage — read “What’s Inside America’s Banks?” in the January/February issue of the Atlantic. Frank Partnoy and Jesse Eisinger argue that banks are not only bigger but also “more opaque than ever.” And regulations partake of the opacity: The landmark Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, separating commercial banking from investment banking, was 37 pages long; the 848 pages of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law may eventually be supplemented by 30 times that many pages of rules. The “Volcker rule” banning banks from speculating with federally insured deposits is 298 pages long.

There is no convincing consensus about a correlation between a bank’s size and supposed efficiencies of scale, and any efficiencies must be weighed against management inefficiencies associated with complexity and opacity. Thirty or so years ago, Brown says, seven of the world’s 10 largest banks were Japanese, which was not an advantage sufficient to prevent Japan’s descent into prolonged stagnation. And he says that when Standard Oil was broken up in 1911, the parts of it became, cumulatively, more valuable than the unified corporation had been.

Brown is fond of the maxim that “banking should be boring.” He suspects that within the organizational sprawl of the biggest banks, there is too much excitement. Clever people with the high spirits and adrenaline addictions of fighter pilots continue to develop exotic financial instruments and transactions unknown even in other parts of the sprawl. He is undecided about whether the proper metric for identifying a bank as “too big” should be if its assets are a certain percentage of GDP — he suggests 2 percent to 4 percent — or simply the size of its assets (Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, has suggested $100 billion).

By breaking up the biggest banks, conservatives will not be putting asunder what the free market has joined together. Government nurtured these behemoths by weaving an improvident safety net and by practicing crony capitalism. Dismantling them would be a blow against government that has become too big not to fail. Aux barricades!

Sen. Ted Cruz%2C R-Texas%2C wants to defund President Obama%27s health care law

Tea Party favorite controlled Senate floor for 21 hours%2C 19 minutes

Cruz%27s talkathon technically was not a filibuster

WASHINGTON — By midday Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz's marathon protest of President Obama's health care law was one for the record books.

The Texas Republican had control of the Senate floor for 21 hours and 19 minutes to urge his fellow senators to defund Obama's signature domestic achievement. Cruz and other conservatives say the health care law is a costly intrusion into people's lives.

That put Cruz in fourth place on the list of longest Senate speeches, about three hours short of the Senate filibuster record set in 1957 by Strom Thurmond. The South Carolina lawmaker, then a Democrat, railed against a civil rights bill for 24 hours, 18 minutes.

Cruz passed his fellow Tea Party favorite, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who protested the Obama administration's drones policy for 12 hours, 52 minutes in March.

""This is not a close call. Obamacare isn't working, and millions of Americans are hurting,"" Cruz said on Rush Limbaugh's radio show after ending his talkathon. ""If the Senate listens to the American people ... we'll do the right thing and vote to defund it.""

Cruz's goal is unlikely, given the Democratic control of the U.S. Senate and Obama's threat to veto a stopgap spending bill if it comes to his desk without any health care funding.

Cruz, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, was elected last year — the latest conservative with strong ties to the anti-tax, small-government Tea Party movement. Like his colleagues Paul and Marco Rubio, Cruz has made a splash in a short time.

The Texan has drawn fire for some of his tactics, including from veteran Republicans such as Arizona Sen. John McCain. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., dismissed Cruz's talkathon as ""a big waste of time.""

""We all admire the senator from Texas for his wanting to talk,"" Reid said shortly after Cruz simply sat down at his desk to end his protest. ""With all due respect, I'm not sure we learned anything new.""

As expected, the Senate took the first of a series of procedural votes aimed at adopting a spending bill to temporarily fund the government. Reid intends to take out House-passed language to defund the law known as Obamacare.

If Congress does not pass a spending bill before the end of the month, the government could face a shutdown Oct. 1.

Technically, under Senate rules, Cruz's talkathon was not a filibuster because he did not prevent the Senate from having its scheduled vote. As Cruz came to a close, he thanked his aides, Senate staff and Capitol police for being on duty throughout the night, likening the time spent by all to the Bataan Death March.

He implored the American people to hold their lawmakers accountable and push them to dismantle Obama's health care law.

""I simply want to note to the American people that this debate is in your hands,"" Cruz said. ""Ultimately, all 100 senators ... work for you. The pleas from the American people, particularly in Texas, are deafening. The frustration that the United States Senate doesn't listen to the people is deafening.""

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the politics of the health care law have already been decided by voters and suggested Cruz's debate will no doubt play out again in the 2014 elections.

""There's a time and a place, as the scriptures say. We will certainly debate in the 2014 elections Obamacare,"" Schumer said. ""We did in the 2012 elections, and not a single Democrat who voted for Obamacare in this Senate lost.""

Cruz took control of the Senate floor around 2:41 p.m. ET on Tuesday, vowing to speak ""until I am no longer able to stand."" Overnight, he filled time by talking about the Revolutionary War, the battle against the Nazis, reading tweets from supporters and even reciting Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham.

Cruz also shared ""words of wisdom"" from the reality TV show Duck Dynasty and quoted much of country music singer Toby Keith's song Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.

In terms of time spent controlling the floor, Cruz lapped such legendary Senate talkers as Robert Byrd, Al D'Amato, Huey Long, William Proxmire and Robert LaFollette.

Paul said Wednesday that he congratulated Cruz for his efforts but joked he was in no hurry to try to pass him on the longest-speech list. ""Not anytime soon,"" he said.

GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Florida's Rubio arrived before dawn Wednesday to ask questions of their fellow Tea Party disciple, so Cruz didn't have to speak the whole time — one of the quirks of Senate rules. Cruz could yield, so someone could ask a question, but not give up his control of the floor.

Cruz and Lee have led the defunding effort despite criticism from Senate Republicans who view their tactics as short-sighted because there is no chance of passage up against a Democratic-led Senate and Obama's veto pen.

A majority of Senate Republicans have said they opposed Cruz's tactics on the spending bill, partly out of fears they will be blamed for a government shutdown. That kind of finger-pointing happened more than a decade ago, when the GOP-controlled House led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich forced a 21-day shutdown in 1995-1996.

The chamber's top two Republicans, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said earlier in the week that they would not vote with Cruz.

""We'd all be hard-pressed to explain why we were opposed to a bill we were in favor of,"" McConnell said Tuesday.

http://news.yahoo.com/america-congress-suck-103016895.html,,[],America to Congress: You Suck!,"A bit of news for members of Congress on their way home for the weekend: America hates you.

Nearly eight in 10 Americans told Gallup pollsters this month they disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job, the 45th consecutive month that more than two-thirds of Americans graded Congress poorly.

The problem isn't as much what Congress is doing as what it is not getting done. Fifty-nine percent of the disapproving Americans cited partisan gridlock and ineffectiveness for their thumbs-down.

Fewer than 30 percent cited performance on specific issues or ethics.

It gets worse.

Gallup's 40-year study of the public's faith in U.S. institutions found that the percentage of people expressing confidence in Congress has dropped to 10 percent. For the fourth straight year, the first branch of government ranks last on a list of 16 institutions.

Congress's ranking is the worst Gallup has ever found for any institution it has measured since 1973.

Churches, businesses, the media, labor unions, and schools—people are losing faith in virtually every social institution that made America great, a dangerous decades-old decline explored by National Journal a year ago (""In Nothing We Trust"").

Gallup puts Congress at the bottom of a decrepit barrel.

""The divided Congress, with Democrats controlling the Senate and Republicans the House, is likely part of the reason for the low levels of confidence rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans express, and is tied to Americans' frustrations with Congress's inability to get much done,"" the Gallup study concluded.

Gridlock has many causes. First, House districts are drawn by politicians to protect incumbents, creating a situation where only hyper-conservative Republicans and staunchly liberal Democrats survive most party primaries. The rise of the tea party has particularly radicalized the GOP.

The Internet has polarized and democratized new media, enabling voters to limit their information sources to those that cement their partisan views. Polarized voters push Congress to extremes, making Americans both opponents of, and a cause of, gridlock.

Story continues

Finally, the Democratic White House and GOP-controlled House lack leaders able and willing to craft compromises. President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner, and their partisan choruses rarely even discuss ways to find common ground, much less find any.

In this era of partisanship, it is safer to demonize than to compromise.

Obama's job-approval rating is hovering near 50 percent, a sign that voters tend to blame Republicans a bit more than Democrats for gridlock. It is too soon to conclude whether the recent spate of controversies involving the White House will affect the public's view of Obama. His relatively high numbers may also may be a reflection of the esteem Americans hold for the office of the presidency.

Not so for Congress."
http://news.yahoo.com/government-shutdown-poll-134003896.html,,[],Poll: More Americans would blame GOP for shutdown than Obama,"As finger-pointing on Capitol Hill continues on the eve of a possible government shutdown, a new national survey shows that more Americans would blame Republicans than President Barack Obama.



According to the CNN/ORC poll conducted Friday through Sunday, 46 percent say they would blame congressional Republicans for a government shutdown, with 36 percent saying the president would be more responsible and 13 percent blaming both the GOP and President Obama.



The results are similar to last week's CBS News/New York Times survey that showed 44 percent of Americans would blame congressional Republicans for a government shutdown, while 35 percent would place the blame on the president.



When asked if Barack Obama ""has acted mostly like a responsible adult or mostly like a spoiled child"" during the recent budget battle, 49 percent said the president has acted like a responsible adult, while 47 percent described Obama as a spoiled child.



When the same question was asked about members of Congress, 69 percent said GOP lawmakers have been acting like spoiled children, while 58 percent said the same of congressional Democrats.



The release of the poll comes on the heels of the GOP-led House of Representatives vote approving a bill that would avoid a government shutdown but also delay the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law known as Obamacare, for a year.



On Sunday, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz tried to place the blame squarely on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for refusing to compromise on Obamacare.



""So far, [Reid] has essentially told the House of Representatives and the American people, 'Go jump in a lake,'"" Cruz said on ""Meet the Press"" on NBC. ""He said, 'I'm not willing to compromise, I'm not willing to even talk,' His position is 100 percent of Obamacare must be funded in all instances, and, other than that, he's going to shut the government down. I hope he doesn't do that. If Harry Reid forces a government shutdown, that will be a mistake. I hope he backs away from that ledge that he's pushing us towards, but that is his position.""



Cruz continued: ""Twice Harry Reid has said, 'We won't even have a conversation. I refuse to compromise. We want to fund it all. We want to stick it on the American people. And we won't budge.' That's not a reasonable position. And if we have a shutdown, it will be because Harry Reid holds that absolutist position and essentially holds the American people hostage."""

Members of the House of Representatives urged Obama Thursday to appoint a permanent leader of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) who will support aggressive steps to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.

The group of 45 representatives, led by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Rep. John F. Tierney (D-Mass.), is asking Obama to fill the director spot at the FHFA with a person who will consider a loan principal reduction program to aid ""underwater"" homeowners -- those who owe more on their mortgage than their property is worth. The agency oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and is currently run by acting director Edward DeMarco.

The signatories noted that there are “approximately 10.9 million residential borrowers” who are underwater on their mortgages.

“It is imperative that we have a strong leader at FHFA to take on these challenges, strengthen the housing market, and promote our nation’s continued economic recovery,” the members of Congress wrote.

The letter is likely to reignite calls in Washington for Obama to fire DeMarco, who assumed his position when the president’s nominee to head the agency was blocked from confirmation by the U.S. Senate.

“In the three and a half years since Edward J. DeMarco was designated Acting Director of FHFA,” the press release announcing the letter noted, “questions have persisted about his repeated failure to utilize the authorities available to FHFA to promote a healthy housing finance market.”

The members of Congress further painted the acting director in the letter as someone who “is not interested in obtaining real-world evidence that might contradict his pre-established views.”

Last summer, DeMarco rankled administration officials and others working to stanch the national foreclosure rate when he refused a request from the Treasury Department to implement a principal reduction and debt forgiveness program for certain underwater homeowners.

At the time, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner wrote DeMarco that he was “concerned by [his] continued opposition to allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) to use targeted principal reduction in their loan modification programs.” Geithner added that he did not ""believe it is the best decision for the country.""

Some analysts expected that Obama would replace DeMarco through a December recess appointment. In October, the Financial Times reported that the Obama administration was ""quietly telling housing industry activists"" that there is a plan to replace DeMarco.

Rick Snyder and the bankruptcy specialist he appointed to fix Detroit’s unprecedented financial problems put the blame Sunday squarely on the city and defended their decision to file for Chapter 9.

The Republican governor said Detroit created the problems and stood steadfast behind his decision to file Thursday for bankruptcy, with the city roughly $19 billion in debt.

“This is a tragic, difficult decision, but a right one,” he told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" “It’s not about just more money, it’s about accountable government.”

He said corruption and city leaders ignoring warning signs for 60 years contributed to the problems. Among his biggest concerns, Snyder said, is the decline of municipal services for Detroit’s remaining 700,000 residents, including police response times of nearly one hour.

Snyder said the state cannot help and asking for a federal bailout is “not the right answer,” though Washington has that option.

More On This...

The Obama administration has extended no offer to help, after Congress and the White House agreed to bail out Chrysler and General Motors during the recent recession.

“Can we help Detroit? We don’t know,” Vice President Joe Biden said last week. His remarks followed White House Press Secretary Jay Carney appearing to rule out such assistance.

“That's something that local leaders and creditors are going to have to resolve,” he said. “But we will be partners in an effort to assist the city and the state as they move forward.”

Among the emerging concerns is that the federal government would have to help repeatedly, considering Chicago reportedly has an unfunded pension liability of at least $19 billion while Los Angeles’ is estimate to be as much as $30 billion.

“There are a lot of other cities right behind Detroit,” Republican strategist Ron Bonjean told Fox News on Sunday.

Kevyn Orr, the emergency manager and bankruptcy lawyer appointed by Snyder, made comments similar to the governor’s on Sunday but avoided questions about a possible government bailout.

“This is the only way,” he told “Fox News Sunday.” “We were compelled to file for bankruptcy.”

Orr said his goal is to restructure the debt, including roughly $3.5 million in underfunded pension liabilities, and to get Detroit on its feet again by fall 2014.

He also said he has appealed a judge’s ruling Friday that the bankruptcy violates Michigan's constitution, which protects government employees' pensions.

Orr also said that his plan would extend full payments only to pensioners for the next six months and acknowledge the hardship it will cause.

“This is very personal to me,” he said. “My mother is a pensioner.”

Still, he said Detroit “dug this hole,” in part by not addressing its problems earlier.

With a population of 1.8 million in the 1950s, Detroit’s slow decline started with residents migrating to the suburbs in the 1960s and was accelerated by automakers leaving Detroit, which diminished the city’s tax base and made it difficult for officials to provide basic services such as police protection.

The filing makes the city the largest in the United States to file for bankruptcy.

Orr also defended criticism from the financial sector, saying potential investors will look at an improved Detroit, not the old one.

I remember when people said “nobody will ever buy a car from a bankrupt automaker,” Orr said."

Taxpayer Advocate says 90%25 of families who claimed adoption tax credit in 2012 had returns flagged for review

Nearly 70%25 had at least a partial audit of their tax return%2C the taxpayer advocacy service reports

Change in law made more families eligible for larger refunds

Another day, another headache for the Internal Revenue Service.

This time, the federal agency is being accused of mishandling the tax returns of adoptive families.

A report from the IRS's Taxpayer Advocate Service says that 90% of families who claimed the adoption tax credit during the 2012 filing season had their returns flagged for further review. Nearly 70%t had at least a partial audit of their tax return.

But the majority of the cases where the tax credit was audited — more than 35,000 returns in all — resulted in no changes.

The Taxpayer Advocate report says the IRS's handling of the adoption tax credit was a essentially a nightmare.

""The IRS's misguided procedures, and its failure to adequately adjust these processes when it learned its approach was seriously flawed, have caused significant economic harm to thousands of families who are selflessly trying to improve the lives of vulnerable children,"" said the report.

Among those families are Jake and Elfie Dotson of Clarksville. They've been dealing with the IRS for more than a year, trying to finalize their 2011 tax return.

Jake Doston is expecting a refund of several thousand dollars, which will help offset the $11,000 in fees they paid for the adoption. He says that because the IRS hasn't approved the tax credit, the agency claims the Dotsons still owe taxes.

""The IRS is telling me that I owe them money they haven't paid me, plus interest and penalties,"" he said.

The problem with the tax returns started in 2010, with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often known as ""Obamacare.""

That law changed the way the IRS handled the tax credit for adoptions. It raised the maximum credit to $13,170 per child and made the credit refundable and retroactive. That meant the credit could could boost a family's tax refund by thousands of dollars.

In the past, many families had not qualified for the full credit. But the new rules made more families eligible for larger refunds, said Becky Wilmoth, a registered tax return preparer for Bills Tax Service of Centralia, Ill.

""A lot of people were able to go back and amend their returns from past years,"" said Wilmoth, who specializes in returns for adoptive families.

The new rules meant the total amount of money refunded jumped fourfold.

For the 2009 tax year, 81,430 taxpayers claimed the adoption tax credit, for a total of $280.6 million. For 2010, 110,591 taxpayers claimed $1.2 billion in credits. In 2011, 51,539 taxpayers claimed $668.1 million in credits.

""I don't think they knew there were that many adoptive families out there,"" said Wilmoth.

Wilmoth said most families who had trouble with the IRS didn't get a full-blown audit, including interviews with IRS agents. Instead, they got a review of the paperwork for their adoption tax credit. That still causes a lot of anxiety, she said.

But most families eventually got their tax refunds, with interest. According to the IRS report, the median refund for the adoption tax credit was more than $15,000.

""Yes, they had to wait,"" Wilmoth said. ""But you are also talking about a lot of money.""

An IRS spokeswoman said that in the past, other refundable tax credits had led to fraud. So the agency was trying to prevent that from occurring with the adoption credit.

""The IRS implemented the adoption credit program with an approach that balanced the objective of paying legitimate credits in a timely manner with that of ensuring that claims were accurate,"" Michelle L. Eldridge, chief of National IRS Media Relations in a statement.

""Our experiences and lessons learned from other refundable credits taught us that high dollar credits have high risk and the potential for fraud. We must ensure delivery of the credit to those entitled while protecting the government's interest in minimizing exposure to fraud.""

News of the adoption audits fueled more online criticism of the IRS. The agency already is under fire after it apologized for targeting Tea Party groups and pro-life groups that had applied for tax exemptions. There does not seem to be any political motive behind the adoption credit audits.

Chuck Johnson, president and CEO of the National Council for Adoption, said he thinks the amount of money involved in the refunds was the issue. He also thinks there were fears that some people might misuse the credit.

That didn't prove to be the case. The IRS disallowed less than 2 percent of the total tax credits claimed, according to the Tax Advocate Service report.

""The good news is that the kind of people who adopt children don't try to cheat on their taxes,"" said Johnson.

Holly Spann, the Tennessee representative for the American Adoption Congress, said in an email that she was disappointed to see that ""such a large number of adoptive parents are going through so much unwarranted analysis by the IRS and having their refunds short-changed....""

Adoptive families who had their tax refunds delayed said that complying with the IRS's requirements was complicated.

David French of Columbia, Tenn., a blogger and lawyer for the American Center for Law and Justice, said that he and his wife, Nancy, filed for the adoption credit in 2011, after adopting their daughter from Ethiopia. Over the summer, they received a letter from the IRS requesting more paperwork, including receipts for their expenses.

They were able to send copies of the receipts for their plane tickets as well as the fees they paid to their adoption agency. But most of their expenses while traveling in Africa were paid in cash.

""Even your hotel doesn't take a credit card in Ethiopia,"" he said.

Families who adopt from overseas often run up tens of thousands of dollars in debt to pay for the adoption. Getting the tax credit can make it easier for middle-class families to adopt, said French. The median income for taxpayers who got the adoption credit was $64,000.

The adoption tax credit is no longer refundable, which has made it easier for taxpayers who claimed the credit for 2012. Wilmoth said only two of her clients have had their credits reviewed this year.

That may change if the credit becomes refundable in the future. Senators Bob Casey, D-Pa., and Mary Landrieu, D-La., along with Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, introduced the Adoption Tax Credit Refundability Act of 2013 on Thursday, to make that happen.

Jake Dotson said he'd just like to see his troubles with the IRS be over. He said most people already have a negative view of the agency, because no one likes to pay taxes. The recent controversies have made things worse.

""Nobody trusts them,"" he said.

Brown targets enterprise-zone tax credits,"SACRAMENTO — A battle is raging over a California program that grants businesses tax breaks for creating jobs but prevents the public from knowing who got them and why.

At issue are enterprise zones, which were established to boost employment in disadvantaged urban neighborhoods and rural areas. California is home to 40 of these special districts, in which about 35,000 companies have qualified for tax credits. Last year they reaped an estimated $700 million in credits — a figure that state tax officials project will grow to $1 billion by 2016.

Giants FedEx Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have availed themselves of these incentives, which are worth as much as $37,400 for each hire. So have small businesses, including two Sacramento strip clubs named Gold Club Inc. and Deja Vu Showgirls.

But the identities of most beneficiaries are a mystery. Because of the confidential nature of state tax laws, it’s nearly impossible to find out which companies got credits, how much they were worth and how the companies qualified for them.

Gov. Jerry Brown is now seeking to eliminate enterprise zones, which he has decried as inefficient, opaque and “loose” in handing out tax breaks. His administration contends that the program has rewarded some firms for simply moving jobs from one part of California to another and that it has helped businesses not located in impoverished areas. And it has showered benefits on low-wage industries including fast-food restaurants and retailers that do little to build middle-class jobs.

“Enterprise zones are not producing the kind of economic growth that we want,” said Kish Rajan, the director of Brown’s business development team. “Not in manufacturing or biotech research and development.”

Brown is supporting legislation that would replace the 27-year-old enterprise zone program with broader incentives. As part of his budget proposal for the year that starts July 1, Brown would redirect existing funds, spending $400 million on a sales tax credit to boost manufacturing and biotech, $200 million on incentives to provide jobs for the poor and unemployed and $100 million to reward businesses that expand in the state.

He faces powerful opposition from local governments and business groups that defend enterprise zones, calling them a crucial economic development incentive in a state that has long been considered unfriendly to business.

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is a major proponent of the zones. L.A. boasts two vast enterprise zones. One is centered in Hollywood and contained entirely within the city limits. The other is shared with the county in an area covering Highland Park, Eagle Rock, Chinatown, Boyle Heights and unincorporated areas of East Los Angeles. The county also administers the Harbor Gateway Communities Enterprise Zone with the cities of Los Angeles and Huntington Park.

Combined, these enterprise zones and others make Los Angeles County the No. 1 area in the state for handing out enterprise zone tax credits, with a 37% share in 2010, according to California tax officials.

“State enterprise zones are one of the few tools we have to create economic opportunity in the areas that need it most,” said Vicki Curry, Villaraigosa’s senior press secretary.

Businessman Martin Lopez credits the enterprise zone program with helping his small health-products business prosper. His company, Herbs of Mexico, is based in East Los Angeles with branches in Huntington Park and Fontana.

The incentives, Lopez said, helped him triple revenue and staffing over the last six years at his three stores, which sell traditional health remedies from Latin America. His business qualifies for the credits because his stores are in areas defined as economically distressed and because he hires economically disadvantaged workers such as ex-prisoners, veterans and the long-term unemployed.

“I’m very comfortable using those credits to do something worthwhile, and that helps me as a small-business owner,” he said. “It’s the first business I’ve successfully owned.”

But critics of enterprise zones say that most of the benefits flow to large companies.

According to the Franchise Tax Board, 65% of the credits issued in 2010 went to corporations with more than $1 billion in assets, 15% to companies with $100 million to $1 billion in assets and only 6% to employers with less than $10 million in assets.

A Sacramento enterprise zone recently released data showing that Wal-Mart and FedEx are among the companies that have received tax credits in its area. In Los Angeles, Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times, has also taken the incentives.

The Times, whose headquarters are in downtown L.A., “meets the qualifications of the California Enterprise Zone tax credit and has taken the credit in prior tax years,” Tribune spokesman Gary Weitman said in response to a query from a Times reporter. He declined to provide further details.

State Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo) and other lawmakers say all the secrecy makes it impossible to root out abuses or to discern whether the zones are effective. Hill is the author of a bill, SB 434, that would limit enterprise zone benefits and increase oversight and public disclosure.

“Without transparency, we and the taxpayer are in the dark,” Hill said. The enterprise zone operators “don’t want us to see what benefits businesses received and how much money it’s costing us.”

The California Assn. of Enterprise Zones contends its programs have boosted local economies. The state’s enterprise zones added 25,000 new jobs and saved 110,000 existing ones in 2012 alone, said Craig Johnson, the group’s president and the manager of an enterprise zone in Long Beach. “I’d say that’s a pretty good sign of success,” he said. The association’s data are mainly self-reported by employers.

A recent report by the state’s legislative analyst contradicted Johnson’s assessment. It said the “most rigorous research has found that [enterprise zones] do not create a net increase in jobs or increase the rate of job creation.” The analyst also raised the question of whether many of those hires would have been made anyway, without the enterprise zone incentive.

In a 2009 study, the Public Policy Institute of California said it was skeptical whether a “cash-strapped state” could afford to continue enterprise zones, given “the absence of evidence of a beneficial effect of California’s enterprise zones on job and business creation.”

Gov. Brown has lambasted the program for rewarding companies with up to five years’ worth of credits per hire for simply moving jobs from one part of the state to another, resulting in no net increase in jobs.

At a May 14 news conference, he pointed to the case of a medical and scientific supply company that has become a symbol of alleged enterprise zone abuses. Brown said that “a company that went from Brisbane to somewhere in the Central Valley” got “a tax credit for leaving one part of California to go to another.”

The company, VWR International of Radnor, Pa., last year closed its Brisbane distribution center south of San Francisco, laying off about 200 union workers, who were denied opportunities to transfer to a new facility in Visalia, 235 miles southeast in Tulare County.

VWR “took $22-an-hour jobs with family healthcare and pensions and turned them into $10-an-hour jobs with unaffordable healthcare and no retirement,” said Doug Bloch, political director for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in Northern California.

Whether VWR is getting tax credits or plans to seek them for the replacement hires in Visalia is unclear. The Sequoia Valley Enterprise Zone, which covers all of Tulare County, declined to discuss VWR’s status, citing tax confidentiality laws.

“To date, VWR has not claimed any enterprise zone tax credits or benefits,” said Valerie C. Collado, a company spokeswoman. Nevertheless, experts note that VWR appears to qualify for the incentive. Under current California law, the company could take up to four years to seek retroactive tax credits, without the public knowing about it.

The efforts by Sen. Hill and the governor still must overcome strong opposition from powerful lobbies for the local officials at dozens of enterprise zones who dole out tax credits as well as complaints from the companies that get them. Those companies make millions of dollars in political contributions to legislators and state and local elected officials.

Persuading the needed two-thirds of the members of both houses of the Legislature to get rid of a popular business tax break won’t be easy. This month, seven state senators and Assembly members from the Latino Legislative Caucus wrote to Brown, asking him to slow down his efforts to eliminate the zones.

“We are hearing from our constituencies, leaders, employees and businesses alike that the elimination of the [enterprise zone] program as we know it will potentially devastate our communities,” they wrote. “Businesses will be forced to lay off employees and/or go out of business, increasing poverty and unemployment in communities with already high rates.”

Enterprise zones have all the characteristics of “an old-fashioned political patronage system,” countered Barry Broad, a Sacramento lobbyist for labor unions. “I can deliver something to you, Mr. Businessman,” he said, “and you be friendly to me.”

http://news.yahoo.com/mass-gov-vetoes-transportation-financing-182535482.html,,[],Mass. gov vetoes transportation financing bill,"BOSTON (AP) -- Mass. Gov. Deval Patrick on Friday kept his promise to veto a massive transportation financing bill, saying the measure was ""not good enough"" after lawmakers rejected his demand to include a plan for offsetting a potential loss of turnpike tolls.

In making the announcement, the governor said he was acting with ""mixed emotions"" because the bill included many positive elements.

Legislative leaders in both the House and Senate have expressed confidence that they have sufficient votes to override the veto.

The bill, which calls for $500 million in new taxes, seeks to pump billions of dollars into the state's transportation network over the next decade, allowing the state to modernize its aging infrastructure and jumpstart a number of stalled projects, such as expansion of commuter rail to the South Coast.

The legislation would also end the practice of borrowing to pay salaries of state transportation workers and close the MBTA's $115 million deficit, heading off another round of fare increases or service reductions.

""On the one hand, this bill, in its current form, enables us to reinvest in our transportation network, after decades of willful neglect,"" Patrick said in a statement. ""It provides some short-term resources to deal with our most pressing needs. It responds to a key priority of my administration and will stimulate many jobs.""

""But this bill is not good enough,"" he added.

The key flaw in the bill, according to Patrick, is that it does not address the problem of how to replace lost revenue if tolls west of Interstate 95 come down as scheduled in 2017. While some lawmakers are of the belief the tolls will not ultimately come down, the governor criticized the Legislature for choosing to deal with the question at a later time.

""I believe this is an issue to be dealt with now, not put off to another day,"" he said.

Patrick's amendment would have allowed for an automatic increase in the state's gas tax if — and when — the western tolls come down.

The House on Wednesday voted 121-31 to send the bill back to the governor without the change, and the Senate did the same on Thursday by a 29-9 margin. Both margins, if they held up, would be above the two-thirds threshold needed to override the veto.

The bill already includes a 3 cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax and would index future increases in the tax to inflation. It also raises the cigarette tax by $1 per pack and imposes the state sales tax on computer software and services."

WASHINGTON -- If Congress fails to pass a spending bill and shuts down the government, federal workers shouldn't expect to be made whole for their furlough days the way they were after the shutdowns of 1995 and 1996, according to the president of a union for federal employees.

Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 workers, said she wouldn't be surprised if this particular Congress declined to grant back pay to workers.

""It's a different time and a different Congress,"" Kelley told HuffPost. ""There are too many people who remember [1995 and 1996] or were told about it by someone and I want them to know that is not a guarantee.""

""I'm telling employees not to assume they would be paid,"" Kelley continued, ""and that adds to the frustration and the anger. They're tired of being caught in the middle of this.""

Last week, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill that ties government funding to the defunding of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Of course, the White House and Senate Democrats have refused to neuter the president's landmark health care reform law at the behest of Republicans. Barring a resolution, funding for government services will expire next week.

Many workers employed in national security roles, like Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officers, would be exempted from furloughs and keep working even if the government goes into shutdown mode. In that case, they would get paid retroactively for their service, but not until Congress passes the new spending legislation.

For other workers, the shutdown would lead to an unknown number of furlough days. Congress could later choose to pay workers for the furlough period -- or not. After the mid-'90s shutdowns, Congress passed legislation compensating workers for the wages they lost.

According to J. David Cox, head of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, the looming government shutdown would amount to ""involuntary servitude"" for federal workers who continue clocking in even if government operations go unfunded by Congress.

Cox, whose union represents 670,000 workers across federal agencies, told HuffPost that union members were ""unnerved"" by the possibility of a shutdown, especially after many have already taken unpaid furlough days this year due to sequestration.

""They've lost a whole week's pay,"" Cox said of many federal employees. ""Now you're talking about a government shutdown. In many instances employees will be required to go to work but won't get paid on payday.""

""This is no way to run a country,"" Cox added.

The threat of a government shutdown has become more common amid Congress' ongoing budget battles. In addition to facing furlough days, many federal employees have also been under a three-year pay freeze as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for belt-tightening. (Although many workers have still received merit raises, they have not been eligible for their traditional cost-of-living increases each year.)

Cox said the union has been in close contact with the offices of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) on the possibility of a shutdown. Kelley said her union has asked all its members to pressure their representatives to strike a deal.

""I don't think anyone is willing to accept it as the new normal, because it's no way to run any operation, much less the federal government,"" Kelley said."

Samuelson', 'Former Columnist Focusing On Economics', 'December', 'Robert J. Samuelson Wrote A Twice-Weekly Column On Economics. He Retired In September']",Robert Samuelson: The luxury of muddling through,"The budget package crafted by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray and Republican Rep. Paul Ryan — heads of the Senate and House Budget Committees — recalls political scientist Charles E. Lindblom’s famous 1959 essay, “The Science of ‘Muddling Through.’” Wrote Lindblom: “Democracies change their policies almost entirely through incremental adjustments. Policy does not move in leaps and bounds.” People stick with what they know. Transformational (“non-incremental”) changes are usually “politically impossible” and, when they’re not, are “unpredictable in their consequences.”

More than a half-century later, Lindblom’s insights endure. Just look around. Obamacare demonstrates the perils of transformational policies — heir unpredictability. And the Murray-Ryan accord is a triumph of incrementalism, a.k.a. “muddling through.” Okay, let’s acknowledge their accomplishment. The agreement beats the alternative, which might be another senseless government “shutdown” (actually, only a partial shutdown). But the price of peace is doing almost nothing about our long-term budget problems.

Recall: The central issue is the mismatch between government’s spending promises and its willingness to tax. Although the Great Recession hurt, it’s not the crux of the matter. From 1973 to 2012, the budget was in surplus only four years. During this period, spending averaged 21 percent of the economy (gross domestic product) and taxes averaged 18 percent. Retiring baby boomers are now raising Social Security and Medicare spending and — if nothing is done — deficits.

But do what? Democrats won’t cut retiree benefits; Republicans reject tax increases. The rest of the budget (the 36 percent that includes defense and “discretionary” programs such as the FBI, school lunches and environmental regulation) has borne most cuts. In 2011, the Budget Control Act reduced this spending by imposing annual caps. When Congress couldn’t agree on further changes, it triggered “sequestration”: automatic cuts to the same spending.

Now Congress can’t stomach sequestration. Republicans worry that the military is being savaged. Training has been cut, weapons purchases delayed, force sizes reduced. By 2021, American fighting forces may shrink by about 25 percent from 2012 levels, estimates the Bipartisan Policy Center. Democrats fear that domestic programs are being gutted. A report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, lists some concerns: fewer meat inspectors and forest firefighters; less spending on Head Start and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Murray-Ryan plan aims to relieve this sequestration misery. It does this by increasing authorized spending by $45 billion in 2014 and $18 billion in 2015, split between defense and non- defense programs. To pay for the increases, the plan would, among other things: lower pension benefits for federal workers and military retirees; raise fees for airport security and premiums for federal pension guarantees; and reduce payments to states from mineral leasing.

There’s no pretense of dealing with the underlying mismatch between taxes and spending. In 2014 and 2015, budget deficits increase slightly (a good thing, say some economists). The claim that the package would provide a small amount of deficit reduction over a decade is dubious; most of the reduction occurs in 2022 and 2023 and reflects assumptions that can be instantly reversed. The broader message is that annual deficits would continue indefinitely; “the current [upward] trajectory of the debt” would not change, says the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

All this is in the best tradition of muddling. Hardly anyone wants to confront truly difficult questions. How big a government do we want? What groups or causes deserve help? Which don’t? How high can taxes go without harming the economy? For decades, Congress and presidents have dodged these and other hard issues through chronic and expedient deficits. Rhetoric aside, they’re staying with what they know, as Lindblom foretold.

But there’s a problem. Lindblom’s common-sense insight has a giant exception: crises. Change, forced by outside events, then happens by “leaps and bounds.” The recent financial crisis caused Congress and two presidents to embrace measures (the rescue of big banks, General Motors and Chrysler) that were unthinkable a few months earlier. In the 1960s, civil rights demonstrations pushed Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that, in outlawing most public racial discrimination, wasn’t “incremental.” History offers other examples, including the Civil War, the New Deal and both World Wars. Small changes won’t suffice when big changes are required.

On the budget, muddling through comes with a crucial assumption. It is that continuous deficits won’t provoke a crisis that compels political leaders to take harsh steps that they would otherwise not take. This optimism may be justified. For decades, “experts” have warned of the dire consequences of unchecked deficits. Yet no great crisis has occurred. But this conviction also could be complacency. Government debt is in territory that, except for wartime debt, is unprecedented. We don’t know the consequences. Someday, we may no longer have the luxury of muddling through.

In April%2C the consumer price index fell 0.4%25

Gas prices dropped 8.1%25

Excluding volatile food and energy costs%2C core prices were up only 0.1%25

WASHINGTON (AP) — A plunge in the cost of gas drove down a measure of U.S. consumer prices last month by the most since December 2008. Excluding the drop in fuel costs, prices were largely unchanged.

The consumer price index fell 0.4% in April from March, the Labor Department said Thursday. The main reason the index fell was that gas prices plunged 8.1%.

For the 12 months that ended in April, overall prices rose 1.1% — the smallest year-over-year increase in 2½ years.

Excluding volatile energy and food costs, ""core"" prices ticked up 0.1% last month. Core prices have risen only 1.7 percent in the past 12 months. That's just below the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target.

Scant inflation is allowing the Fed to continue its extraordinary efforts to stimulate the economy. Worries about lower inflation or even deflation might push the Fed to step up its low interest-rate policies to stimulate more borrowing and spending and push prices higher.

Deflation is a destabilizing cycle in which prices and wages fall steadily. It can slow economic growth.

Unusually low inflation means consumers can stretch their paychecks and buy more goods and services. But if it were to fall further, it could stoke fears of deflation.

""Subdued demand means that core inflation is likely to edge lower, as retailers will be forced to pass previous falls in raw material costs onto customers,"" Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. ""The Fed may soon put more emphasis on fading inflation trends.""

A little inflation can be good for the economy, because it encourages businesses and consumers to spend before prices rise further.

Aside from sharp swings in gas prices, consumer and wholesale inflation has been mild this year. The combination of modest economic growth and high unemployment has kept wages from rising quickly. That's made it harder for retailers and other firms to raise prices.

The average national price for a gallon has fallen since reaching a peak this year of $3.79 on Feb. 28. The average price was $3.60 a gallon on Thursday, according to AAA.

The Fed has said it will keep the short-term interest rate it controls near zero at least until the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, as long as the inflation outlook remains mild.

It is also buying about $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bonds to try to keep longer-term rates low. That's intended to encourage borrowing and spending, which drives economic growth.

Many economists expect the Fed to begin to taper those purchases by the end of the year, particularly if hiring stays healthy. But too-low inflation could encourage the Fed to maintain or even step up the pace of its purchases."

They know this because House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan created a spreadsheet with some scary charts of what things might be like in the 2070s. (Rumor has it that he created the charts with nothing but his dimples and abs.)

So when Ryan said over the weekend that the country isn't facing an immediate debt crisis, Very Serious People were right to be dismayed. After all, how can Paul Ryan possibly convince Americans to support his plan to balance the budget in ten years if he says there's not an immediate debt crisis? If Ryan says there's no debt crisis, people might get crazy ideas—like believing that creating jobs should be our top priority, not austerity.

Fortunately, Paul Ryan has a boss: House Speaker John Boehner. And Speaker Boehner knows there's a debt crisis. He said so in December, dismissing President Obama's plan to replace the sequester and end Bush tax cuts for the wealthy because ""his plan does not begin to solve our debt crisis.""

But wait, I'm just learning now that Boehner has recanted. This weekend he said:



We do not have an immediate debt crisis.

Asked specifically whether he agreed with President Obama who has said we don't have an immediate debt crisis, Boehner said ""yes."" Don't get me wrong, he still says he wants to make huge spending cuts, because eventually he says we'll have a crisis—but he says we don't have one right now.

But just because Boehner is changing how he talks about whether or not there's a debt crisis, it's not like he's actually changing his policies. Sure, it would be reasonable for him to change, given that the budget deficit has dropped by half since 2009 while the unemployment rate is still stuck near 8 percent. But that's not happening. Republicans might be saying there's no debt crisis, but austerity is still the only thing they are offering."

Divided government requires bipartisan negotiation

By Eric Cantor,

The writer, a Republican, represents Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in the House, where he is the majority leader.

For three years, Congress and the White House have been building to this moment. Not the debt limit or Obamacare specifically, but this clarifying moment of Washington dysfunction. President Obama has led us here by continually thwarting the will of Congress and dismissing its role in our constitutional republic. This must end.

The president not only has refused to negotiate on issues of debt and spending but also has mocked the very idea of engaging with Congress. President Obama has repeatedly made clear that he feels it is beneath the office of the presidency to work in a bipartisan way with the legislative branch.

The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and the power to borrow. The president was given the power to veto measures, including those related to spending and borrowing. These separate powers created checks and balances but also forced the executive and legislative branches to work together.

As James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 48, “It is equally evident, that none of [the branches of the federal government] ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence over the others, in the administration of their respective powers.”

In the 224 years of our nation’s history, one party has controlled the House, Senate and White House for 130 years. President Obama enjoyed two of those years, and it’s no surprise he wishes that were still the case. Yet every president has found a way to lead whenever there has been a divided government — except this one.

In 2006, then-Sen. Obama said: “Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America’s debt limit.”

Seven years later, and after the nation’s debt had doubled , President Obama refuses to even sit at the same table as Republicans and work to solve the “debt problem” he correctly identified as a senator. That is a much larger failure of leadership.

This has, unfortunately, been the case since 2011. President Obama has often chosen to unilaterally circumvent the law under the guise of executive authority. Most recently, that was demonstrated in July with his delay of Obamacare mandates for corporations, but it has been a hallmark of this presidency.

Courts have held that President Obama violated the Constitution with certain “recess” appointments, ignoring the required consent of Congress. He has abused executive-branch “rule making” rather than working with Congress to pass laws. He has ignored the letter of the law when it comes to religious liberty and work requirements for welfare.

President Obama has used executive orders to unilaterally change U.S. immigration laws. His administration has used waivers to change laws such as No Child Left Behind to compel states to adopt new policies.

In some of these instances, the president attempted to garner statutory authority, failed to do so and then acted in defiance of that. In other instances, he never bothered to find consensus and ignored Congress from the outset, usually contending that he simply had no choice. This is no way to govern, and it cripples the system of checks and balances that our Founding Fathers envisioned.

Working in divided government is not new. As recently as 1995, President Bill Clinton worked overtime with House Speaker Newt Gingrich to reach bipartisan compromise over the debt ceiling and to end a government shutdown.

Neither Clinton nor congressional Republicans got everything they wanted from those negotiations. They found consensus, and that consensus moved the country forward; they managed to balance the budget because they worked together.

Just two years ago, President Obama and House Republicans came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and implement much-needed reductions in spending. It wasn’t a perfect agreement, but it, too, moved the nation forward. For the first time since the Korean War, the United States will have two consecutive years of reduced nominal spending.

After that agreement, the American people reelected a divided government. They expect us to work together just as just as it was done in 2011, 1996, 1995 and years before — and they will not accept one party simply refusing to negotiate.

Mr. President, let’s sit down and talk. Let’s reach consensus and end the “my way or the highway” attitude once and for all.

About $85 billion will be cut from discretionary spending over the next seven months, reducing defense programs by about 8 percent and domestic programs by about 5 percent. Only a few things will be spared, including some basic safety-net benefits like Social Security, as well as pay for enlisted military personnel.

The sequester will not stop to contemplate whether these are the right programs to cut; it is entirely indiscriminate, slashing programs whether they are bloated or essential. The military budget, for example, should be reduced substantially, but thoughtfully, considering the nation’s needs. Instead, every weapons system, good or bad, will be hurt, as will troop training and maintenance.

These cuts, which will cost the economy more than one million jobs over the next two years, are the direct result of the Republican demand in 2011 to shrink the government at any cost, under threat of a default on the nation’s debt. Many Republicans say they would still prefer the sequester to replacing half the cuts with tax revenue increases. But the government spending they disdain is not an abstract concept. In a few days, the cuts will begin affecting American life and security in significant ways.

While some departments may have exaggerated the dire effects of their reductions, Congressional budget experts say they have little doubt that the size and pervasive nature of the sequester will inflict widespread pain. Here are some examples from the government departments most affected:

NATIONAL SECURITY Two-week furloughs for most law-enforcement personnel will reduce Coast Guard operations, including drug interdictions and aid to navigation, by 25 percent. Cutbacks in Customs agents and airport security checkpoints will “substantially increase passenger wait times,” the Homeland Security Department said, creating delays of as much as an hour at busy airports. The Border Patrol will have to reduce work hours by the equivalent of 5,000 agents a year."

The revolving door between government and business is just one symptom of a bigger picture.

Political appointees in the executive branch should pay an extra income tax when they leave for high-paying jobs.

We should have hearings on this%2C where witnesses can talk about the extent of the revolving-door problem.

A few weeks back, I wrote here about taxing the revolving door that takes people back and forth between the federal government and the various industries that federal government agencies regulate. My proposal was to put a surtax -- 50%, say, or maybe 75% -- on the post-government earnings of federal officials in excess of their government salaries for the first five years: Leave a federal job paying $100,000 a year for an industry job paying $600,000 a year, and you'd pay a $250,000 surtax. After all, with folks leaving the Obama administration, as they left previous administrations, for salaries several times what they earned in the public sector, and with excessive entanglement between government and business a growing problem, why not use the power of the IRS to modify behavior?

I didn't think my proposal would go very far, but maybe I was too pessimistic. It seems that people are noticing and approving.

Not long after my column ran, it got an endorsement from Boston Herald,which noted: ""In his 2008 campaign, President Obama promised to 'close the revolving door.' It's still open."" And spinning more furiously than ever.""

And now Democratic eminence grise Bill Moyers has climbed on board as well. Writing with Michael Winship in the Huffington Post, Moyers observes: ""Imagine -- conservatives and libertarians making a favorable comparison to the capital gains tax! This and that Russian meteor may be signs of the apocalypse. Just gives you an idea of how deeply awful and anti-democratic the revolving door is, no matter which side you're on. That's why it has to be slowed down if not completely stopped -- and why we'll keep talking about it.""

The revolving door is just one symptom of a bigger picture: Whatever claims our political class makes about the general welfare, it is really running things mostly for its own benefit. That's why comparisons to theHunger Games, where the fat-cats in the Capital City live it up while the provinces starve, keep coming. Addressing the revolving door problem won't solve things, either, but it might help. And since it's getting more attention, perhaps I should flesh this idea out a bit more.

First, I'd apply it only to political appointees in the executive branch, at least to begin with. I'd be thrilled to apply it to congressional staffers -- and to members of Congress -- as well, but I think that such a bill would face too much opposition in, well, Congress to make it through. But if executive officials are subject to this sort of law, the pressure will grow to extend it the legislative branch as well. (And I wouldn't apply it to people who aren't political appointees because it seems unfair to slap a surtax on someone who finishes his hitch in the Marines and joins a private-security company).

Second, we might want to adjust things for people who take a pay cut when joining federal service: Perhaps if someone made more money before taking a government job, we should only tax earnings in excess of what he or she earned before. So leave a $250,000 job at a bank to take a $125,000 job with the feds, and when you leave the surtax applies only to your earnings in excess of $250K.

These are the sorts of details that the staff at the House and Senate tax committees, and the regulatory staff at the IRS, are used to addressing. Perhaps we should have some hearings on this, where witnesses can talk about the extent of the revolving-door problem, and approaches to dealing with it. Is a surtax the best one? Maybe yes, maybe no. But it will help, and it will certainly draw attention to the problem.

A long-awaited analysis by the Congressional Budget Office found that the benefits of an increase in legal residents from immigration legislation currently being debated in the Senate — which includes a pathway to citizenship — would outweigh the costs. While the report was a clear victory for immigration proponents, it came just hours after Speaker John A. Boehner raised potential new obstacles for the bill, saying he would not bring any immigration measure to the floor unless it had the support of a majority of House Republicans.

The report estimates that in the first decade after the immigration bill is carried out, the net effect of adding millions of additional taxpayers would decrease the federal budget deficit by $197 billion. Over the next decade, the report found, the deficit reduction would be even greater — an estimated $700 billion, from 2024 to 2033. The deficit reduction figures for the first decade do not take into account $22 billion in the discretionary spending required to implement the bill, however, making the savings slightly lower.

The report was immediately seized on by backers of the bill as a significant boost to its prospects. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, one of the bill’s authors, said the report “debunks the idea that immigration reform is anything other than a boon to our economy.”"

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said Sunday on Fox News: “I do support unemployment benefits for the 26 weeks that they’re paid for. If you extend it beyond that, you do a disservice to these workers.”

This statement strikes at the heart — were a heart to exist — of the divide between conservatives and liberals about whether the social safety net provides temporary help for those who hit hard times or functions as a kind of glue to keep them stuck there.

Whereas I am sure that some people will abuse any form of help, I’m by no means convinced that this is the exclusive domain of the poor and put-upon. Businesses and the wealthy regularly take advantage of subsidies and tax loopholes without blinking an eye. But somehow, when some poor people, or those who unexpectedly fall on hard times, take advantage of benefits for which they are eligible it’s an indictment of the morality and character of the poor as a whole."

They used words like ""Family Flex time"" ... and ... ""work longer hours so you can have half a day with your family, maybe""

Cantor's goal in allowing the interview with the New Yorker Magazine, was to re-market the GOP draconian policies.

Since the 2012 elections, the Republicans have been divided between those who believe their policies are the problem and those who believe they just need better marketing—between those who believe they need to make better pizza and those who think they just need a more attractive box. Cantor, who is known among his colleagues as someone with strategic intelligence and a knack for political positioning, argues that it’s the box. Cantor was happy to make himself available for several long interviews. He persistently struck a diplomatic note and mentioned again and again how much he looked forward to working with Obama, a position that he said he’s been articulating for a long time. “Why isn’t that your reputation, then?” I asked. “I have to ask you that. Maybe you can make it so!”

No, Eric, it is not the ""box"" -- it is the policies.

The article reminded the readers about the time in December when Cantor, Boehner and the House GOP tried, but failed, to pass more spending cuts. As a reminder, Cantor thought he had the votes to pass a Bill requiring more spending cuts but he did not and Boehner and Cantor ended up with egg on their face. Cantor was especially pissed off because the failure to pass the GOP Bill meant Cantor would not be able to go on his ""family vacation""

House Republicans had to decide what to do with it. If Cantor had had his way, he would have been in Guadeloupe. “My whole family went on a cruise, and I couldn’t go,” he told me, glumly; he had to stay in Washington to deal with the fiscal-cliff crisis. His wife, Diana, said, “This was our twenty-third anniversary, and he missed my fiftieth-birthday cruise also.” [wah, wah, wah]

Isn't that sad. Poor Eric Cantor could not go on his family vacation because he screwed up in doing his job so he had to stay to clean up the mess he and his GOP brethren made.

.... Meanwhile, Eric Cantor wants to pass a Federal Law to eliminate overtime pay but not overtime labor. Meaning, naturally, that the law Eric Cantor wants to propose will mean that millions of hourly workers in America would a) not be able to afford their family vacation, and b) might have to work overtime during a scheduled family vacation all without extra pay.

Since Eric Cantor has not given anyone in the media a copy of his proposed Bill, all we can do is look back at the 2003 Republican Bill that would end the Federal Law requiring workers get actual money in exchange for extra hours worked.

One of the many problems with the 2003 Bill was that the Bill did not actually ""require"" employers to give their hourly workers the ""family flex time"" when the worker wanted to use it:

Requires the employer to permit use of comp-time accrued under such an option program within a reasonable time after the employee's request if such use does not unduly disrupt the employer's operations.

Also, Under H.R. 1119, employees who work overtime hours in a given week might not receive any pay or time off for that work until more than a year later,

Therefore, without receiving any interest or security, the employees, in essence, give their overtime pay to the employer in the hopes of getting it back some time later as paid time off.

Hourly worker's overtime pay was put at risk of loss in the event of business failure and closure, bankruptcy, or fraud. In short, H.R.1119 was nothing more than a scheme to allow employers to avoid paying for overtime, a scheme that would result in longer hours, lower incomes, and less predictable workweeks for hourly workers.

From Eric Cantor's February speech, his words sounded a lot like the ""marketing"" used in 2003 where the GOP tried to pass off the notion that not getting actual money paid for overtime worked was a great thing because if workers work overtime they'll have more time to spend with their family.



Eric Cantor Speech dated February, 2013

""Federal laws dating back to the 1930s make it harder for parents who hold hourly jobs to balance the demands of work and home. An hourly employee cannot convert previous overtime into future comp-time or flex-time. In 1985, Congress passed a law that gave state and municipal employees this flexibility, but today still denies that same privilege to the entire private sector. That’s not right. ""There’s a police officer at home in my district, her name is Vicki. She is working a tough job, with long hours, while raising her children. Her life is made a little easier because as a local government employee, she is permitted to work some extra hours and save it up for a sick day or a school event. ""Imagine if we simply chose to give all employees and employers this option. A working mom could work overtime this month and use it as time off next month without having to worry about whether she’ll be able to take home enough money to pay the rent. This is the kind of common sense legislation that should be non-controversial and moves us in the right direction to help make life work for families.""

Cantor seems very giddy and excited that Vicki gets to work overtime in order to 'save it up for a sick day' ...

Two things wrong with Cantor's last paragraph, 1) the mom would feel a lot better about her income if she were PAID OVERTIME for all the extra hours she worked; and 2) the 2003 GOP Bill did not guarantee the worker would get time off when the worker wanted it.

In Cantor's defense, I don't know if Cantor's Bill will be different from the 2003 Bill whereby the time off of the worker asked for was restricted by the employer to a degree that the worker might not get their time off until 12 months after they worked extra hours ... and even after 12 months there was no guarantee the worker would get their requested time off.

However, in Cantor's speech, he did not say Vicky got to use her extra hours worked as time off with pay the next month, Cantor said she had to work extra hours and, ""save it up for a sick day or a school event."" Therefore, it is likely that Cantor's Bill could very much look like the 2003 Republican Bill.

After his speech in February, he met privately with Republicans (as described above the orange squiggle) where Cantor asked if they were finished drafting the 'end overtime pay for hourly worker's' proposal:

Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, excused herself halfway through the session and left; the meeting seemed to have been convened mostly for the edification of the one reporter in the room. Cantor asked Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican leader, if the legislation was ready yet. “We’re still kind of in the exploratory stage, but we are looking at some child-care bills, and not quite ready at this point to bring them forward,” she said. “But we’re working on it."" “O.K., I get it,” Cantor said. “There’s always . . .” His voice trailed off. “O.K., anybody else have anything?” The room went silent. “All right, thank you. Thank you very much.”

The article went on to explain the additional massive cuts the Republicans were demanding in exchange for the 'debt ceiling' vote.



Cantor explained why he argued at the retreat against using the debt ceiling as political leverage. He had been hearing from donors on Wall Street and in the business community about the potential impact on the markets. The legislation merely delayed the fight over the debt ceiling until mid-May. In its place, Cantor and the House Republicans had engineered the battle over the sequester, which would begin on March 1st. Cantor viewed the various fiscal deadlines as what his aides referred to as hot stoves. “One is particularly hot,” Steve Stombres, Cantor’s chief of staff, said. “You touch the debt limit and you go into default, and that could be irreparable damage to our economy. But we felt like we could handle the heat of the sequester. We just needed to get them sequenced correctly and use that as an opportunity. The sequester was in place, and the members don’t want to give up that money, those cuts.”

hmmm ... was that a slip of the tongue when Cantor's aid said ""the members don’t want to give up that money"" ... was he referring to the money from the Wall Street donors who told Cantor not to f'ck with the Debt Ceiling vote?

In the article, Eric Cantor insists that the American voters don't reject Republican draconian policies that are geared to benefit the ultra-wealthy - Cantor thinks the American voters agree with Republicans:

* that ultra-wealthy people should get workers to work overtime with no extra pay and

* that the ultra-wealthy should be able to hide their income overseas to avoid paying taxes that would otherwise pay for things like our debt on two wars and

* that Americans do want cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaide, Food Stamps, education, infrastructure spending ... all so the ultra-wealthy can pay anywhere from 0%-14% income tax rate.

Eric Cantor believes that all the Republicans need to do is market those policies, that would roll America back to the era of the failed ""Gilded Age"" in a prettier box.

In a case brought by Amazon and Overstock.com, the court was asked to decide whether a New York state law that requires online retailers to collect taxes is valid under the Constitution. Because the court declined to hear the case, the retailers' challenge to that law has failed.

With Congress not taking action on the issue, courts have been intervening case by case in a long-running struggle between state governments and major online retailers.

In a March ruling, the New York Court of Appeals said Amazon and Overstock could be compelled by the state to collect tax from online sales. Both companies sought the high court's review of the ruling, citing the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which limits the power of states to regulate interstate commerce.

Seattle-based Amazon has been fighting one-on-one battles with the 50 states for years over sales tax.

The government has no national sales tax and Congress has not moved ahead with proposed legislation that would give all states the power to enforce their sales tax laws on Internet retailers. For years, Congress has debated legislation to grant states the power to tax online purchases. In May, the Senate approved a bill, but it has stalled in the House of Representatives.

Amazon supports federal legislation for nationwide state sales tax enforcement, but other online retailers, including eBay and Overstock, have fought it.

Under a 1992 Supreme Court decision, retailers without a physical presence in a state do not need to collect and remit taxes in that state on each sale. Consumers are supposed to pay the tax on their own, but few do.

In states where Amazon has no physical presence, the company does not generally collect the tax, giving it a pricing edge over traditional brick-and-mortar merchants."

“The tax issue is finished,” Mr. McConnell said on the ABC News program “This Week.” “Over. Completed. That’s behind us.”

Mr. McConnell’s interviews on three Sunday morning programs came just days after he and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. helped broker a resolution to the latest fiscal crisis and as Washington braced for a series of confrontations over debt and spending.

Mr. McConnell’s stance on taxes countered calls from Democrats, and even some House Republicans, to revamp the tax code to close some provisions and raise new revenue. But Mr. McConnell did say he would favor changes if they were “revenue neutral,” meaning that lower rates would be paid for by limiting deductions and closing loopholes."

In 2011, when President Obama proposed the scheme and both parties in Congress embraced it, their thinking was: With a whole year to work on a deal, surely we can figure out a way to avoid a catastrophe.

What Washington did they think they were living in?

With no negotiations under way, it’s virtually certain that on March 1, a long list of federal programs will get slashed. But at this point, the only thing Democrats and Republicans agree on is that the mandatory cuts will hurt the economy, the nation’s security and the well-being of the American people.

So why has there been no serious negotiation to avoid the train wreck we all see coming? One reason is that both sides think the public will side with them and blame the other party.

Obama and the Democrats think they can win the public relations battle because Americans are already on their side. A Pew Research Center poll released last week, for example, found that a big majority of Americans, 76%, agree with Obama’s approach of combining spending cuts with tax increases; only 19% agree with the Republican position that tax increases should be off the table.

But Republicans think it won’t be hard to turn the public against Obama, since he was the one who proposed the sequester in the first place (never mind that they approved the plan). They’ll also insist that the administration is deliberately making the cuts more painful than they need to be. Some in the GOP have even proposed giving Obama more discretion over where to slash, so he can’t complain that his hands are tied.

Both sides have a point. Most Americans do want to cut federal spending in general. But when it comes to individual programs, they want to protect them. The Pew poll found that a majority favored cuts in only one area: foreign aid. Most respondents didn’t want cuts in education, healthcare, unemployment benefits or defense.

That’s why the administration has offered deliberately dramatic forecasts of what spending cuts could mean, from canceled military operations and reduced Border Patrol surveillance to fewer AIDS tests, fewer children in Head Start and even potential meat shortages (because of reduced meat inspections).

And seemingly minor cutbacks can have outsized political impact. When Republicans in Congress shut down the federal government in 1995, the public reacted harshly once vacationers discovered that Yosemite and other national parks were closed. This time, the most painful cut for many people may be at the nation’s airports: If the sequester continues past April 1, the Transportation Security Administration says it will have to cut the number of screeners on duty — meaning waits of an hour or more for passengers. That won’t be pretty.

Still, Republicans hope that by challenging Democrats to come up with spending cuts to match those mandated by the sequester, they can portray their opponents as big spenders unwilling to attack the federal deficit. “Most people agree [with Republicans] that the deficit is one of the reasons the economy can’t get back on track,” said David Winston, a GOP pollster who advises House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). “So let’s get to work cutting the deficit. And then we can ask a second question: Do you really want your taxes to go up?”

In short, Republicans think they can turn the sequester into a teachable moment that will draw public opinion to their side. But they face some obvious problems. Most of the public doesn’t agree with them yet.

The White House has been energetic in pressing its case, using a week when Congress was out of town to stage events, including one that surrounded the president with photogenic law enforcement officers. And while Obama is talking to the country, the GOP has so far been talking mostly to the party faithful, making small-bore arguments about who proposed the sequester in the first place.

In the end, there will be some kind of compromise, probably around March 27, when Congress has to pass a law to keep the government operating for the rest of the year. It will probably include spending cuts that approach what the sequester demands, but with more flexibility— and, if Democrats have their way, a longer delay before the cuts kick in.

Tax increases will be a sticking point, of course. Democrats want them; Republicans reject them. But the recent history of budget showdowns suggests the GOP will compromise at the last minute.

But even if we already know roughly how the standoff will end, it’s hard to see how we’ll get there from here. Neither side knows how to defuse the crisis before it happens; neither wants to be the first to offer concessions. “Every time I’ve gotten into one of these high-profile negotiations, you know, it’s my rear end that got burnt,” Boehner told the Associated Press this month. That’s about as perfect a description of political dysfunction as you could want.

(CNN) - House Speaker John Boehner had some choice words Tuesday for his colleagues in the Senate over the forced spending cuts set to begin Friday.

Boehner, known for his at-times colorful language, said the House won't move a budget bill until the Senate ""gets off their ass and begins to do something.""

He made his comments to reporters after speaking to the House GOP conference on Capitol Hill. Ahead of President Barack Obama's trip to Newport News, Virginia Tuesday afternoon, Boehner criticized the president for holding campaign-style events about the spending cuts, rather than acting to prevent them.

At issue is a disagreement over how to stave off the automatic, across-the-board cuts, known in Washington as the sequester. Democrats and Obama want to replace it with a mix of more specific cuts and an increase in taxes through the closing of certain loopholes.

Republicans, on the other hand, say taxes are out of the question.

""He's gotten his tax hikes,"" Boehner said, referring to the-end-of-the-year fiscal cliff bill that raised tax rates on top earners. ""It's time to focus on the real problem here in Washington and that is spending.""

Building onto the criticism, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Obama is hardly willing to meet Republicans in the middle.

""The president says we can't have any progress on this sequester unless we get the second tax hike in eight weeks. That's not compromise,"" Cantor said.

Later Tuesday, Senate Majority Harry Reid responded to Boehner's remark.

""I was raised in a little town that had 13 brothels in it,"" the Nevada Democrat said. ""So I am used to some pretty salty language as you know.""

Reid then read out Boehner's quote.

""I think he should understand who is sitting on their posterior,"" Reid added. ""We are doing our best here to pass something. The speaker is doing nothing to try to pass anything over there.""

Earlier in the day, Reid said Senate Democrats have a ""balanced proposal"" to replace the sequester with ""smart spending reductions"" and ""measures that close corporate tax loopholes and wasteful subsidies and revenue from the very wealthiest among us.""

Despite their proposal, however, Reid definitively stated the cuts will still take place due to GOP opposition.

""My Republican colleagues are standing in the way of a solution,"" he continued. ""They only want cuts and more cuts. They are willing to sacrifice three quarters of a million American jobs rather than ask multi-millionaires to pay a penny more.""

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats in Congress are playing pingpong over funding the government and President Obama's health care law. The first government shutdown since 1996 will occur if lawmakers and the White House don't work things out.

Here are the five things to know about the pending shutdown for Monday, Sept. 30:

The state of play: The new fiscal year starts Tuesday, Oct. 1, so a bill to fund the government must be passed by both chambers in Congress and signed by Obama by midnight tonight.

Who's got the ball? The Senate, because the House passed a spending bill early Sunday that would also delay implementation of the Affordable Care Act for one year. The House also voted to repeal a 2.3% tax on medical devices to help pay for the health care law. Both policy provisions are non-starters for the Democratic majority in the Senate and the White House — so expect the Senate to send the spending bill back to the House without those items. The Senate convenes at 2 p.m. ET.

What about the House? The lawmakers will gavel into session at 10 a.m. ET, but their legislative agenda is unclear. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., says votes could start as early as 11 a.m. ET depending on any Senate action.

Where is Obama? He's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then the Cabinet.So far, the president hasn't been negotiating with Congress to resolve the budget impasse. As for the health care law, the state-run health exchanges to help people buy insurance are set to begin Tuesday.

Will I feel the shutdown? Yes and no. Social Security recipients will receive benefits, mail service will continue and taxes will still be collected. But if you wanted to visit a national park, historic site or a Smithsonian museum, those gates and doors will shut Tuesday without funding. For more detail, USA TODAY's Gregory Korte provides answers to 66 questions about the government shutdown.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-proposes-94-cent-tax-hike-cigarettes-152459146--politics.html,,[],Obama proposes 94-cent tax hike on cigarettes,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama's budget plan would increase taxes by $1 trillion over the next decade, including a new tax on cigarettes and familiar proposals to increases taxes on the wealthy and some corporations.

The president said his plan includes $580 billion in tax increases to help reduce government borrowing. But the tax hikes don't stop there. Obama's budget proposal would also impose an additional $400 billion in tax increases. Much of it would be used to pay for more spending.

Obama's proposal would increase the federal tax on cigarettes from $1.01 a pack to $1.95. The new cigarette tax would raise an estimated $78 billion over the next decade to pay for pre-school programs for children.

Obama says his tax plan is part of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes painful cuts to benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. Most GOP lawmakers adamantly oppose new taxes, which means his plan has little chance of passing Congress.

Obama already got Congress to increase taxes by $600 billion in January. His budget would add to those tax hikes.

""To be clear, the package I am offering includes some difficult cuts that I do not particularly like,"" Obama says in his budget message. ""But these measures will only become law if congressional Republicans agree to meet me in the middle by eliminating special tax breaks and loopholes so millionaires and billionaires do their fair share to cut the deficit.""

In his budget, Obama calls for an overhaul of the nation's tax laws that would cut tax rates and simplify the system while generating additional revenue to help reduce government borrowing. The plan, however, provides few details on how the rate cuts would be financed.

There is a growing movement in Congress to do tax reform but there is much disagreement over whether it should result in higher overall tax receipts. Many Democrats, including Obama, want to use tax reform to raise taxes. Most Republicans oppose higher taxes.

Story continues

Obama's budget would create a fund of about $100 billion that would be used to finance lower corporate tax rates. The fund, however, is more symbolic than substantive because $100 billion would only cover the cost of lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 34 percent.

Obama has said his goal is a corporate income tax rate of 28 percent.

Obama's proposed tax increase on cigarettes is popular among health care advocates who believe it provides the additional benefit of encouraging smokers to cut back or quit. In addition to the direct revenue from the tax, the Congressional Budget Office analysis concluded that health improvements related to less smoking would save the government about $1 billion over 10 years and generate additional revenue of $3 billion because of a boost in earnings from healthier workers.

The tobacco industry promptly criticized the proposal.

""The idea of increasing taxes on low- to middle-income Americans at this time is ludicrous,"" said Bryan Hatchell, a spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., the nation's second-biggest tobacco company. ""As middle-income Americans struggle to make ends meet in a very slow economic recovery period, this is not the time to hit them with higher taxes.""

The biggest tax increase in Obama's budget would limit the value of itemized deductions for wealthy families. The limits would apply to all itemized deductions, including those for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local taxes. They would also apply to tax-exempt interest, employer-sponsored health insurance and income exclusions for employee retirement contributions.

The proposal would raise $529 billion over the next decade.

Charitable groups have already mounted a lobbying campaign to oppose the limits because they are worried they would discourage wealthy people from donating. Obama has made similar proposals in previous budgets and received lukewarm responses from fellow Democrats. Most Republicans oppose it.

Among the other tax changes, Obama's budget would:

— Impose the ""Buffett Rule,"" named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, an Obama supporter who favors higher taxes. The rules say people making more than $1 million must pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes. The rule would raise $53 billion over the next decade.

— Prohibit tax-free contributions to retirement accounts once the account's assets reach a certain limit. The initial limit would be set at $3.4 million. The proposal would raise about $9 billion over the next decade.

— Eliminate a series of tax breaks for oil, gas and coal companies, raising $44 billion over the next decade.

— Change accounting rules for the way companies value their inventories for tax purposes. The change would raise $81 billion over the next decade.

— Expand and make permanent the research and development tax credit, saving businesses $99 billion over the next decade. The current credit expires at the end of the year, though it is routinely extended.

— Make permanent rules that allow small businesses to more quickly write off expenses, saving business $69 billion over the next decade.
