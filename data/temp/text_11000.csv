The Los Angeles Times credits elimination of the filibuster for judicial nominees to a new class of Democrats on the ascendancy in the U.S. Senate--the ""Elizabeth Warren"" wing of the Party as described by one observer. While Harry Reid tried to tamp down the enthusiasm after this week's historic action, these Democrats have made it clear they have only just begun to fight.

The Times calls them



[P]art of a new breed of Democrats emerging in the Senate. Mostly elected after 2006, these relative newcomers have only known a Democratic-controlled Senate and have little experience with successful bipartisan cooperation, due largely to the tea party's grip on the Republican Party. Now they are hoping to become a new power center in the party, nudging the old guard to adopt more aggressive tactics in pursuit of legislative goals and largely brushing aside Republican threats of retaliation and obstruction. They see the rules and traditions of the Senate as having stifled the will of the majority and stalled President Obama's agenda.

""There's a time to reach across the aisle and there's a time to hold the line,"" said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), the body's youngest member at 40, who was elected in 2012. ""And I think so far this year Democrats in the Senate have done a very good job of mixing across-the-aisle compromise with some heretofore unseen spine-stiffening."" The time has come for Democrats to take a harder stance against the tea party Republicans, he said. ""These folks have come to Washington to destroy government from within and will use any tool at their disposal,"" Murphy said. ""To the extent that we have the ability to take tools away from the tea party, we should do it. And one of the tools was the filibuster. Another was the belief that Democrats would cave in the face of another shutdown or debt default.""

What drives this ""new breed"" of aggressive, unabashedly liberal Senate Democrats? They've all had enough of the antics of the folks on the other side of the aisle. Here's Christopher Murphy, D-CT:When was the last time you heard about any Democratic Senator or Representative other than Harry Reid making the national news? While Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and the entire Tea Party caucus in the House have all transformed themselves into political Kardashians, constantly mugging for the cameras with their latest outrage du jour-- the Democrats--particularly those in the Senate who wield actual majority power--have for the most part sat quietly by for the last five years and endured this nonsense. Many of them, Jeff Merkley, Sherrod Brown, Tom Udall, were elected in 2006 and 2008; Elizabeth Warren and Chris Murphy, in 2012. By 2015 half of the Democratic caucus will have been in place since 2008. They represent a generational shift in the Senate that has known nothing but Tea Party intransigence--and ignorance--from the other side.

They're fed up and they're taking over the Party:



The senators' influence has already been seen in other fights, most recently in the 16-day shutdown, when new Democrats lobbied party leaders to stand up to Republicans — a tactic that seemed to shock many on the other side of the aisle, who were betting that Democrats would blink first.





Next on their agenda is extending the filibuster rule change from presidential appointments to legislation, which would enable the Senate to move on issues including gun control and climate change.

Filibuster reform for legislation may be a bridge too far for some in the Democratic caucus. But isn't it nice to have Democrats actually proposing it?

The Times article also credits the ""new breed"" of Senate Democrats with advancing Janet Yellen as opposed to Lawrence Summers to the Fed.



""The Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party definitely are showing that they have growing influence in the caucus, and in government in general,"" said Matt Wall of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group that works to promote progressive candidates and issues in Democratic primaries.

The shift among Democrats has at times confounded Republicans, particularly on the filibuster issue. Aides to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the third-longest-serving Republican, said they had felt that Reid's most recent moves telegraphing the nuclear option were a bluff. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday railed against the actions of ""uninitiated newcomers in the Democratic caucus,"" reminding them they had never served in the minority in the Senate. Those who have a longer memory ""should know better,"" he added.

Of course, all of this has flummoxed Senate Republicans used to seeing Democrats roll over and play nice. The very fact that the Democrats aren't falling all over themselves to apologize for their actions seems to unnerve them:McConnell should talk to his own caucus about ""uninitiated newcomers."" What he conveniently forgets is that these Democrats are simply the natural antidote to the poison his own Party brought into the chamber and peddled relentlessly these last five years. When the brilliant minds at Americans For Prosperity hatched the ""Tea Party,"" they should have kept in mind Newton's Third Law of Motion.

But that would require them to believe in science."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/18/cnn-poll-gop-underwater-obama-approval-down/,2013-03-18 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",CNN Poll: GOP underwater; Obama approval down,"8 years ago

Washington (CNN) - A new national survey confirms what a months long, top-to-bottom Republican Party review finds as well: That the GOP ""is out of touch"" and seen as the party of ""stuffy old men.""

A CNN/ORC International poll also indicates that President Barack Obama's job approval rating has dipped below 50% for the first time since September, with half of the public saying they disapprove of the job he's doing in the White House. And it appears that the president's stand on the issues and the glaring spotlight in recent months on fiscal and budget issues, never Obama's sweet spot, are contributing to the drop in his overall numbers.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

According to the poll, 54% of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party, with less than three in ten saying they view the GOP in a favorable light. The poll's Monday release came on the same day that the Republican National Committee released a major review of their performance in the 2012 elections, and how to fix what went wrong.

""The Democrats are not overwhelmingly popular - 46% of Americans have a favorable view of the Democrats, compared to 48% with an unfavorable view - but in a two-party system, you only need to be more popular than your opponent to have an advantage,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

""Unfavorable views of the GOP extend into nearly every other major demographic,"" adds Holland. ""The Republican Party's unfavorable rating is over 50% among men, women, the young, the old, the rich, the poor, and just about every region of the country besides the South, where the GOP can manage no better than a 45%-45% tie on the question.""

Just over two-thirds of those questioned in the survey say the Republican Party favors the rich and nearly half think the GOP's policies are too extreme.

While the Republican Party's numbers are nothing to celebrate, it's not as if the president can brag about his polls. Forty-seven percent say they approve of the job Obama's doing in office, down eight points since the start of the year, with 50% saying they disapprove. That's up seven points from January and it's the highest that number has been in over a year. The 47% approval rating in the CNN poll is in line with recent numbers from surveys from other news organizations.

The poll finds the expected partisan divide, with Democrats overwhelmingly approving of the president and Republicans overwhelmingly disapproving, and Obama at 41% approval – 53% disapproval among independent voters.

By a 57%-42% margin, the public says Obama has the personal qualities a president should have.

""Americans still respond positively to the president's personal characteristics - it's his stands on the issues that they disagree with,"" says Holland. ""Fewer than a third approve of how the president is handling the government's budget and fiscal policies, and the White House's 'charm offensive' has not registered with the American public.""

Fifty-six percent say Obama is not doing enough to cooperate with the Republicans in Congress. Not great, but less than seven in ten who feel that the Republicans are not doing enough to cooperate with Obama.

Only 31% say they approve of how the president's handling the budget and fiscal policy. Again, nothing to brag about but higher than the 19% who give the Republicans in Congress a thumbs up on the issue. And Americans are divided on whether the White House or congressional Republicans has the better budget and fiscal policies.

As for the forced federal spending cuts, which started kicking in at the beginning of the month, six in ten said the cuts were having a great deal or some effect on the nation's economy, and 35% said the cuts were having a great deal or some effect on their own financial situation.

The poll also has new favorable ratings on some Republicans in the news. Mitt Romney stands at 41% favorable and 52% unfavorable, close to his numbers in mid November, soon after the 2012 GOP presidential nominee lost the November election to Obama. The previous GOP nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, stands at 46%-42%. But it's a different story for his running mate in 2008. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who got a very warm reception this past weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference, has a 34% favorable rating and a 58% unfavorable rating.

The poll was conducted March 15-17 for CNN by ORC International, with 1,021 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points."

Cole, 60, was Ventura’s city manager for eight years before abruptly stepping down last year. He was city manager of Azusa before that and is a former mayor of Pasadena.

During his tenure in Ventura, he championed the adoption of an all-infill general plan, reorganized departments and recruited high-tech businesses to the laid-back coastal city.

As the economy tanked in 2008, Cole presided over a 15% budget cut that included 100 jobs eliminated and the closure of a popular city library. But he managed to preserve most services and also worked out a plan to improve emergency response times.

With the election of a new City Council majority last year, however, his sometimes blunt style clashed with that of Ventura Mayor Mike Tracy, the city’s former police chief. He announced that he was resigning last July.

Cole said he was approached by Garcetti’s transition team and met with the mayor last week. Garcetti’s team was attracted by his use of performance-based budgeting first in Azusa and then in Ventura.

“That which gets measured gets done,” Cole said. “Government has been slow sometimes to adapt organizational best practices. Tracking performance and being accountable for results is what I’ve tried to implement going back 30 years.”

The city’s workforce needs to be well-equipped, well-trained and “sustainably compensated,” Cole said, and employees also need to use technology that makes them more efficient and be focused on results. Although Ventura and Azusa are far smaller than metropolitan L.A., the same principles have been applied successfully in big cities such as New York and Boston, Cole said.

“We’re starting with a very big city that has been in business for more than 100 years,” he said. “The job is to move aggressively and responsibly to keep the city moving forward, and in a way that people notice improvements in their neighborhoods.”

He doesn’t know Garcetti and didn’t contribute to his mayoral campaign. But he supports Garcetti’s “back to basics” vision, Cole said:

“I believe in their message, and I believe they are real about their message.”

For the last year Cole, a devout Catholic, was the administrator of Ventura’s historic mission in the city’s downtown. He focused on linking the church’s resources with city programs for the poor.

In recent months, he’s also served as interim chief operating officer to the Local Government Commission, a nonprofit based in Sacramento.

Cole lives in Ventura with his three teenage children but said he will be moving to Los Angeles as soon as he can.

“If you work for a city, you need to live there,” he said.

Cole will draw an annual salary of $172,000.

According to a Gallup poll released Wednesday, the reason most Americans disapprove of Congress isn’t because of a specific policy or bad ethical behavior but because of inaction and partisan gridlock. Americans believe that Congress is broken.

And there is no need for any banal stretch for a false equivalency to explain why that would be. The reason Congress doesn’t work is because Republican lawmakers have ceased to believe that it should. For too many of them, compromise has become synonymous with collusion. They would rather resist than work. So the wheels of government are screeching to a halt. Obstruction and bluster have replaced solutions and courage.

As the former Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich wrote last week:

“Conservative Republicans in our nation’s capital have managed to accomplish something they only dreamed of when Tea Partiers streamed into Congress at the start of 2011: They’ve basically shut Congress down. Their refusal to compromise is working just as they hoped: No jobs agenda. No budget. No grand bargain on the deficit. No background checks on guns. Nothing on climate change. No tax reform. No hike in the minimum wage. Nothing so far on immigration reform.”

On that last point at least, Congress has a chance at redemption. It may be the best chance this year — and possibly the last during the Obama administration."

http://news.yahoo.com/sarah-palin-tells-iowa-conservatives-time-stiffen-backs-055045732--sector.html,,[],Sarah Palin tells Iowa conservatives it's time 'to stiffen our backs',"By Kay Henderson DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who rallied members of the Tea Party in their failed effort to defund Obamacare, lashed out on Saturday against members of the Republican Party who agreed to end the government shutdown. The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee's comments during a speech in Des Moines come at a time of division within the party over the strategy conservative members of Congress adopted in forcing a 16-day shutdown of the federal government last month. Polls have shown voters blamed Republicans for the shutdown. Palin, who was speaking to hundreds of attendees at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual fall banquet, was joined by Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah. Lee, along with fellow Tea Party movement star Senator Ted Cruz, was instrumental in the ill-fated attempt to defund Obamacare, the popular name for the healthcare reform law championed by President Barack Obama. Palin told the Christian conservatives in attendance it was time to ""stiffen our spines"" for the 2014 elections. ""I want to encourage you to make your voice heard, to hold politicians accountable,"" Palin said. The bulk of Palin's speech was focused on the nation's current political climate. She drew thunderous applause with her sharp attack on Republicans in Congress who voted in October to raise the nation's debt ceiling and reopen the government. ""They promised that they would do everything in their power to fight against socialized medicine, against Obamacare, but when it came time to stand and defund it, they waved the white flag of surrender and they threw under the bus the good guys who did stand up and fight for us,"" Palin said. Palin named Lee and Cruz as leaders in that fight. Last month, Cruz also made a stop in Iowa, a key state in presidential campaigns because the Iowa caucuses are the first electoral event in the nominating process. In 2010 Lee defeated three-term Republican Senator Bob Bennett in a primary on his way to winning the Senate seat. In his speech on Saturday, he called on Republicans to offer up ""market-based alternatives"" that could replace Obamacare if the Republicans hope to have success at the polls in 2014. ""Frustration is not a platform. Anger is not an agenda and outrage, as a habit, is not even conservative,"" Lee said. (Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis)"

Perez as Labor Secretary,"Liberals and labor leaders hailed Mr. Perez, calling him a champion for workers and those who have faced discrimination. “At a time when our politics tilts so heavily toward corporations and the very wealthy, our country needs leaders like Tom Perez to champion the cause of ordinary working people,” said Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

James P. Hoffa, general president of the Teamsters, called Mr. Perez “the right choice” because of his history of advocacy. “In these difficult economic times,” Mr. Hoffa said, “workers need a fighter at the Labor Department who will stand up for them, and they are getting just that with Thomas Perez.”

While at the Justice Department, Mr. Perez has pursued a record number of discrimination or brutality claims against local police and sheriff’s departments, including that of Joe Arpaio, the outspoken sheriff in Maricopa County, Ariz., who was accused of “a pattern of unlawful discrimination” against Latinos.

Mr. Perez also challenged voter identification requirements imposed by South Carolina and Texas, and his division reached the three largest residential fair lending settlements in the history of the Fair Housing Act. Under him, the voting section participated in the most new litigation in the last fiscal year than in any previous year.

He has spent a career fighting discrimination cases as a federal prosecutor, then, under President Bill Clinton, as deputy chief of the Civil Rights Division, and finally as head of civil rights enforcement at the Health and Human Services Department. Mr. Perez also served as an elected council member in Montgomery County, Md., and as the state’s secretary of labor, licensing and regulation.

Though his father died when he was 12, his family pressed the value of education so much that all four of his siblings became doctors. Mr. Perez, 51, graduated from Brown University and Harvard Law School.

“My parents taught my four siblings and me to work hard, to give back to our community and to make sure that the ladder of opportunity was there for those coming after us,” Mr. Perez said at the White House on Monday as he addressed the crowd in both English and Spanish. “Over my career, I’ve learned that true progress is possible if you keep an open mind, listen to all sides and focus on results.”"

Calling it “the next phase of this movement,” former campaign manager Jim Messina described the new group as an extension of Obama’s successful bid for a second term, which used technology to engage volunteers at a new level in their communities.

“If we can take the enthusiasm and passion that people showed throughout the campaign and channel it into the work ahead of us, we will be unstoppable,” Messina, who will be the chairman of the new group, wrote in an email to campaign donors early Friday morning.

The launch, which the Los Angeles Times wrote about Thursday, was the subject of chatter among Democratic activists and strategists, who predicted that it could upend the party’s power structure.

If it is able to sustain the intensive volunteer effort that propelled Obama twice into the White House, Organizing for Action could outstrip the role played by traditional interest groups, such as organized labor and the environmental movement -- and challenge the party itself as a center of influence.

To accomplish that, however, the organization must avoid the fate of a similar effort Obama officials made in 2009 to extend his first presidential campaign into a permanent advocacy force. That project, Organizing for America, largely failed to turn grass-roots support into a political force from within its confines at the Democratic National Committee.

On Friday, Messina wrote that the new organization would be driven by supporters and would hew to the campaign’s principles: “respect, empower, include.”

“We’ll work on the key battles of our generation, train the next generation of grassroots organizers and leaders, and organize around local issues in our own communities,” Messina wrote. “We’ll continue to support the President in creating jobs and growing the economy from the middle out, and in fighting for issues like immigration reform, climate change, balanced deficit reduction, and reducing gun violence.”

The new group is being organized under the tax code’s section 501(c)4 as a nonprofit social welfare organization, which cannot have politics as its primary purpose, limiting its ability to coordinate with the party or candidates.

In setting the group up as a 501(c)4, Obama aides chose the same structure as conservative advocacy groups, such as Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity, which the president has lambasted for not disclosing their donors. It remains to be seen whether Organizing for Action will voluntarily reveal information about its financial backers.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-aims-halt-perception-passive-president-074725712.html,,[],Obama aims to halt perception of passive president,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with a trio of controversies, President Barack Obama is trying to halt a perception spreading among both White House opponents and allies that he has been passive and disengaged as unexpected developments consume his second term.

The new strategy, underscored in a flurry of new White House actions, signals an Obama team anxious to regain control amid controversies that have emboldened Republicans and threatened to plunge the president's second term into a steady stream of congressional investigations.

On Wednesday, Obama released a trove of documents related to the Benghazi attacks amid pressure from Republicans. He asked Congress to revive a media shield law that would protect journalists from having to reveal information, a step seen as a response to the Justice Department's widely criticized subpoenas of phone records from reporters and editors at The Associated Press. And he forced the resignation of the top official at the Internal Revenue Service after the agency targeted conservative political groups.

""Americans have a right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it,"" Obama said of the IRS actions. ""I will not tolerate this kind of behavior at any agency, but especially at the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives.""

The president, seeking to have a more robust profile on the controversies, also said he would take questions from reporters Thursday at a previously scheduled news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And Obama is expected to nominate a new acting IRS commissioner this week to replace Steven Miller, who resigned Wednesday.

The president addressed the IRS controversy on Monday, but his measured words left many unsatisfied, particularly given that he had waited three days to address the developments. He also repeatedly asserted that he was waiting to find out if the reports were accurate, even though top IRS officials had already acknowledged the controversial actions.

Story continues

Adding to the narrative of a passive president were White House efforts to distance Obama from the IRS scandal, as well as revelations that the Justice Department had secretly obtained work and personal phone records of AP journalists. In both cases, the White House insisted the president had no prior knowledge of the events and learned about the matters as the general public did — from news reports.

Obama's cautious response, combined with his lack of awareness about controversies brewing within his administration, opened him to criticism from hisRepublican foes.

""If Obama really learned about the latest IRS and AP secret subpoena scandals in the news, who exactly is running the ship at the White House?"" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said.

But in a worrisome sign for the White House, some Democrats also criticized the president for not being more aggressive in responding to trouble within the government.

Robert Gibbs, Obama's former White House press secretary, said the president should have appointed a bipartisan commission of former IRS officials to look into the issue of targeting political organizations. And Gibbs gently chided his former boss for using passive language when he first addressed the political targeting during a White House news conference Monday.

""I think they would have a much better way of talking about this story rather than simply kind of landing on the, 'Well, if this happened, then we'll look at it',"" Gibbs said on MSNBC.

The fresh pair of controversies coincided with a resurgence in the GOP-led investigation into the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

Congressional Republicans launched another round of hearings on the attacks last week. And on Friday, a congressional official disclosed details of emails among administration officials that resulted in talking points, used to publicly discuss the deadly incident, being revised to downplay the prospect that the attacks were an act of terror.

Obama aides insisted the emails were either taken out of context or provided no new information, but they resisted pressure to make the emails public for five days before finally disclosing them to reporters Wednesday. The emails revealed that then-CIA Director David Petraeus disagreed with the final talking points, despite the White House's insistence that the intelligence agency had final say over the statements.

The White House has publicly defended its handling of the controversies. Obama spokesman Jay Carney has insisted it would be ""wholly inappropriate"" for the president, in the case of the Justice Department matter, to weigh in on an active investigation, and in the case of the IRS controversy, to insert himself in the actions of an independent agency.

However, legal scholar Jonathan Turley disputed those assertions, saying there is no legal reason a president would be precluded from learning about the investigations before the public did or from commenting on them, at least broadly.

""These comments treat the president like he's the bubble boy,"" said Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.

David Axelrod, Obama's longtime adviser, acknowledged the White House could have acted more aggressively in ""the interest of stagecraft."" But he insisted that the president's handling of the matters will ultimately be vindicated.

""One virtue he has is that he takes a long-range view,"" he said. ""It's easy to get whipped up by the frenzy, but it's responsible to react to the facts. It has short-term liabilities, but in the long-run, it's a quality you want in a president.""

“We have seen the character of this president, and the way that he does business,” said Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, explaining why he will oppose any measure.

A push to bring immigration legislation to the House floor, led by an unusual coalition of business executives, prominent conservatives and evangelical leaders, threatens to create another schism in the Republican Party and could have a noticeable effect on campaign contributions before the midterm elections.

“You wake up and it is 25 degrees, and a cow that is giving birth, and you have 400 cows to milk that day, and you don’t have the help you need — that stinks,” Mr. Jones said, citing a shortage of labor that he says could be eased through a new immigration law. “I bet not one of those legislators back there have been in that position.”

The contention centers on what to do with the illegal immigrants already in the country, which Democrats in both chambers say must be addressed in any final deal. Many House Republicans have already expressed support for proposals to strengthen border security and make it easier for high-skilled workers and farm laborers to get visas, all elements of the Senate package.

Pushing back against the pressure to act from within their own party, a core group of conservatives said in interviews this week that they would not be intimidated by corporate America or other outside parties, even though in this case that includes farmers, evangelical leaders and some prominent conservatives.

Steve King, who has characterized Latinos and Hispanics as dope dealers, their calves enlarged to the size of cantaloupes from lugging narcotics across the Rio Grande, will never support any serious reform of immigration policy. But his willingness to publicly disparage the President's character in such an insulting manner says as much about the GOP's prospects in 2016 and beyond as it does about King.The intense lobbying effort is spearheaded by 600 Republican big donors, among them ""conservative leaders in business, agriculture and religion,"" as well as executives of technology companies, all hoping to convince 80 or so Republican Congressmen to sign on to meaningful immigration reform. Some are threatening to shut off their cash spigot to Republican candidates if reforms are not passed. The primary motivation of these ""conservative leaders,"" however, is not to provide a ""path to citizenship"" for undocumented immigrants but to secure cheap labor and fatten their wallets. As one self-professed ""Tea Party"" supporter in the farming industry puts it:Mr. Jones is absolutely correct. Few if any of the rabid Tea Party House members have the experience of milking cows in 25 degree weather, and even fewer of their constituents have. What the Tea Party House members are experienced in, and what their constituents crave, is sticking it to the arrogant black President. Steve King's disrespect and contempt towards President Obama illustrates this beautifully.So Republicans are trapped. Their natural instincts are to jump when big business says jump. And big business is saying that. But the President and the Democrats hold the trump card -- any meaningful reform has to be accompanied by a path to citizenship and fairer treatment of undocumented immigrants. How to explain that to a base of voters that reacts violently to the slightest suggestion of compromise? In districts where (by and large) there is no meaningful Hispanic or Latino presence to drive the debate? The short answer is --you can't. The Tea Party has already demonstrated it has complete control of the Republican House's agenda. They shut the government down and brought the country to the brink of default over a hopeless effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the President's signature achievement. King's remarks about the President's ""character"" reflect the failure of that effort. The idea that they would support any type of legislation the President supports that hasn't even passed yet is simply laughable.We've already seen prominent Republicans laying the groundwork for their retreat on this issue with the lame excuse that the President's refusal to abandon his health care law undermined the prospects for immigration reform. They've even begun to commission artfully crafted polls to reassure themselves that there is no urgency on the issue. Of course, if the GOP were thinking rationally, the only factor worth considering would be Hispanics' and Latinos' increasingly hostile feelings towards their party

But they're not thinking rationally. They're thinking like Steve King, blinded by their own contempt for the President. And they've convinced themselves that they can keep kicking the can down the road:



A growing number of Republicans, however, privately say they see no political advantage for the party to move ahead on immigration legislation right now. They do not expect it to be a critical issue in the 2014 midterms — in fact, some House Republicans may be even more reluctant to take a tough vote on immigration during an election year — and they say it simply needs to be dealt with before the 2016 presidential election. Thus, they say, they are most optimistic about pushing through an overhaul in 2015.

They can tell themselves they'll pass something in 2015, but it's hard to understand how or why--or what. After all, even in 2015 the President will still be black."

It has been a disheartening experience. In fairness to House Republicans, there is little one legislative chamber can do to affect the direction of the federal government. The tools they do have, however, they have often declined to use. Paul’s filibuster of the Brennan nomination on Wednesday, however, showed the emergence of a new opposition to Obama. Based in the Senate, it is providing the American public a stark contrast to Obama’s ever-expanding government.

Paul’s filibuster was not based on a traditional partisan issue. Its goal was simply to clarify that the President did not have the authority to assassinate American citizens, on domestic soil, who are suspected of cooperating with terrorists. Such clarity ought not require a 13 hour filibuster. The event, however, exposed the public to a reasoned articulation of conservative, constitutional principles. It was a brilliant counter-point to Obama’s doctrine of expanding government power in every direction.

On Friday, Sen. Marco Rubio joined Sen. Ted Cruz in announcing his opposition to any continuing resolution funding the government that didn’t also defund ObamaCare. House Republicans have long since given up this fight, passing a continuing resolution this week that continues to fund ObamaCare’s expansion. Sixteen House Republicans bucked their leadership and opposed the move, but enough Democrats joined Republicans to pass the measure.

With this week’s moves, the center of political gravity has shifted to an emerging band of leaders in the Senate. Sens. Paul, Rubio, and Cruz are providing the nucleus of a new and robust conservative opposition to the Obama Administration. They will likely lose most of their battles. Unlike House Republicans, however, they understand that their primary responsibility is to articulate to the American public an alternative vision for the country. It requires one to pick an occasional battle and present one’s case to the public.

House Republicans are obsessive about “governing,” even though they lack the levers of power to do so. They would rather put off an ideological fight on principle in order to pass legislation. This may make sense tactically, but strategically it’s a losing bet. Worse, it denies the American public a clear choice. A party ought to articulate why it should be entrusted with legislative power.

Sens. Paul, Rubio and Cruz understand this. They are providing the tip of the spear ahead of the 2014 midterms. Based on initial responses to Paul’s filibuster this week, they will have an army behind them.

Washington (CNN) - In a potential preview of the next presidential election, a new national poll suggests Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie would be neck and neck if the 2016 contest were held today.

But a CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday also indicates Clinton leading eight other possible Republican White House hopefuls in hypothetical general election matchups.



According to the poll, 48% of registered voters say they would support support Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, if he were the GOP nominee, with 46% saying they would back Clinton, the former secretary of state, U.S. senator, and first lady, if she captured the Democratic nomination. Christie's 2-point margin is within the survey's sampling error. The CNN poll is the third non-partisan, live operator national survey conducted this month to indicate a possible matchup between Clinton and Christie basically all tied up.

If she decides to run, Clinton would instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. And Christie, fresh off his landslide re-election last month as New Jersey governor, is on top of the pack in recent polls of the race for the Republican nomination.

So what's the secret of Christie's strength against Clinton?

""He performs particularly well among independents, winning nearly six in 10 in that key group,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland siad. ""He also wins a majority of suburbanites and older voters, something that no other GOP hopeful [that was] tested was able to do against Clinton.""

""Christie doesn't win in the Northeast, although he does hold Clinton to a bare majority there, but he has a solid edge in the Midwest while playing Clinton to a draw in the South and West,"" Holland said.

Not surprisingly, the survey indicates a gender gap: Christie has a 14-point lead among men but loses women to Clinton by 10 points.

Clinton leads in other 2016 showdowns

The statistical tie between the Garden State governor and the former secretary of state is pretty remarkable compared to how Christie's potential GOP rivals do against Clinton in the CNN poll at this early stage of the game.

Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, loses to Clinton by eight percentage points. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky trails by 13 points. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a 2008 GOP presidential candidate, is down by 15 points.

And it doesn't get any better for the GOP from there.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who ran for the nomination in the last election, is down 17 points to Clinton; freshman Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas trails by 18 points; Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rick Santorum, a 2012 GOP presidential candidate and former senator from Pennsylvania, are 19 points behind; and former two-term Florida Gov. Jeb Bush faces a 21-point gap between himself and Clinton

.

One thing to remember: Surveys taken this early in a presidential cycle are often heavily influenced by name recognition.

""Keep in mind that polls taken so many years before an election have little or no predictive value,"" Holland said.

The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from December 16-19, with 950 registered voters nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points."

Federal shutdown a pivotal issue in the Booker-Lonegan race

Cory Booker entered the race as a heavy favorite

Distance between the two candidates is not as great now

Cory Booker, the charismatic Newark mayor who won a national following via Twitter and his own heroics, was elected to the U.S. Senate Wednesday.

Booker, a Democrat, easily defeated Republican Steve Lonegan, the former mayor of Bogota, N.J., in a special election to fill the seat held by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who died in June.

Booker is New Jersey's first African-American senator and the only elected black Senator in the upper house. Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina was appointed in January to fill the seat of Sen. Jim DeMint, who resigned.

""Thank you so much, New Jersey, I'm proud to be your senator-elect,'' Booker tweeted minutes after the Associated Press declared him the winner.

Addressing supporters at a victory party, Booker said he will go to Washington ""to engage in the kind of hard, humble service that reaches out to others."" He also paid an emotional tribute to his father, Cary, who died last week. ""Death can end a life, but it cannot end a love,"" Booker said.

The unusual date for the special election -- a Wednesday less than a month before the November legislative and gubernatorial election -- was set by Republican Gov. Chris Christie. The end of nine-week campaign, hard fought between Booker and Lonegan, coincided with 16-day government shutdown.

Booker, who is in his second term as mayor of the state's largest city, made much of his ability to cross party lines and reach compromise, often citing his experience working with Republican Gov. Chris Christie on education and economic development in Newark.

As he voted Wednesday, Booker called the election ""a chance to make a statement about what is going on in Washington.''

Voters who came to cast ballots at Firehouse #3 in Teaneck, N.J., in the northern part of the state, had the congressional stalemate on their minds. Leonard Hospidor, 42, an audio engineer, voted with one goal: ""Stopping the madness.''

Hospidor voted for Booker. But his vote was ""not just a partisan thing as it is so much trying to restore a little bit of sanity to the process,'' he said. ""It's gotten out of control, the crazy thing, and it's a little bit embarrassing.''

Lonegan, former state director of a Tea Party-supporting group, Americans for Prosperity, said he supported the government shutdown, calling it ""a good way to find out which government services are essential,'' and as a way to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

Michael Diehl, 47, a computer technician who voted for Lonegan, said he also favored the shutdown ""If that's what it takes to get them to stop spending down in Washington,'' He patted his shirt pocket. ""I've got a mortgage (payment) check in my pocket right now,'' he said. ""I've got to make that money, I can't keep putting it on a credit card. I've got to pay my bills.''

The shutdown ""hurts my heart,'' said Glenda Hadnott, 60, a partner in an accounting consulting firm. ""How do you let this great country all of a sudden have no money to pay Social Security or the military because you're playing some game?"" she asked.

Hadnott voted for Booker because ""I do not want to see another Republican in there. I don't feel the Republicans care about the middle class and poor.''

""Besides, I love Cory Booker,'' she added. ""It's not because of his color,'' but because he is an ""open personality,'' said Hadnott, who is African-American. ""Cory will go out on the street and Cory will talk to anybody, and he won't put himself on a pedestal.''

Booker entered the race a heavy favorite: New Jersey has not elected a Republican to the Senate since 1972. With a big fundraising advantage, he largely ignored Lonegan until the final two weeks, when opinion polls showed the race tightening to low double-digits. Then Booker began returning Lonegan's fire, calling the Republican an ""extremist'' and pointing out Lonegan's opposition to abortion rights and same-sex marriage.

Long considered a rising Democratic star, Booker was able to call on President Obama, who carried New Jersey by nearly 17 percentage points last year, to make a last-minute video on his behalf.

Lonegan mocked Booker as ""a tweeter, not a leader.'' Booker's fondness for Twitter – where he has 1.4 million followers -- held through Election Day, when he tweeted at least 50 times, compared with about a dozen by Lonegan.

""I worry that he's too much hype and not enough substance,'' said Katie Norris, 47, a copy editor. A Democrat, she voted for Booker regardless. ""Compared with Lonegan – I was not a fan,'' she said.

But Denise Eberly, 38, a theater technician, said Booker is simply communicating in a way that's important for an elected official. Booker's high social media profile is to his credit. ""There's something to be said about being able to reach people and use the media that's available.''

When Booker replaces Sen. Jeff Chiesa, a Republican appointed by Christie to fill the seat vacated by Lautenberg, Senate Democrats gain an additional vote. That will widen their majority to 55, including two independents who generally vote Democratic, to 45 Republicans.

She described how she had tried repeatedly to address local party clubs about her candidacy for a hotly contested congressional seat in the Inland Empire, only to learn four of those organizations had endorsed a rival, Redlands Mayor Pete Aguilar.

The backing, announced by the Aguilar campaign, “suggests that information needed to participate fully in the Democratic Club endorsement process has intentionally been withheld” from other candidates, Reyes, a Colton attorney and first-time candidate, said in her letter. She asked the state party to look into the matter.

Although four Democrats are taking on Rep. Gary Miller (R-Rancho Cucamonga) in next year’s June primary, party leaders months ago decided to back Aguilar, funneling endorsements from a bevy of elected officials and campaign contributions his way. That leaves Reyes, former Rep. Joe Baca of Rialto and San Bernardino school board member Danny Tillman with an uphill climb.

Nor can they expect help from the state Democratic Party, which, according to spokesman Tenoch Flores, has no jurisdiction over local clubs and won’t make its own endorsements until March. Most observers expect Aguilar to emerge with that backing too.

According to interviews and their campaign websites, the four Democrats differ little on policy matters, and each has strong roots and at least a modest political base in the 31st Congressional District. The biggest issue in this Democratic-tilting, largely working-class district is who has the best chance of beating Miller.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee decided on Aguilar, even though he made an unsuccessful run at the same seat last year. That was a seminal year in California elections, with districts drawn for the first time by an independent commission and a new “top-two” primary system that sent the first- and second-place finishers to the fall ballot, regardless of party.

The four Democrats split the vote, and although Aguilar placed first among his party peers, the two Republicans, Miller and state Sen. Bob Dutton, outpolled him, knocking him out of the race and dashing Democratic expectations for winning the district.

This time, Democrats have made the district a top target in their battle to wrest control of the House from Republicans. So it’s not surprising they would choose a preferred candidate quickly, said Shaun Bowler, a UC Riverside political scientist.

“This is what you’ve got to do — settle on one candidate, [hope to] scare off the others and focus your efforts,” Bowler said. “You don’t want to have candidates spending a lot of time and money fighting each other.... You don’t want to have it competitive within the party.”

The risk of such a strategy is giving voters the appearance of backroom dealing and building resentment in the candidates, who resent the party establishment and won’t help the primary winner in the fall.

Baca and Reyes insist they can win and said Aguilar already had his chance.

After 12 years in Congress representing much of the area, Baca decided to seek reelection last year in a neighboring district and lost. Now he’s offering himself as an experienced lawmaker and known quantity who can beat Miller, whose hard-line record on immigration could make him vulnerable in this heavily Latino district.

Baca said he endorsed Aguilar last time and would have again had he won but now believes “he’s not a viable candidate.”

He said he’s attending events throughout the district and cited his name recognition and accomplishments, including obtaining $575 million in economic stimulus funds for the district.

“Every time there’s a crowd of 10 people, I’m there,” Baca said.

He said he doesn’t “need to raise as much money because I’m known,” downplaying the $36,605 cash on hand he reported earlier this year, versus Aguilar’s $437,725.

Baca was elected to a community college board four times, then won election to the state Assembly in 1992 and the state Senate in 1998. In Congress, he racked up a more conservative voting record than most California House Democrats, according to Congressional Quarterly’s Politics in America.

Reyes is a lifelong district resident, whose first job, at 12, was picking onions with her mother and siblings. She has the backing of Emily’s List, a national organization that helps female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights. A longtime community volunteer who has worked on other campaigns, Reyes closed her law practice to concentrate on the race and lent her campaign $100,000.

Over lunch recently at the 75-year-old Mitla Café in San Bernardino, Reyes said she would make families her priority and work to bring back jobs to the district, which was especially hard hit by the recession.

“My mom told me I was always fighting for everybody, and that’s what I plan to do in Congress,” Reyes said.

Aguilar, who has been on the Redlands City Council since 2006, said he can bring "" fresh ideas” and a local perspective to Congress. He owns a small communications company and is a fourth-generation resident of the Inland Empire.

Standing near his boyhood home in a modest San Bernardino neighborhood, Aguilar said he has “worked across the aisle” with Republican elected officials “to serve the best interests of middle-class families” and to encourage job growth.

“I don’t subscribe to ‘you should get one shot and then you should go away,’” he said, rattling off a list of prominent politicians who lost elections before winning big. He calls Miller’s election “a fluke.”

Tillman did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.

The answer, apparently, is more town halls.

Michele Bachmann has gone from presidential ""contender"" (yeah, we're just gonna put some quotes around that one) to being in serious jeopardy of losing even her current House seat. That's not entirely surprising, of course: Even though she's in a deep-red district, she's been nearly booted a few times, and her recent race against Democrat Jim Graves turned out to be a squeaker. Then there's her presidential campaign being investigated by the FEC and FBI. Oh, and the bit where she keeps saying crackpot things and being a general embarrassment to her own party.

What's a bit different is that Bachmann seems to be keenly aware of how much difficulty she's already in. Which means her constituents are going to start seeing her a lot more often:



Bachmann declined to be interviewed for this story. Kotman, her spokesman, said: “It’s 18 months out, and she isn’t focused on the campaign. She’s focused on the district.” […] Bachmann recently began running TV commercials highlighting her role in sponsoring legislation to repeal Obama’s health care bill — an unusually early time in the election season to start airing ads. And Republicans say they’re assured by the congresswoman’s busy in-district schedule — as of late, she seems more focused on holding town halls than on making headlines. “She is working harder in the district than she has in the past,” said Ron Carey, a former Bachmann chief of staff. “It’s going to be harder to make the case that she’s an AWOL congresswoman.”

There's nothing that shows you're ""focused on your district"" more than cutting television ads highlighting yourself and your quixotic obsession with holding dozens and dozens of meaningless votes to repeal ObamaCare. She's a true saint, that one. (Oh, and her office has also already produced an anti-Graves, anti-Nancy Pelosi web video. Again, though, not focused on campaigning. Shame on you for thinking so.) Still, having your constituents hear more from you is a bit of a risky move, for far-right Republicans like Bachmann; the entire 2012 election season was ample enough evidence of that.

Having her constituents actually boot her should still be considered an uphill climb. It's at least a bit interesting, though, that her office seems already to be in a bit of panic."

That idea, which only a black person could invoke without being castigated for the flagrant racial overtones, is a trope to which an increasingly homogeneous Republican Party seems to subscribe.

The most recent example of this is E.W. Jackson, who last weekend became the Virginia Republicans’ candidate for lieutenant governor in the state.

In a video posted to YouTube in 2012 titled “Bishop E.W. Jackson Message to Black Christians,” Jackson says:

“It is time to end the slavish devotion to the Democrat party. They have insulted us, used us and manipulated us. They have saturated the black community with ridiculous lies: ‘Unless we support the Democrat party, we will be returned to slavery. We will be robbed of voting rights. The Martin Luther King holiday will be repealed.’ They think we’re stupid and these lies will hold us captive while they violate everything we believe as Christians.”

He continues:

“Shame on us for allowing ourselves to be sold to the highest bidder. We belong to God. Our ancestors were sold against their will centuries ago, but we’re going to the slave market voluntarily today. Yes, it’s just that ugly.”"

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/clout/chi-new-general-assembly-sworn-in-as-full-plate-looms-20130109,0,4540610.story",,"['Ray Long', 'Rick Pearson', 'Rafael Guerrero']",New General Assembly sworn in as full plate looms,"SPRINGFIELD --- A new Illinois General Assembly was sworn in today, and after the ceremony and celebrations are over, lawmakers will face a full plate of unresolved issues in the month ahead.



Democrats now have veto-proof majorities in both the House and the Senate, increasing the party's control at a time when the state's $96.8 billion pension debt looms as a major issue. Also left hanging following Tuesday's adjournment of the last session: gay marriage, gun control and gambling expansion, among others.



Gov. Pat Quinn presided over the 59-member Senate, which is his constitutional duty, until Sen. John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, was re-elected as the chamber's president. Democrats make up 40 out of the 59 senators.



The House is across town at the University of Illinois-Springfield at an auditorium. The House elected Democratic Rep. Michael Madigan as speaker, a post he has held since 1983 with the exception of a two-year period when Republicans won control. He is Illinois' longest serving House speaker. There are 71 Democrats out of 118 members.



Madigan challenged his newly sworn colleagues to tackle the difficult finances of the state, including the ""absolutely serious nature"" of the heavily indebted pension systems.



The Southwest Side Democrat warned House members that ""really difficult work"" lies ahead, asking them to call upon their ""inner resolve.""



After briefly relenting the past few days during efforts to get pension reform passed, Madigan stuck beside his call to shift the state's costs of paying for suburban and Downstate teacher pensions onto local school districts. Madigan said it is now a ""free lunch"" given that Chicago property taxpayers cover expenses for the city's public teacher pensions.



House Minority Leader Tom Cross, R-Oswego, called on lawmakers to ""be bold"" and put political consequences aside when deciding how to move forward on the ""incredibly difficult issues.""



Earlier, House Majority Leader Barbara Currie launched the renomination of Madigan to start his 15th term as speaker of the House, saying the hallmark of his leadership is one of hard work, intelligence and deliberative decision making.



""He's not a knee-jerk, not a snap judgment kind of guy,"" Currie said.



Citing the state's daunting financial challenges, Currie said: ""One man has shown the capacity to chart a course out of the morass.""



Among lawmakers seconding Madigan's nomination. Rep. Elaine Nekritz, D-Northbrook, said Madigan is always a step ahead, or maybe ""seven or eight,"" as the clear ""focal point"" of the legislative process.



Unlike most ceremonial debates over pre-determined leadership choices, Rep. Mike Bost, R-Murphysboro, ripped into Madigan while nominating Cross for the speakership.



Bost drew national attention last year for a paper-tossing tirade against the confining Madigan-backed rules of procedure in the House, but he said this time he would try to ""keep my emotions in check.""



But Bost wasted little time before he railed against Madigan.



""For the last 32 years, this has not been a very democratic place,"" Bost said, singling out Madigan as the ""one person"" responsible for the problem.



Bost pleaded with colleagues to back Cross because today they will take the ""most important vote"" of the session, one that will determine how committees are structured and whether bills will ever be heard.



At the House ceremony, there is a banner with a picture of the Capitol dome and American flags. There is also a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln: ""Determine the thing that can be and shall be done, and then we shall find the way.""



Four years ago, the Illinois House was sworn in, then promptly voted to impeach then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich. The Senate went on to remove Blagojevich from office, and eventually the ex-governor ended up serving federal time in a Colorado prison following his conviction on political corruption charges.



The new Illinois House is home to two lawmakers who face federal criminal charges: Reps. Derrick Smith, who was kicked out last August but re-elected in November by West Side voters; and LaShawn Ford, who was indicted on financial charges late last year."

The thrill is back for many Americans as President Obama’s second inauguration approaches — though maybe a bit less intense.

This inauguration’s celebration will be shorter, and almost certainly smaller and less expensive, than the gala that drew nearly 2 million people to witness the first time an African American president took the oath of office.

There will be no massive rock concert on the Mall, as there was last time, and there will be only two official evening balls, including one dedicated to military personnel, instead of 10. Even the massive security cordon, which seemed to shut down most of downtown Washington four years ago, will be relatively modest.

But this year’s inauguration will fall on the national holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and that coincidence, along with an enduring fascination with the first family, is expected to boost attendance above any other second-term inaugurations.

And then there are people who stayed away four years ago for one reason or another and who want to make sure they don’t miss history this time.

“I watched on TV, and I wished I was in D.C.,” said Kaye Lin, 26, a producer with Voice of America who is hosting four friends, so far, at her townhouse near the District’s Eastern Market. “This is still as historic and as memorable as before. When is the next time you’re going to see a black man be reinaugurated and get his second term? It might be a long time. So I’m right there.”

Planners have spent months choreographing what one Air Force general called “quite a ballet” to guide the president’s steps and an army-sized support staff through the oath-taking ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, a grand parade down Pennsylvania Avenue and the events that follow.

The festivities will begin the Saturday before the 57th inauguration with a National Day of Service — which Obama is eager to make a permanent tradition — and wind down with a national prayer service the following Tuesday at Washington National Cathedral. As before, a huge security detail of military personnel and law enforcement officers, led by the U.S. Secret Service, will operate checkpoints, close roads and manage crowds.

Members of the newly sworn 113th Congress will be handing out about 250,000 tickets, although this time there will be no purple-coded ones — and, organizers hope, no repeat of the “Purple Tunnel of Doom,” an episode in which thousands bearing purple color-coded tickets were inadvertently blocked in 2009 from reaching their seats on the Capitol lawn.

Obama’s second time around will also have some firsts, or at least near-firsts. He will become the first president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to take the oath of office four times. That’s because of the do-over performed after Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. flubbed his lines during Obama’s first inauguration, and because Jan. 20, the date prescribed for taking the oath, falls on a Sunday this time.

Although hotel bookings have not kept pace with bookings last time, when there was a 90 percent occupancy rate on inauguration eve, tourism officials say the tempo picked up after the holidays. Still up for grabs for well-heeled revelers were faux presidential suites at the Willard InterContinental with a view of Pennsylvania Avenue. The “Oval Suites,” featuring marble-floored entryways and a design based on the Oval Office, were going for $5,700 a night, with a four-night minimum and a $27,000 catering minimum.

Metro will expand service to handle crowds, and there will be a water taxi running from Alexandria. But Amtrak says it expects business as usual, and Virginia Railway Express won’t be running at all.

Doug Anderson, 55, who owns a charter bus company in Greenville, Pa., said nine groups have plunked down $2,000 each for 56-seat buses to Washington, compared with 25 buses last time.

“It was a monumental event when President Obama was initially elected, and it was a turning point in a number of ways in the national political arena. This year, it wasn’t quite as dramatic or climactic as it was the first time,” Anderson said.

Four years ago, inauguration planners initially braced for as many as 4 million people. An estimated 1.8 million people attended, making it the largest event ever in Washington.

Elliott Ferguson, president of Destination DC, a nonprofit group that promotes District tourism, said his organization is working on an estimate of 800,000 visitors this time, which is still higher than attendance generally expected for second inaugurals. President George W. Bush’s drew about 400,000 people in 2005.



Last time around, the cost was difficult to pin down because of the many groups involved. Government officials and media organizations estimated that Obama’s first inauguration’s total cost was about $150 million, including $54.3 million in private money raised by the Presidential Inaugural Committee, a principal organizer of events before and after the oath-taking ceremony.

The Presidential Inaugural Committee has not yet come up with an estimated cost for this year’s festivities.

The Constitution doesn’t have much to say about inaugural events, prescribing only such basics as the time and date and the wording of the oath. Everything else has evolved through tradition. And like all rituals, the quadrennial exercise creates tensions between the need to adhere to tradition and the desire to acknowledge cultural or political change.

Every gesture has the potential to create meaning — sometimes by adding something, sometimes by omission — in a ceremony whose overarching purpose is to display a peaceful transition of power, or its peaceful renewal, in a democracy.

“I think what an inauguration does is it gives you constancy, and you get some comfort in it. The idea of beginning anew is a very powerful idea, even if it’s a second term,” said Mark R. Kennedy, a former member of Congress who heads the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University. “They all, perhaps, have twists.”

Obama’s inauguration festivities will begin, as four years ago, with a National Day of Service on Saturday, Jan. 19, whose centerpiece will be a tented service fair on the Mall. Visitors will be encouraged to sign up and pledge a year’s effort to one or more of about 100 local and national community organizations.

On Sunday, the president will take the oath in a private ceremony; on Monday, he will repeat it in public. Roberts will give the oath to the president both times. Vice President Biden will receive the oath from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic appointed to the high court.

This will be the fifth time that a president takes the oath in private and repeats the process in public because of a quirk in the calendar, said Beth Hahn, historical editor in the U.S. Senate Historical Office. Four presidents — Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Woodrow Wilson and Rutherford B. Hayes — took the oath in private and then again in public because the constitutionally mandated date for the oath fell on a Sunday, a tradition grounded in the desire to honor Sunday as the sabbath.

After the oath-taking ceremony Monday, the president will attend a congressional luncheon and then lead the parade from the Capitol to the White House.

The Obamas will then attend the Inaugural Ball and the Commander-in-Chief’s Ball, both of which will be held at the Washington Convention Center.

The next day, Washington National Cathedral will host an invitation-only interfaith National Prayer Service, with the president and the vice president. There will also be a live webcast of the event.

On Monday, Metrorail will open an hour early, at 4 a.m., and service will be provided for an extra two hours, until 2 a.m. Tuesday. To help offset the costs of expanded service, Metro will charge peak fares until 9 p.m. Metrobus will operate weekday rush-hour service in the morning, followed by an early afternoon rush. Many routes will have detours related to inaugural events. There are also plans to accommodate an expected 2,500 motorcoaches and tour buses.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/26/5-Political-Surprises-in-2013,2013-12-26 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Top 5 Political Surprises in 2013,"At the beginning of 2013, Obama and his Democrat party were in firm control of the nation’s political terrain. Obama had won a convincing reelection by again boosting turnout of his young and minority voter base. Contrary to expectations, the Democrats gained two seats in the Senate, extending their control of the chamber, and made modest gains in the House. The Republicans, after squandered an almost unprecedented opportunity, were have something of an existential crisis. What a difference a year makes.

Not only did 2013 see a resurgence of the Republican party, it provided a number of political surprises throughout the year. The following were the biggest surprises of the year.

5. The Collapse of Marco Rubio

At the beginning of the year, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) seemed the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in 2016. A poll of Iowa Republicans in January showed him with a commanding lead with a crowded field, running ahead of his closest competitor, Rep. Paul Ryan, by over eight points. In December, however, Rubio polled 8th in Iowa, garnering support from just 6% of Republicans in the state. In national polls, he polls around 6th place. It is a breathtaking political collapse.

Rubio’s political fortunes were reversed by a fundamental misreading of the electorate on immigration reform. There is a robust case to be made for reforming our nation’s immigration system. The approach adopted by the Senate and promoted by Rubio, however, is arguably worse than the current system. It provides immediate legalization for 11 million illegal immigrants and effectively does almost nothing to secure the border. Even the modest security provisions in the bill would likely be ignored by the Obama Administration, which has ignored existing Congressional directives related to the border.

Like amnesty legislation in 1986, it provides legalization with a promise of security that will likely never materialize. Also like the deal in 1986, it will likely provide an incentive for even greater illegal immigration in the future. The GOP establishment and its business allies may still approve immigration reform in 2014, but Rubio’s political standing is unlikely to return.

4. The ObamaCare Rollout Disaster

I always expected ObamaCare to ultimately be a failure. I did not anticipate, however, the smoldering wreckage that was its rollout. The government simply had to build a website with no more complexity than Amazon or any other e-commerce site. It also had hundreds of millions of dollars and three years to build it. Even the government didn’t seem incompetent enough to screw that up.

Oh, but it did.

Even more surprising was the very slow response of the Obama Administration to the obvious disaster. Subsequent reports have detailed several warnings to government officials that the website wasn’t ready to launch, wasn’t secure, and wasn’t even accessible. Did no one take these remotely seriously? Did they think unicorns and pixie dust would mask these failures?

In October, in the aftermath of the government shutdown, Democrats led the generic congressional ballot by eight points. In the wake of the ObamaCare rollout disaster, Republicans have gained an unprecedented 13 points and now lead Democrats by 5.

3. The GOP’s War on Its Base

Inexplicably, the Republican party establishment reacted to its defeats in 2012 by declaring war on its base, conservative voters. Party officials and strategists blamed their defeat on the “tea party” and conservatives, who presumably turned off more “moderate” voters. The problem with this narrative is that the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, won Independents by five points. Republicans lost because the Democrats did a better job turning out their base voters. For the past two elections, the GOP has given its nomination to the most “moderate” candidate running. It is clearly not a recipe for success.

In the past few years, there have been some candidates with strong tea party backing who in the end were flawed. There have been far more “establishment” candidates who also lost. Todd Aiken won the GOP primary in Missouri because the tea party was divided between two other candidates. Richard Lugar had the edge over eventual nominee Richard Mourdock, until it was revealed that Lugar didn’t have an actual residence in his state. At least make a pretense of representing a state. At least six “establishment” and “electable” Senate candidates, enough to secure a majority, went down to defeat in 2012.

The party and its business allies, however, have vowed to challenge conservatives in primaries next year. The GOP establishment will no doubt be able to raise millions to wage this pyrrhic war, but it is hard to see how it will have the “boots on the ground” to win elections. It may very well spark its own destruction as a national political force.

2. Obama’s Irrelevance

Congress ended its year passing the first budget agreement in five years. Most surprising, though, is that it accomplished this because Obama wasn’t part of the negotiations. The Democrats’ lead negotiator, Sen. Patty Murray, intentionally kept the White House out of the talks.

It was a dramatic turn around for a President who won a solid reelection just a year ago. At the start of 2013, Obama’s approval rating was nearly 60%. By a combination of political miscalculation and detachment, Obama has squandered all the political capital he won through his reelection.

He has made high-profile pushes for gun control, immigration reform, climate change and a higher minimum wage. Progress on these issues is arguably harder now than it was before Obama made them priorities.

In foreign policy, an area where second term presidents generally focus, Obama has led a withdrawal of the US from the world stage. America was a passive observer to the dramatic events in Egypt. Our absence allowed Russia to reassert its influence in the region for the first time in decades. China is expanding its influence throughout the world. Obama drew a line in the sand on Syria and then quickly retreated. His outreach to Iran has angered almost all of our allies. They don’t trust us and our enemies don’t fear us.

1. Obama’s Political Resilience

With his approval ratings at the lowest of his Presidency, it may seem counterintuitive to talk about Obama’s political resilience. Consider, however, what he has withstood this year.

We have learned that the government is engaged in comprehensive surveillance of Americans. The NSA tracks our web activity and even keeps records on every phone call we make. Worse, the Administration has lied about its activities repeatedly. The government even targeted reporters it suspected of working with government whistleblowers.

We also learned that the government was using the IRS to target its political opponents. This targeting went beyond supervision of tax-exempt groups and included audits of major Republican donors. When a cancer patient went public with the news that he was losing his health insurance as a result of ObamaCare, he quickly learned he was being audited by the IRS.

PoliticFact names Obama’s oft repeated promise that people can keep their health insurance the “lie of the year.” Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance as a result of his signature legislative achievement. The cancellation of these policies and problems with the law’s implementation raise the real possibility that fewer Americans will have insurance when ObamaCare takes full effect on January 1st.

I could literally run through a half-dozen more issues, any one of which would cripple most presidencies. That’s even before considering the anemic economic “recovery.” Obama does currently have the lowest approval rating of any 2-term President, at this point, since Richard Nixon. Still, between 40-42% of the public approves of the job he is doing. How is this even possible?

The most surprising thing about 2013 is that Obama has absorbed more negative shocks than almost all modern-day presidents combined and yet is still supported by only a little less than half the public. Even his currently low approval ratings defy gravity.

Something’s got to give next year."

Christian Adams'],"53,000 Dead Registered Voters in Florida, Millions Nationwide","The Florida Secretary of State has discovered 53,000 dead voters registered to vote. The Secretary of State has also flagged thousands of potential non-citizens who are also registered to vote. This discovery is indicative of a wider national problem with dead and ineligible voters on the rolls heading into the Presidential election.

In the 2012 legislative session, Florida finally passed a law requiring the use of the Social Security Death Index (SSDI) to determine if dead people are registered to vote in Florida. Secretary of State Kurt Browning and then-State Election Director Don Palmer proposed this idea in the previous legislative session, but the bill did not pass.

Florida discovered the dead voters by matching voter rolls against the SSDI.

The SSDI is the list of Americans who have died and applied for death benefits. Because an application must be submitted by the next of kin and carries criminal penalties for false statements, it is considered the most accurate list of dead voters available.

Yet most states don’t use the SSDI. Instead, they use a hodge-podge of other information, usually compiled from the state bureaus of vital statistics. But state bureau reporting is slow and incomplete.

Three counties in Florida have reported more citizens registered to vote than people alive eligible to vote – St. Johns, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa – according to the most recent Election Assistance Commission report.

Having dead people infesting the rolls is the first step to voter impersonation.

Federal law requires states to have a reasonable voter list maintenance program and gives the Eric Holder Justice Department the power to sue states that don’t. Not surprisingly, Holder’s DOJ has not brought a single case under the law to require states to clean up corrupted voter rolls. Indeed, when I served at the DOJ Voting Section, an announcement was made in November 2009 that this provision of the law would not be enforced. The political leadership was philosophically opposed to the law, and they said so.



Make no mistake, the problem of corrupted voter rolls is not confined to Florida. It extends to New Mexico, Iowa, Indiana, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and other states. Judicial Watch has notified various states they are in violation of the law and will be filing lawsuits to force the sort of clean-up that Florida has now started.

Many resist cleaning up the voter rolls as directed by the Secretary of State. Brenda Snipes, the Supervisor of Elections in Broward County (Fort Lauderdale) is one.

“I’m feeling really uncomfortable about this,” Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes told officials with the state’s Division of Elections.

With the election just months away, the time for removing ineligible voters is now. Unfortunately, millions are on the rolls across the nation, and election officials from the DOJ to local offices are reluctant to act."

But plenty of Republicans are still eager to wage a midterm campaign against President Obama, convinced that the spate of recent troubles dogging his second term will drive voters into their arms next year.

“Now, we’re seeing the arrogance. We’re seeing the cronyism in practice in this second term,” Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin recently asserted, sounding a lot like his vice-presidential candidate self from 2012, when Republicans spent a good deal of time attacking the president as a self-satisfied autocrat who used his power to reward friends and punish enemies.

Not everyone in the party, however, is so sure that they can expand their ranks in Congress or improve their standing among voters by personally attacking the president, whose likability ratings stand near 80 percent even if only half of Americans approve of his job performance. And they are cautioning their fellow party members to avoid building their campaigns around the same kinds of messages that have fallen flat before.

“I don’t think I’d personalize it,” said John Linder, the former congressman from Georgia who ran the National Republican Congressional Committee during the late 1990s while Newt Gingrich and House Republicans were preparing an impeachment case against President Bill Clinton. Mr. Linder said he fought and lost a battle with Mr. Gingrich over their strategy in the 1998 midterm elections, which Mr. Gingrich thought should be focused on assailing Mr. Clinton’s character."

Chen'],"Assailing Bloomberg, Liu Enters Race to Replace Him","Mr. Liu joins other major Democrats who have officially entered the race. A week earlier, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who has been leading comfortably in early polls, announced her candidacy through Twitter and a video, then visited all five boroughs for a “walk and talk” tour. A month ago, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, made his announcement outside his row house in Park Slope, Brooklyn, to emphasize his outer-borough appeal. William C. Thompson Jr., who lost a close race to Mr. Bloomberg in 2009, said in 2010 that he would run again.

Mr. Liu’s kickoff was far more raucous and chaotic, with the City Hall announcement as a microcosm. There were so many people trying to squeeze onto the City Hall steps that aides to Mr. Liu asked supporters to move aside, saying Mr. Liu, his wife and their son would be unable to pass through. Then Mr. Liu delivered his remarks twice — once for the people at City Hall, and then for several dozen more at City Hall Park who could not get closer. And finally, he held an unscheduled news conference, before answering even more questions, on his way to his next event, from reporters with Mexican and Chinese television stations.

Virtually every question was about the federal investigation into his fund-raising. On April 15, two associates, including his former treasurer, are scheduled to stand trial on fraud charges. And though Mr. Liu, 46, has not been accused of wrongdoing, court documents have left little doubt that prosecutors have questioned his conduct.

On Sunday, Mr. Liu maintained his defiant posture, saying, “People have said there’s a witch hunt; the problem is, there’s no witch.”

Asked if he was concerned about his fund-raising, which has lagged, Mr. Liu said: “What are you guys talking about? You guys don’t understand campaign financing at all, do you?”

Earlier in the day, at the Staten Island St. Patrick’s Day parade, Mr. Liu was speed-walking down the sidewalk and passed Mr. Bloomberg, who was walking in the street.

Selassie Samuel, 27, saw Mr. Liu coming with his small retinue of photographers, reporters and staff members. He turned, smiled and asked to have his picture taken with Mr. Liu. Afterward, Mr. Samuel asked a reporter, “Who was that?”"

Pelosi currently represents 12th Congressional District of California, which includes the northeastern three-quarters of the City and County of San Francisco, California. (here's a PDF map of CA-12)

In 2012, Pelosi was lucky to draw a Republican general election challenger, John Dennis. Since the 12th Congressional District of California is overwhelmingly Democratic to the point that simply being a Republican means that someone is unelectable, Pelosi won re-election easily. If that happens again in 2014, Pelosi will win re-election easily.

However, if Nancy Pelosi draws a Democratic general election challenger, which is possible because of the way congressional elections are conducted in California, Pelosi could be in big trouble.

Since the 2010 Republican wave that saw Democrats lose the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Pelosi's relationship with progressives has become heavily strained.

First, in a 2011 report by the newsmagazine 60 Minutes, Pelosi was revealed to have participated in the initial public offering (IPO) of shares of Visa stock in 2008 at the same time that the House was considering whether or not to bring proposed regulations on credit cards to the House floor, which it never did:



...former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband have participated in at least eight IPOs. One of those came in 2008, from Visa, just as a troublesome piece of legislation that would have hurt credit card companies, began making its way through the House. Undisturbed by a potential conflict of interest the Pelosis purchased 5,000 shares of Visa at the initial price of $44 dollars. Two days later it was trading at $64. The credit card legislation never made it to the floor of the House.

A coalition of progressive outside groups is threatening to recruit primary challengers against Democrats who vote for a bill with “chained CPI,” and the groups have been directing thousands of activists to call Democratic members, including leaders. But when asked about “chained CPI” Wednesday, Pelosi backed Obama, saying she considers it “a strengthening of Social Security.”

Writer, blogger and sometime TV pundit, Zerlina Maxwell, who was given the unenviable challenge of interviewing Ms. Pelosi, Saturday afternoon, eventually got to a question about Edward Snowden's release of documents related to the government's snooping operations. Boos and heckles cascaded across the convention hall, as the minority leader defended the legality of the NSA's data mining operation, and its intrusions into the world's email and internet activity, while decrying any comparison to similar activities under Bush and Cheney. She even brought charts explaining the differences, which she tweeted. ""No more secret courts! No more secret laws,"" shouted attendee Marc Perkel, a 57 year-old Californian. As the crowd applauded and cheered his audaciousness, some joining in the chants, security personnel were summoned and he was removed from the hall. ""It was wrong when Cheney did it, and it's wrong now,"" he yelled, as they marched him out. The shouting inside did not stop, however. When Leader Pelosi was asked for her response to the news that Snowden had been charged with three felonies, under the Espionage Act, she defended the Department of Justice's criminal complaint. ""In terms of Snowden,"" she said, ""I may be in disagreement with you. He did violate the law, in terms of releasing those documents."" At that point, Pelosi was assailed with another rolling chorus of boos.

Second, Pelosi has supported President Obama's War on Social Security , including making the absurd claim that Chained CPI would actually strengthen Social Security:Finally, Pelosi publicly defended the National Security Agency's PRISM elecronic surveillance program at the 2013 Netroots Nation conference, and she was booed by progressive activists Trust me, the LAST thing Nancy Pelosi wants is to have to run against a progressive Democrat in the general election in her home district, as she'll have to defend her non-progressive positions on a few very important issues in a district that has a storied history of progressive activism. If Pelosi has to run against a true progressive Democrat, she could lose re-election despite Pelosi having a massive campaign war chest at her disposal."

Rick Santorum announces he will be suspending his campaign during a press conference at the Gettysburg Hotel on April 10, 2012 in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Santorum's three-year-old daughter, Bella, became ill over the Easter holiday and poll numbers showed he was losing to Mitt Romney in his home state of Pennsylvania. (Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)

Rick Santorum said the nation's colleges are promoting a ""sea of antagonism toward Christianity"" and ""indoctrinating"" its youth with ideals that support gay marriage, abortion and pornography.

Santorum called in to Tony Perkins' ""Washington Watch"" on Tuesday to talk about the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade ruling. The conversation dealt not only with abortion but also included other ""symptoms"" that have changed the nation.

Perkins spoke broadly, saying pro-choice Americans represent a troubled country that doesn't choose life, meaning ""That is to follow the principals, the teachings, the instructions of God ... You see that as you've been in Washington, D.C. There is a rejection of this idea of truth, and that there is a foundation or morality, which needs to be upheld.""

Santorum agreed, adding that less young people devote themselves to Christianity. ""If you look at the popular culture and what comes out of Hollywood, if you go to our schools and particularly our colleges and universities, they are indoctrinated in a sea of relativism and a sea of antagonism towards Christianity.""

""Abortion is a symptom. Marriage is a symptom. Pornography [is a symptom],"" he continued. ""All of these are symptoms to the fundamental issue that we've gotten away from the truth and the 'Truth-Giver.'""

Santorum has long been against gay marriage and anti-abortion. When he was in the running for the GOP presidential nomination, he vowed to initiate a war on porn if elected. Santorum received his undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University, an M.B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and a J.D. from the Dickinson School of Law but has criticized the notion that college is a critical entry point to the middle class.

""President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college. What a snob!"" Santorum said last February, according to the New York Times. ""There are good, decent men and women who go out and work hard every day and put their skills to the test that aren't taught by some liberal college professor trying to indoctrinate him. I understand why he wants you to go to college. He wants to remake you in his image.""

The Times highlighted a 2008 study that disproved the theory that going to college makes students increasingly liberal. The study found that 18 to 24-year-old students' ideals shifted somewhat leftward, but this was in line with normally occurring shifts in that age group regardless of education."

Some Florida Republicans are reportedly growing concerned that a new bill curbing the use of mail-in voting could end up backfiring on the party. After Florida's state legislature recently passed a bill to place new restrictions on mail ballots, some Republicans in the state are ""reacting with alarm,"" The Washington Post reports. After all, the bill will be ""curtailing a practice that millions of state Republicans use,"" the Post writes, and Republicans are worried their ""political fortunes are in peril"" as a result. The bill, for example, requires that voters reapply for mail ballots each two-year cycle, whereas the current law requires them to reapply every four years, and it also restricts the use of drop boxes, the report notes. The state legislature moved to enact the changes following the 2020 presidential election, during which former President Donald Trump attacked the use of mail-in voting. But almost 35 percent of GOP voters in Florida cast their ballots by mail in 2020, and Republicans fear the bill will ""further undercut the party's ability to encourage mail voting,"" the Post writes.

Some Republicans reportedly discussed trying to exclude these two groups from the requirement to request mail ballots each cycle but were told this would ""raise equal protection problems.""

Peters'],Senate Confirms Sri Srinivasan for Court Seat,"An alternative possibility is that a bipartisan group of senators could try to reach a deal on the filibuster themselves, that way averting a confrontation that would further strain the already distrustful relationship between the two parties.

Republicans have threatened to filibuster several Obama appointees. Among them: Gina McCarthy, the president’s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, on the ground that she was not forthcoming in responding to their written questions. (They sent her nearly 1,100.) The nomination of Thomas E. Perez for labor secretary is in peril because Republicans view his work as head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division as too political. They have vowed to block Mr. Obama’s pick to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, because they object on principle to the existence of such a bureau. And nominees to the National Labor Relations Board are meeting similar obstacles.

“There may be some that we really have a fight over,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, saying a drawn-out argument over nominations could do considerable harm to the Senate. “So that’s when we have to think this thing through,” he added, saying he would support reopening talks with Democrats over changing the rules on filibusters. “If it becomes a problem and we get hung up over cabinet nominees, yes, I’d be willing to.”

There does appear to be one bright spot for the administration: the nomination of Penny Pritzker as commerce secretary. Ms. Pritzker, a Chicago businesswoman who was a top fund-raiser for Mr. Obama, appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday and met little resistance from Republicans.

But even a relatively gentle confirmation process for Ms. Pritzker is unlikely to resolve the bigger differences between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans point out that they have approved the majority of Mr. Obama’s nominees. But the new lengths to which they have gone to slow down confirmation — including the first-ever filibuster of a defense secretary nominee and requests that nominees respond to hundreds of written questions — have made the process highly contentious.

Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said that after the Senate voted on immigration changes she would support efforts to broker a compromise on the use of the filibuster."

Just how close a call Boehner had is now becoming clear.

Nine House conservatives voted for somebody other than Boehner, two abstained from voting and one voted “present.” That total of 12 Republicans who didn’t support Boehner was a stone’s throw from the required 17 to force a second ballot election – at which point several more Republican members were slated to back a competitor to Boehner’s, who would unite the party behind him or her.

Politico has reported the original list of members possibly considering defection from Boehner was longer and included Reps. Steve King of Iowa, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Scott Garrett of New Jersey and Steve Fincher and Scott DesJarlais, both of Tennessee.

Politico uncovered this list because Kansas Republican Rep. Tim Huelskamp “sat on the House floor during the speaker vote brandishing an iPad” with a message “displayed on the screen ticking off members of the House Republican Conference he hoped would oppose the sitting speaker.”

The title of the email message was reportedly: “You would be fired if this goes out.”

Breitbart News has confirmed that the following members were considering voting against Boehner retaining his speakership as well: Reps. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Sam Graves of Missouri, Steve Southerland of Florida, Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, David Schweikert of Arizona, Arkansas freshman Tom Cotton and Brett Guthrie of Kentucky.

Reps. Guthrie and Cotton denied to Breitbart News that they were on the list.

“Speaker Boehner was voted out of the Republican Conference unanimously and I never considered not voting for him on the House floor. I do not know where these lists originated and my proposed involvement is completely false,” Guthrie said.

Doug Coutts, Chief of Staff for Rep. Cotton, asserted, “Contrary to Breitbart’s reporting, Mr. Cotton did not consider voting for anyone other than Speaker Boehner, an intention he stated plainly the morning of the vote on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal.

“Further, no one approached Mr. Cotton to ask his support for anyone other than Speaker Boehner, nor did Mr. Cotton engage such conversations.”

Breitbart News also learned that outgoing House GOP conference chairman Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling was considering opposing Boehner. Boehner recently named Hensarling to be the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee in the next Congress.

All in all, there were more than 20 House Republicans who were considering unseat Boehner. Many of these members bailed on the movement at the last minute on the House floor.

There did appear to be at one point a chance Boehner wouldn’t regain his position during the happenings on the House floor. The Clerk of the House had reached the end of her list of names to call when Boehner reached 216 votes – he needed 217 to win re-election. As the National Review’s Washington, D.C., editor Robert Costa noted on Twitter, there were 17 Republican members either not voting, voting present or voting for someone other than Boehner. “So: In short, we were over 17 for a minute, looking at 2nd ballot, when the conservatives come to floor, save Boehner from 2nd ballot,” Costa wrote.

Then, as Costa notes, Bachmann, Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn and New Jersey’s Scott Garrett came back to the floor – after ignoring their names being called the first time during the alphabetical roll call – and voted for Boehner.

“Boehner is fine, people/ He will be reelected. Blackburn, Bachmann, and Garrett saved him,” Costa said of those conservatives saving Boehner. “What a story. What a story.”

To be sure, while political observers and most other Americans are looking ahead at whether Republicans can retake the Senate in 2014 or if Hillary Clinton will become a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, the bare-knuckled Virginia race is attracting national attention.

Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe is relatively new to running for office -- with one unsuccessful attempt, a 2009 try to become Virginia governor.

However, he is well known in national political circles as a prolific fundraiser for former President Clinton and Hillary Clinton and as a former Democratic National Committee chairman.

His Republican opponent is Virginia Attorney General and social conservative Ken Cuccinelli, creating a race that has drawn more than one comparison to a potential 2016 presidential match up.

“It’s a prelude to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign,” David Bossie, president of the conservative nonprofit Citizens United, told Fox News on Sunday.

The non-partisan Cook Political Report this month called the contest “the marquee race on the ballot nationally in November” and predicted “much will be read into the results as the 2014 cycle moves into high gear.”

Both campaigns in the too-close-to-call race have attempted to ride this year’s scandal wave – linking the rival candidate to questionable activities by either him or members of his party.

The biggest so far appears to focus on the relationship major political donor Jonnie Williams has with Cuccinelli and outgoing Virginia Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell.

News reports this month revealed Williams gave more than $120,000 in loans to McDonnell’s wife and to a business the governor co-owned.

The revelations follow Cuccinelli amended four years' worth of reports in April to show gifts from Williams.

Among the unreported gifts were a $3,000 summer family retreat and a $1,500 family Thanksgiving dinner at Williams' lodge in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountain foothills.

Richmond's commonwealth's attorney, Democrat Mike Herring, recently said he found no evidence that Cuccinelli violated the state ethics law.

McDonnell has repaid the loans, but the money and thousands of dollars in gifts from Williams remain at the center of two investigations.

Meanwhile, McAuliffe is facing criticism about two associated, green-energy businesses that have yet to become the job-creating firms he touted them to be.

One company, GreenTech Automotive, is an energy-efficient car manufacturer with a plant in Mississippi, not Virginia, whose output remains unclear after roughly three years.

McAuliffe critics last week tried to bring GreenTech into a purported federal investigation involving the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, who also is President Obama's choice to be the No. 2 official at the Homeland Security Department.

Mayorkas is purportedly being investigated for possibly helping a company that funded GreenTech also secure an international investor visa, even after the application was denied and an appeal was rejected.

McAuliffe resigned as GreenTech chairman before starting his gubernatorial campaign.

The second company is Franklin Pellets, which was started in Virginia in 2010 but appears yet to have become operational.

Citizens United is out with a video this week titled “Fast Terry,” a documentary about both companies.

Bossie argue the video doesn’t mention the gubernatorial race and is intended only to “educate Americans about Terry McAuliffe,"" considering he “hangs his hat on his business background.”

The McAuliffe campaign responded by saying it was not surprised by the video considering Citizens United has given the Cuccinelli campaign more than $100,000 through other groups.

Virginia has increasingly become a bellwether state, with its Washington suburbs voting largely Democrat and its rural southwestern region and Hampton Roads, with its many military bases, leaning Republican.

Though McDonnell is a Republican, the state's two previous governors, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, are Democrats and are now Virginia’s U.S. senators.

Cuccinelli and McAuliffe clashed hard in the first to what appears will be three debates.

McAuliffe attacked Cuccinelli over the Williams’ gifts and supporting socially conservative activism.

He also criticized Cuccinelli for what he described as deterring Virginia’s business growth.

“There are consequences to mean-spirited hatefulness,” McAuliffe said, citing Cuccinelli’s legal actions against a University of Virginia climate-change researcher; a 2010 letter telling state-supported colleges they couldn’t enact anti-discrimination policies protecting gays; and actions to restrict abortions.

Cuccinelli accused McAuliffe of stiff-arming some of Virginia’s most destitute regions by building the GreenTech plant in Mississippi.

“The only candidate in this race who has chased business out of Virginia is you,” Cuccinelli said. “You walked right over the people of Martinsville on your way to Mississippi.”

Making his first public comments since losing last November’s presidential election, Romney appeared mystified still that the country didn’t see things his way. He went on the attack against President Obama during a wide-ranging interview on “Fox News Sunday,” as if the Republican hadn’t lost a beat since giving his last stump speech.

Explaining the defeat, Romney and his wife spread around the blame — Mitt to Obama winning over so many blacks and Hispanics by enacting universal health care, Ann to a news media she believed unfairly caricatured her husband. Yet although Romney said “you rehearse all the mistakes that you made,” Romney mostly did not dwell on his own failings as a candidate.

Romney insisted he is getting on with his life — Fox showed him pushing some grandkids on a swing set and cradling his youngest in his arms (“No. 19 and No. 20,” he called the newborn twins) — but he revealed flashes of pain. For him, the White House forever will remain an unfulfilled destiny.

“I look at what’s happening right now, I wish I were there,” Romney said. “It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done.”

Up until Election Day, both Mitt and Ann said, they thought they would win. “We were a little blindsided,” Ann told Fox anchor Chris Wallace. She seemed more heartbroken than her husband, saying she has cried since he lost on Nov. 6.

“You know the great ‘Princess Bride’ line, ‘Mostly dead’?” she said. “I’m mostly over it. But not completely. And you have moments where you, you know, go back and feel the sorrow of the loss. And so, yes, I think we’re not mostly dead yet.”

She added, “I know he would have been a fabulous president, and I mourn the fact that he’s not there.”

The transition from presidential nominee — life in the intoxicating and never fading spotlight, with a minute-by-minute schedule and bevies of aides, press and Secret Service agents surrounding you — to campaign has-been is always difficult. Just ask John McCain and John Kerry.

But unlike McCain and Kerry, who continued distinguished Senate careers after their failed White House bids in 2008 and 2004 respectively, Romney had no job to return to. The former Massachusetts governor tended his wounds at his San Diego beach house, largely in seclusion, making up for lost time with his family and friends.

Photographs of Romney surfaced online, including one of him pumping his own gas with his hair messed up. “None of those were done by professional photographers — or I might have, you know, combed my hair,” Romney joked to Wallace.

Romney began easing back onto the public stage with Sunday’s interview. He is scheduled to give his first speech since the election at the Conservative Political Action Conference next week.

In the Fox interview, Romney was not shy about critiquing Obama’s handling of the nation’s fiscal crises — continuing the fights that shaped the 2012 campaign.

The hardest part about losing, Romney said, has been watching “this golden moment just slip away with politics.” He accused Obama of using automatic federal spending cuts known as the sequester to score political points.

“No one can think that that’s been a success for the president,” Romney said. “He didn’t think the sequester would happen. It is happening. To date, what we’ve seen is the president out campaigning to the American people, doing rallies around the country, flying around the country and berating Republicans and blaming and pointing.”

Said Ann Romney, “I totally believe at this moment, if Mitt were there in the office, that we would not be facing sequestration right now.”

When Wallace asked him to critique his campaign, Romney said his failure to sway Hispanic and black voters was “a real weakness.” He said minorities voted Democratic in part because “Obamacare was very attractive, particularly to those without health insurance, and they came out in large numbers to vote.”

Although Stuart Stevens, Romney’s chief campaign strategist, has pushed this health-care argument, it is not a conventional analysis of why Romney lost.

Many analysts believe Romney lost because he became defined as an out-of-touch plutocrat who championed the wealthy over the middle class. For this, Ann Romney blamed the news media.

“People didn’t really get to know Mitt for who he was,” she told Wallace. “It was not just the campaign’s fault. I believe it was the media’s fault as well, that he was not being given a fair shake. . . . I’m happy to blame the media.”

Yet Romney’s strategy had been to keep warmer aspects of his biography, such as his numerous charitable deeds when he volunteered as a church bishop, out of public view. He and his family repeatedly declined interview requests on the subject. Only in the final weeks of the campaign did he talk about this part of his life, but by then it was too late.

Perhaps more than any other factor, Romney’s own words — his commentary to donors dismissing the “47 percent” of Americans who back Obama and feel entitled to government handouts — helped a negative narrative take hold.

“It was a very unfortunate statement that I made,” Romney told Wallace. “It’s not what I meant. I didn’t express myself as I wished I would have. It was very harmful. What I said is not what I believe.”

Asked to look back and rate himself as a presidential candidate, Romney said, “I see my mistakes and I see my flaws.”

“I did better this time than I did the time before,” he continued, referencing his failed 2008 run. “And I won’t get a third chance.”

http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/25/politics/electoral-college/index.html,2013-01-25 00:00:00,['Tom Cohen'],Some GOP-led states look at electoral vote changes,"Story highlights NEW: A spokesman for the Virginia governor says he does not support the proposal GOP state legislatures consider changing how they allocate electoral votes The proposed changes would have hurt President Obama in last year's election A similar push followed the hotly contested 2000 presidential election

If at first you don’t succeed, try to change the rules.

A proposal under consideration in Virginia’s Republican-led state Legislature would change how the commonwealth allocates its 13 electoral votes in the wake of Democratic President Barack Obama’s re-election last November.

Obama won the popular vote in the crucial battleground state to claim all 13 electoral votes, even though GOP challenger Mitt Romney beat him in seven of the 11 congressional districts.

Under the proposed alternative system, electoral votes would get divvied up by congressional districts won. In addition, Virginia’s two other electoral votes – one for each U.S. Senate seat – would go to the candidate who won the most congressional districts.

If the district-based system had been in effect in Virginia last year, Romney would have gotten nine electoral votes to four for Obama.

Jindal urges GOP to stop being ‘stupid’

While a subcommittee has advanced the Virginia proposal, skepticism expressed by some GOP state senators raised doubts that it would proceed any further.

Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, does not support the plan, according to his spokesman.

“He believes Virginia’s existing system works just fine as it is. He does not believe there is any need for a change,” Tucker Martin said in statement.

However, Reince Priebus, newly re-elected chairman of the Republican National Committee, called the idea worth examining.

“I think it is a state issue, but personally I’m pretty intrigued by it,” he told reportersFriday.

Opinion: Where the stupidity really lies

The state party chairman in Florida, Lenny Curry, questioned the wisdom of such a move at a time when the party is trying to broaden its support.

“It seems to me we ought to be focused on connecting with voters and bringing them into our party versus trying to change the game,” Curry said.

To Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst at RealClearPolitics, the concept doesn’t violate democratic principles, but he called it a bad idea.

“Close elections would likely always result in extensive recounts, we could see huge disparities between the popular and electoral vote, and the partisan motive behind it would be transparent,” he wrote Friday on the group’s website.

Currently, only Nebraska and Maine use a district-based plan for allocating electoral votes.

Their systems differ from the Virginia proposal by awarding the two additional electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote, rather than who won the most districts. Last year, both split their electoral votes between Obama and Romney.

Other GOP-controlled state legislatures reportedly contemplating changes to their electoral vote allocation include Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.

Under the Electoral College system, each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population. Winning the presidency requires a majority of the electoral vote, regardless of who wins the popular vote.

States have the power to decide how their electoral votes get allocated, the National Conference of State Legislatures noted on its website.

It cited a similar push for change after the 2000 election, when Democratic Vice President Al Gore won the national popular vote but lost the electoral vote, and therefore the decision, to Republican George W. Bush.

From 2001 to 2006, bills proposing adoption of the district system were introduced in many states, but failed to pass, according to the NCSL website. Both Maine and Nebraska adopted their district-based systems before 2000.

The issue reflects the regionalization of America’s deep partisan divide, with splits in many states between populous urban areas that tend to be more liberal and larger, less populated rural areas that generally are more conservative.

In Virginia, Obama got strong support in two heavily populated northern districts close to Washington as well as a district that includes much of Richmond and Norfolk. Romney won more rural districts in the central, southern and western parts of the state.

Overall in Virginia, Obama got 51% of the total vote – more than 1.97 million – compared to Romney’s 1.82 million for 47% of the total.

The Nov. 8 gala for the International Medical Corps is expected to be attended by several hundred people who are donating as much as $100,000 each to the nonprofit. Hollywood titans and major Democratic fundraisers Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg and their wives are among the hosts of the benefit. Katzenberg is expected to be a key donor for an independent effort that hopes to boost Clinton’s bid for the White House if she decides to run. That entity, Priorities USA, was crucial to President Obama’s campaign.

The group that will benefit from the Beverly Wilshire Hotel event was founded in 1984 to provide humanitarian aid during global crises. It also trains local residents in 30 countries to help their communities. An International Medical Corps official said it is honoring the former secretary of State because of her work on behalf of women and children.

“She’s a longtime advocate for women’s health and women and children refugees,” said Margaret Aguirre, director of global communications, adding that invitations are expected to go out in coming days.

Clinton saw the group’s efforts firsthand in the Congo, and has been an advocate for its mission, she said.

“She’s been a real champion of women’s issues, which is central to what we do,” Aguirre said, citing Clinton’s efforts to increase access to healthcare and education.

The visit will be Clinton’s fourth to California in recent months, as she debates whether to mount a second presidential bid. Since she stepped down from her secretary of State post in February, Clinton’s trips to the Golden State and across the nation have been a mix of awards and paid speeches. In August, she spoke to a business travel group in San Diego and the American Bar Assn. in San Francisco. In May, she accepted an award named after the late Secretary of State Warren Christopher from the Pacific Council on International Policy, also at the Beverly Wilshire.

The Beverly Wilshire holds a bit of history for the Clintons. Mickey Kantor, President Clinton’s former trade representative and Commerce secretary, noted in May as he introduced Hillary Clinton at the Pacific Council gala at the hotel that her husband held a sparsely attended presidential fundraiser in the same ballroom in 1992.

“On that night 21 years ago … we knew Hillary Clinton would be a ground-breaking first lady, but I doubt any of us imagined she would follow in [Christopher’s] footsteps to the State Department,” he said. “And what extraordinary things she would do, tirelessly traveling the globe, patiently working for peace, standing up to the bullies of the world, empowering and inspiring women and girls everywhere.”

“And Hillary continues to be in focus and even the subject of some speculation,” he said to cheers and applause at the pointed reference to her future options.

The November award will take place in the same spot, and will almost certainly be the subject of the same speculation.

Poll No. 1: Rasmussen Reports found that views of the tea party — the wing of Republicanism that dominates party primaries and therefore the congressional Republican caucuses — at a new low. Only 8 percent of likely voters considered themselves tea-party members, down from 24 percent in 2010. According to Rasmussen (which tends to have a pro-Republican bias), unfavorable views of the movement topped favorable views, 49 percent to 30 percent.

Poll No. 2: Fairleigh Dickinson University found that 73 percent of New Jersey voters approved of the job their Republican governor, Chris Christie, is doing — near his all-time high. Even 62 percent of Democrats approve of Christie, as well as 69 percent of racial minorities and 70 percent of women. The top would-be challenger to Christie in November’s gubernatorial election is trailing him by 33 percentage points.

So grim are things for the Democrats in heavily Democratic New Jersey that the state Senate president, Democrat Stephen Sweeney, apologized Monday after saying Christie wished for Hurricane Sandy to hit New Jersey. “I guess he prayed a lot and got lucky because a storm came,” Sweeney had said.

Certainly, the storm — and, more important, Christie’s forceful response — boosted the governor’s standing. But the tea party’s record lows and Christie’s record highs tell a larger story: Americans are crying out for an end to ideological warfare.

That has developed into Christie’s signature in New Jersey. He began his term promising tax cuts and fighting with the teachers union over tenure, pay and education reforms, but he now preaches reconciliation — a recurring theme in his State of the State address Tuesday afternoon.

“Now, we’ve had our fights,” he told state legislators. “We have stuck to our principles. But we have established a governing model for America that shows that, even with heartfelt beliefs, bipartisan compromise is possible. . . . Maybe the folks in Washington, in both parties, could learn something from our record here.”

Christie, his eye on a possible 2016 presidential run, overstates that record, both in terms of economic progress and in terms of partisan cooperation. But his message is undoubtedly a winning one. More than three-quarters of Americans believe that politics in Washington is causing “serious harm to the United States,” according to a new Gallup poll — and they are correct to think so.

Christie lent his powerful voice to that sentiment last week when he condemned as “disgusting” the House Republicans’ decision not to take up a $60 billion Hurricane Sandy recovery bill because tea-party lawmakers considered it wasteful. “That’s why people hate Washington,” Christie said at the time, helping to force House Speaker John Boehner to reconsider.

It was just the latest of Christie’s many breaks with tea-party orthodoxy. Just before the election, his effusive praise of President Obama’s “outstanding” response to Sandy earned him condemnation from Rush Limbaugh and Rupert Murdoch.

He unnerved fiscal conservatives by saying that the hurricane recovery would probably require higher taxes, because “there’s no magic money tree.” He came out against the National Rifle Association’s plan to have gun-wielding guards in schools, saying, “You don’t want to make this an armed camp for kids.”

Earlier, after conservatives criticized his appointment of a Muslim judge, he took on these “bigots” for their “gaze of intolerance.” And on immigration, he called for an “orderly process” to legalize immigrants and he criticized those who “demagogue.”

Caption Piles of debris, damaged homes and flooded streets remain in the wake of the storm. Nov. 3, 2012 New Jersey state troopers keep order as motorists line up to purchase gasoline at the Thomas A. Edison service area on the New Jersey Turnpike near Woodbridge, N.J. Lines were long at some gas stations with motorists trying to make purchases before a noon switch to a gas-rationing system ordered by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R). Drivers with license plates ending in an even number will be allowed to buy gas on even-numbered days, and those with plates ending in an odd number can make gas purchases on odd-numbered days. Mel Evans/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Certainly, Christie is no liberal, but his State of the State speech was full of policy prescriptions that conservatives might label big government: “We’ve requested the federal government to pay 100 percent of the costs of the significant debris removal. . . . We have secured $20 million from the Federal Highway Administration. . . . We have worked with the Small Business Administration to secure nearly $189 million in loans.”

Christie also bragged about “implementing the toughest fertilizer law in America,” fighting insurers’ “excessive deductibles” and “investing the largest amount of state aid to education in New Jersey history.” He said “both Republicans and Democrats” would make sure the state got its full federal payout for the storm.

“You see,” he told the legislators, “some things are above politics.”

University enrollments have shown tremendous growth in the state

Young Virginia voters supported Dole over Clinton in 1996 but have gone heavily for Obama

In the gubernatorial race%2C Democrats face challenge of getting these voters to the polls

FAIRFAX, Va. — As an ugly gubernatorial race grinds to conclusion in Virginia, Republicans in the commonwealth face a growing demographic problem: young people.

Young voters in Virginia are a growing chunk of the state's electorate, and as a group, their politics have shifted dramatically in favor of Democrats over the past 15 years.

The question facing Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Ken Cuccinelli is whether they will show up at the polls in big enough numbers to matter next week.

Both campaigns are playing to their slice of the youth vote: McAuliffe campaigned with former president Bill Clinton in college towns across Virginia this week, including Blacksburg (Virginia Tech), Charlottesville (University of Virginia) and Harrisonburg (James Madison University). Cuccinelli appeared at Lynchburg's evangelical Liberty University — the fastest-growing school in the state — with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. on Monday.

In 1996, voters age 18-29 made up 15% of the state's presidential vote, and they voted for Republican Bob Dole over Bill Clinton, 49%-42%, bucking the national trend. That year, 53% of young people nationwide voted for Clinton, according to exit polls.

By 2012, the under-30 crowd had grown to 19% of the state's voters and their politics had shifted. They voted 61% for President Obama's re-election, 1 point higher than the national total for their peers.

""For young people age 18-29 there has been a dramatic shift in the voting and party identification,"" said Peter Levine, director of CIRCLE, a Tufts University research center on youth voting and civic engagement. ""Young people are dramatically more liberal in Virginia than they were in '96.""

In 2012, there were 1,162,000 citizens age 18-29 eligible to vote in Virginia, up from 979,000 in 1996 – a jump of nearly 20%. Part of this growth is reflected in significant increases in higher education enrollments in the state, which also tends to be a heavily Democratic constituency. The significant exception is Liberty, which went from 7,700 students in 1996 to 74,000 last fall, but only about 12,600 of these students are residential — most of the rest take classes online.

Overall, the ""fall headcount"" at Virginia colleges and universities grew from just under 342,000 in 1996 to just under 540,000 last year, according to data collected by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.

Tod Massa, the council's director of policy research, said a recent study by the state predicted the total undergraduate enrollment would increase 9.6% though this decade. And student body expansion also means increases in staff, faculty, services and the economic footprint of the institution.

Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said the state is trending toward becoming reliably Democratic in statewide campaigns in part because of the academic presence. ""This is a state with a remarkably large number of college communities (that) are heavily Democratic and major employment magnets.""

Virginia overall has grown by more than a million people over the past decade. According to the Census Bureau, Virginia's population was 7 million in 2000 and about 8.2 million in 2012.

Craig Brians, a political science professor at Virginia Tech, said, ""those million people are not a random sampling of people — those are folks who are younger, more educated and they are more likely to be Democratic."" But he noted that young voters ""only vote at a 40-50% rate.""

For Democrats, the issue becomes getting the young voters to the polls, which is much easier during a presidential race than an off-year gubernatorial election.

But the state may be helping.

Fairfax County added a new polling precinct on the campus of George Mason University in 2011 to accommodate the university's dramatic expansion. Once a sleepy commuter college with no on-campus housing, the school now has 6,000 beds and a total headcount of around 33,000.

Fairfax County election manager Judy Flaig said the first year the polling place opened, ""there was a lot of publicity and we had maybe 1,800 or so"" students registered. Now there are ""about 3,000 students registered at that polling place"" and the county is anticipating about half of those will turn out to vote Nov. 5.

Tom Kramer, the executive director of Virginia21, a non-partisan non-profit that encourages student engagement in public policy, said that on campuses and college communities around the state, ""Voter registration is notably higher in 2013 than it was in 2009,"" which suggests that ""youth turnout in 2013 will be higher than it was in 2009.""

Mohammad Ahmad, a George Mason freshman who will turn 18 and vote in his first election this year, said he thinks students will vote in strong numbers. ""People are more interested in government now because of the shutdown,"" he said. Ahmad noted that many students have families in the area whose employment was directly affected by the battle over federal spending.

George Mason student Miranda Haynie, 18, agreed, ""I definitely noticed that,"" she said. ""Just in class – we had discussions about the shutdown, and it was all over the Internet."" Both Haynie and Ahmad say they plan to vote for McAuliffe.

Polls have shown McAuliffe, a businessman and Democratic fundraiser, has a consistent lead over Republican Attorney General Cuccinelli in a race that has been unrelentingly negative. Democrats have hammered Cuccinelli for accepting improper benefits in a scandal that has engulfed GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell and for his advocacy of strict anti-abortion legislation. Republicans have attacked McAuliffe for a series of questionable business deals, including an investment with a Rhode Island estate planner who has been charged with stealing the identities of terminally ill patients.

Cantor says there will be ""discussions on both sides"" ""We want to move quickly,"" a House Republican says

(CNN) —

Progress.

It’s been seemingly nonexistent in Washington for weeks, as Republicans and Democrats squabbled about funding the government and whether to raise its borrowing limit. Both sides drew their lines in the sand and talked vociferously at each other, but not to each other.

On Thursday, 10 days into the government’s partial shutdown, the tide appeared to turn. House Republicans offered a plan to temporarily stave off the threat of a first-ever U.S. debt default. President Barack Obama listened to them. Both sides agreed to keep on talking.

Said Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican: “We’re all working together now.”

Sessions spoke early Thursday evening after he and fellow House Republicans talked with Obama at the White House.

Afterward, the Obama administration described the session as “good” – saying the President listened to Republican proposals and the two sides discussed “potential paths forward.”

And House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called it “very useful.”

“We’re going to have more discussions on both sides tonight,” the Virginia Republican said.

The fact the two sides are talking, though, doesn’t mean they have agreed to anything yet.

After all, they have been bitterly divided on party lines for weeks, routinely throwing barbs but rarely trading proposals.

House Republicans initially passed a series of measures tying government funding to defunding or dismantling Obamacare, the president’s signature health care reform. And they’ve insisted that they won’t increase the nation’s borrowing limit without cuts first.

Obama, meanwhile, has been just as firm in his position: Pass “clean” – meaning no add-ons or qualifications – bills to fund the government and raise the debt limit, and only then will we talk.

One big deadline passed without an agreement – October 1, when the partial shutdown began no funding had been authorized to keep the government running.

And there seemed little movement toward addressing the next one – October 17, when the Treasury Department has said the government will run out of money to pay its bills unless something is done.

Now a plan from House Republicans to temporarily boost the nation’s borrowing limit and start talks about reopening the government shifted the dynamic.

What it didn’t do was meet Democrats’ demand to fund the government right away. Asked after attending a White House meeting of his own Thursday with the President about the prospect of the debt limit lifting while the government stays partially closed, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid didn’t mince words: “It’s not going to happen.”

Obama made clear, during his session with House Republicans, that he won’t give concessions to reopen the government, according to a Democratic source familiar with the meeting.

Yet no less than White House spokesman Jay Carney cheered the movement, saying Obama was “happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House” over the need to avoid a possible default.

Will 2014 election solve anything?

Deep into Thursday night, these heads were getting together to try to find a resolution. The White House hopes these initial staff-level discussions will let it know exactly what Republicans want, the Democratic source said.

Rep. Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said both sides are talking “in good faith” about not just the debt ceiling, but what it will take to restart the government.

“There was not a timeline set,” said Rogers. “But we want to move quickly.”

Anti-Obamacare provisions no longer in GOP plans

Optimism in Washington triggered relief on Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest one-day gain of the year at 323 points. Investors have been nervous over the political stalemate and the possibility of a debt default and its potential economic consequences.

This came a day after Obama said in a separate meeting with House Democrats that he would consider a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN.

“If that’s what (House Speaker John) Boehner needs to climb out of the tree that he’s stuck in, then that’s something we should look at,” according to the lawmaker, who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Some congressional Democrats have balked at the outline of the GOP offer, saying the government must reopen and the debt ceiling must be increased to get broader talks going.

“One way or another both of those have to happen,” said veteran Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan.

Another Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said Obama “needs to press for the opening of the government.”

“Without a doubt the default would be much more catastrophic, but I’ve got constituents, a lot of whom work for the federal government who are going through catastrophes every hour,” Cummings said.

Paul Ryan steps into budget fight

One thing any budget resolution won’t include, it appears, is provisions targeting the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Ryan, who was the Republican party’s vice presidential nominee last year, didn’t mention Obamacare in a Wall Street Journal op-ed – saying instead that politicians from both parties should focus on “modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.”

As others have done in recent days, GOP Rep. James Lankford of Oklahoma told CNN on Thursday that going after the President’s signature health reform is “currently off the table.”

Yet Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas – one of the most vocal Republicans in the debate – wasn’t so ready to let the health care issue go. Speaking Thursday on CNN’s “Crossfire,” he said “Democrats in this town do not want to discuss Obamacare.”

On Obama’s signature health care reform and what’s happening in Washington generally, Cruz said that it’s House Republicans who “are listening to the millions of Americans” to do what’s best for them.

According to a GOP source, it’s not certain whether Boehner can gain support from some or most of his GOP caucus to support a plan without anything to do with Obamacare or other concessions. That could mean – if a proposal like the one floated Thursday proceeds – the Speaker may need Democratic votes to pass it.

Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase

Failure to raise the debt ceiling by next week’s deadline would leave the government unable to borrow money to pay its bills for the first time in its history. And absent a breakthrough, the shutdown would continue at a cost estimated at up to $50 billion a month.

All of it is taking a toll on Washington’s reputation: A national CNN/ORC International survey released Monday indicated that Americans were blaming all parties in the fight, though Republicans got the worst of it.

Republicans won big in the 2010 midterm election, taking control of the House and numerous state legislatures. That victory corresponded with a significant increase in the percentage of Americans calling themselves conservative, particularly on economic issues. Since then, however, the percentage has steadily declined, according to an annual “values and beliefs” survey conducted by Gallup.

The latest version shows a further drop, with 41% of Americans calling themselves economic conservatives, down from just over 50% at the 2010 peak. On social issues, the share identifying as conservatives has dropped slightly and is now just more than 1 in 3.

On social issues, the big gain has come among those who call themselves liberals, whose ranks have increased from 22% of adults in 2010 to 30% now. On economic issues, gains have mostly come among those calling themselves moderates, with the percentage of liberals holding relatively steady.

For Republicans, the trend poses a challenge. The party depends heavily on self-identified conservatives for votes, even as their ranks have become scarcer.

Just more than a quarter of American adults (26%) now identify as conservatives on both economic and social issues. But that relatively small group makes up almost two-thirds (63%) of those who identify themselves as Republicans or independents who say they lean Republican, the Gallup data show.

Conservatives can take heart that they still outnumber self-identified liberals – 1 in 8 adults (13%) called themselves liberal on both economic and social questions. But Democrats don’t depend on liberals as exclusively as Republicans depend on conservatives. Consistent liberals make up only a bit more than a quarter of those who identify themselves as Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democrats.

None of those numbers necessarily forecasts an election result. Republicans won big in 2010 in part because more Americans considered themselves conservative, but also because more of them showed up to vote. That’s where the current Washington controversies over the IRS, the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya last year and other issues could have an effect. Republican strategists hope those issues will arouse their voters and spur them to the polls while dispiriting Democrats.

Over the longer term, however, Republicans clearly face a problem that will require either changing voters’ minds or shifting their party’s identity if it is to keep winning. Changing voters’ minds can happen – after all, the percentage of Americans who call themselves conservative did go up after Barack Obama’s first election as president, so presumably, it could go up again. But that would require swimming against a fairly strong tide, which shows up clearly in an analysis of different age groups that Gallup did for the Los Angeles Times.

Among adults 65 and older, those identifying themselves as conservative hit 43% on social issues and 47% on economic ones.

Advertisement

But among those younger than 30, the corresponding figures were 31% and 32%.

Among adults 18 to 29, those who call themselves liberals on social issues form a larger group (41%) than either social conservatives (31%) or social moderates (37%).

Advertisement

And among those in the next older age group, those in their 30s and 40s, liberals, moderates and conservatives on social issues make up about equal shares. The pattern is not quite as sharp on economic issues, but there too the results show a noticeable break around age 50 in the ideological labels people choose, with those who are younger significantly more likely to call themselves liberal.

On social issues, although not on economic ones, education levels matter a lot. Those with college degrees or higher call themselves liberal on social issues at a much higher rate than those without. In recent elections, Democrats have gained heavily among college-educated voters, and the percentage of Americans who go to college and earn a degree has been on a long-term increase.

These results should mostly not be affected by the well-publicized problems that befell Gallup during the last election, in which its results skewed significantly toward Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Some of those problems had to do with how Gallup forecast who would show up to vote. Many of those problems, which Gallup has tried to fix, would not affect these numbers, which come from a survey of all American adults, not just likely voters. The survey, conducted May 2-7, interviewed 1,535 adults, age 18 and older. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

http://news.yahoo.com/trio-troubles-threatening-obamas-second-term-211559462.html,,[],Trio of troubles threatening Obama's second term,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama seemed to lose control of his second-term agenda even before he was sworn in, when a school massacre led him to lift gun control to the fore. Now, as he tries to pivot from a stinging defeat on that issue and push forward on others, the president finds himself rocked by multiple controversies that are demoralizing his allies, emboldening his political foes and posing huge distractions for all.

It's unclear how long he will be dogged by inquiries into last year's deadly attack in Libya, the IRS targeting of tea party groups and now the seizure of Associated Press phone records in a leak investigation. But if nothing else, these episodes give new confidence and swagger to Republicans who were discouraged by Obama's re-election and their inability to block tax hikes as part of the Jan. 1 ""fiscal cliff"" deal.

Taken together, these matters will make it harder for the administration to focus on its priorities - racking up a few more accomplishments before next year's national elections.

""It's a torrential downpour, and it's happening at the worst possible time, because the window is closing"" on opportunities to accomplish things before the 2014 campaigns, said Matt Bennett, who worked in the Clinton White House. From here on, he said, ""it's going to be very, very difficult.""

So far, there's no evidence that Obama knew about - let alone was involved in - the government actions in question. But a president usually is held accountable for his administration's actions, and Republicans now have material to fuel accusations and congressional hearings that they hope will embarrass him, erode his credibility and bolster their argument that his government is overreaching. Even some of his Democratic allies are publicly expressing dismay at the AP phone records seizure.

Obama advisers on Tuesday cast the trio of controversies as matters that flare up in an institution as complex as the U.S. government, and they questioned the impact of them. The one exception, advisers said, was the brewing scandal at the Internal Revenue Service, which they see as the issue most likely to strike a chord with Americans.

Story continues

The IRS has apologized for what it calls ""inappropriate"" targeting of conservative political groups, including tea party affiliates, that were seeking tax-exempt status in recent years. A Treasury Department inspector general's report released Tuesday concluded that ineffective management led to the targeting, and Attorney General Eric Holder said he had ordered a Justice Department investigation.

But he distanced himself from the decision to subpoena the AP records, saying he'd had no part in it, stepping aside because he had been interviewed in a government investigation into who provided information for a news story that disclosed details of a CIA operation in Yemen.

The press case sparked bipartisan outcry, with several GOP and Democratic officials questioning Holder's department's actions in the matter. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the attorney general should resign over the issue, adding: ""Freedom of the press is an essential right in a free society.""

Connecticut Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, both Democrats, called on the Justice Department to explain the records seizure. And Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the House's second-ranking Democratic leader, said, ""This is activity that should not have happened and must be checked from happening again.""

As the press and IRS issues boiled over Tuesday, many conservative activists stayed focused on the attack last September in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Republicans have spent the past eight months accusing the Obama administration of ignoring security needs before the attack, and of revising subsequent ""talking points"" to play down the role of Islamic terrorists in the assault, which occurred at the height of Obama's re-election campaign.

Hillary Rodham Clinton — the secretary of state at the time, and a possible presidential candidate in 2016 — is the target of many GOP accusations.

Despite the noisy controversies, White House advisers tamped down suggestions that Obama would make any sudden moves, such as firing top officials or shaking up his team. In a Tuesday night statement on the inspector general's IRS report, Obama said he expected those responsible to be held ""accountable"" though he did not specify what that should entail.

On all three matters, the White House Tuesday steered blame to other administration agencies. The disputed Benghazi talking points, advisers said, were chiefly the CIA's work. In discussing the IRS controversy, the White House has emphasized the agency's independent status.. And Obama's spokesman has deflected all questions about AP phone records to the Justice Department, saying that the president and his aides didn't know about the case until they read press reports Monday.

Asked why Obama couldn't simply ask the attorney general about the Justice Department subpoenas, Carney said, ""A great deal prevents the president from doing that. It would be wholly inappropriate for the president to involve himself in a criminal investigation that ... involves leaks of information from the administration.""

The White House also tried to change the narrative on Benghazi. Carney accused congressional Republicans of giving a misleading description of an email from top Obama aide Ben Rhodes in order to make it look like the White House was supportive of efforts to downplay the prospect that the Benghazi attack was an act of terror.

""They decided to fabricate portions of an email and make up portions of an email in order to fit a political narrative,"" Carney said.

White House officials said Obama plans to press his second-term agenda as planned, but the contentious issues are complicating that effort. Amid new revelations about Benghazi and the IRS, Obama's attempts last Friday to highlight the implementation of key components of the health care law - his first term's signature accomplishment - were largely ignored.

Republican consultant John Feehery says the IRS and Benghazi controversies undercut the president's argument for increasing the government's role in health care and almost everything else. They undermine the notion, he said, ""that government is trustworthy and can fix problems.""

However, the biggest item now before Congress - whether to rewrite the nation's immigration laws and provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of people here illegally - may be barely touched by the hubbub. Many Republican leaders say the GOP must embrace immigration revisions to improve the party's weak standing with Hispanic voters, a fast-growing constituency. Denying Obama a victory on immigration, they say, could do even more damage to Republicans.

On other issues, including the never-ending partisan dispute over deficit spending, the White House's preoccupation with potential scandals may give Republicans a greater sense of confidence and support.

The claim of an IRS bias against conservative groups is what worries Democrats like Bennett most. The White House counsel's office was alerted about the inspector general investigation into the IRS on April 22, but did not inform the president, officials said.

Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist, said Republicans will try to use investigations into the IRS actions, Benghazi and possibly the AP phone records ""to run out the clock on the president's second term.""

""The political risk of running endless congressional investigations is relatively minimal compared to the risk of opposing immigration reform, gun control and some of the other issues that have broad bipartisan support,"" McMahon said.

There's rarely unanimity in any town, but in Newtown, on this...

EJ Dionne:

The real danger for Obama is that the coming months could become a summer of discontent if those who currently back the president lose track of where he wants to lead the country and abandon hope in Washington’s capacity to make things better. Already, there is a feeling of demobilization on the progressive side of politics. The liberal writer Paul Waldman captured the problem recently with this question on the American Prospect’s Web site: “What is the grand battle in which liberals are now engaged?” His response: “For the first time in a decade, there isn’t one.” While the next three years could well be “decisive for the liberal project,” he wrote, “it doesn’t feel that urgent to liberals.”

I dissent. Neither gun legislation nor immigration reform has passed yet. And the SCOTUS is key to everything, with aging Justices to be replaced.

David ignatius:

For an Obama administration that is struggling to find its voice in the second term, Rice’s elevation should be helpful. She will give the White House a compelling new focal point on foreign policy. People may not always agree with her, but they’ll know what she thinks. And perhaps she will galvanize sharper policy thinking from Obama himself, especially on Syria. But the Rice nomination brings some obvious risks: She is not a quiet inside player in the tradition of Brent Scowcroft, who was Donilon’s role model as national security adviser. She’s more in the tradition of extroverted policy intellectuals such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger, who used the media and other channels to shape events.

Because it's all about personality (and how well you get along with the press.)

NY Times:

Mr. Obama made no secret of how upset he was when he passed over Ms. Rice for secretary of state last winter amid a furor about the handling of the deadly attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya. But ever since, he has been choosing appointees and nominees he knew would provoke fights with Republicans, almost as if trying to redeem the moment. The unapologetic selections reflect a conclusion in the West Wing that when it comes to choosing personnel, the president can never satisfy Republicans who will find almost anyone objectionable. But his choices also highlight the complicated second-term balancing act for a president unconstrained by re-election concerns and therefore freer to challenge Congress, yet still hoping to forge deals by courting the opposition with dinners and White House meetings.

The West Wing is correct. And (message to the press) if life is complicated, don't oversimplify."

— Reversed a $2.2 billion deficit and brought it into balance without raising taxes, largely by reduced spending and eliminating wasteful and unaffordable programs, allowing for a projected fiscal 2014 budget surplus of $300 million.

— Bipartisan pension and benefits reforms, saving the state $120 billion over 30 years.

— Streamlining government by eliminating 5,200 government jobs.

— Vetoing tax increase bills three times while cutting taxes for job creators.

More On This...

— Reforming the nation’s oldest teacher tenure law by making it conditional on teacher performance in the classroom.

— Reduced property tax increases to a 21-year low and capped them at a maximum 2 percent.

There’s more, but shouldn’t conservative Republicans be ecstatic by this record compiled by New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie?

[pullquote]

Not the folks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), which decided not to invite one of the party’s superstars to its annual gathering in Washington. Apparently, the reason had to do with Christie upsetting conservative orthodoxy by saying something nice about President Obama for approving emergency aid to distressed New Jerseyans affected by Super Storm Sandy.

I’m all for orthodoxy, which some call principle. I am orthodox in many things, but in politics, compromise in the pursuit of ultimate goals does not necessarily make one a compromiser.

Gov. Chris Christie is no liberal. He is proving his ideas work, which is why, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he has a 74 percent approval rating in one of the bluest states in the country.

Most politicians would, as they say, “kill” for a number like that, but instead CPAC organizers “killed” Christie from their list of speakers.

Conservative Republicans have a unique opportunity to present a positive, forward-looking and reform-minded agenda at a time when most voters’ approval of government is scraping rock bottom. Americans are aware of the current dysfunction in Washington and may be ready for a creative message if Republicans could show them how a 21st-century model would mutually benefit themselves and the nation.

Former George W. Bush aide Peter Wehner offers some suggestions in a Time magazine essay:

“First, Republicans should make front-and-center their plans to reform public institutions that were designed for the needs of the mid-20th century. Our health-care and entitlement system, tax code, schools, immigration policies and regulatory regime are outdated, breaking down, and creating substantial wreckage. If I had to boil it down to a single sentence, I’d urge the GOP to develop its reputation as the party of reform and modernization. Second, Republican leaders at every level need to conduct themselves in a manner that not just reassures voters but appeals to them. As former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels has put it, ‘as we ask Americans to join us on such a boldly different course, it would help if they liked us, just a bit.’ … Third, Republicans must resist the temptation of defeatism, enervation, and turning against the country. It is entirely within the power of the GOP to both remain principled and appeal to a majority of Americans. An intellectually self-confident party would, in fact, be energized by a challenge of this scale.”

Read this line again: “It is entirely within the power of the GOP to both remain principled and appeal to a majority of Americans.”

A bold agenda that does these things reflects Gov. Christie’s record in New Jersey. By not inviting him to speak, CPAC invites comparison with a pessimistic and hypercritical political environment of the past. If the Republican “tent” isn’t large enough for Chris Christie, then it will resemble a pup tent for some time to come.

Judd gave a speech on public health, followed by an audience question and answer session, at George Washington University’s School of Public Health and Health Services in the Foggy Bottom area of Washington, D.C. The event was Judd’s first real political trial balloon ahead of a rumored 2014 Democratic U.S. Senate bid in Kentucky – and she flopped.

During her speech, Judd described her initial decision to enter the Hollywood acting world over the activism world.

“I went to the other jungle: Hollywood,” Judd said to the audience of about 150 students. “There, I had instantaneous success much to my own – what would the word be? – I wouldn’t even say surprise because I didn’t even know it was success until I looked back on it last year. It just all happened so very fast.”

“I remember when I was going [to Hollywood], I was talking to a family friend, and I was still frightened,” Judd continued. “Amazingly, I was raised with someone who has the greatest voice of her generation in our own home yet I didn’t have a lot of stage education. I didn’t know what it meant to be an actor. So, I was scared. I was nervous. I was talking to this family friend and said, ‘you know, I’m still going to do a lot of service, I’m still going to help advocate that women need access to medically accurate sex education and have access to a full basket of family planning choices that are right for them.’ I went on to list the other things I was going to do and he said, ‘do you want to be an actor or do you want to save the world?'”

“In 2002, I was really sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Judd added. “I didn’t know what was wrong. I knew that I was just – something wasn’t quite right. At that time, it turns out, and I didn’t even know this, I was one of the highest paid women in the history of Hollywood.”

After admitting she is a card carrying member of the “One Percent,” the Americans Democrats routinely demonize, Judd went on to flub comment after comment throughout the rest of the event.

When she was describing how she “got sick and tired of my own pity for myself,” Judd struggled to pronounce the word “periphery” correctly.

Judd then name-dropped Bono.

“That very same day I got a call from Bono,” Judd said of the day an AIDS group asked her to help push their message. “No talk is ever complete without talking about Bono.”

“He’s amazing,” Judd said of Bono. “He’s the real deal.”

The actress went to explain how she determined “why women and girls end up in brothels,” telling the student audience that “baseline” it was “gender inequality.”

When Judd opened the floor up for questions, her struggles intensified. When asked by the dean of the college if she had advice for the community, Judd let the place know how wonderfully she thought of herself. “You know have no idea how much advice I have,” she said.

“I can’t wait to hear from the College Republicans,” Judd joked at another point, before any students asked her a question.

The first student questioner, a young woman who made sure to point out she was a Democrat, asked Judd to define “feminism.” Judd tackled it the best she could, after noting how “it’s really very simple.”

“We could spend the rest of the day talking about this,” Judd said. “We were all made in the image and likeness of our Creator. We’re all sacred, and we’re here to love each other and be equal. It’s very simple.”

As a second young woman wrapped up her question of Judd, the actress stopped paying attention. “Huh, I’m sorry, I was giving my mother eye kisses,” Judd said. Judd’s mother, Naomi Judd, was in the audience.

The dean was forced to re-ask the young woman’s question so Judd could answer it.

When asked about what role “faith” plays in her initiatives, Judd said “I’m just a surrogate for the people doing the grassroots work.”

“What I had to do was find a faith that would work for me under all causes and conditions,” Judd said. “In forcibly displaced persons camps, in child abuse children, in emergency rooms, in a brothel, in a labor slave camp, in an orphanage. You know how hard it is to walk out of an orphanage? My hands tingle. You feel the weight of the babies coming up behind.”

“Or to sit in a slum and see two sisters who are orphaned ask me to bring them home to America, because America is the place where dreams come true? Later I found out they rehearsed it because they so wanted to come home to America with me. That’s a depth for me, a spiritual depth.”

Another student asked her about garbage initiatives around the world. The student said she worked in India for a little while recently, and “the amount of garbage … I just could not get over it.”

“My question is how to we get anyone to care about their health when the first thing they probably need to care about is the dump of trash in front of their house or their slum, and that they don’t have running water?” the student asked Judd. “To me, that seems like the base…. I’m just wondering from what you’ve seen in your travels what your thoughts are on that.”

Judd used a homespun saying in her tortured response.

“My thought is that you found your pig,” Judd responded. “You should stick with your pig. What I mean by ‘pig’ is we all have to find the thing that makes us mad and the thing that gives us the fire in the belly and the passion and the stamina to stick with it. The ‘pig thing’ comes another good Eastern Kentuckian, my godmother. It was heavy-handed in my face.”

In trying to further explain the “pig” reference, Judd said “it became a slogan for this is ‘my thing.'”

“It sounds like garbage has become your thing,” Judd told the student questioner. “Go with it. And I agree with you about the garbage.'”"
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/27/obama-publicly-thanks-clinton-in-60-minutes-interview/,2013-01-27 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Obama publicly thanks Clinton in '60 Minutes' interview,"8 years ago

(CNN) - President Barack Obama said Hillary Clinton will go down ""as one of the finest secretaries of state"" as he sat next to her in their first joint interview Sunday night on CBS's ""60 Minutes.""

""The main thing is I just wanted to have a chance to publicly say 'thank you,'"" he said when asked why he wanted to do the interview with his former political foe.



""It has been a great collaboration over the last four years,"" he continued. ""I'm going to miss her, wish she was sticking around, but she has logged in so many miles I can't begrudge her wanting to take it easy for a little bit.""

Nearly 1 million miles and 112 countries, in fact, she said Wednesday when she appeared before congressional committees to testify about last year's attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

Now, Clinton is set to depart the world stage - at least for now, as she has been floated as a presidential contender in 2016. She appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week in support of Sen. John Kerry, the man Obama tapped to replace her.

While Clinton has talked about the wear and tear of the job and recently had a health scare, she said in the ""60 Minutes"" interview that she found working with Obama and serving as her nation's top diplomat extremely satisfying.

""This has been just an extraordinary opportunity to work with him as a partner and friend and to do our very best,"" she said. ""It's something that I'm going to miss a great deal.""

While Clinton and Obama competed bitterly in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, the two have been highly complimentary of each other during the president's first term. In the interview that aired Sunday, Clinton said such a public sit-down would have been ""improbable"" a few years ago because ""we had that very long, hard primary campaign.""

""But, you know, I've gone around the world on behalf of the president and our country, and one of the things that I say to people - because I think it helps them understand - I say, look, in politics and in democracy, sometimes you win elections and sometimes you lose elections. And I worked very hard, but I lost. And then President Obama asked me to be secretary of state, and I said yes. And why did he ask me, and why did I say yes? Because we both love our country.""

Not only has Hillary Clinton played a big role in Obama's first four years of office, but her husband and former President Bill Clinton also was a crucial part of Obama's re-election bid last year. The 42nd president appeared on the stump for Obama in key swing states and had a prime-time speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention.

While admitting that their respective staffs may have had a difficult time getting over rancor from the 2008 primary, Obama said that it was not as hard for him.

The president said that even before they both ran for president, he had admired Clinton's ""discipline, her thoughtfulness, her ability to project and make issues that were clear."" Those attributes, as well as her standing as ""already a world figure,"" made her a smart choice for secretary of state - even if she didn't initially jump at the opportunity.

""We're both gluttons for punishment,"" she said jokingly of her decision to take the job despite numerous global challenges and the president having his hands full dealing with an economic crisis at home.

Obama said he had always respected Clinton and knew she would excel, but what changed over the years is that they became ""strong"" friends.

It was a sentiment echoed by Clinton, who described her relationship with her boss as ""very warm, close.""

""I think there's a sense of understanding that sometimes doesn't even take words,"" she said.

As a former popular first lady, U.S. senator and now secretary of state, experts say Clinton is well-positioned to be the Democratic frontrunner if she seeks a White House bid in 2016. But presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said much of her decision will largely depend on her health.

""She needs rest. She's exhausted,"" he said Sunday on CNN's Newsroom. Clinton returned to work earlier this month after being treated for illness, a concussion and blood clot near her brain. ""She needs to work on a memoir, she'll probably give speeches. At that point, in about 18 months or two years, they have a big decision to make.""

Brinkley described her as ""somebody who does not lack ambition"" and will be highly influenced by the ""ability to break the glass ceiling and be the first female president.""

""The question is whether she's up for the exhaustion of going to the Iowa caucus, in New Hampshire, in South Carolina and having (Monica) Lewinsky and other issues from the '90s come back and haunt her in some ways,"" Brinkley said. ""Does she have that fight in her?""

Decision could affect standing of other Obama appointees

Case could ultimately wind up in the Supreme Court

The president has maintained that the appointments were legal because the Senate was on vacation

A federal appeals court said Friday that President Obama overstepped his authority with a series of recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board.

The case may wind up in the Supreme Court and determine how far the president can go in appointing people whose nominations would otherwise be blocked by the Senate.

The result could affect the standing of other Obama recess appointees, such as the head of the president's new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray.

White House press secretary Jay Carney said the administration ""respectfully but strongly"" disagrees with the court's ruling, arguing that it ran counter to precedents dating back 150 years.

The Justice Department also criticized the court's decision. ""We disagree with the court's ruling and believe that the President's recess appointments are constitutionally sound,"" a department spokesperson said.

Administration officials indicated they would appeal the decision, and predicted they would win similar cases pending before other judges.

""This is one case in one court,"" said Carney.

In legal briefs, Obama said his recess appointments were legal because the Senate was on vacation at the time. The president has authority to make temporary appointments without Senate approval if the Senate is not in session.

But Republican senators who joined in a lawsuit said the chamber stayed in a ""pro forma"" session during the time in question, denying Obama the right to make recess appointments — and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with them. In these ""pro forma"" sessions, a senator would gavel an empty chamber to order every few days and then recess again.

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said today's decision ""will go a long way toward restoring the constitutional separation of powers,"" while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the decision ""reaffirmed that the Constitution is not an inconvenience but the law of the land.""

Senate Republicans had blocked Obama's appointees to the National Labor Relations Board, calling them too pro-union.

It's not known whether the Supreme Court will step into this White House-Congress dispute.

As it stands now, the decision invalidates hundreds of decisions made over the past year by the National Labor Relations Board.

Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Foundation, released a statement calling the court's decision ""a victory for independent-minded workers.""



On Jan. 4, 2012 — the same day he appointed Cordray — Obama appointed Deputy Labor Secretary Sharon Block, union lawyer Richard Griffin and NLRB counsel Terence Flynn to fill vacancies on labor relations board — those are the appointments in question.

The Cordray appointment is still under challenge in a separate case pending before the appeals court.

C. Boyden Gray, a former White House counsel to President George H. W. Bush, said in a statement that one key takeaway from today's decision is that the president ""has no power to declare when a recess exists"" as he said Obama did with the appointment of Cordray and the NLRB board members.

The scheme involves six states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida, all of which voted for President Obama in 2012 but have Republican-controlled state legislatures and governorships, proposing and enacting state laws changing the way it allocates its electoral votes from the ""winner-take-all"" system, in which the Presidential ticket that receives the most number of votes in any state that allocates its electoral votes that way win's all of that state's electoral votes, to a ""closed party list"" system, in which electoral votes are allocated roughly in proportion to the percentage of the vote that each presidential ticket receives in any state that implements such a scheme.

Here's how Nichols described this latest GOP-backed scheme:



Priebus initially talked up the idea of to having Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania abandon the current model of assigning electoral votes to the winner of the state and instead implement a model where the allotment would be based on the winners of congressional districts. That plan, which would have allowed the loser of the popular vote in many states to ""win"" most of the electoral votes, was such a blatant rip-off that shamed Republicans in Virginia, Florida, Wisconsin and other states abandoned it. But they did not abandon the basic premise laid out by Priebus -- that states that are ""controlled red"" by the Republicans should game the rules so that they are less ""consistently blue"" in presidential politics. They've just shifted strategy. Under the plan now being entertained by Pennsylvania Republicans, electoral votes would be distributed based on the percentage of the vote received by the contenders. Had the plan been in place in 2012, President Obama, who won 52 percent of the Pennsylvania popular vote, would have gotten 11 or 12 electoral votes, while Republican Mitt Romney would have gotten 8 or 9. That looks like a more reasonable result than under the plan for allocating by congressional district results, which would have given Romney most of Pennsylvania's electoral votes despite Obama's popular vote win. But here's where things get tricky. If Pennsylvania and other swing states that tend to back Democrats move to the proportional model, while big states such as Texas and Georgia that have been voting Republican stick with a winner-take-all plan, they will lock in a national advantage for the Republicans. The Pennsylvania initiative may not be quite as ""sweet"" for Republicans as the initial Priebus plan. But if states that vote Democratic assign substantial numbers of their electoral votes to the Republican loser, while states that vote Republican make no such concession, it will be a lot easier to chart a course where a Republican nominee who is trounced in the national popular vote might still ""win"" the electoral vote and the presidency.

Republican Pennsylvania State Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi says that he will introduce legislation that would change the way Pennsylvania's electoral votes are allocated from the winner-take-all system to the proportional system.

Once again, Republicans are plotting to steal the 2016 presidential election. Let's hold them accountable another time!"

A civil rights veteran struggles ""to keep from crying"" as Obama takes oath on MLK Bible

It was a seemingly wistful moment at the halfway mark of his presidency, before the celebratory parade and the evening's galas.

Shortly after exhorting the United States to continue its ""never-ending journey"" to live up to the ideals of its founders, on his way off the platform at the West Front of the Capitol, President Barack Obama stopped to drink in the scene before him.

""I want to take a look one more time,"" he told those surrounding him. ""I'm not going to see this again.""

24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon, letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal, public second inauguration file past. And so, with his oath of office taken -- again -- and the speech delivered , the president stood aside for24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon, letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal, public second inauguration file past.

It was one of the few quiet moments on an otherwise jam-packed day. Obama stole another such moment with his wife, at the first of two official inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend Monday night.

Following performances by Alicia Keys, Brad Paisley and the Mexican rock group Mana, the first couple danced as Jennifer Hudson sang the classic song, ""Let's Stay Together,"" by Al Green.

First lady Michelle Obama wore a floor-length, custom, ruby-colored chiffon and velvet gown designed by Jason Wu, the same designer behind her 2009 inaugural dress.

The celebrations came a day after Obama was sworn in on the constitutionally required date in a low-key ceremony at the White House. The flag-waving crowd that watched Monday's event was noticeably smaller than the throng that turned out for his first oath in 2009 but still packed the National Mall for blocks.

The waving flags, the red-white-and-blue bunting and the heralding trumpets marked the 57th such ceremony in the history of the nation, with the peaceful extension of power based on last November's election that returned Obama to the White House.

The Sousa marches, the ceremonial guns and the voices of James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce having faded away, Obama headed into the Capitol for a luncheon with members of Congress. Then he led the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue, stopping near the White House to walk a few blocks of the route with the first lady to the cheers of those lining the sidewalks.

""You've got to come out for this,"" said Nick Pignone, a Washington resident. ""Everyone's excited -- good vibes right now.""

Also publicly sworn in for a second term was Vice President Joe Biden, who, like Obama, also took his official oath Sunday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor performed the honors for Biden at his home at the Naval Observatory in Washington, where the vice president's extended family and a few Cabinet officials gathered to watch the ceremony.

Biden and his wife, Jill, also took some time to walk part of the parade route, with a grinning Biden periodically jogging over to the sidelines to shake hands with people across the barricades. Once both couples and their families were seated at the White House reviewing stand, one of the first acts to pass was the marching band from Honolulu's Punahou School, Obama's alma mater.

What followed included dozens of military and school bands, Native American dance troupes whirling in traditional dress, war veterans, Civil War re-enactors, kilted firefighters blowing bagpipes and Montana's governor and congressional delegation on horseback and in cowboy hats.

Obama, the first African-American president and the 17th to win a second term, used a pair of Bibles in Monday's ceremony -- one from Abraham Lincoln, the other from Martin Luther King Jr. His roughly 2,000-word inaugural address hearkened back to both.

""I did everything possible today to keep from crying,"" said U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, a onetime lieutenant of King. He called the sight of Obama using King's Bible ""very moving, unreal -- almost unbelievable.""

Monday is also the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of King, who was assassinated in 1968.

The loudest cheer of Obama's address came when he said the nation's journey remained incomplete ""until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts,"" and ""until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.""

Obama begins the second half of his presidency with the opportunity to make it more historic but facing some of the same challenges that he struggled with in the first four years.

Americans ""have the power to set this country's course,"" he said, urging people to fulfill their citizenship by meeting ""the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.""

On the Mall, Carlos Arieta and his wife, Sharon, took in the scene after driving from Atlanta to witness history. The former Washington residents said it was the first time they had attended an inauguration.

Surprised by the throngs gathered a few hours before the speech on a clear morning with temperatures just above freezing, Arieta said ""it's nice to see all the different kinds of people.""

Even some of those who didn't support Obama's November re-election turned out to watch. Don King, 27, and his 21-year-old brother Matthew said they don't agree with the president on taxation, debt and other fiscal issues but didn't want to miss this bit of history.

""It's the second inauguration for Obama, and it's pretty amazing if you think back to the 1800s and later during the civil rights era, that we're here,"" Don King said.

A new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago, when nearly 2 million people crowded the Mall despite frigid weather for Obama's historic first inauguration.

In January 2009, nearly seven in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN survey said they were thrilled or happy that Obama was about to take office. Now, according to the new, that number is down 18 points, to 50%.

Back then, six in 10 saw Obama's inauguration as a celebration by all Americans of democracy in action, with just 39% saying it was a political celebration by the supporters of the winning candidate.

Now, the numbers are nearly reversed, with 62% saying the second inauguration is a celebration by those backing the president, and 35% saying it's a celebration of democracy.

""The thrill is gone, along with the hope that the start of a new presidential term of office will bring a divided nation together,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

Reality of second-term presidencies

The smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies, when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first act.

For Obama, that difference is even sharper. His historic ascendancy to the White House in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades.

However, a litany of challenges, including an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional Republicans over budgets and spending, only hardened the opposing positions in Washington.

Obama's signature achievements, including major reforms of the health care industry and Wall Street, became symbols of political division, with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery.

For his second term, Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation's immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy, proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals, and oversee the implementation of Obamacare.

And the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda.

CNN polling released Sunday showed a majority of Americans -- 54% -- believe Obama will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term, while 43% said he'd be poor or below average.

And while overall, seven in 10 Americans hope the president's policies succeed, only four in 10 Republicans feel that way, with 52% hoping that Obama will fail.

But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN, ""Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together.""

""I think the president did a fine job, certainly, laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country,"" Cantor said. ""There are areas of disagreement, but there are also some things fundamentally we agree on, and that is this country is one of opportunity. And sort of the way we get there to help everybody, there are some differences. Hopefully, we can bridge those differences."""
http://news.yahoo.com/both-parties-aim-to-score-political-points-off-the-shutdown-183517402.html,,[],Both parties aim to score political points from the shutdown,"Republicans and Democrats are using the ongoing battle over the government shutdown and the debt ceiling to bludgeon vulnerable candidates with paid-messaging campaigns, efforts that offer a glimpse into their political playbooks before the midterm elections next year.

The attack campaigns, which have come in the form of online ads and robocalls in battleground states, also shine a light on how political gamesmanship can drive policy decisions in Washington.

For example, since the government shut down Oct. 1, House Republicans have held a series of votes to fund a handful of popular government programs with full knowledge that Democrats would reject them. While refusing to hold a vote on a “clean” funding bill to reopen the entire government, Republicans have voted to fund programs such as the National Park System and National Institutes of Health. Many House Democrats crossed party lines to vote for them, but the Democrat-led Senate has rejected the piecemeal approach.

It was a legislative strategy made perfect for a sound-bite world. By passing those minifunding bills, Republicans went on to accuse Democrats of voting to close national treasures like the Grand Canyon and opposing government funding for medical research and U.S. military veterans.

The Republican National Committee has launched a series of robocalls against red state Democratic lawmakers facing re-election in 2014. The calls, which went to constituents of Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, emphasized the delayed benefits of U.S. military veterans under the government shutdown and accused Democrats of “playing politics by cutting off our veterans and their benefits.”

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), the top party group responsible for electing Republicans to the Senate, is also considering ways to use the shutdown battle against potentially vulnerable Democrats, all of whom voted against delaying the federal health care law as part of a House package to fund the government.

Story continues

“They're in a Catch-22. Vulnerable Democrats like Mary Landrieu, Mark Pryor and Kay Hagan are terrified of losing their liberal base, but their campaigns bleed independent voters each second that they embrace Obamacare and refuse to negotiate and compromise,” NRSC spokesperson Brad Dayspring told Yahoo News. “They're tying themselves to an anchor.”

While Republicans are focusing pressure on 2014 House and Senate candidates, the Democratic National Committee is sponsoring an offensive that aggressively goes after GOP congressional leaders and possible presidential candidates.

Democrats last week launched a three-wave strike, with paid online ads against Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. (Rubio, Paul and Cruz aren’t up for re-election in 2014, but all have shown some interest in seeking the party nomination for the White House in 2016.)

The first wave came on Oct. 8, when the DNC sponsored online ads and robocalls that targeted each lawmaker in their home state.

On Oct. 9, they released a series of robocalls against Rubio, Paul and Cruz in Iowa, a strategic move because Iowa traditionally holds the first Republican presidential caucuses.

“Republicans in Congress like Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul shut down the government over a week ago trying to gut Obamacare,” the voice on the DNC-sponsored robocall said. “Because of their shutdown, new USDA farm loans in Iowa have been halted, and Iowa farmers aren’t receiving payments for programs they’re enrolled in.”

Then, on Oct. 10, the DNC rolled out yet another series of Spanish-language calls to Hispanic voters against Cruz and Rubio in Florida, Texas, Nevada and Arizona that accused them of “hurting the Latino community.”

While not surprising, these campaigns shine a light on the parallel messaging battle being waged alongside the squabble on Capitol Hill, and how both parties are working hard to ensure the other team takes the fall for the blame. Depending on what works, expect to hear more of this — a lot more — in 2014 and beyond."

The only fili that has winner written all over her face.

I'm going to be brief and direct.

You want to know why Hillary Clinton is leading among all Democrats by huge margins? It is simple: She is the only Democrat big enough to separate from President Obama in 2016 and still win a general election. You can't name anybody else who can do that.

Why would any Democrat want to do that? It is simple: Because even 3 years from now, we are still going to have a shitty economy. President Obama's legacy on the economy is pretty much set: slow, middling growth coupled with vast inequality and poverty. Eight more years of treading water is hard sell. You'd have to be an idiot to run on the Obama economic record. For any other Democrat, there will be no avoiding it.

The cyclic nature of politics should mean the tide is against us. Add to that a Democratic Party that is still afraid of its own shadow, and we shouldn't expect any bold policy initiatives that will fix our crap economy. The only thing saving us in a national election is three things:

1. Demographics.

2. The Republican Party is fucking crazy.

3. Hillary.

And that's the truth, Ruth."

Ag Secretary Tom Vilsack says rural America is losing its political clout

Decline in rural population means fewer lawmakers advocating rural issues

Leaders say rural interests must work together to educate%2C advocate

WASHINGTON — When the top cheerleader for rural America has some harsh words for the people he represents, it might be time to take notice.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack delivered a dire warning to the 51 million farmers, ranchers and other residents inhabiting rural America before a farm group in Washington last month. His message: Rural Americans are becoming less relevant in the country's increasingly urban landscape and unless they find a way to reverse the trend their voice will continue to fall on deaf ears in Washington and around the world.

""Unless we respond and react, the capacity of rural America and its power and its reach will continue to decline,"" Vilsack said. ""Rural America, with a shrinking population, is becoming less and less relevant to the politics of this country, and we better recognize that, and we had better begin to reverse it.""

In the past four years, he said, more than 50% of rural counties have seen their population decline.

Vilsack pointed to rural America's diminishing impact as a reason Congress was unable to pass a farm bill in 2012 — during an election year. More than 80% of lawmakers are not representing rural areas, making it an uphill battle for those outside of urban areas to be heard in Washington by senators and representatives who may not fully understand or appreciate the role played by agriculture in the United States.

As their influence diminishes, lawmakers representing so-called non-metro America are left to collect a smaller piece of government spending. And they have less influence on laws and regulations that affect people in their areas.

""It's time for us to have an adult conversation with folks in rural America,"" said Vilsack, who urged those living in rural areas to be proactive and not to hang on to the successes of the past. ""We need a proactive message, not a reactive message. How are you going to encourage young people to want to be involved in rural America or farming if you don't have a proactive message? Because you are competing against the world now and opportunities everywhere. Young people have all of these opportunities.""

The former Iowa governor said the strong agricultural economy – supported by high commodity prices, growing demand for ethanol and other renewable fuels and the increased use of public land for recreation – has failed to improve the rural economy, where poverty rates hover at 17%, higher than in metropolitan areas.

During the 1990s, people flocked to rural areas to take advantage of the growth in jobs. But with fewer positions now available, a major incentive to move out of the big city has vanished. Rural America gained about 2.2 million people between 2000 and 2010, but the growth was about half of the previous decade, according to a review of U.S. Census Bureau data by Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire's Carsey Institute. Counties dependent on farming saw their population grow a meager 0.3% between 2000 and 2010, and only 29% of those counties actually gained people. The minimal growth rate was attributed entirely to births rather than people moving there.

Still, the analysis found more than a third of 2,051 rural counties experienced what's called a ""natural decrease"" — where more people are dying than are being born. Although population growth also slowed in metropolitan regions of the country from the 1990s, the rate last decade was still far greater — 10.8% — than in rural areas.

""I'd have a hard time really arguing with"" Vilsack's warning to rural America, said Michael McCurry, South Dakota's state demographer who also teaches at the state university in Brookings. ""Our rural people are not that significant. We don't have the votes. We don't have the voice, and, by golly, I just don't see it changing. Barring some massive plague or environmental disaster, we're going to continue becoming more urban.""

Rural America, which encompasses nearly 75% of the land area of the United States, currently accounts for about 16% of the country's population, the lowest in the nation's history. In fact, it has been almost a century since people living in rural America outnumbered those who resided in metro areas. The U.S. Census Bureau classifies rural areas as open country and settlements with fewer than 2,500 residents.

The reasons surrounding the slowing population growth compared with urban and suburban areas are complicated, but those who have studied the shift boil it down to one thing: fewer opportunities. The use of combines, tractors and other farming technology that began decades ago, along with the gradual consolidation of operations since then, have reduced the number of people needed to staff farms and ranches. Meanwhile, the growth of steel, automobile and other industries, along with a college education, pulled young people into urban areas where they got married and had children. Most did not return to their rural roots.

It is the same in much of the country today. As towns shrink, there is less demand for everyday services that create jobs. A school with smaller class sizes might have to lay off teachers or a business could abandon plans to open up a new plant, further siphoning off jobs and depriving the area of additional tax dollars needed for things such as repaving roads or improving emergency services.

In Iowa, where agriculture is the top industry, 74% of the state's population was rural in 1900 but by 1990 that figure slipped to 39%. The shift away from rural living has likely accelerated since then, according to those who study populations in America.

The change is even more noticeable by county. In Kenneth Johnson's analysis of Census Bureau data he found the agricultural county of Osceola in northwestern Iowa had 6,452 people in 2010 compared with 8,371 three decades earlier and 8,956 in 1910. In contrast, Dallas County, Iowa, which is on the fringe of the Des Moines metro area, has experienced significant gains in the past couple of decades. In 2010, its population was 66,135 compared with 29,513 in 1980 and 23,628 people in 1910.

John Cromartie, a geographer with USDA's Economic Research Service, participated in a University of Montana study that included visits to high school reunions in 21 rural communities across the country during 2008 and 2009. Interviews with people who stayed in the community and others who had moved away showed that the decline of a town had a direct impact on the psyche of people and affected whether they would want to return to raise their family or open a business.

"" 'When I was a kid there was a bowling alley here, two drugs stores where you could go get a soda, and it was just a bustling active place that was well kept up. Now look at it, ' "" Cromartie often heard from people he interviewed. "" 'Half the stores are closed up. No one comes down here anymore. It's not a place you would send your kids to go hang out.' ""

To be sure, some rural parts of the United States continue to prosper and many counties near metro areas have actually seen their ranks grow. In North Dakota, a decades-long streak of population erosion was reversed after a boom in coal, oil and natural gas attracted thousands of workers to the area.

For Vilsack and others, the struggle is finding a way to make rural America a place enticing enough for people — especially those in their 20s, 30s and 40s — to stay, work and raise their families.

Craig Hill, president of the Iowa Farm Bureau, said farm and other commodity groups need to advocate for the interests of agriculture, especially as the food supply comes under attack. Last year, for example, the meat industry was criticized for using trimmings, dubbed by some as ""pink slime,"" that have been added to beef since the early 1990s to reduce both costs and fat content. No deaths or illnesses have ever been linked to the additive.

""We went about our business assuming that consumers knew where food came from, and knew production practices and knew of the safety and the value that they are receiving,"" Hill said. ""We were unaware of how much the consumer didn't know about conventional agriculture.""

In Washington, some lawmakers have an equally difficult task convincing others in Congress that rural America still matters. In order to boost their presence, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said those representing rural America need to form coalitions to underscore the impact these forgotten areas have on the nation's well-being.

""That is a challenge in this country, where food is abundant and, for most people, affordable and taken for granted,"" Harkin said.

Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political science professor, said representatives and senators overseeing large rural areas need to press upon urban and suburban lawmakers that ""their fates are tied to rural America."" Sabato pointed to the recently averted crisis facing the dairy industry as an example.

A deal reached as part of the ""fiscal cliff"" talks in Washington earlier this month prevented dairy subsidies from reverting to 1949 levels, a move that could have caused milk prices to double to about $7 a gallon across the country. The lawmakers need ""to make the connection with their colleagues, to make the argument with their colleagues: here's how what's happening in my district affects yours,"" Sabato said, noting it would take significant time for the push to have a meaningful impact in Congress.

Farmers and lawmakers representing agriculture-intensive states or districts strongly disagree with Vilsack's analysis of a declining of rural America. While their political power in Washington may have eroded, farmers and ranchers point to the food, fuel and jobs they produce, along with their impact on the country's economy, as evidence of their ongoing importance.

""It's a little disappointing to hear the secretary of this great nation make a comment like that. We have less power as a vote, but as far as relevancy, we are more relevant today than we've ever been."" said Justin Dammann, who raises corn, soybeans and cow calves near Essex, in far southwest Iowa.""I kind of question if (Secretary Vilsack is) not just trying to get us fired up.""

McCurry, South Dakota's demographer, has lived in rural America most of his life. The 63-year-old grew up in northwest Montana and now lives 15 miles away from the South Dakota State University campus. He has no plans to leave behind the many trees and beautiful sunrises and sunsets he sees from his home.

""For me, I'm pretty comfortable there,"" McCurry said. ""I live in this place where I got a little fish pond. I do have to shoot the rabbits when they get into my garden, but it's a pleasant and a quiet life and I enjoy it."""

In remarks made on Tuesday night at a fundraiser for Massachusetts Senate candidate Ed Markey in front of an audience of donating (doting?) Democrats, Biden went for the jugular. In a reference to Al Gore, who introduced Biden at the Washington, D.C., event, Biden said, ""This man was elected president of the United States of America,"" according to the pool report. ""But for the good of the nation, when the bad decision, in my view, was made, he did the right thing for the nation,"" Biden continued.

“Al, you set an example for this country that is going to live as long as recorded history, about the man who won by a decision that I think constitutional scholars now and in the future will conclude was an ill-fated decision,” Biden said. “The way you stepped up, it was amazing.”

Biden was just getting warmed up:This is pretty amazing stuff coming from a sitting Vice-President--to take a hammer to the very legitimacy of the prior Administration. Don't think we've ever seen anything quite like that before. Of course, it also helps when it happens to be true.

Nor did the Biden stop there. He characterized the divide between Democrats and the modern Republicans, once merely differentiated by competing principles, as akin now to an unbridgeable abyss.



It’s a pretty simple proposition: The United States of America, and the state of Massachusetts, does not need another Republican in the Senate,” Biden said, also according to the pool report. “I’m being straight about this. This is not your father’s Republican Party. It really is a fundamentally different party. There’s never been as much distance, at least since I’ve been alive, distance between where the mainstream of the Republican congressional party is and the Democratic Party is. It’s a chasm. It’s a gigantic chasm.





[T]he last thing in the world we need now is someone who will go down to the United States Senate and support [Texas freshman Sen.] Ted Cruz, support the new senator from Kentucky—or the old senator from Kentucky,"" Biden said, referring to freshman Sen. Rand Paul and veteran Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “Think about this,” he said. “Have you ever seen a time when two freshman senators are able to cower the bulk of the Republican Party in the Senate? That is not hyperbole.”

And still more of the knife did the Biden twist:Yow!"

According to the survey -- conducted by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling on behalf of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy For America -- Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky's Democratic secretary of state who officially entered the race on Tuesday, leads the longtime senator by one point, with 45 percent to McConnell's 44 percent. While her lead is within the margin of error, the poll also underscored some broader issues that McConnell is likely to face as he campaigns for a sixth term.

At 51 percent, a majority of Kentuckians say they disapprove of McConnell's job performance, while 40 percent approve and 9 percent are undecided. Those numbers are an improvement over an April PPP poll that showed him to be one of the least popular senators in the country, with a 36 percent job approval rating. His lagging numbers reinforce a longstanding problem that McConnell has had wrangling support for his reelection bid.

PPP surveyed 1,210 Kentucky voters for the first two questions, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent. PCCC reportedly plans to release additional findings from the survey at a press conference later on Thursday.

“It’s no surprise that Kentucky voters have had enough of Mitch McConnell’s partisan gridlock,” said Jonathan Hurst, senior adviser to Lundergan Grimes. “For thirty years, McConnell has been the embodiment of all that is wrong with Washington and has no problem turning his back on Kentucky’s middle class.”

""George Soros and the Obama Allies are up to their same old tricks,"" said McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton. ""They have concocted another fictitious poll that has no basis in reality, held it for ten days, and released it at the perfect time in the news cycle to help their upstart liberal candidate. This poll has zero credibility and should be ignored out of hand.""

PPP's polling was lauded for its accuracy during the 2012 election cycle.

Previous polls by the firm, taken in April and May, before Lundergan Grimes officially kicked off her campaign, similarly suggested that the Democrat would be a viable threat to McConnell. A survey taken by Republican firm Wenzel Strategies last month had McConnell in better shape, leading Grimes 48 percent to 40 percent.

Potentially compounding matters for McConnell is the recent decision by Kentucky tea party activist and businessman Matt Bevin to challenge the five-term senator for the Republican nomination. Bevin was not included in the latest survey, though the Wenzel Strategies poll released in July suggested that McConnell had a strong lead over his challenger.

This article was updated to include comment from the McConnell campaign.

UPDATE: 7:23 p.m. ET -- A poll conducted by Grimes' campaign also showed the Democrat with a slight lead over McConnell, the Courier Journal reported Thursday. In that poll, Grimes led McConnell by two points.

The internal Grimes poll surveyed 750 Kentucky voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points."

""I remain excited about the future and the challenges ahead,"" he said, ""but the time has come to pass on the mantle of leadership.""

Perry, who has not ruled out another presidential run, added that he will ""pray and reflect and work to determine my own future path,"" during a San Antonio event with supporters billed last week as an announcement of ""exciting future plans.""

The Texas governor pledged to continue his work in Texas for the remainder of his term, focusing on his work at the helm of ""a strong pro-life, pro-family, pro-freedom state.""

“I will spend the next 18 months working to create more jobs, opportunity and innovation. I will actively lead this great state,” he said to applause.

Perry’s announcement comes almost 18 months after he ended his bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, a campaign marred by the Texas governor’s much-ridiculed gaffes.

But since his previous presidential ambitions died out with a whisper in January of last year, Perry has worked to rebuild his national profile, pushing his home state’s pro-business agenda in a recent East Coast tour while leading a high-profile fight against legislators at home who support abortion rights.

The Texan, who underwent major back surgery just weeks before announcing his presidential run at a conservative confab in August 2012, has since attributed his rocky political performance to lingering health problems after the procedure. He’s also indicated regret at getting into the 2012 race much later than his competitors, leaving him little room for error in the early state jostling.

While his infamous inability to recall the three federal agencies he proposed to axe during a November primary debate was the most memorable of Perry’s mistakes, earlier mediocre debate performances and campaign infighting had taken the sheen off his once promising candidacy weeks before his “oops” moment.

Appearing on Fox News Sunday last weekend, Perry indicated that another presidential run was “an option out there” but declined to talk further about his political future.

On Monday, Perry said he would continue to concentrate on his home state as he completes his term.

""Any future considerations I will announce in due time, and I will arrive at that decision appropriately.,"" he said. ""But my focus will remain on Texas.”"
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/08/12/north-carolina-governor-signs-extensive-voter-id-law/,2013-08-12 00:00:00,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'Senior Reporter']",North Carolina governor signs extensive Voter ID law,"The measure requires voters to present government-issued photo identification at the polls and shortens the early voting period from 17 to 10 days. It will also end pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-old voters who will be 18 on Election Day and eliminates same-day voter registration.

Democrats and minority groups have been fighting against the changes, arguing that they represent an effort to suppress the minority vote and the youth vote, along with reducing Democrats' advantage in early voting. They point out that there is little documented evidence of voter fraud.

Republicans say that the efforts are necessary to combat such fraud and that shortening the window for early voting will save the state money. They also note that, while the North Carolina law makes many changes to how the state conducts its elections, most of its major proposals -- specifically, Voter ID and ending same-day registration -- bring it in line with many other states. More than three-fifths of states currently have some kind of Voter ID law, and even more have no same-day registration. Not all states allow in-person early voting.

“While some will try to make this seem to be controversial, the simple reality is that requiring voters to provide a photo ID when they vote is a common-sense idea,"" McCrory said in a statement. ""This new law brings our state in line with a healthy majority of other states throughout the country. This common-sense safeguard is commonplace.”

A spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association said McCrory's ""cynical"" move will come back to haunt him.

""When he ran for governor, Pat McCrory pretended to be a moderate pragmatist,"" the spokesman, Danny Kanner, said. ""Today, he proved that he's just another cynical, ultra-conservative ideologue intent on disenfranchising voters who might not be inclined to vote Republican.""

While there is significant resistance to Voter ID laws on the left, polls generally show the American people support them by large margins. Recent North Carolina polls and a Washington Post poll last year showed nearly three-quarters support requiring voters to show photo ID.

The Post poll also showed, though, that Americans are split when it comes to whether it's more important to fight voter suppression or to combat voter fraud. And while Voter ID polls popularly, the bill covers much more than that.

Several similar efforts have passed in recent years in other states with Republican-controlled state legislatures and GOP governors, but North Carolina's has drawn a particularly high degree of backlash from the left, given how far-reaching and all-inclusive the new law is.

The Justice Department has suggested it will fight the new law, which comes just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key portion of the Voting Rights Act. States like North Carolina are no longer required to obtain preclearance from the Justice Department for such changes after the Court struck down the formula used for determining which states and jurisdictions with a history of voter suppression require preclearance.

The Justice Department is also looking to challenge a new Voter ID law in Texas and has also fought against a new Voter ID law in Florida.

The other big change in the law -- a reduction in the number of early-voting days -- could diminish Democrats' historical advantage in early voting, which accounted for more than half of ballots cast in North Carolina last year.

But Republicans note that the law still requires the same number of hours of early voting -- just over a smaller period of time. County election officials can either extend hours on a given day or provide more early voting locations.

Other provisions in the new North Carolina law would prohibit paid voter registration drives, end straight-ticket voting (in which a voter can vote for all candidates of one party by voting just once -- another area in which Democrats benefit) and loosening restrictions on poll watchers who can challenge a voter's eligibility.

The state legislature gave the law final approval in late July.

The changes come as the state has fallen under Republican control for the first time in more than a century. North Carolina's state legislature went Republican for the first time since Reconstruction after the 2010 election. McCrory then won in 2012, becoming the state's first Republican governor since the early 1990s.

McCrory also recently signed an extensive new abortion restrictions law -- another move that has earned him significant opposition from the political left.

The result was the 14th amendment, which, in addition to codifying the abolition of slavery, included in its Section 4 the guarantee to honor all U.S. debts.

The fact that the debt issue was stuck in the face of the southern states in the same constitutional amendment as slavery abolition civil rights guarantees should not go unnoticed for either its symbolic value or for its roots as a point of contention with the Tea Party, which draws upon white resentments in the south and elsewhere fueled by the rise of civil rights laws in the 1960s. The Tea Party draws on white supremacist sentiment that has been a part of U.S. history since its beginnings, augmenting it with pro-Nazi sentiments fueled by the so-called Fellowship Foundation of ""key men"" (and, sometimes, women) starting in the mid-20th century. Their purpose is completely clear; split the U.S. so that it can be destroyed, and replaced with a far right police state benefiting a few elites.

As with the rise of Hitler during Germany's Weimar Republic, the Tea Party uses economic and social chaos to fuel its rise. It undermines faith in democratic processes at every turn, so that people will favor ""strong man"" governments - governments that will benefit the ""key men"" first and foremost and further the redistribution of wealth from average people to the elites. The Nazis of Weimar Germany also used resentment against Europe and moderate Germans for the perceived unfairness of war reparation payments after World War I to fuel nationalism, much in the same way that the Tea Party fuels resentment against the fall of the ""Southern Cause"" with its encouragement of Confederate flag-waving and the use of the proxy Gadsden Flag from South Carolina's troops in the War of Independence.

What we are engaged in is not an economic fight, or even a political fight. What we're engaged in is in fact a fight for the last chance for a democracy in the United States for the foreseeable future. The billionaire lords of the Tea Party. like the industrialists backing Hitler, want to wage economic and military war on anyone who might interfere with their accretion of wealth, both in this nation and beyond. Their ""values"" issues, while certainly a part of their outlook, are largely tools for a much more agnostic and pagan goal: power and wealth for its own sake, with the state as the crowning mechanism for their goals.

Sadly, I don't think that the U.S. public really gets this - or really gets that they are in a battle where they are still the majority against this hardened and fantasy-based group of extremists. Hitler rose to power in part because everyday people became exhausted, beaten down by harsh economic realities, a beating aided and abetted by a flaccid and complacent media. So it is again today. Little has been learned in a century, unfortunately, it would seem.

We do have hope and we do have options, but people are tired, and they need to feel that they have hope. This is what's lacking in the political dialogue right now. Obama is doing his best to fuel that courage and that hope, but it will take a lot more grass roots activism to overcome the Tea Party. They can command endless hours of news coverage simply by having a few of their relatives and friends wave Confederate flags in front of the White House. They call for massive rallies that never materialize - except in the news media's perception that declaring these things to be so makes them so.

We have to create our own reality for the sake of U.S. democracy, and soon, otherwise there will be no union left to save. If that seems to be an exaggeration, look at how the German people allowed democracy to slip away from their own nation. The fact of the matter is that, one way or another, we are still engaged in a great Civil War for American democracy, testing whether this nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure, as Abraham Lincoln put it. The enemies of democracy laid down their arms only in part more than 150 years ago. The final battle of that war is upon us. It is up to us as a people to decide how to fight it, but the fight has been brought to us regardless. We have only to choose how to respond.

Let's hope for the best - and fight for it."

And it would have been -- it would have been much better for America, I believe, in my heart if he had been there right now.

Ann and her eleventy billion houses and her fancy horse and her two Cadillacs will be just fine, thank you very much, but as for the rest of the country ... Ann weeps for you. A lot:Remember, those tears of self-pity, because it's very hard to lose, are not for her. They're for you, America. For you.She may be mostly dead, but she's nowhere near done whining about it:

Damn you, America! But at least she's not bitter. Not like, say, her husband:



MITT ROMNEY: The president had the power of incumbency. ObamaCare was very attractive, particularly to those without health insurance. And they came out in large numbers to vote. So that was part of a successful campaign.

I think they had a better ground game. And I think we were not aware -- you know, we certainly had the passion coming from our side, and I don't think we were as aware of the passion that was coming from the other side. I think we were a little blindsided by that.

Curse that sneaky president and his popular policies that made people want to vote for him instead of the guy who called them a bunch of deadbeat takers! Oh, plus, also having a better campaign that everyone except the Romneys could see:Yeah, it sure it surprising when all the polls turn out to be right and Karl Rove is wrong.

Also, Ann thinks the media and the Obama campaign were very unfair to her husband because he's a swell guy—no, really, he is!—and yet, for some reason, no one saw that.



WALLACE: Do you think the media was in the tank for Barack Obama? (LAUGHTER) ANN ROMNEY: I think that it's -- anytime you're running for office, you always think that you're being portrayed unfairly. And, you know, we -- of course, on our side believe that there's more bias in favor of the other side. I think that that's a pretty universal -- universally-felt opinion. WALLACE: What do you think of the campaign that Barack Obama ran? ANN ROMNEY: I think, obviously, it was a winning campaign. It worked. WALLACE: Do you think it was fair? ANN ROMNEY: No. WALLACE: In what way? ANN ROMNEY: Portrayal of my husband. He is an exceptional, wonderful person. (LAUGHTER) MITT ROMNEY: She's not biased at all. ANN ROMNEY: I'm not biased! And, you know, and he -- I mean, he really is a selfless person that really, truly cared about the American people. He truly cares about making a difference and about helping others. And for him to be portrayed in a very negative light in another way was very hard. He has enormous skill set in dealing with difficult issues and I totally believe at this moment if Mitt were there in the office, that we would not be facing sequestration right now.

If Mitt were president, there would be no sequester. Also, no war, no debt, no terrorism, no child would go to bed hungry at night, it would never rain on your wedding day, and everyone would have a pony. Two ponies! Because Mitt's that good. See what you're missing, America? DO YOU GET IT NOW?!?!?

Because Ann can't stop talking, Wallace then speaks with Mitt separately. He explains how Obama sucks because if Mitt were president, we wouldn't have the sequester, and also, Mitt totally worked with Democrats that one time he was governor, so, ya know. He woulda fixed all those problems by now. And as for all those awful things Mitt couldn't stop saying during the election? He didn't mean them anyway:



Yes, it was a very unfortunate statement that I made. It's not what I meant. I didn't express myself as I wished I would have.

Yup. That's the Mitt we all knew and despised—the guy who would say anything and then insist it's not what he meant anyway. Really a shame he's not our president now, isn't it?"
http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-rejects-latest-republican-offer-end-shutdown-000940029--business.html,,[],"Obama, congressional leaders still deadlocked on shutdown","By Jeff Mason and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama met with Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress on Wednesday to try to break a deadlock that has shut down wide swaths of the federal government, but there was no breakthrough. After more than an hour of talks, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said Obama refused to negotiate, while House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of trying to hold the president hostage over Obamacare. Reid said Obama told Republicans ""he will not stand"" for their tactics. As hundreds of thousands of federal employees faced a second day without pay, leaders of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate offered token concessions that were quickly dismissed by the other side. Obama, meanwhile, scaled back a long-planned trip to Asia. Republicans have tried to tie continued government funding to measures that would undercut Obama's signature healthcare law. Obama and his Democrats say that is a non-starter. ""The president reiterated one more time that he will not negotiate,"" Boehner told reporters after the White House meeting. ""All we're asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare."" Reid said Democrats were willing to discuss any ways to tackle the budget after a temporary funding bill is passed. ""We're through playing these little games,"" he said. The shutdown, which took effect Monday at midnight (0400 GMT Tuesday), has raised questions about Washington's ability to carry out its most essential duties. Though it would do relatively little damage to the world's largest economy in the short term, global markets could be roiled if Congress also fails to raise the debt limit before borrowing authority runs out in coming weeks. The shutdown has closed landmarks like the Grand Canyon and prevented some cancer patients from receiving cutting-edge treatment. United Technologies Corp, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and other items for the military, said it would be forced to furlough as many as 4,000 employees, if the U.S. government shutdown continues through next week, due to the absence of government quality inspectors. OBAMA EXASPERATED ""Am I exasperated? Absolutely I'm exasperated. Because this is entirely unnecessary,"" Obama told CNBC television in an interview before meeting the congressional leaders. ""I am exasperated with the idea that unless I say to 20 million people, 'You can't have health insurance,' these folks will not reopen the government. That is irresponsible."" The U.S. Army's top general said the shutdown was significantly harming day-to-day operations, and intelligence leaders say it is undermining their ability to monitor threats. A Federal Reserve official said it could delay the central bank's ability to assess whether its monetary stimulus efforts are still needed. The uncertainty in Washington has forced the White House to scale back an Asia trip that was designed to reinforce U.S. commitment to the region. Obama scuttled two stops on a planned four-country tour and left visits to two other countries up in the air. He was due to leave on Saturday and return a week later. Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Malaysia and the Philippines in his place. Obama is weighing whether to attend diplomatic summits in Indonesia and Brunei, a White House official said. Despite the disruption, Boehner's Republicans have failed to derail Obama's controversial healthcare law, which passed a milestone on Tuesday when it began signing up uninsured Americans for subsidized health coverage. Though some moderate Republicans have begun to question their party's strategy, Boehner so far has kept them united behind a plan to offer a series of small bills that would re-open select parts of the government most visibly affected by the shutdown. The Republican-controlled House passed and sent to the Senate a funding bill that would re-open the National Institutes of Health, which conducts medical research, and another bill to reopen shuttered federal parks and museums, such as the Smithsonian museums, the National Gallery of Art and the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Both bills passed with the support of about two-dozen Democrats, who joined Republicans. The House was expected to vote Thursday on measures to fund veterans' care, the District of Colombia and the Army Reserve. The measures are likely to be defeated in the Democratic-controlled Senate, and Obama said he would veto them if they reached his desk. Still, they allowed Republicans to charge that their adversaries are standing in the way of help for elderly veterans and young cancer patients. ""Will they now say 'no' to funding for veterans, our National Parks and the National Institutes of Health?"" asked Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. Reid told Republicans he would engage in talks about tax reform, farm policy and other pressing issues that Congress has failed to address once Republicans agreed to re-open the government without conditions. Republicans dismissed that idea. A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that 24 percent of Americans blamed Republicans for the shutdown, while 19 percent blamed Obama or Democrats. Another 46 percent said everyone was to blame. BIGGER FIGHT LOOMS The shutdown fight is rapidly merging with a higher-stakes battle over the government's borrowing power that is expected to come to a head soon. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said the United States will exhaust its borrowing authority no later than October 17. The government could have difficulty paying pension checks, interest charges and other bills after that point. Many Republicans see the debt limit vote as another opportunity to undercut Obama's healthcare law or extract other concessions - an approach that business groups say could lead to disaster. ""You can re-litigate these policy issues in a political forum, but they shouldn't use the threat of causing the U.S. to fail on its ... obligations to repay on its debt as a cudgel,"" Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein told reporters after he and other financial-industry executives met with Obama. Some Democrats have begun to consider asking Obama to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling on his own - a move that could lead to years of court battles. The White House has said that approach is not feasible. Asked whether there is a push underway among Democrats to convince Obama that he should use this power, a senior House Democrat who asked not to be identified said: ""No, not at this point."" Stock investors on Wednesday appeared to show growing anxiety over the standoff after taking the news in their stride on Tuesday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both closed down 0.1 percent. Obama said Wall Street should be worried about the debt ceiling. ""I think this time's different. I think they should be concerned,"" Obama told CNBC. ""When you have a situation in which a faction is willing potentially to default on U.S. government obligations, then we are in trouble."" A short-term shutdown would slow U.S. economic growth by about 0.2 percentage points, Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday, but a weeks-long disruption could weigh more heavily - 0.4 percentage points - as furloughed workers scale back personal spending. The last shutdown in 1995 and 1996 cost taxpayers $1.4 billion, according to congressional researchers.

What Benghazi is all about.

Every scandal the right manufactures has something simple at its core: a stained blue dress, a long-form birth certificate, a Budhist temple. What is with Benghazi? I haven’t figure it out yet.

The glib (and accurate) answer is "" Hillary Clinton 2016 "". You don't have to be a rocket scientist (or super-genius Jason Richwine ) to crack that code. But even pretend scandals have some sort of narrative to tie them together. You know, the Clintons killed Vince Foster, Obama's birth certificate is forged, yadda yadda yadda.

But with this Benghazi thing ...

Best I can gather, it goes something like this: ""Obama knew the attacks were carried out by terrorists even as he was saying they were a result of a YouTube anti-Islamic movie.""

To that, the crazies respond with shit like this:



SUSAN RICE LIED HILLARY LIED OBAMA LIED AMERICANS DIED

There is, of course, hilarious irony to this, given that this is the same crowd that didn't give a fuck about Bush's genuine lies that got people genuinely killed. And lots of them. But even assuming their version of ""reality"" has any semblance of truth, it doesn't follow that any administration lies would've cost any lives. At worst, using their own facts, the administration misled the public for a week following the attacks. At worst. Only with wingnut logic does a post-event misstatement create a time vortex in which people lose their lives in the past.

But in reality, Obama called the attacks a terrorist attack the day after the attacks. Remember, it was this alternate wingnut version of reality that got Mitt Romney in trouble with the iconic ""please proceed, governor"" moment during the second presidential debate.

Yet the alternate wingnut reality persists. Maybe that's inevitable. After over four years of the most scandal-free administration since forever, conservatives have to hang on to some semblance of malfeasance to continue justifying their pathetic hysteria, and given the failure of their Fast and Furious hysteria, maybe this Benghazi thing can become the new scandal of the century. If they keep screaming about it enough, perhaps people will suddenly start believing in time vortexes as well."

The D.C. Council member kicks off her bid for the Democratic nomination to lead the city.

The D.C. Council member kicks off her bid for the Democratic nomination to lead the city.

D.C. Council member Muriel Bowser launched a mayoral bid Saturday, kicking off a year-long Democratic primary campaign that is likely to center on the pace of progress in city government, the ethics of elected officials and the direction of the city’s remarkable growth.

Bowser made her announcement in front of her childhood home in North Michigan Park, a working-class Northeast neighborhood of brick duplexes and modest detached homes that have housed working-class, mostly African American Washingtonians for generations.

Her remarks Saturday and in an interview with The Washington Post indicate that the Ward 4 Democrat is designing her campaign to exploit Mayor Vincent C. Gray’s perceived weaknesses — his deliberate bearing and the federal investigation into his 2010 campaign.

“Will you go the distance with me?” Bowser, 40, asked a cheering crowd of more than 100 people Saturday. “It won’t be easy, but we need a change.”

She did not mention Gray directly but said, “Corruption has robbed us of our focus, our momentum, our need to think big and act swiftly.”

Bowser, a political confidante of former mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), becomes the first candidate to officially enter the race, leapfrogging Gray (D), who could announce a reelection bid before late fall when candidates begin circulating ballot petitions for the April Democratic primary. Still more council members could enter the race: Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) has formed an exploratory campaign, Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) has said he plans to run and David A. Catania (I-At Large) is pondering a bid.

Much of her campaign, Bowser said in the interview, will concern how to “manage the growth” the city has experienced in recent years — in particular, how to reconcile the anxieties of longtime residents with the expectations of newer ones. Census figures indicate that the city has reversed decades of population loss in the past five years, leading to pressures on affordable housing and employment.

“You’ll find that a lot of people who have lived here for a long time — white and black — feel like that the growth is pushing them out or causing prices to go up, the senior citizens to get hurt,” she said. “How do we manage it to the point that D.C. is welcoming to people who have lived here for five decades or people who have lived here for five months?”

A name Bowser mentioned only in passing Saturday, but one that will hover over the entire campaign, is Fenty. Bow­ser’s political patron, he served as Ward 4’s council member before launching a mayoral run from the stoop of his childhood home. After winning in 2006, he endorsed Bowser to replace him on the council and paved the way to victory for her. Since then, Bowser has easily won twice.

Besides being a backer of Fenty’s initiatives, Bowser also adopted some of his trademarks: a focus on constituent services over legislative heft, a shared political team and a campaign color known colloquially as the “Big Green Machine.”

Fenty’s 2010 loss to Gray, after his alienation of broad swaths of the black community, threatened Bowser’s future as a citywide candidate, but two revelations — of illegal activity within Gray’s campaign and a separate $650,000 “shadow campaign” for him — have helped burnish her prospects. Gray has denied any wrongdoing.

With Fenty settled in private life, Bowser is well positioned among potential mayoral candidates to assume his mantle in what could resemble a reprise of 2010. But while Bowser retains strong connections to Fenty — her campaign chairman and treasurer, lawyer Bill Lightfoot and businessman Ben Soto, served in the same positions for Fenty in 2010 — she has been wary about making too explicit a connection.

“I have great respect for the mayor, he’s a friend of mine, and we share a lot of ideals for our city,” she said of Fenty. “But I don’t think people confuse me with him.”

Asked about Bowser’s candidacy, Gray said he “refused to engage” her on campaign issues at this point.

Although Gray, 70, has not said whether he will seek reelection, he has rhetorically laid the groundwork for doing so. He has touted the city’s growth, a spate of economic-development projects and steady progress in some city agencies. His administration has also issued a five-year economic development strategy, a 20-year sustainability plan and a long-term affordable-housing framework.

Privately, Gray has told friends that he would run for reelection based on the progress he said the city has made. The Gray administration and some supporters said he continues to win the confidence of the business community and big-money contributors by delivering good city services. But detractors note that Gray’s grass-roots base — those who would canvass and help get out the vote — is fractured because of the federal probe and resentment that many of the 2010 die-hard volunteers did not get jobs and have been shunned by the administration.

Bowser’s brother, Marvin Bowser, who introduced her Saturday, said afterward that the biggest challenge for her campaign going forward is to get locals who have been “disillusioned” with the Gray administration to publicly voice support for her campaign.

Bowser indicated she would renew one of the central debates of the 2010 race, when Fenty’s insistence to move on city projects “as fast as humanly possible” was derailed by Gray’s pledge to move more deliberately to involve communities and interest groups more thoroughly in decision-making.

“Certainly, we want plans. We’ve had plans created in this District for decades,” she said. “But what people really want is action, urgency and energy behind these ideas.”

Bowser said she also intends to rekindle the debate over education — one that moved from center stage during the Fenty years to a less prominent position among the Gray administration’s priorities. The high-pitched debates that characterized the tenure of Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee have been replaced by a less strident tone.

Bowser would not identify a particular policy she would pursue, other than moving more aggressively on schools issues and seeking to “connect the dots” among early childhood education, public and charter schools, the city’s universities and workforce development.

Besides a campaign agenda that appears to be heavier on governing styles than policy prescriptions, Bowser is open to attacks that her résuméand legislative record are thin compared with those of her potential council challengers.

Bowser was a mid-level administrator in Montgomery County government before joining the D.C. Council, where her key legislative accomplishment was pushing an ethics law amid a spate of controversies a year ago. But some critics saw the effort as less than thorough because it did not includechanges in campaign finance laws.

Although Bowser is critical of former council chairman Gray’s deliberation in running the government, she has been deliberate in determining whether to seek the mayor’s seat.

Friends and supporters said the nudges to persuade Bowser to run began in late 2011 and early 2012 as the investigation into the Gray campaign continued. But Bowser relented, telling close friends that she was focused on reelection.

“She said, ‘Never take anything for granted,’ ” said a friend who requested anonymity to speak freely about their private conversations.

Bowser listened to the refrain more intently after she was reelected to the council and embarked on an informal citywide listening tour. She became more visible outside Ward 4, traveling to other neighborhoods, including those east of the Anacostia River.

Businesswoman LaRuby May recalled spotting Bowser in January at an awards brunch in Congress Heights. “She was warmly received,” said May, 37. “I talked to her and told her I would support her.”

Subtle promises of support became more overt and targeted. May invited Bowser this month to the ribbon-cutting of Roundtree Residences, a 91-unit affordable-housing community built through the National Housing Partnership Foundation and the development arm of May’s church, Allen Chapel AME.

“It was absolutely intentional on my part to invite her to give her some exposure to Ward 8,” May said. “This is in line with her philosophy on economic development.”

Eric Magwood served on Gray’s campaign finance committee but has defected to Bowser’s camp. Magwood, 47, said he is discouraged by the investigation into the mayor’s 2010 campaign. “Unfortunately, I was one of the people on the campaign who didn’t know what was going on,” said Magwood, a political consultant whose conversations with Bowser began about five months ago.

Before deciding to enter the race, Bowser said she called a circle of her oldest and closest supporters. One of them was Fenty.

He had one thing to say, Bowser said: “Go for it.”

But plenty of Republicans are still eager to wage a midterm campaign against President Obama, convinced that the spate of recent troubles dogging his second term will drive voters into their arms next year.

“Now, we’re seeing the arrogance. We’re seeing the cronyism in practice in this second term,” Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin recently asserted, sounding a lot like his vice-presidential candidate self from 2012, when Republicans spent a good deal of time attacking the president as a self-satisfied autocrat who used his power to reward friends and punish enemies.

Not everyone in the party, however, is so sure that they can expand their ranks in Congress or improve their standing among voters by personally attacking the president, whose likability ratings stand near 80 percent even if only half of Americans approve of his job performance. And they are cautioning their fellow party members to avoid building their campaigns around the same kinds of messages that have fallen flat before.

“I don’t think I’d personalize it,” said John Linder, the former congressman from Georgia who ran the National Republican Congressional Committee during the late 1990s while Newt Gingrich and House Republicans were preparing an impeachment case against President Bill Clinton. Mr. Linder said he fought and lost a battle with Mr. Gingrich over their strategy in the 1998 midterm elections, which Mr. Gingrich thought should be focused on assailing Mr. Clinton’s character."

Rich Morin, a senior editor at the Pew Research Center, wrote about a new study on public opinion on Wednesday and found that:

“Americans often say they want their representatives in Congress to put the country’s needs over local concerns. But four novel experiments suggest that the public does just the opposite.”

He continued:

“Respondents rated a member of Congress far more favorably if the lawmaker put the interests of his or her district or state over those of the country as a whole.”

He concluded, in part, with this damning line:

“The study’s author says legislators who ‘nobly’ put national preferences ahead of local ones will be punished by constituents.”"

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/15/The-Tea-Party-Comeback,2013-04-15 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],The Tea Party Comeback,"Thousands of Tea Party activists will gather Monday at rallies across the nation to mark Tax Day, April 15–and to re-ignite a movement that had been written off as dormant by the media and the political classes.

After propelling the Republican Party to the majority in the House of Representatives in 2010–and likely for the next decade thereafter–the Tea Party seemed to retreat. It failed in its political aim of defeating President Barack Obama in 2012, largely because of its earlier failure to find an alternative nominee to Gov. Mitt Romney. It was tarnished unfairly as racist, extremist, and–especially after the Tuscon shooting of Jan. 2011–violent, and was blamed even by some Republicans for the debt ceiling impasse in mid-2011.

Yet the Tea Party also succeeded in stopping the rapid growth of federal spending and taxation. The Tea Party ensured that there would be no bailouts for profligate states and no large-scale tax increases. Though it had to swallow the tax increases of the “fiscal cliff” deal in the early hours of 2013, it essentially preserved 98% of the Bush-era tax cuts. And by shifting the national debate in favor of deficit reduction, the Tea Party laid the foundation for the budget sequester–a set of across-the-board spending cuts that the American public has largely tolerated, even in the face of President Obama’s attempts to create panic and outrage.

The Tea Party ought to be fading into the background. The issues that the Obama administration has placed on the national agenda–immigration, gun control, and gay marriage–are thought to be ones where the Tea Party is weakest, far from the fiscal agenda that gave it early momentum and prominence. And yet the Tea Party has new momentum as an opposition force. Without articulating clear policy positions on any of these divisive issues, the Tea Party has rallied opposition nonetheless, holding the line in Congress and the states.

The key has been the Tea Party’s continued stress on the Constitution–not just the Second Amendment, but also the fundamental principle of the rule of law, and the federalist structure that Washington has done so much in recent decades to erode. These general principles are enough of a foundation for a political stand–and broad enough to admit wide differences of opinion on the substantive underlying issues themselves.

Recent months have proved challenging for conservatives, especially as politicians once backed by the Tea Party have begun reshaping themselves as moderates–Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) on immigration, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) on gun control, and several governors on Obamacare funding for state Medicaid expansion. Yet the Tea Party appears set for a revival–partly because of the failures of Republican national leadership, partly because of the emergence of new leaders, but largely because the country needs the opposition that it provides.

In a system there the two parties find themselves unable to undo the worst aspects of policies in which they have often colluded, and the mainstream media no longer bother to hold Washington in check, only the Tea Party seems to have the potential to provide the spark for the country’s urgent renaissance."

(CNN) —

More new judges. Faster appointments to top government jobs. Revised regulations and rules reflecting government policy.

Those are the practical impacts from the nuclear option Senate Democrats approved to end filibusters of most presidential nominations and appointments.

Obama supports Senate’s nuclear option to end some filibusters

The politics of the move are messy, with majority Democrats saying it was needed to end unprecedented obstruction by minority Republicans, and Republicans contending it was a power grab.

Both sides are right, at least in part. Here are five things that will change because of the move:

1. Easing Senate gridlock

First and foremost, eliminating the ability of senators to block most nominations means the majority party – in this case Democrats – can hold votes and approve presidential nominations and appointments more quickly.

Before the rule change, minority senators could mount a filibuster that required 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to overcome. With Democrats holding a 55-45 majority, the filibuster served as an effective minority veto.

Once a rare maneuver of specific opposition, the filibuster has become routine, especially since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.

According to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who spearheaded Thursday’s nuclear option rule change, there have been 168 filibusters of executive and judicial nominations in Senate history, with about half of them occurring during the Obama administration.

In the Senate’s first move after the 52-48 vote Thursday to change the rules, it ended a filibuster against one of Obama’s three nominees for a key federal appeals court in Washington who had been blocked by Republicans.

The altered filibuster rules also will apply when the day comes that Republicans hold the Senate majority, a fact emphasized by GOP leaders who decried the change.

“This changes everything,” veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona told reporters Thursday. He blamed newer Democratic senators who never served as the minority party for pushing the issue, adding: “They succeeded and they will pay a very, very heavy price for it.”

What is the nuclear option?

2. More new judges

Obama and Democrats have complained for months that Republicans prevented the President from filling three vacancies on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the nation’s second most important judicial body behind the Supreme Court because it handles many major government-related cases.

The D.C. appeals court became the focal point of the filibuster issue, with Republicans blocking the three Obama nominees to prevent a more liberal-leaning majority on the panel that now has eight judges –four considered conservative and four considered more liberal. GOP leaders argue the court caseload doesn’t require any more judges on the panel.

Now, the three Obama nominees – Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Cornelia Pillard – are likely to get Senate approval to join the D.C. court in coming weeks or months. Upcoming cases the court could consider include challenges to tougher EPA limits on carbon emissions and other regulatory issues.

The Senate rule change specifically exempted Supreme Court nominations, meaning they still can be filibustered, though some Republicans argue that no such distinction exists.

If Reid “changes the rules for some judicial nominees, he is effectively changing them for all judicial nominees, including the Supreme Court,” conservative GOP Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said. “Apparently the other side wants to change the rules while still preserving the ability to block a Republican President’s ability to replace a liberal Supreme Court Justice with an originalist.”

Both sides have been guilty of political hijinks over judicial nominees in the past.

During the administration of President George W. Bush, Republicans who held the Senate majority in 2005 threatened the nuclear option to prevent Democratic filibusters of Bush’s judicial nominees. The confrontation was averted thanks to an agreement by a bipartisan group of 14 senators.

Obama, then a senator, opposed the nuclear option at that time, saying on the Senate floor that “in the long run, it is not a good result for either party.”

Asked about Obama’s past stance compared with his support Thursday for Reid’s move, White House spokesman Josh Earnest cited increased obstruction of Obama nominees as the reason for needing to get the Senate working again.

“The circumstances have unfortunately changed for the worse since 2005,” Earnest said, noting that there were 50 judicial vacancies when Obama took office compared to 93 today, and that many of the President’s nominees have bipartisan support but can’t get an up-or-down Senate vote.

Grassley, however, noted that almost half of the 93 judicial vacancies today lack a nominee by the President.

3. Executive branch appointments

When Obama nominated Chuck Hagel as his defense secretary, the choice seemed safe from major Republican opposition in the Senate because Hagel himself was a former Republican senator.

However, the bitter partisan divide of Washington brought a GOP filibuster that initially prevented a final vote – the first time in history that a defense secretary nominee had been blocked.

“What seems to be happening, and this has been growing over time, is the Republican minority in the Senate seems to think that the rule now is that you need to have 60 votes for everything,” Obama complained at the time.

The rule change means that Obama and future presidents will be able to fill Cabinet posts and agency leadership positions more freely so long as their party controls the Senate.

However, if divided government means the president is of a different party than the Senate majority, look for even more obstruction of such appointments in the future.

4. Rules and regulations

A major target of Republican political attacks now is Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the health care reforms passed by Democrats in 2010 and despised by the political right.

In her job, Sebelius oversees the setting of regulations and rules under the Affordable Care Act, just like Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy is considering regulations on greenhouse gas emissions opposed by Republicans.

That’s what agency and department heads do, and the ending of minority filibusters against a president’s nomination will mean faster implementation of an administration’s policies.

By essentially lubricating the nomination process, the rule change increases the chances of more “Ping Pong politics” in the future, with each new administration undoing regulations and policies of predecessors under the opposite party.

Man who coined the term ‘nuclear option’ regrets ever pursuing it

5. Thorny politics

The Senate rules change applies only to appointments and nominations, not legislation. While some Democrats call for a similar move to apply to proposed laws, such a step remains highly unlikely.

However, Republicans warn that the rule change will harm the political relationships between senators of different parties that can lead to bipartisan agreements and cooperation on drafting and passing laws.

“There’s still quite a bit of legislation that goes through the United States Senate, and it’s done on the basis of people’s agreement and work with one another across the aisle,” McCain told CNN on Thursday. “There are going to be difficulties from time to time where cooperation was probably the case in the past and will not be now.”

With the Republican-controlled House already an opposition bulwark against Obama and Democrats, the President needs the Senate to have any chance to push forward his agenda.

What remains unclear is how much the nuclear option will stiffen Senate Republican resolve to join their generally more hardcore House conservative colleagues in efforts to repeal or dismantle Obamacare, prevent immigration reform and other policy stances.

“We’re not going to shut down the Senate,” McCain said, then adding that “we’re going to focus on trying to repair ObamaCare, which is plaguing the lives of millions of Americans.”

(CNN) - Former President Bill Clinton may have stoked more speculation about his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and her potential run for president.

Asked during a Q-and-A session on Saturday if he'd rather take eight more years as president or complete 16 projects at the Clinton Global Initiative, Clinton said - after a pause - ""I would rather keep doing what I'm doing.""

""Because I think America will have some very good choices for president,"" he continued, drawing applause from the audience as they presumably clapped and cheered for his wife.

His comments came in St. Louis at the annual meeting for the Clinton Global Initiative University, part of his nonprofit he runs that gets young people focused on innovations to improve poverty, development and medical care around the world.

The forum ended with Clinton being interviewed on stage by comedian Stephen Colbert, a conversation that will air on Comedy Central's ""Colbert Report"" Monday evening. Clinton and Colbert took questions from the young audience after the interview.

""I think that, except in unusual circumstances, a two-term limit is a good thing,"" Clinton continued. He said he wouldn't oppose allowing future presidents to run for a third term not immediately after their second.

""But I would personally rather keep on doing what I'm doing for as long as I can possibly do it, because I think I have learned how to do it, and I'm not sure anybody else would be doing this - whereas I'm quite sure there are going to be lots of talented people who are dying to become president of the United States,"" he said.

Although recent polls show Hillary Clinton would come out strong against potential Republican rivals should she decide to make another bid for the White House, one Republican senator said Sunday that her supporters shouldn't get their hopes up.

""I think after eight years of Barack Obama, if things don't change, the next Democrat running for president will be in trouble,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""She will be a formidable candidate. I think her time as secretary of state is mixed. Benghazi is yet to be told completely. Anybody underestimates her on the Republican side would do so at a peril. But yes, she can be beat; anybody can be beat in this country."""

The answer, apparently, is more town halls.

Michele Bachmann has gone from presidential ""contender"" (yeah, we're just gonna put some quotes around that one) to being in serious jeopardy of losing even her current House seat. That's not entirely surprising, of course: Even though she's in a deep-red district, she's been nearly booted a few times, and her recent race against Democrat Jim Graves turned out to be a squeaker. Then there's her presidential campaign being investigated by the FEC and FBI. Oh, and the bit where she keeps saying crackpot things and being a general embarrassment to her own party.

What's a bit different is that Bachmann seems to be keenly aware of how much difficulty she's already in. Which means her constituents are going to start seeing her a lot more often:



Bachmann declined to be interviewed for this story. Kotman, her spokesman, said: “It’s 18 months out, and she isn’t focused on the campaign. She’s focused on the district.” […] Bachmann recently began running TV commercials highlighting her role in sponsoring legislation to repeal Obama’s health care bill — an unusually early time in the election season to start airing ads. And Republicans say they’re assured by the congresswoman’s busy in-district schedule — as of late, she seems more focused on holding town halls than on making headlines. “She is working harder in the district than she has in the past,” said Ron Carey, a former Bachmann chief of staff. “It’s going to be harder to make the case that she’s an AWOL congresswoman.”

There's nothing that shows you're ""focused on your district"" more than cutting television ads highlighting yourself and your quixotic obsession with holding dozens and dozens of meaningless votes to repeal ObamaCare. She's a true saint, that one. (Oh, and her office has also already produced an anti-Graves, anti-Nancy Pelosi web video. Again, though, not focused on campaigning. Shame on you for thinking so.) Still, having your constituents hear more from you is a bit of a risky move, for far-right Republicans like Bachmann; the entire 2012 election season was ample enough evidence of that.

Having her constituents actually boot her should still be considered an uphill climb. It's at least a bit interesting, though, that her office seems already to be in a bit of panic."

USA TODAY

BOSTON — As expected, Republican Party officials voted Friday not to allow CNN and NBC to sponsor Republican primary debates in 2016 if the networks air planned programs about potential 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

In a resolution passed at the party's summer meeting in Boston, national committee members called CNN's planned documentary and NBC's planned biopic ""little more than extended commercials supporting Secretary Clinton"" and an attempt to put ""a thumb on the scales"" for the 2016 presidential election.

GOP chair Reince Priebus had sent a letter to the networks Aug. 5. telling them to drop plans for the programs or face the RNC action. NBC News has said the fictionalized biography is being developed by the network's entertainment division, a separate entity from the news division. CNN asked the RNC to ""reserve judgment"" until the documentary is further along.

Though the RNC is making Hispanic outreach a priority, the ban nonetheless includes NBC's cable networks and Telemundo and CNN Espanol, RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said. Both networks aired debates during the 2012 campaign.

The RNC is trying to find ways to limit the number of debates in 2016 after the marathon of 20 debates in the 2012 primaries, which Priebus said gave the party's candidates too much opportunity to ""slice and dice"" each other. Republican candidates could agree to debates regardless of the RNC action, Kukowski said.

Clinton, who recently stepped down as secretary of State, has not said whether she plans to run for office, but activists around the country are organizing a campaign infrastructure for her.

After the vote, CNN issued the following statement:

""CNN Films, a division of CNN Worldwide, commissioned a documentary about Hillary Clinton earlier this year. It is expected to premiere in 2014 with a theatrical run prior to airing on CNN. The CNN broadcast date has not been determined. This documentary will be a non-fiction look at the life of a former First Lady and Secretary of State. The project is in the very early stages of development, months from completion with most of the reporting and the interviewing still to be done. Therefore speculation about the final program is just that. We encouraged all interested parties to wait until the program premieres before judgments are made about it. Unfortunately, the RNC was not willing to do that.""

News emerged Friday regarding the NBC miniseries. First, Fox Television Studios, which was in talks to produce it, confirmed it had decided not to go ahead with the project.

Late in the day, NBC entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt, who announced last month that the network is developing the project, issued a statement saying the Clinton miniseries is in its early stages and there is no guarantee it will run.

""The Hillary Clinton movie has not been ordered to production, only a script is being written at this time. It is 'in development,' the first stage of any television series or movie, many of which never go to production,"" he said. ""Speculation, demands and declarations pertaining to something that isn't created or produced yet seem premature."""

In a letter to both NBC and CNN, RNC Chair Reince Priebus said that the Party will not allow either network to host primary debates if they go ahead with planned projects surrounding Hillary Clinton. In its statement, CNN said they will not cancel the planned documentary and that it would be a “disservice to voters” for the RNC not to partner with them for the debates:

CNN Films, a division of CNN Worldwide, commissioned a documentary about Hillary Clinton earlier this year. It is expected to premiere in 2014 with a theatrical run prior to airing on CNN. This documentary will be a non-fiction look at the life of a former First Lady and Secretary of State. Instead of making premature decisions about a project that is in the very early stages of development and months from completion, we would encourage the members of the Republican National Committee to reserve judgment until they know more. Should they decide not to participate in debates on CNN, we would find it curious, as limiting their debate participation seems to be the ultimate disservice to voters.

As far as CNN’s claim about a “disservice to voters,” one wonders which voters CNN is talking about. Certainly not Republican voters. For years now, and for very good reason, Republican voters have seen CNN as just another branch of the Democrat Party.

During the 2012 election, many Republicans were infuriated and questioned the judgment of an RNC that willingly allowed our candidates to have their futures put in the hands of a network that was and is so obviously enamored with Obama and the left. It was a suicide run, when these debates should be used by the RNC to help our candidates shine.

CNN was even worse during the actual presidential debates when CNN’s Candy Crowley violated the debate rules, tried to save Barack Obama from a Mitt Romney attack, and got her facts horribly wrong. This is one of the biggest gaffes in all of presidential debate history, but this one was committed by the moderator.

Earlier today, NBC News responded with the claim it had nothing to do with the network’s planned miniseries about Clinton, that will star Academy Award-nominee Diane Lane.

It is unlikely that Priebus and the RNC expected either network to back down. So the news here is all good.

Responding to a question with a joke, Matthews said he felt bad for Christie’s wife. The obvious insinuation is that the overweight governor crushes her during sex:

Two days after Election Day, Chris Christie has crushed his opponent. Is he gonna be the Republican …” began McGrath.

“The one I feel for is his wife,” Matthews cut in.

After a brief pause, some chuckled as McGrath asked, “Why’s that?”

“Did you just say, ‘crush?'” Matthews said. “I mean, use your imagination.”

The crowd erupted.

This is not the first time Matthews has publicly mocked Christie’s weight:

Matthews said during a “Q & A Cafe” event two years ago with Carol Joynt, “He must be 300-plus, and that’s something he’s just gotta deal with, because you’re not going to say, ‘I’m going to cut the budget,’ well, how about starting with supper?”

In their efforts to undermine a likely GOP presidential candidate, the mainstream media have taken issue with Christie’s weight in various ways, ranging from cheap shots to scare tactics. Earlier this week, Time Magazine declared Christie the “elephant in the room” on its cover. Earlier this year, CNN’s Jim Acosta warned Americans that Christie could die in the Oval Office.

It is also no coincidence that Politico piled on today with a “serious” piece examining Christie’s weight.

The media love Christie when he is hugging Barack Obama and trashing conservatives. But the media also know that he is about to threaten Hillary Clinton’s ascension to the White House. By laying the groundwork with the weight issue now, the media hope to turn Christie into a national fat joke as a way to undermine his candidacy.

How right he was. The release of his long-form birth certificate did not eliminate the “birther” movement, which wrongly contends that Obama was born in Kenya and is therefore ineligible to be president. Although conspiracists had demanded its release, once he made public the document it merely shifted the debate. Some birthers accused Obama of forgery, while others turned their focus to his college transcripts in hopes of proving that he had applied for admission as a foreign student. (He had not.)

And this week, birthers seized on a plane crash off Hawaii that killed one person: state public health Director Loretta Fuddy, the woman who verified the authenticity of Obama’s birth certificate.

Skeptics turned to social media Thursday to suggest that Obama had played some role in Fuddy’s death. Twitter posts included: “The WH tying up loose ends?” “What did she really know?” and “R.I.P. Loretta Fuddy — we’ll know the truth about Barack Hussein Obama, regardless.”

Donald Trump, a longtime doubter of Obama’s birthplace, also weighed in on Twitter: “How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s ‘birth certificate’ died in plane crash today. All others lived.”

That reaction didn’t surprise those who study conspiracy theorists.

Mark Fenster, University of Florida law professor who wrote a book on conspiracy theories, said adherents will search for evidence to support their beliefs, and each piece of news can give their theory new life.

“The theories themselves are a process of stitching together individual facts to form a larger narrative, and this is just one more fact that gets linked to the chain,” Fenster said.

Fuddy, 65, was among nine people in a Cessna that crashed into the ocean Wednesday, shortly after leaving Kalaupapa Airport on the island of Molokai about 3:15 p.m. The eight others on the plane, including the pilot, were rescued, but Fuddy “remained in the fuselage of the plane,” Honolulu Fire Capt. Terry Seelig told KHON-TV. “It’s always a difficult situation when you’re not able to get everybody out.”

On Thursday, Lt. William Juan with the Maui Police Department said that Fuddy’s body had been recovered from the wreckage and that an autopsy would be conducted.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash, agency spokesman Eric Weiss said, and a preliminary report should be ready in 10 to 14 days.

The pilot of the Makani Kai Air plane did not call for help, officials said, but radio reception is bad in the area.

Makani Kai Air President Richard Schuman said the crash was caused by “catastrophic engine failure.”

Fuddy was apparently headed to Honolulu from Kalawao County, a park on the north coast of Molokai and the home of Hawaii’s former leper colonies. The director of the health department serves as the mayor of Kalawao County.

Fuddy had been the state’s public health director since March 2011. She approved the release of Obama’s long-form birth certificate, which is not a public document in Hawaii, at his lawyers’ request.

More recently, she had been involved with implementing the Affordable Care Act and the state’s gay marriage law, which took effect Dec. 2.

Hawaii’s governor praised Fuddy.

“Our hearts are broken. Loretta was deeply loved and respected. She was selfless, utterly dedicated, and committed to her colleagues in the Department of Health and to the people of Hawaii,” Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a statement. “Her knowledge was vast; her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience.”

For Orly Taitz, the leading birther litigator who has argued in several federal courts that Obama isn’t a natural-born American, the sole fatality was too much of a coincidence.

“Attorney Taitz calls on 8 courts and judges who received her cases to rule expeditiously on the merits and review the evidence of forgery and theft in Obama’s IDs before more people die in strange accidents,” she said on her website. Taitz has yet to win a case in the matter.

Anyone who believes that Obama’s birth certificate is fake will find a way to tie the plane crash to their beliefs, said Dan Cassino, professor of political science at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey. Their train of thought goes something like this, he joked: “If there’s nothing wrong with the birth certificate, why did Obama have the people from Scandal go ahead and shoot that plane down?”

It’s unclear how many people ascribe to birther beliefs. But a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University in January found that 36% of voters, including 64% of Republicans, believed Obama is hiding information about his background.

Conspiracy theories aren’t new, Cassino noted. The birthplace of the 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, became a point of contention in 1881 as rumors spread that he had been born in Canada.

The Internet has made it easier to spread outlandish theories, Cassino said. Thirty years ago, if you tried to tell people about a farfetched belief, they’d ignore you, he said. But online, “you can go and find a community of people who all agree with you.”

This causes a false-consensus effect, in which people overestimate how many people agree with them, he said. Under these conditions, the loudest voices win, and theories become more and more extreme, he said.

Fenster said he didn’t think the Internet had increased the number of people who believe in conspiracy theories. But it does provide people with a platform to instantaneously make their beliefs known, and allows theories to develop much more quickly, he said.

Although the number of theories may have gone up, Fenster said, the number of people who believe in them probably has not.

Rozell', 'Posted Felixkeverich', 'Posted Bagehot', 'Posted Sanity-Monger', 'Posted Coindependent', 'Posted Yooper', 'Posted Vulturetx', 'Posted Sayhey', 'Posted Ga_Chris']",Right-wing talk shows turned White House blue,"Talk isn’t cheap, as Republicans have learned. The conservative talk show culture is proving expensive for GOP presidential hopefuls.

Since Rush Limbaugh’s 1992 bestseller “The Way Things Ought to Be,” his conservative talk show politics have dominated GOP presidential discourse – and the Republicans’ White House fortunes have plummeted. But when the mainstream media reigned supreme, between 1952 and 1988, Republicans won seven out of the 10 presidential elections.

Conservative talk show hosts and Fox News blame the “lamestream” national media’s “liberal bias” for the GOP’s poor showing since 1992. Yet the rise of the conservative-dominated media defines the era when the fortunes of GOP presidential hopefuls dropped to the worst levels since the party’s founding in 1856.

It was when most Americans got most of their information from network news programs, which took their lead from what conservatives labeled “liberal” newspapers, that the GOP held the White House. Yet the right regularly accused the mainstream news media of colluding to turn the public against conservative nominees.

Is it all a coincidence that Democrats’ fortunes reversed as Limbaugh and his imitators gained influence?

Despite Limbaugh’s ridicule, in 1992, Bill Clinton won more electoral votes than any Democratic challenger in 60 years. In the previous six presidential elections (1968-1988), the Republicans had won five times – all but one by an electoral landslide. Since conservative media began to flourish, only once (2004) has the GOP candidate captured more than 50 percent of the popular vote. And that candidate, President George W. Bush, had the lowest re-election results of any conservative chief executive in U.S. history.

On the other hand, between 1996 and 2008, with conservative media ascendant, four different Democratic standard-bearers in successive elections – Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama – combined for a majority of the popular vote. Democratic nominees had never enjoyed this level of serial success. In 2012, Obama won re-election in a second majority-vote victory – the first Democrat to do so since Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Coincidence again?

“Some things are just too coincidental to be a coincidence,” as Yogi Berra once said. The famed Yankee catcher offers insight into why the new media pitch contributes to the GOP striking out.

Network news sought a mass audience, unlike the niche-programming of today’s cable and radio talk shows. So the network news philosophy focused on fact-based reporting, homogenized for the broadest possible audience – not opinion, which could prove divisive, driving away some potential viewers.

The GOP’s “rally ’round the flag” Cold War anti-communist conservatism was similarly based on a nationalizing formula. So the network economic model and the Republican political equation were a perfect fit.

When the Cold War ended with the Soviet Union’s collapse, the Republican formula lost its philosophic basis. Is it just another coincidence that the GOP’s best showing since the collapse of Cold War conservatism was when Bush could use a nationalizing theme – the threat of terrorism – to win the Republicans’ only recent popular vote majority?

The conservative talk show culture has contributed to today’s new-media fragmentation, which has been so detrimental to GOP presidential hopes. Why is this happening? It’s all about free-market economics.

The more strident and doctrinaire a talk show, the bigger the financial rewards can be for host and sponsor. Programs prosper by capturing a small but deeply loyal slice of the mass audience. This economic model would have decimated national network news in its heyday – as we can now see.

The conservative media powers blame GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s defeat on his inability to rally conservative groups. They claim he failed to focus on their issues. However, in championing the niche special-interest groups over a broader national prism, conservative talk show hosts are fragmenting the electorate

This has never been an effective strategy for Republicans. It is Democrats who have been more successful with it, as Roosevelt proved with his New Deal coalition.

Contrary to talk show revisionist history, the “mainstream media” proved the GOP’s best friend for several generations. ABC, CBS and NBC Nightly News worked for GOP presidential candidates – convincing voters to see elections through a wide prism.

Conservatives delighting at the influence of their favorite talk show hosts and the decline of the mainstream media have missed this crucial modern political lesson: The GOP fared best in presidential politics through a nationalizing lens – not narrow-based ideological appeals.

Now, it could all be a coincidence; Yogi could be wrong. After all, he still claims to have tagged out Dodger legend Jackie Robinson, despite the umpire’s saying No. 42 had stolen home on his Hall of Fame rival in one of baseball’s immortal moments, in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series at Yankee Stadium.

(Steve Helber/AP)

He’s been called “the accidental speaker.” But since taking the helm of the House of Delegates a decade ago after his predecessor stumbled, William J. Howell has been nothing but careful, plotting a strong rightward course for the legislature and occasionally pulling back when he thinks it’s gone too far.

With one swift procedural move this week, the Republican leader killed a new state Senate map that could have given the GOP control for years. But by doing that, he cleared a path toward compromise with Democrats on Republican Gov. Robert F. McDonnell’s transportation plan.

If the art of compromise means sometimes angering your friends and pleasing your enemies, Howell succeeded in his ruling. Some Democrats hailed Howell’s decision as an act of political courage. Some members of Howell’s caucus expressed fury, though usually in private because they feared retribution.

The episode, which attracted national attention, also demonstrated the powers of a figure who has played key roles under both Republican and Democratic governors and never threatened to upstage them.

Howell has worked to satisfy the demands of a Republican caucus that has become more conservative with the rise of the tea party. But at the same time, his pragmatic streak has led him to cut deals with Democrats. He spoke out against then-Gov. Mark R. Warner’s (D) $1.6 billion tax hike but quietly instructed a few Republicans to skip a committee vote so that the bill would go the House floor. And despite his distaste for then-Gov. Timothy M. Kaine’s (D) smoking ban, he worked a deal there, too.

Howell, a man of average height whose graying sheepdog bangs are flung to the side, blends into the crowded corridors of Thomas Jefferson’s Capitol, just another gent in a business jacket and a tie, his head down hurrying somewhere as he talks with staff.

Yet he’s one of the most powerful men in Virginia, having served as the House of Delegates speaker for 10 years. Interviews with lawmakers, friends and family draw a picture of a deeply religious man who runs the House, the GOP caucus and his PAC in firm, sometimes high-handed ways. But he has also earned the respect of key Democrats. He likes a good practical joke, and even his foes can’t help but admire his wit, which he demonstrates every legislative session in his wisecracks and zingers from the speaker’s rostrum.

“He’s intellectually honest,” Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) said. “We’re all politicians. We all cast political votes. But Bill is pretty principled.”

Saslaw, who counts Howell as a personal friend, said even before Howell’s decision that he would respect him no matter how he ruled. And he, too, admires Howell’s skill at repartee. “He’s Johnny Carson quick,” Saslaw said.

Driven by faith, humor

Howell, 69, makes his living as a wills and trusts lawyer in a log cabin filled with stuffed hunting trophies on the Rappahannock River. He is business-friendly — to a fault, critics say — sometimes leading him to team up with groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council, a pro-business, free-market group he chaired in 2009.

Howell championed legislation, ghostwritten by ALEC, that would have shielded one company from paying asbestos-related health claims. The Fortune 500 firm — Crown Cork & Seal — said the legislation was necessary to save jobs at plants in Virginia; it also gave $8,000 to the PAC that Howell controls.

Howell grew up in Northern Virginia, one of four children born to a World Bank executive and an English mother whose father set up National Association of Local Government Officers. As a kid, he and a brother once conducted a capital trial of his sister’s dolls when she was out of the house. Mary Howell was not pleased to find them hanged when she returned.

The GOP scored 33 more seats in the House this election even though Democrats earned a million more votes in House races. Professor Jeremy Mayer says gerrymandering distorts democracy. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Clowning around nearly cost Howell his life while an undergraduate at the University of Richmond, when he reached over a banister in a dorm and fell five stories onto concrete. He was in a coma for 18 hours.

“He should have been killed,” said his younger brother, Chuck Howell, an engineer in Loudoun County. “The next day . . . he just sort of opened his eyes and said: ‘Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?’ ” Except for some initial dizziness and headaches, he was fine.

His wife of 46 years, Cessie, is a Marylander, and while she moved to Virginia, he swapped his church for hers. A devout Baptist, he teaches Sunday school at his church and has not only traveled to Israel with his church to see the places where Jesus walked, but he also has taken a cruise with his wife that retraced St. Paul’s steps in the Middle East.

He was one of the original four delegates to start a prayer group that meets at 7 a.m. every Wednesday and jokes that he’s the only one still in the House while the other original members — including McDonnell — have moved on. Today the prayer group attracts 30 or more, men and women, Republicans and Democrats, including the governor sometimes.

When he’s in Richmond, after hitting the treadmill at his hotel, he will call his wife to share a moment of prayer. Howell said he often reflects on the Epistle of St. James’s meditation on faith and action: “Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” To Howell, the passage is a reminder that good deeds alone are not enough to win salvation. But good deeds are also the necessary consequence of true faith.

He drives a silver Lincoln Town Car with the number one on the license plate. Every Saturday, he takes a stroll with a group of friends around Fredericksburg, capped by a stop at the Hyperion Espresso coffee shop. When he meets for breakfast with buddies at another regular haunt a few times a week, he usually orders the same meal: eggs and sausage that must be well done, or he might send it back.

They talk politics and joke, as the speaker loves to do in almost any setting. At his older brother’s wedding reception years ago, Howell strode through the hotel lobby and came upon a man at an automated blood pressure machine.

“Bill hovered behind him, and Bill said, ‘I’m a doctor,’ ” the speaker’s younger brother, Chuck Howell, recalled. “And the cuff collapsed and these numbers came up and Bill said, ‘Mmm, mmm, mmm,’ and started shaking his head.”

“What is it?” the man wanted to know. “Are those numbers not good?”

“And he said, ‘Mmm, mmm, mmm,’ and walked away.”

Stickler for the rules

Howell became speaker in 2003 after S. Vance Wilkins resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal. Howell was the sleeper candidate whom everyone liked and no one viscerally opposed.

“The Republicans were looking for somebody who was squeaky clean, with a lot of integrity, and they picked Bill — and they picked the right guy,” Saslaw said.

But Howell followed his predecessor’s legacy in one way: Wilkins, the first Republican to rule the chamber in 100 years, instituted a number of reforms, including bringing some strictness and objectivity to germaneness rules. Those rules came into play this week, as Howell decided Senate Republicans had gone too far when they tacked an entirely redrawn state Senate map onto a bill calling for minor “technical adjustments” to House districts.

Howell also was conservative on social issues such as abortion, but he primarily focused on promoting business-friendly policies. And pragmatic, he was willing to cut a deal to get things done.

In the years since, a more confrontational GOP brand has taken hold, and those Republicans believe Howell is not conservative enough, or at least too willing to compromise. They’ve grumbled this year as he signed onto McDonnell’s transportation plan, which includes tax and fee hikes, and tried to keep a lid on the social issues that consumed the 2012 session.

Behind closed doors in caucus meetings, Howell takes a top-down approach, preferring to convey decisions of the leadership in tightly scripted meetings rather than spend hours in debate.

“The speaker definitely likes to have things go his way,” said U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R), who served as majority leader under Howell. “He and I didn’t always agree, but we had a good working relationship. I have great respect for the speaker.”

Some caucus members say Howell can be vindictive and petty, removing people from coveted committee assignments if they don’t do his bidding and killing bills he doesn’t like. After advising his caucus of his plans to kill the redistricting plan, they asked for a break in the House proceedings to vent for more than an hour behind closed doors — without Howell present.

“He’s the epitome of all that’s wrong with politicians,” said Jeffrey M. Frederick, who clashed with Howell as a former Prince William County delegate and former chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia. “He’s all about power without purpose. And it’s a shame, because he didn’t start out that way.”

Frederick accuses the speaker of sacrificing conscience for job security and using coercion, not persuasion, to lead.

But first-term Del. Israel O’Quinn (R-Grayson) said the speaker was gracious when he went to his office last year to find funding for a prison in southwest Virginia that was already open but still vacant at a time when his community, with unemployment at 11 percent, was counting on those 300 or more prison jobs.

“I haven’t gone to his office many times. But he sat down every single time with me, even if he had other appointments,” O’Quinn said. “I didn’t get the answer I wanted. But I didn’t feel degraded or walk out feeling like a dumb freshman.”

This year, about $17 million for the prison was attached to the budget bill."

We elected people in the house to stop you. That's what elections are for and its not all about you and what you want.

From Reagan to Obama, in the past 8 Presidential Election cycles Republicans have won 5 times, and Democrats have won 3 times. So, Mr. President. . . . .What's your point???

This is kinda complicated, so I don't expect no teabagger to keep up: Democrats won the House popular vote by over 1 million. An artificial gerrymandered delivered a GOP majority. 50 teabaggers and their Senate papi effectively eliminated that GOP majority. So in the end, it was Democrats that made the House work.Popular vote winners:

Reagan

Reagan

Bush I

Clinton

Clinton

Gore

Bush II

Obama

Obama

That's nine presidential elections. Democrats won five of them. Better yet, Democrats have won five of the last six.

Still, I'm confused... Republicans get to throw tenter tantrums because Reagan was once president?



They did win elections! I know the DICTATOR doesnt respect the PEOPLES HOUSE but all of those republicans were elected and most of them campaigned on getting rid of his crappy healthcare law. He speaks of bipartisanship but his actions are totally the opposite. When Obama says WE WONT NEGOTIATE, how is that being bipartisan? He acts like a spoiled child. The reason he wont negotiate is because he simply doesnt know how to. He has never worked anywhere in the real world. He is a community organizer. He only knows how to rant and rave, picket and complain and beat his opponents into submission. Its like dealing with a child who just pisses and moans until the parent gives in. Unfortunately its been effective with this republican leadership that has little or no spine.The left's idea of compromise is that they get thier way no matter what. Compromise to them is simply to tell our side the we're really lucky that they didnt scew us even more. For example they say: We wanted a single payer system but we compromised with this free market solution by allowing private companies to be the insurance providers. We on the right hear them say: We could have went full blown communist on you but we compromised and only went socialist/facist on you.

1. We are not a democracy, we are a Constitutional Republic. 2. This is not a winner takes all political system. 3. You can only draw from a poisoned well so many times.

The most loyal voting bloc for the Dems. is the bloc of freeloading, panhandling, gimmee, gimmee, bums. It is tough to beat Santa Claus.

If we ever have an honest election again, we need voter I.D., no illegal aliens, no dead voters, no one voting multiple times, no disallowing of the military vote, no district with over 100% voter turnout, you would not be so quick to say that

STFU. I am your lord and god and thou shalt not oppose me. I'm growing tired of this whining little boy who really believes no one should criticize him. Grow up Little Man. We had thousands of Americans who died to free us from despots and I'll continue to speak out as long I have breath in my lungs.

Phukin Ni****ER.

We did...they're called Tea Party Republicans in the House of Representatives. And there will be more after the 2014 mid-terms.

IMPEACH OBAMA NOW! This illegal alien has committed at least 50 impeachable acts against the Constitution. He is a walking Hitler incarnate who will murder millions of Americans with his ""change"".

Our national elections are as rigged as anything in Stalin's USSR! The illegal alien Obama was never elected...he was SElected, twice; and his agenda is the total destruction of the USA and the murder of tens of millions. This will allow the confiscation of all our wealth by the Jewish international banking cartel so they can invest in that slave labor nation, China. George Soros and his band of Hebrew gangsters are pulling all of Obama's strings. They are merely the latest in the continuing sacking of the wealthiest nations on earth and the murder of millions. HITLER was financed and set up by Jewish banksters on Wall Street; and so is Obama!

Obama: 'Go Out There and Win an Election' if You Want to Oppose My Agenda Well...those WI Democrat Senators didn't seem to get that message, Mr. President.

From the communist sneaker who stole into the first term by hiding his past, and stole into the second using the IRS to suppress his opponents. And now he wants an election crony in the military in charge of DHS. Posse comitatus, destroyed from the top. Time for the jackboots. Go to H377 you evil communist, Frank Marshall POTUS. Go to H377.

If Oblamo throws the gauntlet down, the least we can do is accept the challenge. We can start by primary'ing McConnell. Heck, even Ed Schultz wants McConnell around. Was slobbering over all the pork projects McConnell votes for.

Republican won 230 elections, ya dumba$$.

Hey, Mr. Community Organizer. Just because conservatives lost the election and you won doesn't mean that they will allow you to destroy this country. The inept and incompetent Obama as President is so far in over his head on doing the job someone needs to step in and do the job right or at least the way it should be done.

How about we just drag this fraud out of office and dispatch him as a traitor?

Those are the most evil eyes I have ever seen.

I think he really is the Anti Christ .....

Throw this guy out now while were still alive.

The Nuremberg trials will get this traitor sooner or later.

False flags will commence now , probably another this week for punishment .

He is evil.

Yeah, sure, go try to win an election now that the dims have hacked the electronic voting system and have a completely untraceable way to modify the election results in any county they so desire. Just a few close counties flipped is all it will take. So, go ahead, try to win against that.

I oppose you WITHOUT an election, you little puzzy!

Come and get me.

Hey Hey IRS

Look at what I said today!

The Black Socialist Dick #Obama and Ugly looking Communist Democrats are afraid of the ""New"" Tea Party taking over in 2016. Thanks to the Christian Extremists and the Almighty power of Jesus Christ the one and only King of ""ALL"" Kings & Lord of ""ALL"" Lords. Obama is a Loner!!!

Democrats NEVER compromise! Well, except that one time they compromised. And sure, it was a HUGE compromise because they did things the way WE wanted to, but, WHY WON'T THEY COMPROMISE?What about a well full of Tea Party Kool-Aid? When does that run out?Why do people vote for people who are generous and kind and beloved and dedicated to bringing joy to the masses and kinda jolly? They should vote for Genghis Kahn instead.Ithard to cover up evidence of five million undocumented immigrants and dead voters voting!Boy?How many ""g""s does that racist think is in that word?They won FIFTY elections in the House. Why won't Obama let them decide them everything?FIFTY? Adorable! Every teabagger member in the House chipped in with a fantasy impeachable act.It was right there on his ""issues"" page: the murder of tens of millions, and he wasselected president by the sheeple!You mean the ones that tried to effect change with ... elections?Go to hett?I don't think Obama was talking about pri-- Ah hell, that'swhat he was talking about: beating Mitch McConnell. Lamar Alexander too. And Susan Collins. You know what? Just go whole hog and primary all of them.With fewer votes than the Democrats who won about 201. Because that's what happens in republics, apparently.Why rehash the GOP's 2012 election message, given how poorly it performed?Obama: Win an electionTeabagger: Sorry no-can-do. Maybe sedition instead?He gave himself away when he fought for expanded access to health care. Only Satan would want such evil.It'll be pretty awesome when he's shipped back in time to 1946 to stand trial.Democrats are so incompetent that they have a system to rig elections in completely untraceable ways ... AND FORGOT TO USE IT IN THE HOUSE!IRS is busy. Can we stick you in a FEMA concentration camp instead?""Obama is kinda of anti-social!"" is the nicest thing any Breitbarter has said Obama ... perhaps ever?"

They are the national leaders of No Labels.

Much ink has been spilled over what’s wrong with Washington.

The rise of partisan media, too much money in politics and congressional gerrymandering that rewards ideologues with safe seats have all been offered as diagnoses for government dysfunction.

These explanations are accurate — but almost totally irrelevant to the urgent challenges at hand.

The American people can’t just hope for the creation of a better “system.” Reducing money in politics and building a better election system are worthy and important endeavors — but they are tough, multi-year, state-by state slogs.

We need to attempt those things and to seek solutions now from the system and the leaders we already have. Businesses are not hiring, and investors are not investing as a direct result of the uncertainty created by Washington. Too many would-be workers are not working. The coming generations are being doomed to a worse standard of living than previous generations.

Knowing that should light a fire under everybody in Washington. But it hasn’t. The gridlock continues, most recently with the “fiscal cliff” fiasco, and the fight over the debt ceiling looms.

From our perspective, there is only one way for leaders in Washington to step up: They need an attitude adjustment. Everyone needs to be willing to sit down with anyone — conservative, liberal or anyone in between — to work together to achieve success for our nation. Everyone needs to recognize that principled and deeply held political beliefs don’t require an all-or-nothing approach to governance and that the letter behind a person’s name does not automatically make them stupid or treasonous.

To be clear, we are not naïve about the challenge of fostering cooperation across the aisle. There are philosophical differences between Democrats and Republicans that can’t be papered over with nice words about civility.

But adopting an attitude focused on problem solving is a deeply pragmatic response to Washington’s dysfunction. With Democrats controlling the Senate and Republicans controlling the House, no one can get everything they want. We will either work across the aisle to fix problems or we will achieve nothing.

Luckily, we are not the only ones who recognize this. On Monday morning, the group No Labels — a collection of Democrats, Republicans and independents dedicated to promoting a new politics of problem solving — will unveil two dozen “Problem Solvers”: a group of House and Senate members evenly split between Republicans and Democrats who have agreed to hold monthly meetings in 2013 to build trust across the aisle.

These forward-looking Americans include: Sens. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Reps. John Barrow (D-Ga.), Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.), Janice Hahn (D-Calif.), Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.), Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), Dave Loebsack (D-Iowa), Jim Moran (D-Va.), Reid Ribble (R-Wis.), Scott Rigell (R-Va.), Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.).

This is a big deal. While in past years members of Congress used to interact regularly with members of the opposite party, today members of Congress interact very little with people from the other party — or even members of their own party in the opposite body. Members’ daily lives are dominated by party caucus, policy and fundraising meetings that are focused on winning elections or destroying the opposing party. There isn’t much time left over to actually govern.

But the Problem Solvers can and will seek to change this. In the next year, No Labels’ grass-roots supporters will strive to expand the number of problem solvers, with a goal of recruiting 75 members by year’s end. This could transform how Washington works. And it won’t be long before members start hearing demands from their constituents to join the group. Millions of Americans who have tired of the hyper-partisanship have realized that there is an organized group that can finally give them a voice in our political system. They have gone to NoLabels.org and are telling their friends and neighbors to as well.

Despite the gloomy outlook in Washington, the United States has great potential and promise. The American people need their leaders in Washington to start supporting our economy and stop subtracting from it. We can begin tapping our potential the moment we stop taking score and begin taking steps to start solving problems. That’s the only realistic way forward for America."

In a recent MSNBC interview, he restocked his pantry of excuses for his disappointing results, announcing that “we have these big agencies, some of which are outdated, some of which are not designed properly”:

“We’ve got, for example, 16 different agencies that have some responsibility to help businesses, large and small, in all kinds of ways, whether it’s helping to finance them, helping them to export. . . . So, we’ve proposed, let’s consolidate a bunch of that stuff. The challenge we’ve got is that that requires a law to pass. And, frankly, there are a lot of members of Congress who are chairmen of a particular committee. And they don’t want necessarily consolidations where they would lose jurisdiction over certain aspects of certain policies.”

The dawn is coming up like thunder as Obama notices the sociology of government. He shows no sign, however, of drawing appropriate lessons from it.

Big government is indeed big, and like another big creature, the sauropod dinosaur, government has a primitive nervous system: The fact of an injury to the tail could take nearly a minute to be communicated to the sauropod brain.

Obama, of whose vast erudition we have been assured, seems unfamiliar with Mancur Olson ’s seminal “The Rise and Decline of Nations,” which explains how free societies become sclerotic. Their governments become encrusted with interest groups that preserve, like a fly in amber, an increasingly stultifying status quo. This impedes dynamism by protecting arrangements that have worked well for those powerful enough to put the arrangements in place. This blocks upward mobility for those less wired to power.

Caption From Trayvon Martin to Obamacare: Take a look at a selection of the stories that caught readers’ interests over the past year. Why liberals are panicked about Obamacare If Obamacare fails, “It will discredit Obama’s new liberalism for years to come.” By Charles Krauthammer Jessica Rinaldi/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue.

Obama, startled that components of government behave as interest groups, seems utterly unfamiliar with public choice theory. It demystifies and de-romanticizes politics by applying economic analysis — how incentives influence behavior — to government. It shows how elected officials and bureaucrats pursue personal aggrandizement as much as people do in the private sector. In the public sector’s profit motive, profit is measured by power rather than money.

Obama’s tardy epiphanies do not temper his enthusiasm for giving sauropod government ever-deeper penetration into society. He thinks this serves equality. Actually, big government inevitably drives an upward distribution of wealth to those whose wealth, confidence and sophistication enable them to manipulate government.

The day before Obama shared with MSNBC his conclusion that big government defends its irrationalities but is insufficiently big, his speech du jour deplored today’s increasing inequality and distrust of government. He seems oblivious to the mutual causations at work.

Of course Americans distrust one another more as more and more factions fight one another for preferential treatment by government. Of course government becomes drained of dignity, and becomes corrosive of social cohesion, as it becomes a bigger dispenser of inequality through benefits to those sufficiently clever and connected to work its levers.

Obama correctly says that not only do we “tend to trust our institutions less,” we also “tend to trust each other less.” Of course there are parallel increases in distrust: Government’s dignity diminishes as government grows to serve factions of those sophisticated at manipulating its allocation of preferences. Social solidarity is a casualty of government grown big because it recognizes no limits to its dispensing of favors.

Obama’s speech denounced “trickle-down ideology” and deplored growth that “has flowed to a fortunate few.” But the monetary policy he favors — very low interest rates, driving money into equities in search of higher yields — is a powerful engine of inequality. Since the Dow closed at 7,949 on Inauguration Day 2009, it has doubled , benefiting the 10 percent who hold 80 percent of directly owned stocks. The hope is that some of this wealth will trickle down.

Suppose there were not 16 government agencies “to help businesses, large and small, in all kinds of ways.” Suppose there were none. Such barnacles on big government institutionalize the scramble for government favors; these agencies are a standing incitement to bend public power for private advantage. Hence they increase distrust of government, diminish social solidarity and aggravate the most indefensible inequality — that driven by government dispensations.

Judd gave a speech on public health, followed by an audience question and answer session, at George Washington University’s School of Public Health and Health Services in the Foggy Bottom area of Washington, D.C. The event was Judd’s first real political trial balloon ahead of a rumored 2014 Democratic U.S. Senate bid in Kentucky – and she flopped.

During her speech, Judd described her initial decision to enter the Hollywood acting world over the activism world.

“I went to the other jungle: Hollywood,” Judd said to the audience of about 150 students. “There, I had instantaneous success much to my own – what would the word be? – I wouldn’t even say surprise because I didn’t even know it was success until I looked back on it last year. It just all happened so very fast.”

“I remember when I was going [to Hollywood], I was talking to a family friend, and I was still frightened,” Judd continued. “Amazingly, I was raised with someone who has the greatest voice of her generation in our own home yet I didn’t have a lot of stage education. I didn’t know what it meant to be an actor. So, I was scared. I was nervous. I was talking to this family friend and said, ‘you know, I’m still going to do a lot of service, I’m still going to help advocate that women need access to medically accurate sex education and have access to a full basket of family planning choices that are right for them.’ I went on to list the other things I was going to do and he said, ‘do you want to be an actor or do you want to save the world?'”

“In 2002, I was really sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Judd added. “I didn’t know what was wrong. I knew that I was just – something wasn’t quite right. At that time, it turns out, and I didn’t even know this, I was one of the highest paid women in the history of Hollywood.”

After admitting she is a card carrying member of the “One Percent,” the Americans Democrats routinely demonize, Judd went on to flub comment after comment throughout the rest of the event.

When she was describing how she “got sick and tired of my own pity for myself,” Judd struggled to pronounce the word “periphery” correctly.

Judd then name-dropped Bono.

“That very same day I got a call from Bono,” Judd said of the day an AIDS group asked her to help push their message. “No talk is ever complete without talking about Bono.”

“He’s amazing,” Judd said of Bono. “He’s the real deal.”

The actress went to explain how she determined “why women and girls end up in brothels,” telling the student audience that “baseline” it was “gender inequality.”

When Judd opened the floor up for questions, her struggles intensified. When asked by the dean of the college if she had advice for the community, Judd let the place know how wonderfully she thought of herself. “You know have no idea how much advice I have,” she said.

“I can’t wait to hear from the College Republicans,” Judd joked at another point, before any students asked her a question.

The first student questioner, a young woman who made sure to point out she was a Democrat, asked Judd to define “feminism.” Judd tackled it the best she could, after noting how “it’s really very simple.”

“We could spend the rest of the day talking about this,” Judd said. “We were all made in the image and likeness of our Creator. We’re all sacred, and we’re here to love each other and be equal. It’s very simple.”

As a second young woman wrapped up her question of Judd, the actress stopped paying attention. “Huh, I’m sorry, I was giving my mother eye kisses,” Judd said. Judd’s mother, Naomi Judd, was in the audience.

The dean was forced to re-ask the young woman’s question so Judd could answer it.

When asked about what role “faith” plays in her initiatives, Judd said “I’m just a surrogate for the people doing the grassroots work.”

“What I had to do was find a faith that would work for me under all causes and conditions,” Judd said. “In forcibly displaced persons camps, in child abuse children, in emergency rooms, in a brothel, in a labor slave camp, in an orphanage. You know how hard it is to walk out of an orphanage? My hands tingle. You feel the weight of the babies coming up behind.”

“Or to sit in a slum and see two sisters who are orphaned ask me to bring them home to America, because America is the place where dreams come true? Later I found out they rehearsed it because they so wanted to come home to America with me. That’s a depth for me, a spiritual depth.”

Another student asked her about garbage initiatives around the world. The student said she worked in India for a little while recently, and “the amount of garbage … I just could not get over it.”

“My question is how to we get anyone to care about their health when the first thing they probably need to care about is the dump of trash in front of their house or their slum, and that they don’t have running water?” the student asked Judd. “To me, that seems like the base…. I’m just wondering from what you’ve seen in your travels what your thoughts are on that.”

Judd used a homespun saying in her tortured response.

“My thought is that you found your pig,” Judd responded. “You should stick with your pig. What I mean by ‘pig’ is we all have to find the thing that makes us mad and the thing that gives us the fire in the belly and the passion and the stamina to stick with it. The ‘pig thing’ comes another good Eastern Kentuckian, my godmother. It was heavy-handed in my face.”

But other times, ill-advised casualness can go wrong, as it did during Alicia Keys’ much discussed performance at the Public Inaugural Ball at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, one of two official inaugural balls on Monday night.

The first mistake she made was to opt for a medley, as ungratifying a maneuver as can be done onstage. Beginning by tossing off a loose version of “New Day,” Keys traced out a minimal keyboard melody while singing an aspirational song about rebirth and renewal. Halfway through, though, and before she’d developed any sort of momentum, Keys switched to “Girl on Fire,” except with new lyrics she seemed to have banged out with little regard for meaning.

“He’s president and he’s on fire/Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway,” she sang, turning the autobiographical song of determination into an increasingly awkward presidential ode. “He’s living in a world and it’s on fire/Filled with catastrophe but he knows he can fly away,” she went on to sing, and to my ears the suggestion here is that the president just may cut and run when the going gets tough.

“He’s got both feet on the ground,” she continued, “and he’s burning it down/Got his head in the clouds/As he’s not backing down.” Did anyone else interpret that to mean he’s out of touch and stubborn? And how can anyone burn down the ground? She then went into a recast version of the song’s chorus: “Obama’s on fire! Obama’s on fire! He’s walking on fire! Obama’s on fire!”

Perhaps he’s the devil? No? Then, why in the following line did Keys sing, “Everyone stands as he goes by/They can see the flames that’s in his eyes/Watch him as he’s lighting up the night.” OK, maybe I misread it. She was just saying he’s a charismatic guy.

Then Keys acknowledged that the president, hot though he may be, is taken -- “Everyone knows Michelle is his girl/And together they run the world -- and we’re gonna let it burn, let it burn,” and in these lyrics she seemingly confirmed the fear of many right-wing conspiracy theorists.

“Obama’s on fire,” concluded Keys. Good to know. Maybe Hank Williams Jr. could cover the song next.

And now, it appears establishment 'Pubs are willing to roll out the big guns in their battle with Randy and the Cruz-ers.

The New York Times reports this morning that the National Republican Senatorial Committee has given notice to longtime 'Pub ad house Jamestown Associates that the NRSC will not be contracting any ad campaigns with Jamestown this cycle. The reason? Jamestown has produced spots and bought time for candidates backed by Jim DeMint's Conservatives Fund, which has been targeting sitting GOP senators with right-side primary challenges.

Party campaign committees, while of dubious value in actually convincing voters to get to the polls, control impressive war chests, and the NRSC's shot across Jamestown's bow is a signal that establishment 'Pubs aren't going to take Tea Party primary challenges lying down, but are prepared to fight back with the biggest guns they've got--the green ones.

Meanwhile, the ongoing war of words between the factions continues unabated. A couple of choice quotes from the Times piece may amuse.



“We’re not going to do business with people who profit off of attacking Republicans,” said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the committee. “Purity for profit is a disease that threatens the Republican Party.”

“This is happening because Mitch McConnell is having a complete meltdown,” said Matt Hoskins, executive director of the conservative group. “He can’t defend his record so he’s threatening and attacking everyone who disagrees with him. He’s so rattled, he has decided to declare war on the entire conservative movement, which represents the very people he needs to win re-election. This isn’t the behavior of a confident person. It’s the irrational reaction of a power-hungry bully who isn’t getting his way.”

“S.C.F. has been wandering around the country destroying the Republican Party like a drunk who tears up every bar they walk into,” said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell’s chief of staff, now detailed to the National Republican Senatorial Committee through the election. “The difference this cycle is that they strolled into Mitch McConnell’s bar and he doesn’t throw you out, he locks the door.”

Stay tuned for more dispatches from the front. Or just wait for the rumble and the smell of powder."

(CNN) —

In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown, three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don’t deserve to be re-elected.

A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans’ policies are too extreme. And according to the poll, Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections, there’s plenty of time for these numbers to change.

CNN Poll: House Republicans, Boehner take big post-shutdown hit

The poll was conducted Friday through Sunday, just after the end of the 16-day partial federal government shutdown that was sparked in part by an effort by House conservatives to dismantle the health care law, which is President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement.

A majority of those questioned blamed congressional Republicans for the government shutdown and said the President was the bigger winner in the deal to end the crisis.

The survey also found nearly eight in 10 saying the shutdown was bad for the country, and the standoff has led to a loss of confidence and satisfaction in government. And more than seven in 10 think that another shutdown is likely.

Anger directed at congressional Republicans

More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don’t deserve to be re-elected, with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn’t deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling.

“Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular, the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents,” CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.

Defeated GOP hopes to unite, fight another day

Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don’t deserved to be re-elected, 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don’t deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill.

Democrats hold early 2014 polling lead

The shutdown seems to be making an impact on polls asking the generic ballot question: Would you vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in your congressional district. There is no mention of the names of any candidates.

Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district, with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll.

While the generic ballot is a much-watched gauge, it’s important to remember that the battle for the House is a district-by-district fight, rather than a national race, and just 17 of the 232 House Republicans are in districts won by Obama in last year’s election.

Obama wants new approach after shutdown

“We’re a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House,” Holland cautioned. “There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the ‘generic ballot’ question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot.”

The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010, thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup.

GOP too extreme?

One major concern for Republicans is the growing number of Americans who think the party is too extreme. Fifty-six percent now feel that way, up from 48% in March. By contrast, 52% say that the policies of the Democrats are generally mainstream (with 42% saying they are too extreme), which is unchanged since March.

“Any connection with the tea party movement isn’t helping the GOP,” Holland added. “Six in 10 Americans now believe that the tea party movement is too extreme; only one in four consider it to be generally mainstream.”

The poll indicates that Republicans themselves are divided on whether the 4 1/2-year-old grassroots conservative movement is too extreme or generally mainstream.

Four things we learned from government shutdown

Blame Game

Fifty-two percent say congressional Republicans were more responsible for the shutdown, with 34% pointing more fingers at the President. At 45%-36%, independents place more blame with the GOP in Congress.

The poll indicates Obama was the clear winner. Sixty-four percent say the President got more of what he wanted out of the deal to end the shutdown, with less than one in five saying the GOP in Congress were the winners. More than seven in 10 Republicans and conservatives agree that Obama got more of what he wanted.

Fifty-five percent of the public say the GOP strategy to link dismantling parts of Obamacare to funding the government was a mistake, with 42% saying it made sense at the time. While vast majority of Democrats say the strategy was a mistake, independents are divided, and most Republicans say the move made sense.

The next shutdown ?

While the GOP doesn’t fare well in the poll, the poll suggests that the public is looking for almost as much compromise from the Democrats as from the Republicans in any bipartisan agreements.

Forty-nine percent say the Republicans should give up more than the Democrats in any future bipartisan agreement, but nearly as many – 44% – would prefer to see the Dems give up more than the GOP.

And seven in 10 say that another shutdown is likely when current funding for the federal government runs out in mid-January.

“That’s probably because Americans have lost confidence in the people who run government,” Holland said.

According to the poll, only a third say they have a great deal or some confidence in the people who run government, down 10 points since May. And only 14% say they are satisfied with the way the nation is being governed.

“That’s an 11-point drop since March and is lower than the 26% who felt that way in September of 1973, when the Watergate crisis was in full swing,” Holland added.

In another sign of anti-Washington sentiment, six in 10 say the government should not do more to solve the country’s problems.

Updated 9:32 p.m. ET 7/8/2013

(CNN) – Gracie Mansion isn't the only contested hotspot for political redemption in New York City this year.

The day after former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced his campaign for city comptroller, he was issued a direct challenge for the post by a woman who says she was the madam who supplied him with escorts.



Self-described ""ex-madam"" Kristin Davis used Spitzer's campaign to once again announce her already-declared candidacy for comptroller on Monday.

""Eliot Spitzer broke state and federal laws in his use of prostitutes and paid no penalty; I broke the law and paid my debt to society,"" Davis, who served four months in prison, said in a statement. ""There cannot be two standards of justice, one for the average citizen and another for the political and social elite.""

Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned as governor in 2008 amidst a scandal surrounding his use of prostitutes.

Spitzer: 'You need skin as thick as a rhinoceros'

Davis, a former hedge fund senior vice president, first filed with the city campaign finance board in September of 2012 to run for city-wide office. The exact post she was seeking was not specified at the time. She filed to run specifically for comptroller in June, according to the board. Her campaign now needs at least 3,750 signatures to qualify for the ballot.

This is not Davis' first go at public office, nor her first time using the title of ""Elliot Spitzer's madam"" in her campaign. She ran as a protest candidate for New York governor in 2010.

Now running as a Libertarian with a plan to legalize marijuana in New York City, Davis first announced her campaign in April. She did so in a release challenging the other major candidate for city comptroller, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer.

""I have more financial management experience than either Eliot Spitzer or Scott Stringer,"" Davis said in her statement Monday. ""They are both career politicians looking to use the office of Comptroller as a stepping stone to higher office.""

Stringer had originally been considered a candidate for mayor until he instead announced a candidacy for comptroller. He left a crowded field of mayoral contenders that has become increasingly complicated, particularly by the official candidacy of former Congressman Anthony Weiner.

Weiner quickly found himself at the head of the race for the Democratic primary, polls show. This despite having resigned from office in 2011 after he was caught sending lewd photos of himself on Twitter.

Polls: Weiner gaining ground in NYC mayoral battle

Spitzer and Weiner make two current New York City candidates whose sexual improprieties led to falls from power. And they are not alone.

This has become the season of political resurrection, a season best exemplified by Republican Rep. Mark Sanford's successful campaign for the U.S House of Representatives.

The final vote, which was held after the Senate worked well past midnight churning through dozens of amendments, exposed cracks in Democratic unity as lawmakers facing re-election peeled off, citing the proposal's failure to tackle the deficit. In the end, the budget plan squeaked by on a razor-thin 50-49 vote.

Four Democrats opposed it, and one did not vote.

The defections, while amounting to only a handful, nevertheless could spell trouble for Democratic leaders as they head into the next phase of negotiations with House Republicans. Leaders could be pressured by their more moderate members to make a bigger push to balance the budget, even if they don't want to make the kinds of major changes to entitlements that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., prescribes.

Sen. Mark Begich, a moderate Democrat from Alaska, proudly announced Saturday that he opposed the Senate's plan because of its copious red ink.

""While I am happy that Congress is finally talking seriously about our fiscal crisis, this budget didn't go far enough,"" Begich said. ""Alaskans expect us to finish the job and make this staggering deficit manageable. Passing this problem off to our children is not an option.""

Though Democrats say Ryan is relying on unrealistic projections and changes, the House Republican budget aims to eliminate deficits over the next 10 years -- on paper, anyway. The Senate Democrats' budget doesn't come close, despite raising taxes by $1 trillion. Under their plan, the deficit over the next decade never dips below $400 billion and would hover at or near $600 billion by 2023.

This, as Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions repeatedly notes, would add $7.3 trillion to the national debt over that period.

""The content of the plan the majority has now approved demonstrates why they were unwilling to reveal it for so long: their proposal, once accurately understood, cannot be publicly defended,"" Sessions said in a statement.

House Republicans were not without defections of their own. Ten Republicans opposed Ryan's 2014 plan earlier this week. But the Republicans' budget resolution still passed by a more comfortable margin in the House than the Democrats' did in the Senate.

The four Senate Democrats who voted against the Democrats' bill were Kay Hagan, D-N.C.; Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Mark Pryor, D-Ark.; and Begich. But there are more up for re-election in 2014 in moderate-to-conservative states where votes for a deficit-heavy budget plan would cause campaign problems.

President Obama plans to release his own 2014 budget next month, an unveiling that will be studied for whether it signals a willingness to engage Republicans in negotiations or play political hardball.

The Democratic budget's $975 billion in new taxes would be matched by an equal amount of spending reductions coming chiefly from health programs, defense and reduced interest payments as deficits get smaller than previously anticipated. This year's projected deficit of nearly $900 billion would fall to around $700 billion next year and bottom out near $400 billion in 2016 before trending upward again. Shoehorned into the package is $100 billion for public works projects and other programs aimed at creating jobs.

Neither the Democratic nor Republican plan will clear Congress in its current form -- plus each is just a blueprint which by itself does not appropriate money.

Democrats and Republicans will now launch into hard bargaining, and each make sacrifices if they are to settle on a bona fide budget, as opposed to passing stopgap spending bills to fund the government year after year.

The White House on Saturday again reiterated its displeasure with the House Republican plan, which does not call for tax hikes on anybody.

""The House Republican budget refuses to ask for a single dime of deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and the well-connected but instead makes deep cuts to education and manufacturing while asking seniors and the middle class to pay more,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

He said the Senate plan would ""create jobs and cut the deficit in a balanced way."" Carney said it is time for Congress ""to come together to find common ground.""

Begich laid out a series of novel proposals for cutting spending further, including: preventing people making more than $1 million from receiving jobless benefits; allowing senators to give back part of their salary; and cracking down on wasteful spending in the farm subsidy program.

It would take more than that to bring the budget into balance.

The blueprint from Ryan claims $4 trillion more in savings over the period than Senate Democrats by digging deeply into health care and food benefits and other safety net programs. It would also transform the health care program for older Americans into a voucher-like system for future recipients. Many Democrats, who say the sequester has cut too deep as it is, are resisting further cuts to domestic spending as well as the specific changes Ryan wants to make to health care entitlements.

""We have presented very different visions for how our country should work and who it should work for,"" said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who chairs the Senate Budget Committee. ""But I am hopeful that we can bridge this divide.""

The Justice Department on Thursday redoubled its efforts to challenge state voting laws, suing Texas over its new voter ID measure as part of a growing political showdown over electoral rights.

The move marked the latest bid by the Obama administration to counter a Supreme Court ruling that officials have said threatens the voting rights of minorities. It also signaled that the administration will probably take legal action in voting rights cases in other states, including North Carolina, where the governor signed a voter ID law this month.

The Supreme Court in June invalidated a key section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that had forced certain jurisdictions to receive approval from the Justice Department or a federal court before changing their voting laws. The ruling, however, did not preclude the Obama administration from using other sections of the law.

On Thursday, the Justice Department said it will rely on another section of the act to contend that the Texas voter ID measure was “adopted with the purpose, and will have the result, of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.”

The Texas law sets strict requirements for the types of government-issued photo ID that must be presented at polling places. Texas argues that the requirements are intended to curb voter fraud. The suit filed by Justice says the state “knew or should have known that Hispanic and African-American Texans disproportionately lack the forms of photo ID required” by the law.

Read the document Justice Dept. voter ID complaint The Justice Department's court filing in its lawsuit against the state of Texas's new voter photo identification law.

“We will not allow the Supreme Court’s recent decision to be interpreted as open season for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement. “We will keep fighting aggressively to prevent voter disenfranchisement. . . . This represents the department’s latest action to protect voting rights, but it will not be our last.”

Texas Republicans said the move smacked of federal interference and vowed to fight it. The lawsuit drew a particularly sharp response from Gov. Rick Perry, who accused Holder and President Obama of filing “endless litigation in an effort to obstruct the will of the people of Texas.”

“We will continue to defend the integrity of our elections against this administration’s blatant disregard for the 10th Amendment,” Perry said. The amendment sets limits on federal powers.

Sen. John Cornyn (R), a member of the Judiciary Committee and a former Texas attorney general, struck a similar note of outrage. “Facts mean little to a politicized Justice Department bent on inserting itself into the sovereign affairs of Texas and a lame-duck Administration trying to turn our state blue,” Cornyn said in a statement. “As Texans we reject the notion that the federal government knows what’s best for us.”

Holder announced last month that the department will support a separate lawsuit in Texas brought by a coalition of Democratic legislators and civil rights groups against a Republican-drawn redistricting plan. It submitted a “statement of interest” to the court and asked it to require Texas to submit all voting law changes for approval.

On Thursday, the department took a further step in that case, asking the federal court in Texas to formally allow it to become a party to the suit.

In both the voter ID and the redistricting case, the department asked that Texas again be required to submit to pre-clearance of any changes to its voting laws.

The Voting Rights Act required states with a history of discrimination to be granted approval by the Justice Department or courts before they could change their voting laws. In its June ruling in Shelby County v. Holder , the Supreme Court did not strike down the law but said Congress must come up with a new formula to determine which states should be subject to special scrutiny.

Legal experts said the Justice Department has various legal tools to counter the Supreme Court ruling. “They are trying a bunch of things,” said Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine.

Experts noted that some of those approaches might not be effective. The provision the Justice Department is using to challenge the Texas voter ID law, for example, has traditionally been used for redistricting cases, according to Spencer Overton, a law professor at George Washington University.

“Congress needs to act to update the Voting Rights Act” because existing legal tools are inadequate for these kinds of cases, said Overton, who served as principal deputy for legal policy in the Justice Department during Obama’s first term.

Hasen said the Justice Department’s recent actions signaled an admission that Congress may be unwilling to act. As a result, the administration will be forced to challenge electoral laws on a case-by-case basis.

The next state to be challenged, experts say, could be North Carolina. The new voter ID law there includes requirements that critics say will make voting harder, especially for racial minorities. Last week, civil rights groups filed a lawsuit challenging it.

The 5-4 ruling on Tuesday addressed a 1960s-era provision that largely singled out states and districts in the South -- those with a history of discrimination -- and required them to seek federal permission to change their voting laws.

The court ruled that the formula determining which states are affected was unconstitutional.

In doing so, the court potentially opened the door for certain states to proceed with voter ID laws and other efforts that to date had been held up because of the Voting Rights Act. Prominent among those are voter identification laws in Alabama and Mississippi.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott also put out a lengthy statement vowing to proceed with both a voter ID law and potentially a new set of redistricting maps without federal oversight.

More On This...

""Today's ruling ensures that Texas is no longer one of just a few states that must seek approval from the federal government before its election laws can take effect,"" he said. ""With today's decision, the state's voter ID law will take effect immediately. Redistricting maps passed by the Legislature may also take effect without approval from the federal government.""

Attorney General Eric Holder warned states against going too far. He said the Justice Department would not hesitate to take ""swift"" action against states looking to ""take advantage"" of the ruling.

He, like President Obama, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision, saying discriminatory practices live on and need to be addressed.

""These problems have not been consigned to history,"" Holder said.

Holder and Obama urged Congress to create a new formula.

""Today's decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent,"" Obama said.

But their statements acknowledged that until Congress intervenes, officials' hands are largely tied when it comes to screening particular states.

The court effectively determined that the law, which Congress most recently renewed in 2006, relied on old data that does not reflect racial progress and changes in U.S. society.

""In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25 years, but the coverage formula was not changed. Coverage still turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test in the 1960s or1970s, and had low voter registration or turnout at that time,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.

He clarified that the provision requiring advance approval of voting law changes -- known as Section 5 -- was not being struck down. Rather, the court found that the provision pertaining to the formula, known as Section 4, was unconstitutional.

The decision, though, challenges the overall practice of federal screening unless and until Congress addresses the formula.

The decision means that a host of state and local laws that have not received Justice Department approval or have not yet been submitted will be able to take effect.

Going forward, the outcome alters the calculus of passing election-related legislation in the affected states and local jurisdictions. The threat of an objection from Washington has hung over election-related proposals for nearly a half century. At least until Congress acts, that deterrent now is gone.

Roberts argued that these states and the conditions in them have ""changed dramatically"" over the years.

""The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years. Yet the Act has not eased (Section 5's) restrictions or narrowed the scope of (Section 4's) coverage formula along the way. Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented features have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they have grown even stronger,"" Roberts wrote.

The court warned of problems with the voting rights law in a similar case heard in 2009. The justices averted a major constitutional ruling at that time, but Congress did nothing to address the issues the court raised. The law's opponents, sensing its vulnerability, filed several new lawsuits.

The latest decision came in a challenge to the advance approval, or preclearance, requirement, which was brought by Shelby County, Ala., a Birmingham suburb.

The lawsuit acknowledged that the measure's strong medicine was appropriate and necessary to counteract decades of state-sponsored discrimination in voting, despite the Fifteenth Amendment's guarantee of the vote for black Americans.

But it asked whether there was any end in sight for a provision that intrudes on states' rights to conduct elections, an issue the court's conservative justices also explored at the argument in February. It was considered an emergency response when first enacted in 1965.

The county noted that the 25-year extension approved in 2006 would keep some places under Washington's oversight until 2031 and seemed not to account for changes that include the elimination of racial disparity in voter registration and turnout or the existence of allegations of race-based discrimination in voting in areas of the country that are not subject to the provision.

The Obama administration and civil rights groups said there is a continuing need for it and pointed to the Justice Department's efforts to block voter ID laws in South Carolina and Texas last year, as well as the redistricting plan in Texas that a federal court found discriminated against the state's large and growing Hispanic population.

Advance approval was put into the law to give federal officials a potent tool to defeat persistent efforts to keep blacks from voting.

The provision was a huge success because it shifted the legal burden and required governments that were covered to demonstrate that their proposed changes would not discriminate. Congress periodically has renewed it over the years. The most recent extension was overwhelmingly approved by a Republican-led Congress and signed by President George W. Bush.

The requirement currently applies to the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. It also covers certain counties in California, Florida, New York, North Carolina and South Dakota, and some local jurisdictions in Michigan. Coverage has been triggered by past discrimination not only against blacks, but also against American Indians, Asian-Americans, Alaska Natives and Hispanics.

Towns in New Hampshire that had been covered by the law were freed from the advance approval requirement in March. Supporters of the provision pointed to the ability to bail out of the prior approval provision to argue that the law was flexible enough to accommodate change and that the court should leave the Voting Rights Act intact.

But in case you want to see what that looks like in the polling composite, it's as glorious as you might imagine:



In my decades of polling, I recall only one moment when a party had been driven as far from the center as the Republican Party has been today [...] I see little reason to believe that the staunch conservative bloc will wither away or splinter; it will remain a dominant force in the GOP and on the national stage. At the same time, however, I see no indication that its ideas about policy, governance and social issues will gain new adherents. They are far beyond the mainstream.

Democrats need to win the popular vote in 2014 by about seven points to take the House. So far, so good. It's early, obviously, but who doesn't like those trends? And it's not as if the GOP is doing the things it needs to do to reverse them. As legendary pollster Andrew Kohut (founder of Pew and president of Gallup when they were good) notes:The GOP's dilemma is obvious: evolve now, and risk a massive backlash among its base, rendering it unelectable for along freakin' time. Don't evolve, and remain far from the American mainstream, rendering it unelectable forever. It's a lose-lose situation, which in all truth, is everything the GOP deserves."

Four years ago, the movement and its potent mix of anger and populism persuaded thousands of costumed and sign-waving conservatives to protest the ballooning deficit and President Obama's health care law. It swept a crop of no-compromise lawmakers into Congress and governor's offices and transformed political up-and-comers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, into household names.

But as many Tea Party stars seek re-election next year and Rubio considers a 2016 presidential run, conservative activists are finding themselves at a crossroads. Many of their standard-bearers have embraced more moderate positions on bedrock issues such as immigration and health care, broadening their appeal in swing states but dampening grass-roots passion.

""They keep sticking their finger in the eyes of the guys who got them elected,"" said Ralph King, a co-founder of the Cleveland Tea Party Patriots. ""A lot of people are feeling betrayed.""

The Tea Party is a loosely knit web of activists, and some are hoping to rekindle the fire with 2014 primary challenges to wayward Republicans. But many more say they plan to sit out high-profile races in some important swing states next year, a move that GOP leaders fear could imperil the re-election prospects of former tea party luminaries, including the governors of Florida and Ohio.'

""It changes the playing field for us,"" said Tom Gaitens, former Florida director of FreedomWorks, a political action committee that has spent millions of dollars to help tea party candidates. ""The most powerful thing we have as a movement is our feet and our vote.""

In the summer of 2009, tea party supporters stormed congressional town hall meetings, shouting down lawmakers who had voted for the bank bailout and the stimulus package. The movement's voice grew louder after Democrats passed the health care overhaul, and voters took their outrage to the polls in 2010. The Tea Party wave stunned Democrats and many moderate Republicans, sweeping the GOP into control of the House and changing the balance of power in many statehouses.

But not long after some tea party stars took office, political analysts said, they were forced to adapt to a changing landscape, particularly in states Obama won in 2012, and to the realities of governing.

The Tea Party also fell out of favor with many people. At its height after the 2010 elections, a CBS News poll found that 31 percent of those surveyed considered themselves tea party supporters. A May survey found just 24 percent identified with the movement.

Facing sagging approval ratings, tea party Republicans, some of whom were elected by slim margins, shifted tactics.

Fla. Gov. Rick Scott, a former health care company executive who won office by attacking the health law and calling for deep cuts to state spending, has embraced the health law and signed one of the largest budgets in state history, complete with pay raises for teachers. Similarly, Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, and Rick Snyder, R-Mich., are battling their GOP-dominated legislatures to expand Medicaid, a big part of the health law.

Tea Party supporters were most struck by Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. His personal story and unlikely rise to power made him perhaps the most prominent figure in the movement.

As a Senate candidate in 2010, he denounced as ""amnesty"" any plan that would offer a path to citizenship for those who were in the country illegally. Yet in recent months, he has emerged as a leader of a bipartisan Senate group that developed a plan that includes such a provision. The plan has been panned by conservatives but ultimately could bolster Rubio's standing with Hispanics, a growing demographic group that has voted overwhelmingly Democratic in recent years.

One sweltering July day, a half-dozen tea party protesters gathered under a tree in front of Rubio's Miami office, seeking shade as they denounced his support for an immigration overhaul. But the protest soon turned into more of a support group, with the four men and two women grousing to each other about how Rubio had turned into a ""back-stabber,"" a ""liar"" and a ""flip-flopper.""

Juan Fiol, a real estate broker who organized the protest, kept looking at his phone, waiting for calls from fellow tea party supporters that never came.

""It was supposed to be a big event,"" he said as he waved a large ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag.

The movement's top strategists acknowledge the Tea Party is quieter today, by design. It has matured, they said, from a protest movement to a political movement. Large-scale rallies have given way to strategic letter-writing and phone-banking campaigns to push or oppose legislative agendas in Washington and state capitals. In Michigan and Ohio, for example, leaders have battled the implementation of the president's health law and the adoption of ""Common Core"" state school standards.

Local activists say they have focused largely on their own communities since Obama's re-election and the ideological drift of some Tea Party-backed politicians. Many are running for school boards, county commissions and city councils, focusing on issues such as unfunded pension liabilities and sewer system repairs.

""The positions that people are filling at the local levels are more important for the future of the movement and the future of the country,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, a national umbrella organization. ""It's creating a farm team for the future.""

The Republican establishment, however, is concerned about 2014. Party leaders worry about the GOP's most passionate advocates walking away, particularly those supporters angered by the Senate's immigration bill. In a nod to the tea party, business and conservative groups have launched ad campaigns recasting the bill as a national security measure.

The conservative American Action Network spent $750,000 on pro-reform commercials. One ad aimed at Florida voters called the legislation ""the toughest border security plan ever passed by Congress"" and urged viewers to thank Rubio for ""keeping his promise and fighting to secure the border.""

National Tea Party leaders hope to re-energize followers by focusing on two of the movement's chief targets: the Internal Revenue Service and the health law. They said the Obama administration had handed them a recruiting tool when it delayed the law's implementation and when the IRS singled out tea party groups and other conservative political organizations for special scrutiny.

""The very issues that brought us together in the first place are emerging as more center stage than they were in 2009 and 2010,"" said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks. ""That animates the political conversation and mobilizes our grass roots going into the 2014 election.""

Some Republicans are also moving to repair their relationships with the movement.

Rubio recently spoke to about 50 conservative activists and other lawmakers at a meeting of the Senate's tea party caucus. Organizers said he breezed past immigration, instead devoting much of his speech to repealing the health law."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/us/politics/dr-benjamin-carson-obama-critic-have-conservatives-dreaming-of-2016.html,2013-03-21 00:00:00,['Trip Gabriel'],Carson Makes Conservatives Look to 2016,"BALTIMORE — Dr. Benjamin Carson was a political unknown just weeks ago.

Then with a single speech delivered as President Obama looked stonily on, he was lofted into the conservative firmament as its newest star: a renowned neurosurgeon who is black and has the credibility to attack the president on health care.

In his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast last month, Dr. Carson criticized the health care overhaul and higher taxes on the rich, while warning that “the P.C. police are out in force at all times.”

Overnight, he was embraced by conservatives including those at The Wall Street Journal editorial page, which proclaimed, “Ben Carson for President” — a suggestion Dr. Carson helped feed at a high-profile gathering last weekend, the Conservative Political Action Conference. He was interrupted by sustained cheers when he coyly said, “Let’s just say if you magically put me in the White House...”

In an interview in his office at Johns Hopkins University, he said he had been told for years that he could have a political career. It would be built on his compelling personal story that began in poverty in Detroit, leading to fame through pioneering work separating conjoined twins and his own self-help and inspirational books, including “America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great.”"

Of course, this size disparity is an even bigger problem in the Senate, though Freeman's radical plan would remedy both—by redrawing the 50 states to make them all equipopulous.

You'll definitely want to click through to Freeman's site to see his impressive full-size map (and there's an even more detailed version that you can buy in poster form). Freeman also explains how he came up with these states:

The map began with an algorithm that grouped counties based on proximity, urban area, and commuting patterns. The algorithm was seeded with the fifty largest cities. After that, manual changes took into account compact shapes, equal populations, metro areas divided by state lines, and drainage basins. In certain areas, divisions are based on census tract lines.

As an added bonus, House districts (which also currently vary widely in size) would have equal populations, too.

Of course, a map this extreme would never come anywhere close to implementation; as Freeman himself says, this is an art project, not a serious proposal. But it's some very useful food for thought, in that it highlights just how unfair our existing state lines are. Indeed, the fact that few of Freeman's creatively named states even resemble any of today's shows just how out-of-whack our systems of governance are when it comes to respecting the true ideal of ""one person, one vote.""

But we aren't without hope: One genuine (if partial) remedy is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would replace the electoral college with a true national vote, without the need for a constitutional amendment.

For now, though, we can have a little fun, so tell us which new state you live in. I'm still in the only one that doesn't get a name change: New York. How about you?"

He Served As President Of The Gallup Organization To']",The numbers prove it: The Republican Party is estranged from America,"Andrew Kohut is the founding director and former president of the Pew Research Center. He served as president of the Gallup Organization from 1979 to 1989.

In my decades of polling, I recall only one moment when a party had been driven as far from the center as the Republican Party has been today.

The outsize influence of hard-line elements in the party base is doing to the GOP what supporters of Gene McCarthy and George McGovern did to the Democratic Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s — radicalizing its image and standing in the way of its revitalization.

In those years, the Democratic Party became labeled, to its detriment, as the party of “acid, abortion and amnesty.” With the Democrats’ values far to the left of the silent majority, McGovern lost in a landslide to Richard Nixon in 1972.

While there are no catchy phrases for the Republicans of 2013, their image problems are readily apparent in national polls. The GOP has come to be seen as the more extreme party, the side unwilling to compromise or negotiate seriously to tackle the economic turmoil that challenges the nation.

View Graphic A 20-year low for the GOP

It is no surprise that even elements of the Republican leadership that had been so confident of a Mitt Romney victory — including when it was clear that he was going to lose the election — are now looking at ways to find more electable candidates and cope with the disproportionate influence of hard-liners in the GOP. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus only scratched the surface this past week when he dissected the party’s November defeat: “There’s no one reason we lost. Our message was weak; our ground game was insufficient; we weren’t inclusive; we were behind in both data and digital; and our primary and debate process needed improvement. So there’s no one solution. There’s a long list of them.”

A long list, but one that doesn’t address the emergence of a staunch conservative bloc that has undermined the GOP’s national image.

The Republican Party’s ratings now stand at a 20-year low, with just 33 percent of the public holding a favorable view of the party and 58 percent judging it unfavorably, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Although the Democrats are better regarded (47 percent favorable and 46 percent unfavorable), the GOP’s problems are its own, not a mirror image of renewed Democratic strength.

Americans’ values and beliefs are more divided along partisan lines than at any time in the past 25 years. The values gap between Republicans and Democrats is now greater than the one between men and women, young and old, or any racial or class divides.

But while members of the Republican and Democratic parties have become more conservative and liberal, respectively, a bloc of doctrinaire, across-the-board conservatives has become a dominant force on the right. Indeed, their resolve and ultra-conservatism have protected Republican lawmakers from the broader voter backlash that is so apparent in opinion polls.

For decades, my colleagues and I have examined the competing forces and coalitions within the two parties. In our most recent national assessments, we found not only that the percentage of people self-identifying as Republicans had hit historic lows but that within that smaller base, the traditional divides between pro-business economic conservatives and social conservatives had narrowed. There was less diversity of values within the GOP than at any time in the past quarter-century.

The party’s base is increasingly dominated by a highly energized bloc of voters with extremely conservative positions on nearly all issues: the size and role of government, foreign policy, social issues, and moral concerns. They stand with the tea party on taxes and spending and with Christian conservatives on key social questions, such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage.

These staunch conservatives, who emerged with great force in the Obama era, represent 45 percent of the Republican base. According to our 2011 survey, they are demographically and politically distinct from the national electorate. Ninety-two percent are white. They tend to be male, married, Protestant, well off and at least 50 years old.

Knowing how this slice of the electorate came together is key to understanding why GOP lawmakers have been able to withstand the public backlash seen in polls — and why the party will face great difficulty in reinventing itself.

According to our polling, three factors stand out in the emergence of the GOP’s staunch conservative bloc: ideological resistance to President Obama’s policies, discomfort with the changing face of America and the influence of conservative media.

The Obama backlash

The Obama backlash: The conservative response to Obama was fast and furious as he began his first term. While Republicans wished him well for a month or two after his 2008 victory — as many as 59 percent reported a favorable opinion of him in January 2009 — their disapproval of the new president soon rose sharply. By the 100-day mark of Obama’s first term, 56 percent of Republicans disapproved of the president. And by January 2010, 61 percent of Republicans and 73 percent of conservative Republicans strongly disapproved of the president.

On a host of issues — gun control, abortion rights and global warming — national opinion quickly veered right. For the first time in more than a decade of polling, a Pew Research survey in April 2009 found nearly as many people saying it was more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns (45 percent) than to control gun ownership (49 percent). The same poll found that the share of the public saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases had declined to 46 percent from 54 percent just eight months earlier. In the fall of 2009, those saying they believed that the Earth was warming fell to 57 percent from 71 percent a year earlier.

The abortion shift proved to be short-lived — 54 percent once again believe it should be legal in most or all cases. But the public’s change of heart on gun control continues, even after Newtown. And belief in global warming has rebounded somewhat, but it remains significantly lower than it was before Obama took office.

Perhaps the most far-reaching change we observed in 2009 concerned the size and role of government. A growing plurality of Americans said they preferred a smaller government that offered fewer services (48 percent) rather than an activist government that offered more (40 percent), compared with a virtually even split on this question a year earlier. At the same time, a clear trend of increasing public support for the social safety net that we’d seen during the George W. Bush presidency reversed itself within months of Obama taking office.

These trends kicked in before health-care reform became such a dominant political issue, but the charged political debate over Obamacare only reinforced them.

This conservative tide of opinion — strengthened with the emergence of the tea party — showed its power in 2010, with a dramatic midterm election victory for the GOP that Obama himself called a “shellacking.” As the election approached, conservatives accounted for 68 percent of the Republican base, compared with 60 percent eight years earlier.

The changing face of America

The changing face of America: The nation’s demographic and social shifts have also played a role in galvanizing the new bloc. Conservative Republicans are more likely (33 percent) than the public at large (22 percent) to see the growing number of Latinos in America as a change for the worse. Similarly, 46 percent of conservatives see increasing rates of interracial marriage as a positive development, compared with 66 percent of the public overall.

During Obama’s first term, ethnocentric attitudes — on immigration, equal rights and interracial dating — grew by 11 percentage points among conservative Republicans but did not increase significantly among any other political or ideological grouping. Some academic surveys found similar partisan polarization on racial measures over the course of Obama’s first term.

Race has loomed larger in voting behavior in the Obama era than at any point in the recent past. The 2010 election was the high mark of “white flight” from the Democratic Party, as National Journal’s Ron Brownstein called it — the GOP won a record 60 percent of white votes, up from 51 percent four years earlier.

To the conservative base, Obama, as an African American in the White House, may be a symbol of how America has changed. Unease with him sets conservative Republicans apart from other voting blocs — including moderate Republicans, who have hardly been fans of the president. For example, a fall 2011 national survey found 63 percent of conservative Republicans reporting that Obama made them angry, compared with 29 percent of the public overall and 40 percent of moderate Republicans.

The conservative media

The conservative media: If a values backlash and racial-political polarization helped forge the staunch conservative bloc, the conservative media has reinforced it.

The politicization of news consumption is certainly not new; it’s been apparent in more than 20 years of data collected by the Pew Research Center. What is new is a bloc of voters who rely more on conservative media than on the general news media to comprehend the world. Pew found that 54 percent of staunch conservatives report that they regularly watch Fox News, compared with 44 percent who read a newspaper and 30 percent who watch network news regularly. Newspapers and/or television networks top all other news sources for other blocs of voters, both on the right and on the left. Neither CNN, NPR or the New York Times has an audience close to that size among other voting blocs.

Conservative Republicans make up as much as 50 percent of the audiences for Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’ Reilly. There is nothing like this on the left. MSNBC’s “Hardball” and “The Rachel Maddow Show” attract significantly fewer liberal Democrats.

I see little reason to believe that the staunch conservative bloc will wither away or splinter; it will remain a dominant force in the GOP and on the national stage. At the same time, however, I see no indication that its ideas about policy, governance and social issues will gain new adherents. They are far beyond the mainstream.

Any Republican efforts at reinvention face this dilemma: While staunch conservatives help keep GOP lawmakers in office, they also help keep the party out of the White House. Quite simply, the Republican Party has to appeal to a broader cross section of the electorate to succeed in presidential elections.

This became apparent last fall. Voters generally agreed with the GOP that a smaller government is preferable to a larger, activist one, and therefore they disapproved of Obamacare. However, exit polls showed popular support for legalizing same-sex marriage and giving illegal immigrants opportunities for citizenship.

This combination of conservative and liberal views is typical. To win, both parties must appeal to the mixed values of the electorate. But it will be very hard for the Republican Party, given the power of the staunch conservatives in its ranks.

Of course, the Democrats of the 1970s were able to overcome their obstacles. All it took was Watergate, an oil embargo and a presidential pardon of Nixon for Jimmy Carter to secure a thin victory in 1976. Not even the most frustrated Republicans could hope for a similar turn of events.

The Tea Party Express Is Coming For You, Saxby Chambliss (R)!","So my shear hatred towards U.S. Senator Saxby ""Chicken Hawk"" Chambliss (R. GA) is no secret here. In fact thanks to all you wonderful people, you made my hate letter to Chambliss my most recced diary:

http://www.dailykos.com/...

Well it looks like Amy Kremer, chairman of the national Tea Party Express and a Georgia resident shares my hatred for Chambliss as well but for different reasons:

http://blogs.ajc.com/...



“And we’re a red state, we deserve a conservative senator, a conservative senator that would stand with [Sens.] Marco Rubio [R-Fla.] and Rand Paul [R-Ky.] and Mike Lee [R-Utah] who all voted ‘no’ for this bill.” - Ann Kremer, chairman of the national Tea Party Express, 1/3/13

Kremer is pissed that Chambliss voted for the recent fiscal cliff deal which involves tax increases so that's why she hates him. I hate him because of what he did to this great man in 2002:The best part is Chambliss is shitting his pants now more than ever:

http://blogs.ajc.com/...



Based on what he told reporters in a conference call this morning, I guess Saxby Chambliss is taking talk of a primary challenge seriously:

Junkyard dogs wearing helmets and chin straps while drawing lines in the sand? - Jay Bookman for the Atlanta Journal Constitution, 1/4/13

Yeah, ok Chambliss. Teabaggers might be crazy and stupid but they know you're all bark and no bite. Plus lets not forget that the Libertarian vote took away decent chunk of your vote back in 2008 causing you to go up in a runoff with Democrat Jim Martin.

Now I do want to see Chambliss go down in the primary, that's the first part of what I like to think of as the Max Cleland Karma Pay Back but the second part is taking back this seat for the Democrats. Right now, there hasn't been any names showing any interest. Yes Blue Dog Democratic Congressman John Barrow and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed have been mentioned but they're not really interested. I've heard a lot of names mentioned from Former Governor Roy Barnes to Jimmy Carter's son, Jason Carter to even the idea of Cleland himself running for the Senate. PPP showed us that Cleland is the only one who comes the closest to beating Chambliss. For some reason the PPP had them tied. Now against a more conservative, Tea Party Republican like Congressman Tom Price, Democrats have a much better shot. In looking for our ideal candidate to take on Chambliss, PPP offers this advice:



-Chambliss' cross over appeal to Democrats would make him hard to defeat in a general election. But given the very real possibility of him losing to an extreme conservative candidate in the primary it might benefit Democrats to get a Joe Donnelly caliber candidate who doesn't have a lot to lose into the race, just in case... - PPP, 12/4/12

My advice to Georgia Democrats is this: nominate someone who is open to immigration reform. Yes, you need a centrist Democrat who can appeal to white voters but even Cleland, who voted for the Bush Tax Cuts, was pro-environment, pro-choice and most importantly, pro-immigration reform. Voter turnout is key for Democrats to win this seat against a crazy teabagger and Georgia's changing demographics show great potential for a Democratic victory:

In a press conference on Monday, Obama called the reports ""outrageous"" and intolerable, while saying he would reserve harsher judgment for when a fuller report on the IRS's actions is formally released.

""This is pretty straightforward,"" said Obama. ""If, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that is outrageous, and there is no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable, because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a non-partisan way. You should feel that way regardless of party.""

""But I have got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this,"" he added.

The remarks were the president's first on the evolving scandal surrounding the tax collection agency. News broke last Friday that the IRS had targeted groups with the words ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in their name, forcing them to fill out additional questionnaires and provide more information in order to get approval for their tax-exempt status. Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the IRS had also given extra scrutiny to organizations that focused on government spending, debt and taxes.

Lawmakers have responded with anger and outrage. On Monday morning, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called on the IRS commissioner to be fired. The senator's office confirmed to The Huffington Post that he was referring to Steven Miller, the acting commissioner. The Senate has not yet confirmed a full-time commissioner since Douglas Shulman, a Bush appointee, stepped down this past fall.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), meanwhile, called for a ""congressional investigation to determine"" how the IRS scandal took place. Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said that ""The IRS should be prepared for a full investigation into this matter by the Senate Finance Committee.""

The results of such an investigation will ultimately determine whether the story amounts to a case of terrible bureaucratic judgment or becomes a wider political scandal.

The IRS began taking on additional campaign finance regulatory responsibilities after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which led to an uptick in filings for 501(c)(4) organizations seeking social welfare status. The agency's Cincinnati office became the central clearing point for those applications. Officials there, the agency said, were the ones who inappropriately targeted conservative groups for scrutiny.

As early as mid-2011, however, high-ranking IRS officials became aware that the Cincinnati office was engaging in this activity, a forthcoming Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report will reportedly reveal. Why nothing was said or done prior to last Friday is unclear.

The president on Monday said that neither he nor his advisers were aware that this was taking place.

""I learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this,"" said the president. ""I think it was on Friday.""

The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported that a government official who had reviewed a copy of the report said no one outside the IRS was involved in encouraging the targeting of conservative groups.

UPDATE: 2:45 p.m. -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has joined the chorus of concerned lawmakers, saying that he supports bipartisan calls for an investigation into the IRS scandal. From his floor remarks:

I have spoken today to the senior Senator from Montana, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Max Baucus, and he is looking into this matter in his role as finance chairman of that committee. If the Inspector General's report indicates further investigation is needed, I have full confidence in the ability of Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee to get to the bottom of this matter and recommend appropriate action."

She had amassed a huge political war chest, and independent campaigns were willing to spend millions more. She won the backing of the some of L.A.'s most powerful labor unions, but also of the Chamber of Commerce. Big names from opposite ends of the political spectrum — former Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and former Democratic President Clinton — would ultimately endorse her. She spoke inspirationally of becoming the city’s first female mayor.

But six months after emerging as the leading candidate to succeed Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Greuel’s campaign was handed a decisive defeat by her former City Council friend, Eric Garcetti. The portrait that emerges from interviews with campaign aides and analysts begins with a candidate who underestimated the strength of her opponents in the primary election and the importance of maintaining her brand as a trusted public servant. The slippage accelerated when Greuel’s efforts to promote past accomplishments and future goals drew new rounds of scrutiny and criticism. And attempts to take down her opponents fell short, according to the interviews with campaign operatives and outside experts.

MAP: How L.A. voted

The city controller and former City Council member who wanted to be ahead of the pack and run a positive runoff campaign highlighting her historic bid to become the city’s first female mayor found herself trailing and fighting a rear-guard action as voters went to the polls in March. After she finished 4 points behind Garcetti, key staffers departed, the financial advantages of employee-union backing became liabilities and her carefully cultivated reputation as a straight-shooting watchdog of the public purse suffered.

Greuel did not respond to a request for comment. But in recent days, reviewing the race with her closest advisors, she took solace in the fact that she fought hard for a job she had long coveted. Greuel repeated a quotation she had etched on her mother’s gravestone: “Unless a person sets out to do more than he can possibly ever do, he will never do all that he can.”

As she ramped up her campaign last year, Greuel believed that, as controller, she had built the perfect platform to run for mayor in a city that seemed perpetually in financial crisis, aides said. She would hammer at the $160 million in “waste, fraud and abuse” that the controller’s office calculated she had uncovered during more than 80 audits. She suggested she could use such savings to help balance the budget.

But Greuel’s team failed to delve deeply into the numbers buttressing the central theme of her campaign. Aides were caught off guard by the intensity of reporters’ challenges. The media wanted to know how much the candidate could recover for the city treasury, and her answers were vague.

Changing focus, Greuel rolled out an ambitious and costly plan to add 2,000 officers to the Los Angeles Police Department. Polls show strong voter support for public safety improvements, but prominent political and civic leaders attacked the idea, noting the city already had slashed services, including 911 medical response teams, to reach a 10,000-officer force.

Greuel then backed away from the proposal, stressing that adding 2,000 more cops was an “aspiration.” But the damage from questionable audit savings and criticism of her proposed police buildup had been done, said a source inside the campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussing internal matters. “It just exploded the trust that Wendy had built with the voters.”

Greuel and Garcetti appeared to be gliding toward a two-candidate runoff election from the start. But John Shallman, Greuel’s chief strategist, acknowledged last week that campaign officials underestimated the punishment their candidate was in for during the primary.

“We didn’t perceive Jan Perry or Kevin James as serious candidates in any way, shape or form,” Shallman said, referring to the strength of the veteran African American councilwoman and Republican former radio host. “That was a mistake.”

James, an attorney, was under-financed but particularly effective at withering sound bytes that attracted media coverage. He spoke with authority to conservative San Fernando Valley voters, who Greuel — a self-described “Valley girl” — long assumed would be a crucial pool of support. “Suddenly he became real,” Shallman said. “The more real he became, the more of a challenge it became for us to hold on to and compete for our base.”

James took the lead in warning voters of Greuel’s connections to city unions, particularly the one representing many Department of Water and Power workers, who spent nearly $1.7 million on an independent campaign to get her elected. The message appeared to stick, according to USC Price/LA Times polling.

Perry, meanwhile, launched a series of blistering mailers attacking Greuel, including one that accused her of being a closet Republican. (She had actually switched to the Democratic Party two decades ago.) Perry’s attacks appeared to be “almost a political suicide bombing,” Shallman said, more designed to take down Greuel than promote Perry’s candidacy. When Greuel retaliated with a mailer of her own — hitting Perry for a personal bankruptcy filing years earlier — women and African Americans accused Greuel of stooping to a lowly personal attack.

A string of nearly 50 debates before the March 5 primary also played away from Greuel’s strengths. She was charming and relaxed with small groups of voters, but she visibly stiffened going on stage for debates.

Garcetti was more polished, glib and less of a target than Greuel for the other primary election contenders, who saw more opportunity to siphon votes away from her.

Campaign aides began turning down debate invitations. But Greuel, determined to compete, would call back organizers and promise to participate.

Advertisement

A number of Greuel’s efforts to attack Garcetti failed to stick or blew up on her. She criticized him for taking taxpayer-funded trips, when she too had been on such trips. She attacked the number of city cars his office had, when as a council member her staff had the same number of vehicles.

To both insiders and political observers, the lack of precision had the hallmark of a low-profile race, such as an Assembly campaign, where press scrutiny is far less intense.

Advertisement

As the unexpected challenges of the primary election grew, trouble was brewing inside Greuel’s campaign. The bulk of her field team, responsible for identifying supportive voters and getting them to the polls, quit shortly after the March vote. Shifting to a new team left Greuel’s get-out-the-vote operation in catch-up mode.

Meanwhile, Shallman was clashing with Rose Kapolczynski, a veteran of Sen. Barbara Boxer’s campaigns, who had been hired early on to run day-to-day operations. Inside team Greuel, some saw Shallman as too aggressive. Others viewed Kapolczynski as too cautious. Kapolczynski decided she could no longer be part of the effort before the March primary, though she held off on leaving until after the March voting.

Raising the cash needed for a come-from-behind victory in the runoff became a major new obstacle after a USC Price/LA Times poll showed Greuel trailing Garcetti by 10 points.

The Greuel campaign took a gamble on a game-changing play that might close the gap, aides say. Greuel launched an early barrage of advertising, spending $1.7 million over two weeks in an effort to pull even. The airwaves were flooded with ads showing Magic Johnson, Riordan and Boxer singing Greuel’s praises. The move drained her coffers, but Greuel drew even with Garcetti in public and private polls.

Advertisement

But the flow of money did not return. In part, aides acknowledge, business donors were concerned by Greuel’s image as the candidate of city employee unions — and particularly the relatively high-paid workers at the city’s utility.

That left the Greuel campaign heavily dependent on the independent groups and “super PAC” committees that were backing her bid — and causing her problems in the polls and airing a muddy mishmash of ads on television.

Advertisement

Going into election day, Greuel staffers were nervous. Their early ad blitz hit just as voting by mail began. Greuel insiders figured they needed a five-point edge in the first big wave of mail-in ballots counted election night.

When the first tally appeared on a jumbo screen at Greuel’s election night party at a downtown nightclub, she was up by 2 points. Some guests cheered. But her campaign staff sensed where the night would end.

Garcetti gained ground with each new count, eventually winning by 8 points.

Greuel turned 52 two days after the election. She headed to Palm Desert, where she has spent every Memorial Day weekend since her teens with family and friends. She’d cut short her stay in recent years as she pursued her dream of being mayor. A friend said Greuel plans to enjoy the entire gathering this year.

“She can do the whole thing,” the friend said, “and she is having fun.”

http://news.yahoo.com/new-book-details-how-obama-questioned-his-own-ability-to-run-for-re-election-191039012.html,,[],New book details how Obama questioned his own ability to win re-election,"After President Barack Obama’s mediocre first debate performance against Mitt Romney in 2012, he reportedly told advisers, “I just don’t know if I can do this,” when they urged him to turn around his re-election campaign.



In “Double Down,” journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann say that Obama followed up his presidential debate by conducting a “dismal” mock debate with then-Sen. John Kerry.

“If we don’t fix this, we could lose the whole f------ election,” Obama adviser David Plouffe reportedly said following the mock debate.

Obama’s advisers attempted to shift his tone and approach in advance of the second presidential debate, leading Obama to respond, “I can’t tell you that ‘Okay, I woke up today, I knew I needed to do better, and I’ll do better.’ I am wired in a different way than this event requires. … I just don’t know if I can do this.”

For her part, Michelle Obama reportedly did not suffer from the same reservations as her husband, telling a group of female Obama campaign donation bundlers that the president had lost the first debate only because “Romney is a really good liar.”

It was the second such detail revealed from “Double Down” in recent days. On Thursday, an excerpt from the book revealed that Obama advisers explored the possibility of replacing Joe Biden on ticket with Hillary Clinton.

And while that excerpt also detailed the continually strained relationship between Obama and Bill Clinton, Saturday’s excerpt details how the former president was brought in to help Obama prepare for his second debate with Romney.

At a fundraising debate four days after the first debate, Bill Clinton reportedly told Obama, “Don’t try to make up the ground you lost. … Just be yourself.”

Specifically, Clinton warned Obama to not try to compensate for his seemingly detached first debate performance by becoming too aggressive in the rematch.

Plouffe then tried to put the challenge in perspective for Obama.

“You’ve got basically 75 to 80 minutes left of doing this in your entire life. That’s less than the length of a movie!” Plouffe said. “I know it’s unnatural. But that’s all. That’s the finish line, you know?”"

As of Monday morning, only 17 votes – out of more than 2 million cast – separated the two candidates in the race to become the state’s chief legal officer, making the contest one of the closest statewide races in U.S. history.

For Virginians, the race – which features two state senators, Republican Mark Obenshain and Democrat Mark Herring – matters in part because the attorney general’s job often provides a stepping stone to the governor’s mansion.

People outside of Virginia may be more interested in the proof that 13 years after the contested presidential balloting in Florida, U.S. elections remain rife with small, but sometimes critical, mistakes.

Unlike Florida in 2000, however, the effort to correct the errors in the Virginia race has been eagerly watched over – and in some cases spurred on – by a small but eager corps of election devotees who have pored over preliminary vote numbers available on the Internet looking for anomalies and trumpeting their discoveries on Twitter.

Obenshain led on election night last Tuesday, and at one point had a margin of more than 1,000 votes over Herring. That margin began to erode as officials in the state’s cities and counties began reviewing their tallies. Local officials have until midnight Tuesday to present a certified count to the state election board.

Most of the errors officials discovered were small – a transposed number here, a mathematical error in adding up vote totals there. But on Friday, officials in Fairfax County, the state’s most populous, discovered a voting machine in a heavily Democratic area that had malfunctioned. Nearly 2,000 votes had not been counted, and when they were, the race became a near tie.

Monday afternoon, attention shifted to the state capital, Richmond, where GOP officials had asked for a review of eight majority-Democratic precincts where they said irregularities might have occurred. Their request for a review backfired badly.

PHOTOS: Election Day 2013

The local election board, which has a 2-1 Republican majority, found that voting machine No. 3791 in precinct No. 501 had never been counted. The 190 votes on that machine went overwhelmingly to Herring, giving him a statewide lead of 115 votes.

Meantime, election boards also have to rule on provisional ballots, cast by voters who for one reason or another were unable to use a regular ballot on election day. Several hundred provisional ballots remain to be reviewed on Tuesday, mostly in Fairfax. A legal dispute already has flared over the process for determining which of those ballots are valid.

Once officials have certified the results, the loser can request a recount. Both parties already have begun soliciting contributions to pay for further challenges. The race may not finally be settled until sometime next month.

Updated 11:03 a.m. ET, 7/2

(CNN) - In a rare joint appearance, first lady Michelle Obama and Former first lady Laura Bush were on stage, laughing about shared experiences and giving advice to fellow first ladies–even talking about Michelle's 'bang backlash' that swept the nation.

The two women spoke at the First Ladies Summit in Africa on Tuesday, as President Barack Obama and the first family wrapped up their week-long trip to the fast-developing continent.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

First to address the crowd, Mrs. Bush began by acknowledging that she, Mrs. Obama, and the nine other African first ladies were voted into their role by one person, and that they can choose to take advantage of their positions.

""Lady Bird Johnson realized that she had a podium because her husband was president and she chose to use it,"" Mrs. Bush said. ""I know that the first ladies in this room are also using their podiums.""

Calling the women in the room 'advocates' and 'agents for change', Mrs. Bush announced the Bush Institute is now supporting efforts to continue bringing together these influential women, saying ""none of you needs to do it alone, that's why we are launching the First Ladies initiative at the Bush Institute."" Mrs. Bush said they will be convening the first ladies together annually ""to highlight the significant role they can play in addressing significant issues in their countries.""

The current first lady shared Mrs. Bush's sentiments.

""Being able to pursue our passions and do things that not only help our country and connect us with the rest of the world, it's a great privilege,"" Mrs. Obama said.

It's also a ""freeing and liberating opportunity"" from the tight security and restrictions the first family faces in the White House.

Asked by the moderator if she feels like a prisoner–a reference to Martha Washington, the first ever first lady, who told her niece she felt like a ""state prisoner""–Mrs. Obama jokingly replied: ""No, there are prison elements to it. But it's a really nice prison, so–""

""But with a chef,"" Mrs. Bush interjected, drawing laughs from the crowd.

""You can't complain,"" Mrs. Obama added, jovially. ""But there is definitely elements that are confining.""

However, she added, being first lady is better than being president.

""We have probably the best jobs in the world because, unlike our husbands who have to react and respond to crisis on a minute by minute basis, they come into office with a wonderful, profound agenda, then, they are faced with the real world. On the other hand, we get to work on what we are passionate about and that is something that I would encourage all first ladies to never lose sight of. You have an opportunity to speak to your passions and to really design and be very strategic about the issues you care about.""

Both first ladies agreed there can be distractions when they are really trying to get a point across. Mrs. Obama's fresh cut bangs, for example, threw the public into a media frenzy.

Mrs. Obama's advice? Stand strong by the issues you believe in.

""While people are sorting through our shoes and our hair and whether we cut it or not... whether we have bangs. Who would have thought? I didn't call that one...We take our bangs and we stand in front of important things that the world needs to see, and eventually people stop looking at the bangs and they start looking at what we are standing in front of,"" she said.

Mrs. Bush said she and her husband had many issues they were passionate about when George W. Bush first took office – but then, America was attacked on 9/11 and they had to put those goals on hold. Mrs. Bush said she stepped up to the microphone that evening and soon after addressing the nation on behalf of her husband, she realized the power of her position.

""Right after the attacks of September 11th, I gave the presidential radio address to talk about women in Afghanistan, and right after that I was in a department store with my daughter, Jenna; she was a freshman in college and I was in Austin seeing her and we went to a department store and the women who sold cosmetics at the department store said, 'thank you so much Mrs. Bush, thank you for speaking for the women in Afghanistan.' And that was the first time it really occurred to me that people really did hear me and that I really did have that podium that Lady Bird Johnson knew about and had told us about,"" she said.

That podium, however, does not extend into their husband's office. Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Bush were quick to concur that their husbands, as presidents, have no need for any more political advisers.

""I found that my husband needs time to be off, and the only time is when he walks into the doors of the residence and we sit down and we have a family dinner,"" Mrs. Obama said.

While the first ladies agree that it's not their place to criticize their husband's job performance, all bets are off when it comes to their daughters.

""You know, the fortunate thing about having young children and girls is that truly, they could care less...there are times when Malia is like, so what about climate change? What about the tigers?"" Mrs. Obama said.

In addition to support from one another, the first ladies of the world will also now have the Bush Institute's First Ladies Initiative to ""connect to one another and develop private-public partnerships,"" according to the Bush Initiative's website.

""I want to encourage every first lady to speak out and speak up and let people know, because people are watching and they are listening and you can be so constructive for your country if you speak up about issues that you think are important,"" Mrs. Bush said."
http://news.yahoo.com/why-republicans-aren-t-giving-white-folks-081158720.html,,[],Why the Republicans Aren’t Giving Up on White Folks,"It seemed that Republicans had a singular message for themselves after Election Day 2012: Befriend minorities. The Grand Old Party’s popularity with Latino and black voters had dwindled to modern-day lows, and leading GOP lights publicly vowed that the work to remake the party would begin immediately. If they failed, the argument went, last year’s debacle would metastasize into political irrelevance.

But fresh hope among party strategists of retaking the Senate has bumped that existential crisis to the background in favor of a campaign plan aimed, yet again, at winning white voters.

Indeed, an early examination of the party’s 2014 efforts shows that Republicans have yet to begin writing new pages for their old playbook. Efforts to expand the map by fielding candidates in diverse states have so far been stymied. And, in any case, those races have been relegated to the second tier in favor of more-lucrative opportunities. The GOP’s midterm strategy will rely heavily on whites, especially those without a college education, and particularly in rural states where its presidential candidates win easily.

It’s not just recruitment, either. The congressional GOP’s message and agenda during the first half-year of President Obama’s second term speak to a party that—with the exception of immigration reform—seems content to regain power by focusing on red, not purple, states.

Because of a midterm map that tilts the party’s way, the strategy will likely succeed. But the short-term gain risks diverting Republicans from long-term reforms, making it a dangerous gamble for a party that by its own admission needs an overhaul. Irrelevance won’t come next year, but it very well might arrive by 2016. Even if Republicans manage to retake the Senate majority this cycle, they’ll likely lose it in 2016 when minority turnout increases and the Senate map shifts to a deluge of blue-state elections.

The most glaring example of the party’s struggle is in Senate recruitment. Here, the GOP has watched itself scramble to find strong contenders in states with a high Latino or African-American presence—in some cases, they haven’t had anyone of note emerge at all. In Virginia, for example, a state Obama won twice thanks in large part to its multiracial makeup, no serious Republican has stepped up to challenge Sen. Mark Warner. The reluctance could be chalked up to the popular Warner’s own formidable standing in the Old Dominion, but the dynamic has repeated itself elsewhere.

Story continues

New Mexico, which President George W. Bush won less than a decade ago, is all but off the playing board for Republicans. And in Colorado, which like Virginia is one of the country’s preeminent presidential battlegrounds, Republicans are openly aghast at the lack of options after Rep. Cory Gardner last month passed up a chance to take on Democratic Sen. Tom Udall. “I have never seen a situation like this where an incumbent looks so vulnerable with no activity on the Republican side,” Dick Wadhams, a Republican consultant and former state party chair, told National Journal.

The trio of states have something in common: Whites there made up less than 80 percent of the vote in 2012. More generally, the GOP has also seen recruiting failures in Iowa, Michigan, and Minnesota, three states that, while not particularly diverse, suggest that the Republican Party is struggling to convince candidates they can win outside of deep-red states.

It’s common for parties to lack a lineup of strong recruits 18 months before the general election. They could yet emerge—the National Republican Senatorial Committee has vowed to expand the map of competitive races into otherwise blue states. But the failures stand out largely because they’re so distinct from the GOP’s success in red states.

Republicans, who are targeting all seven red-state seats currently represented by Democrats, have already found strong contenders in South Dakota (former Gov. Mike Rounds), West Virginia (Rep. Shelley Moore Capito), and Louisiana (Rep. Bill Cassidy). They’re likely to find another one in Arkansas, where Rep. Tom Cotton is expected to run.

To many Republicans, targeting those races is exactly what they should be doing. Concerns about the GOP’s long-term viability are secondary, they say, to the straightforward goal of retaking the Senate. “The NRSC is doing the job it needs to, which is focusing on this cycle and finding a path to get Republicans back to the majority,” said one senior Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “The long term for them is 2014.”

It’s not just the Senate where Republicans are zeroing in on heavily white populations. The House GOP’s top targets include an array of longtime Democrats representing largely rural areas, such as Reps. Nick Rahall of West Virginia, Collin Peterson of Minnesota, and John Barrow of Georgia. That these races lead the GOP target lists can explain, at least in part, why the party has pursued an agenda largely aimed at its base. The GOP’s primary messages to date have been to repeal President Obama’s health care law, assail the president for the scandals that have gripped the White House, and oppose any gun-control expansion—issues that rouse the conservative base but fail to attract most minority voters.

The strategy could lead to success next year because of the favorable map and a midterm turnout dynamic in which older, white conservatives traditionally make up a larger percentage of the vote. But it could deceive the party into thinking that last year’s election was a fluke. “If the Republicans do reasonably well in the 2014 elections, that will be seen as further evidence they don’t need to move to [the] center,” said Guy Molyneux, a Democratic strategist. “The dynamics of an off-year election and a particularly good map for them could yield a lot of strong outcomes even if they do move to the right. That will be seen as vindication of the idea that going right is really the best electoral strategy.”

In other words, what will work in 2014 could end up costing the GOP soon thereafter."

Chris Christie called Tuesday for a special election later this year to decide who will fill the seat of the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, though he did not say whom he might appoint in the interim.

The Republican governor, during a press conference in Trenton, said he wants to make sure New Jersey voters have a ""voice and a choice""

He set the primary for Aug. 13 and the general election for Oct. 16.

The announcement ended some -- but not all -- of the speculation about Christie's handling of the open seat. Lautenberg, a Democrat and the oldest member of the U.S. Senate, died Monday after complications from viral pneumonia at age 89. While colleagues paid tribute to the legacy of the World War II veteran, political observers launched into heavy speculation on how the popular Republican governor would move to fill the position.

Christie faced conflicting state laws in deciding when to have the election. He could have waited until November 2014, or possibly this November. But Christie said Tuesday it was worth the expense to the state to hold a special election earlier.

""The citizens of New Jersey need to have an elected representative to the United States Senate and have it as soon as possible,"" he said.

With the special election set, Christie will not have his appointee of choice in the Senate for a full 18-month span. However, the governor ensured that a high-profile Democratic Senate candidate would not be running at the top of the ticket this November, when he and other Republicans are running in the main general election. Such a candidate on the ballot could help attract support to other Democrats running for lower-level office.

As for whom he would appoint in the short-term to fill the seat, Christie said he hasn't decided -- but that he wasn't putting ""preconditions"" on that decision.

""I don't dawdle,"" he assured, saying he'd make the call ""relatively quickly.""

Christie, despite his reputation as a brash, no-nonsense executive, has a complicated political profile that makes his decision hard to read.

He's considered a possible contender in the 2016 presidential race, but his status as one of the best-known GOP governors is no guarantee he'll tap a fellow Republican for the seat, according to some analysts.

New Jersey has not elected a Republican to the Senate since 1972. And it hasn't had one serve there at all since 1982, when Republican Gov. Tom Kean appointed Republican Nicholas Brady to finish the term of Democrat Harrison Williams, who resigned amid scandal.

If Christie picks a Republican, he risks upsetting voters who chose a Democrat for the seat.

Yet if Christie picks a Democrat, it may not play well with Republican presidential primary voters, who could see him as disloyal to his party in the run-up to the 2016 primary season.

One New Jersey Republican political consultant told FoxNews.com there's almost no way the governor picks a Democrat.

""It is a sure bet he will pick a Republican,"" the source said. The source said there are ""several short lists"" of GOP candidates to choose from -- of current GOP lawmakers, of non-lawmakers like the sitting lieutenant governor and of former dignitaries.

State Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat, said Christie should appoint a Democrat, because the seat was held by an elected one. But he said he thinks Christie may be reluctant to appoint a Democrat.

Despite the risks, Christie could consider appointing Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat who announced earlier this year plans to run for Lautenberg's seat in 2014, said Brigid Harrison, a political scientist at Montclair State University. The move could backfire, she said, but it would help Christie's image with New Jersey Democrats and African-Americans across the country -- especially since history shows it's hard for a Republican to win a Senate seat in New Jersey.

Political analysts say the list of Republican possibilities includes state Sen. Tom Kean Jr.; U.S. Rep. Chris Smith; former Gov. Christie Whitman; state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, who ran for the U.S. Senate last year; state Sen. Kevin O'Toole; or Bill Baroni, the deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Another possibility could be Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, which would open a spot on Christie's re-election bid ticket this fall for another Republican.

No one has yet begun campaigning for the job publicly.

With Lautenberg's death, the Senate now has 52 Democrats, 45 Republicans and two independents who caucus with the Democrats.

USA TODAY

Bachmann ran for the Republican presidential nomination last year

Move comes amid an FEC complaint against her former presidential campaign

She did not reveal her future plans

WASHINGTON — Tea Party favorite Michele Bachmann, a GOP conservative who ran for president last year, made a surprise announcement Wednesday and said she will not seek re-election to a fifth term in Congress.

The Minnesota Republican was facing inquiries into her 2012 presidential campaign and a potential 2014 rematch with Democrat Jim Graves, a wealthy hotel executive who came within about 4,300 votes of defeating her in November. She had already bought airtime in Minnesota to begin running campaign ads.

""My decision was not influenced by any concerns about my being re-elected,"" Bachmann said in a video posted on her website.

Bachmann added, ""This decision was not impacted in any way by the recent inquiries into the activities of my former presidential campaign.""

Former Bachmann aide Peter Waldron in January filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, claiming the congresswoman made improper payments to an Iowa state senator who was the state chairman of her presidential campaign. Waldron accused Bachmann of other FEC violations.

Bachmann, 57, made a name for herself in Congress by staunchly opposing President Obama's health care law. In 2006, she became the first Republican woman elected to represent Minnesota in the U.S. House. Bachmann later co-founded the House Tea Party Caucus, a group dedicated to the anti-tax, small government principles that sparked the movement, and set out to repeal the health care law.

Her outspoken critique of Obama and frequent TV appearances, along with support from the Tea Party, invariably led to comparisons with Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican Party vice presidential nominee. Palin had backed Bachmann during her 2010 re-election bid, when she faced a tough fight against Democrat Tarryl Clark. Bachmann said she viewed Palin as a friend and not a competitor.

In her presidential campaign, Bachmann tried to tap into her support from Tea Partiers — who also felt political kinship with candidates such as Rick Santorum and Rick Perry — in her bid for the GOP nomination. She made a number of gaffes on the campaign trail, such as the time she suggested the Revolutionary War battles at Lexington and Concord occurred in New Hampshire.

Bachmann blasted Perry, the Texas governor, in one televised GOP debate over mandating the HPV vaccine for schoolgirls and suggested it would lead to retardation. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other doctors spoke out to correct Bachmann, saying that the HPV vaccine, which prevents cervical cancer, would not cause mental retardation.

It was a quick rise — and fall — on the national scene for Bachmann, who declared her intention to seek the White House during a televised debate in June 2011. The Iowa native later that summer won the Ames Straw Poll, a state Republican Party fundraiser that is viewed as a gauge of grass-roots support for the first-in-the-nation caucuses. But Bachmann had trouble consolidating support among the Tea Party faithful and social conservatives, and dropped out the morning after the Iowa caucuses.

Months after some of her presidential rivals had already done so, Bachmann endorsed Mitt Romney for the GOP nomination.

Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, praised Bachmann as a ""tireless advocate and dedicated representative for the people of Minnesota's 6th District."" He said Bachmann ""has worked hard each day to ensure that her constituents' voices are heard in the halls of Congress.""

Bachmann routinely was among the House's top fundraisers and her 2012 race against Graves, the former CEO of the AmericInn chain, was one of the most expensive in the country. She raised nearly $15 million last year to about $2.3 million for Graves, and wasted no time cranking up her fundraising machine for the 2014 elections.

In one such e-mail pitch, Bachmann proclaimed that the ""Pelosi-Obama campaign machine"" was taking aim at her.

Democrats hailed Bachmann's decision to retire from Congress and held her up as an example of what is wrong with the Republican Party.

""Michele Bachmann's Tea Party brand of extremism and obstruction have infected the entire Republican Congress and her influence shows no signs of waning,"" said Emily Bittner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

The House Majority PAC, which works to elect Democrats to Congress, promised to help Graves win the seat based in the Twin Cities suburbs. ""We are confident that we would have helped defeat her next November, but Bachmann voluntarily removing herself from Congress is a victory we can all celebrate today,"" said Alixandria Lapp, executive director of the House Majority PAC.

Bachmann promised in her video to ""continue to work overtime for the next 18 months in Congress defending the same Constitutional conservative values we have worked so hard on together.""

As for her plans beyond Congress, Bachmann said, ""There is no future option or opportunity, be it directly in the political arena or otherwise, that I won't be giving serious consideration if it can help save and protect our great nation.""

http://news.yahoo.com/abortion-potential-gop-divider-ga-senate-race-160345254.html,,[],Abortion: Potential GOP divider in Ga. Senate race,"ATLANTA (AP) — The four Georgia Republicans who want to succeed retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss all call themselves conservatives who oppose abortion.

Two are congressmen who recently voted in favor of a House bill to outlaw nearly all abortions beyond the 20th week after conception. Another candidate, a former secretary of state with her own national profile in the abortion debate, expressed support for the measure. Meanwhile, Rep. Paul Broun, an obstetrician, voted against it, saying it didn't go far enough. That vote put him alongside abortion-rights advocates yet it garnered a de facto endorsement from a leading anti-abortion group in Georgia.

The divide exposes fault lines in an already divisive primary that some party figures worry could set up a repeat of 2012 losses in Missouri and Indiana, GOP-leaning states where Democrats successfully cast Republican Senate nominees as out of the mainstream based mostly on their views on abortion.

Broun, a conservative who has called President Barack Obama a Marxist and who drew national attention last year when he declared evolutionary theory ""lies from the pit of hell,"" defends his outlier vote — just six Republicans voted against the bill — because the proposal contains exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest.

As he put it: ""I am extremely disappointed that House Republican leadership chose to include language to subject some unborn children to needless pain and suffering.""

While Republicans rule state politics in Georgia, strategists in both parties say Broun pulls the GOP primary field further to the right. That potentially gives Democrats an opening for the 2014 election in a state that Obama lost by single digits in 2008 and 2012 at a time when an influx of minority voters is making Georgia fertile future ground for the president's party.

The GOP can't afford to lose a Georgia seat it already holds as the party tries to gain the six seats necessary to win Senate control for the last two years of the Democratic president's term. No Democrats have officially entered the race, though Atlanta philanthropy executive Michelle Nunn is mulling a bid. Her father, Democrat Sam Nunn, represented Georgia in the U.S. Senate.

Story continues

In the Republican primary, abortion probably won't be the only consideration for most voters. But it could affect the result in a crowded primary field in which the margins likely will be close and a runoff could be needed.

Rep. Jack Kingston, who voted for the 20-week abortion ban, said Broun's vote is an ""irresponsible approach"" for someone who opposes abortion rights. ""The question is whether unborn children are more protected with this law,"" Kingston said. ""As we live in this post Roe v. Wade world, the reality is that we have to play chess, not checkers."" Kingston said he'll always support exceptions on abortion bans in cases of rape, incest and medical necessity to protect the life of a pregnant woman.

Karen Handel, the former secretary of state, said, ""I certainly respect the views of those who didn't support that bill. But that sort of all-or-nothing approach is what's wrong with Washington."" Handel supports rape and incest exceptions, saying: ""For women in those horrible circumstances, that is something for them to work through with their family, their church and their faith counselor.""

An aide to Rep. Phil Gingrey positioned her boss between Broun and the other candidates.

Jen Talaber said Gingrey wasn't pleased with the exceptions, but ""supported the bill because it saves lives."" Gingrey, also an obstetrician, has already walked a fine line on abortion. He publicly defended as ""partly right"" failed Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's claim last year that a woman's body can avoid pregnancy from a ""legitimate rape."" Gingrey later apologized and called his own remarks ""stupid.""

The proposal itself reflects state laws that many Republican legislatures have adopted in recent years, some of them already blocked by federal courts. It won't pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, but it gives Republicans and anti-abortion advocates a key vote to measure candidates.

The National Right to Life Committee strongly supported the House bill and warned House members in a letter beforehand that a no vote would be viewed ""no matter what justification is offered, as a vote to allow unlimited abortion in the sixth month or later.""

Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the group, said Broun followed some bad advice. ""We said this was the single most important pro-life legislation since the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was enacted a full decade ago,"" Johnson said.

But the group's state affiliate, Georgia Right to Life, praised Broun. In a letter posted on the organization's website, President Dan Becker called out Gingrey and Kingston as ""Georgia politicians who say one thing and vote another."" Becker then went on to issue a de facto endorsement, saying ""Let's elect (Broun) our new U.S. senator.""

That prompted pushback from some Republicans.

RedState.com founder Erick Erickson called for the formation of a new state anti-abortion group to replace Georgia Right to Life. ""Instead of saving souls, they'd rather stone those who are trying to save souls,"" Erickson wrote in a June 19 blog posting.

Suzanne Ward, a state Right to Life executive, said the Georgia group doesn't worry about election outcomes. ""It's never wrong to do the right thing,"" she said. ""We don't set our standard on political winds. Our standards are based on the word of God, and that doesn't change.""

It's not the first time Georgia Right to Life has roiled Republican races. The group clashed with Handel during the 2010 governor's race, refusing to endorse her because she supports some exceptions to abortion bans. Handel lost a close Republican runoff but went on to become a champion for some within the anti-abortion movement after a public battle with Planned Parenthood. In the last year, she wrote a book and traveled the country, talking with various Right to Life groups about her time as an executive with the Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the public outcry over the breast cancer charity's decision to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood, whose services for women include abortion.

Ward said her group's endorsement, complete with PAC contributions and organizational muscle, will come later. Asked whether a candidate who supported the House bill could win the nod, she said, ""We would always want to leave the door open for people to become educated and change their positions. We hope and pray people would do that.""

Kingston said he doesn't think the distinctions over abortion exceptions will have a strong effect, at least in the Republican primary. Most social conservatives, he predicted, will save their energies to campaign against a Democrat next year.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.

Abortion could be a dividing issue among Republicans in the 2014 Georgia Senate race.

The declared candidates all describe themselves as conservative abortion opponents. Two of them are congressmen who recently voted in favor of a bill to outlaw nearly all abortions beyond the 20th week after conception. Another candidate, who is a former secretary of state, said she would have voted yes.

But Rep. Paul Broun voted against the ban because, he said, it didn't go far enough. That put him alongside abortion-rights defenders like former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But it also drew praise from a leading anti-abortion group in Georgia.

The divide highlights potential friction as some national Republicans worry that a nominee who is too conservative could make the race competitive in this GOP-leaning state."

Democrats couldn't win without 'em!

The most damning conclusions lay in the survey’s examination of how people view the two major parties in terms of broad attributes. For Democrats, young voters chose “tolerant,” “diverse” and “open-minded,” while for Republicans they often chose “rich” and “religious.” In focus groups in January, the report said, young voters were asked to list leaders of the Democratic Party. “They named prominent former or currently elected officials: Pelosi, the Clintons, Obama, Kennedy, Gore. When those same respondents were asked to name Republican leaders, they focused heavily on media personalities and commentators: Bill O’Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck.” So it’s not terribly surprising that when they were asked what words came to mind when they heard ""Republican Party,"" the results ""were brutal — closed-minded, racist, rigid, old-fashioned.""

18-24: Obama 60, Romney 36

25-29: Obama 60, Romney 38

30-39: Obama 55, Romney 42

40-49: Obama 48, Romney 50

50-64: Obama 47, Romney 52

65+: Obama 44, Romney 56

Republicans decided to figure out why young voters were avoiding their party like MySpace:Per the exit polls:The circle of life and all, this is horrible news for the GOP. Their strongest supporters are the most likely to not be around the next cycle. Meanwhile, those young voters aren't just young, but also heavily brown. The median age of a native-born Latino is 18. As of last month, Latinos students outnumber their white counterparts in Texas schools. In 10 years, that'll be true for everyone in the state.

So when these youngsters talk about ""racist"" and ""rigid"" and ""closed-minded"" Republicans, they do so not just as an observation, but from personal experience. And with the GOP so closely branded with the buffoonery of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Bill O'Reilly, there is little chance the party can reverse that perception; Republicans aren't about to start distancing themselves from their right-wing media overlords.

Limbaugh and O'Reilly like to brag about their power, and it's true. They've been clearly instrumental in costing Republicans the millennial vote for a generation, if not forever."

In fact, we seem to be increasingly becoming two countries under one flag: Liberal Land — coastal, urban and multicultural — separated by Conservative Country — Southern and Western, rural and racially homogeneous. (Other parts of the country are a bit of a mixed bag.)

This has led to incredible and disturbing concentrations of power.

As The New York Times reported after the election in November, more than two-thirds of the states are now under single-party control, meaning that one party has control of the governor’s office and has majorities in both legislative chambers.

This is the highest level of such control since 1952. And Republicans have single-party control in nearly twice as many states as Democrats.

This is having very real consequences on the ground, nowhere more clearly than on the subjects of voting rights and women’s reproductive rights."

McAuliffe announced appointments of several members of his cabinet including, from second left, Paul Reagan, chief of staff, Ric Brown, secretary of finance, and Levar Stoney, secretary of the commonwealth. (Steve Helber/AP)

Virginia Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe began shaping his administration Monday, filling key administrative positions with veteran Democratic operatives with extensive experience he hopes will enable him to move his agenda forward.

McAuliffe (D) named Paul Reagan as his chief of staff; Suzette Denslow as deputy chief of staff; Ric Brown as secretary of finance; and Levar as the secretary of the commonwealth.

Reagan, Denslow and Brown all have long careers working for several top Democratic elected officials, including governors and members of Congress. Their collective expertise and many relationships in Richmond could help blunt criticism of McAuliffe’s lack of governing experience, which became an issue during his campaign against Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II.

And Brown, whose tenure as finance secretary will now span the terms of three governors, will bring crucial knowledge to a budget process expected to be squeezed by the continuing effects of federal budget cuts on Virginia’s economy.

McAuliffe, who has pledged a “mainstream, bipartisan” approach to governing, said during a brief news conference that the newly appointed members of his team will help him “find common ground with leaders of both parties around solutions that create jobs, grow our economy, and help navigate the uncertainty that we will face over the coming years.

“They are the ideal foundation for an administration that is devoted to building new bridges to compromise and erasing old partisan lines in the sand.”

Reagan has been involved in politics for more than 30 years, including serving as chief of staff to Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (D) and former Democratic senator Jim Webb. In Richmond, Reagan worked as communications director for former governor Mark R. Warner (D).

“There are few people in this commonwealth who can match Paul’s experience, practical knowledge of Virginia and administrative skills,” McAuliffe said. “Paul’s knowledge of this commonwealth and how we interact will be an invaluable asset to Virginia as this administration begins, as will his calm, collaborative and decisive leadership style.”

Denslow most recently served as chief of staff for Richmond Mayor Dwight C. Jones (D).

“Suzette’s talent, professionalism and knowledge of Virginia policy make her an invaluable asset,” McAuliffe said. “She has helped lead this city to a new chapter of economic growth, and I am thrilled she will bring her record of accomplishment to my administration.”

Previously, Denslow served as legislative director for both Warner and former governor Timothy M. Kaine (D). She was also deputy secretary of education for former Democratic governor L. Douglas Wilder.

Brown is the current secretary of finance. He has served the state for more than 40 years, working for 12 different governors, he said.

“It’s a privilege to be asked to stay,” Brown said. “I’m going to try to help as much as I can for as long as I can.”

McAuliffe said Brown has agreed to stay in the position at least through the first budget cycle. When Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) was elected, Brown said he planned to stay on for a short time. He remained in the post throughout McDonnell’s term.

McAuliffe said Brown’s appointment is crucial to bringing continuity at a time when the state faces fiscal challenges as a result of sequestration.

Republican leaders told him that if he could persuade Brown to join his administration, it would “probably be one of the smartest things you could do for the commonwealth.”

He said he enlisted help from Wilder and McDonnell to encourage Brown to stay.

“Secretary Brown has been a steady hand in a time of great uncertainty in our economy. He has contributed as much as anyone to helping Virginia weather the great recession and its fallout by protecting education, transportation and other key investments in Virginia’s economy,” McAuliffe said.

Stoney, McAuliffe’s deputy campaign manager, was described by McAuliffe as his “closest adviser” during the transition process and the “chief conduit to Virginia leaders from both political parties as we continue to prepare to take office.”

McAuliffe, who narrowly won the governor’s race two weeks ago, said Monday that he has spent the past two weeks meeting with elected leaders from both parties and working with his transition team to assemble his administration.

Reagan, Denslow, Brown and Stoney, “along with the rest of the team that we are working hard to put together during this transition process, will help me bring together people so that we are working on a common goal of job creation, diversifying our economy, improving education, reforming the [Standards of Learning test], fixing transportation and keeping our economy strong,” McAuliffe said."

Topping the list of lawmakers exalting the former First Lady and former Secretary of State are Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).

Clinton has not openly declared she is running in 2016. Yet, according to political strategist Tad Devine who helped Al Gore and John Kerry in their presidential bids, “She’s the prohibitive front-runner. She’s in a stronger position than anyone seeking the nomination other than an incumbent president in the last 40 years.” Clinton’s front runner status provides “a powerful inducement for figures to offer her early support,” he further commented.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, hoping to regain her leadership as Speaker of the House, also shares her support for the former First Lady. Pelosi recently stated, “If she were to run, I think that she would be the candidate, and I think she’d be one of the best prepared — and she would win.”

Besides Pelosi, Reid, and Schumer clamoring to jump on the Clinton band wagon, other less influential democratic legislators are trying to clutch onto the Clinton coattails. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), is willing to forget that she suggested in 2008 former President Bill Clinton may not be a good role model and that she wouldn’t let her daughter near him. Respecting the power of the Clintons, she now boasts, “I was one of the first to do the Ready for Hillary rollout. I’ve been publicly way out there for a while.”

Needless to say, there is good reason to be lending your support to Ms. Clinton. She and husband Bill prove to be exhaustive fundraisers and help draw potential voters to the polls, including female and minority voters. All of this means positive election outcomes and greater chances for Dems to win in their individual races. Moreover, an early coronation for Hillary will avoid unnecessary in-house battles that are often damaging in presidential primaries."

(CNN) —

Despite objections from popular Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, it seem the much-criticized budget deal will get final congressional approval this week, sidestepping the cooked-up dramas that have come to define the 113th Congress.

Good news for those of us who like it when politicians actually do their jobs.

Bad news for those who thought the Republican establishment and the tea party were going to live happily ever after.

Last week House Speaker John Boehner let some of his frustrations with the far-right cohort spill out on television. He called them “ridiculous.” He said, “They’ve lost all credibility,” and accused them of “pushing our members in places where they don’t want to be.” He even tossed in a bit of theatrics with his “Are you kidding me?” remark, all of which made for great sound bites.

ESPN LZ Granderson

Intentionally or not, the outburst also provided a good distraction from the overhaul the Republican National Committee is planning for the 2016 primary process, which was also was reported last week.

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus had talked about limiting the number of debates soon after President Barack Obama was re-elected. Now it seems the RNC is prepared to punish candidates who participate in unofficial GOP debates and forums severely by stripping them of one third of their delegates. Remember the quotes from Republican candidates all trying to out-ultra-conservative each other in 2012? Don’t expect to hear as many come 2016. This, more than entertaining sound bites from Boehner, is a far more tangible sign that the establishment is serious about reining in the radical right.

And by radical right, I mean the tea party.

So now what?

Well, 60% of Americans want a third party, and it seems Republicans want their party back. Perhaps it’s time that tea party standard bearer Cruz and company file the divorce papers and see if the group has the strength to stand on its own two feet.

It is, after all, unlikely that he or any of the other tea party-leaning politicians are going to forgo the group’s influence and get in line with moderates just because Boehner said some harsh words on TV. And with deep-pocket groups such as Americans for Prosperity behind the tea party, why should they?

Indeed, many tea partiers believe the reason Republicans lost in 2012 – despite an economy that lagged under the first Obama administration – was because Mitt Romney wasn’t conservative enough.

This thinking was echoed in November after tea partiers cited a lack of conservatism as a main reason why the anti-gay, anti-abortion Ken Cuccinelli lost in the governor’s race in Virginia.

Couple that with The New York Times reporting that presumptive front-runner – and establishment darling – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is as unpopular with ultra-conservatives as he is popular with moderates, and there is no reason to believe the tea party is just going to roll over after Obama signs the budget deal into law.

“(Christie’s) no more conservative than Harry Reid,” said Scott Hofstra, a tea partier from Vine Grove, Kentucky, told the Times. With statements such as that, it’s clear it’s time for the GOP and the tea party to call it quits. The two had a good run retaking the House in 2010, but if a guy such as Cuccinelli doesn’t pass the conservative smell test and Christie’s a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, then it seems this marriage is unsalvageable.

Debates within a party are healthy for Washington. But civil wars are not good for anyone, as evidenced by the country’s downgraded credit rating, Congress’ historically low approval numbers, the unprecedented number of appointment delays for Obama’s nominees and Congress’ dubious distinction of being the least productive in U.S. history.

The tea party supposedly started to express the views of voters frustrated with big government. But it has quickly morphed into a thorn in the side of the Republican establishment – prodding 2012 candidates into making outlandish statements and strong-arming leadership into a series of questionable moves.

It seems it now has a critical decision to make: be reined in or break out. The scenario reminds me of the day Ronald Reagan became a Republican.

It was the summer of 1962. And though he still called himself a Democrat, at this point, Reagan was so in name only. His political leanings had begun shifting in the 1940s, and he had been publicly campaigning for Republicans since the 1950s. One day, while campaigning for Richard Nixon, someone in the crowd interrupted his speech with a question.

Have you registered as a Republican yet?

He replied no.

And then a woman identifying herself as a registrar appeared. She walked down the center aisle, placed a registration card in front of Reagan, and he signed it. He then returned to his speech, later saying, “I didn’t leave the Democratic Party, the party left me.”

Last week Boehner came down the center aisle and placed a registration card in front of the tea party. But given its beliefs, funding and recent events, is there still a good reason why the group and its followers should sign it?

In A Three-Decade Career At The Washington Post', 'Robinson Has Been City Hall Reporter', 'City Editor', 'Foreign Correspondent In Buenos Aires', 'London']",Eugene Robinson: GOP obstruction as the new normal,"The bad news is that approval ratings for both the president and Congress are sinking, with voters increasingly frustrated at the bitter, partisan impasse in Washington. The worse news is that in terms of admiration for our national leaders, these may come to be seen as the good old days.

I’m an optimist by nature, a glass-half-full kind of guy. But try as I might, I can’t convince myself that Republicans in Congress are likely to respond any better to President Obama’s latest proposals on the economy than to the previous umpteen. I’m also pretty gloomy at the moment about the prospects for meaningful immigration reform — unless House Speaker John Boehner decides that passing a bill is more important than keeping his job.

“We should not be judged on how many new laws we create,” Boehner said Sunday. “We ought to be judged on how many laws that we repeal.” So much for faint hope.

My fear is that stasis has become a structural feature of our politics. Nothing lasts forever, but this depressing state of affairs could be with us for quite a while — and could get worse.

The public is not amused. Three out of four Americans disapprove of the job Congress is doing, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, while an NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey measured disapproval of Congress at a stunning 83 percent. Obama’s approval rating has slid to 49 percent, the Post-ABC poll found — better than the president’s political opponents are faring but hardly anything to cheer about.

Here’s the basic problem: The Democratic Party seems likely to grow ever stronger nationally while the GOP remains firmly entrenched locally. This means the stubborn, maddening, unproductive standoff between a Democratic president and a Republican majority in the House may be the new normal.

Demographic trends clearly favor the Democrats in presidential elections. Hispanics and Asian Americans, the nation’s biggest and fastest-growing minorities, respectively, both voted for Obama over Mitt Romney by more than 70 percent . This is not just a function of the GOP’s hostility to immigration reform, although that certainly doesn’t help. Republicans are also out of step with these voters on other issues, such as health care. And all too often they transmit a breathtaking level of hostility.

A case in point is the recent allegation by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) that for every young undocumented immigrant who becomes a valedictorian, “there’s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds — and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.”

Criticized by his colleagues — ixnay on the igotrybay — King insisted his comments were “factually correct.” And the GOP’s outreach to Latino voters returned to square one.

None of this eliminates the possibility that Democrats will nominate flawed presidential candidates or that Republicans will nominate attractive ones. But all things being equal, the Democratic Party likely will go into presidential elections with a structural advantage. Eventually the GOP will be at pains to defend even Texas, the party’s only reliable mega-state.

Yet the Republican majority in the House, ensconced by clever redistricting, will be hard to dislodge. Perhaps Democratic registration and get-out-the-vote efforts can reshape the midterm electorate enough next year to recapture the majority. I wouldn’t bet the mortgage on it.

It may be, then, that we’re in for a much longer period of divided government in which the principal way that Republicans can affect federal policy is through obstruction. The whole “party of no” thing is more than a meme; it’s a logical — if somewhat nihilistic — plan of action. Or inaction.

Republicans know they cannot repeal the Affordable Care Act, for example, but they can hamper its implementation. They cannot impose their vision of immigration reform — all fence and no citizenship, basically — but they can ensure that no reforms are approved. They cannot choose their own nominees for federal judgeships, but they can block Obama’s.

Commentators who criticize the president for not hosting enough cocktail parties or golf outings for Republicans are ignoring political reality. He has tried being nice, he has tried being tough, he has tried offering to compromise, he has tried driving a hard bargain. Nothing works if Republicans are committed to blocking every single thing he seeks to do.

No wonder Obama chose to unveil his economic program while making what looks like a campaign swing. It will be the voters who eventually get us out of this hole. Unfortunately, that may take some time.

When Citizens United came down, bingo—no more serious restrictions in the 60 days before the election. However, the 501(c)(4) loophole is not supposed to be as wide and deep as it has become. There are two types of 501(c)(4)s—those that are genuine social-welfare organizations that also do some lobbying or direct policy-advocacy work, and a relatively small group that were set up to subvert or evade disclosure laws and requirements so that donors could pour in money to shape and influence elections anonymously. It is the latter group that the IRS has had trouble with—and that was behind the efforts to single out highly charged categories. The law says 501(c)(4)s have to be “exclusively” involved in social welfare. Ridiculously, inexplicably, the IRS regulations changed “exclusively” to “primarily,” never specifically defined the term, and then passively accepted the rough rule of thumb proposed by pols and lawyers that anything over 50 percent of the money expended would qualify. Into this huge loophole rode Karl Rove, whose American Crossroads, a political organization that required donor disclosure, established in 2010 a sister, Crossroads GPS, a 501(c)(4), explicitly to court donors for political campaigns who did not want their identities disclosed. The idea that Crossroads GPS, or the American Action Network, or Priorities USA, or a host of other organizations engaged in partisan campaigning on both sides are “social welfare organizations” is nonsense. Bloomberg’s Julie Bykowicz recently pointed to another example to show the farce here. Patriot Majority USA, run by a Democratic operative, told the IRS its mission was “to encourage a discussion of economic issues.” It spent $7.5 million in ads attacking Republican candidates in 2012—and then virtually disappeared, with Bykowicz unable to reach the group by e-mail or phone. “Social welfare?”

In the IRS case, many prominent Washington lawyers say Ruemmler made the sensible legal call. She protected her client — Obama — by distancing him from a politically sensitive problem and ensuring that he could not be accused of meddling in an inquiry.... But Ruemmler and McDonough’s careful plan for the IRS was upended on May 10, when Lois Lerner, a senior official at the agency, broke the news by admitting that the IRS had given extra scrutiny to conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Senior White House officials were stunned to see the IRS trying to get ahead of its own story — and in doing so, creating a monstrous communications disaster for an administration that appeared not to know what its agencies were up to.

Best IRS journo story to date on what actually happened from WaPo (aka when doing the right thing everywhere else—not interfering with a probe— looks bad in DC because an IRS official wants to CYA):See David Petraeus and Benghazi.

Greg Sargent:

As you know, Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee last night yanked provisions out of the immigration reform bill that would extend immigration rights to gay married couples, angering the gay rights community. But this battle is not necessarily over. What comes next could get quite interesting from a strategic and political standpoint.

Whenever the world of Washington seems hopeless, someone will point out that the Senate Judiciary Committee did a good job on immigration reform. That’s it? Yeah, pretty much.

http://news.yahoo.com/big-crowd-high-spirits-2nd-obama-swearing-153950715--politics.html,,[],"Big crowd, high spirits for 2nd Obama swearing-in","WASHINGTON (AP) — Declaring ""our work begins today"", President Barack Obama vowed to ""finish what we started"" four years ago as hundreds of thousands of inauguration-goers gathered on the historic National Mall in anticipation of his oath-taking for a second term.

""Let's go,"" Obama tweeted Monday morning as he began the day of inaugural celebrations.

The president was cheered in the streets as his motorcade slowly made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House and arrived at the Capitol. At midday, he was to speak to a huge crowd on the Mall and millions more watching on television, hoping to set an optimistic tone for a divided nation seeking solutions to economic woes at home and conflict overseas.

The fanfare is extending across the nation's capital, including the traditional inaugural parade and a pair of glitzy formal balls.

Obama, along with his family and Vice President Joe Biden, began his day with a church service at St. John's Episcopal Church. Known as ""The Church of the Presidents"", St. John's is located just across from the White House on the other side of Lafayette Park. Pew 54 is known as ""the president's pew"" and is reserved for the commander in chief whenever he attends.

The centerpiece of Monday's festivities is Obama's inaugural address. The president will be urging lawmakers to find common ground and will preview his second-term goals, including immigration reform, stricter gun-control laws and an end to the war in Afghanistan.

Obama is also facing fresh concerns about terrorism in North Africa. In the midst of the inaugural celebrations, a U.S. official said two more Americans died in Algeria, bringing the U.S. death toll from a four-day siege at a natural gas plant to three. Seven Americans survived, the official said.

Washington largely shelved its partisan fighting for the three days of inaugural celebrations. Obama, perhaps seeking to start fresh with lawmakers in his second term, invited several members of Congress to the White House before his swearing-in, including the Republican leaders he has been at odds with for the past four years: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

Story continues

""This is a great day for all Americans to celebrate and to remember that the Capitol belongs to all,"" Cantor wrote on Twitter.

Pressing matters await the president and Congress once the celebrations subside, including three looming fiscal deadlines. Obama will also need help from a reluctant Congress if he hopes to fulfill his promise to sign comprehensive immigration reform and tighten gun laws in the wake of last month's school shooting in Newtown, Conn.

The mood surrounding Obama's second inaugural is more subdued than it was four years ago, when the swearing in of the nation's first black president drew 1.8 million people to the Mall. Still, organizers were expecting up to 700,000 to attend Monday's events, which would make it the largest second-term inaugural in history.

At least one public viewing area on the National Mall was full two hours before the president's swearing-in, and the crowd spread from the Capitol to the Washington Monument.

The weather forecast was encouraging, to a point. High temperatures were predicted for the lower 40s during the day, with a slight chance of rain and snow showers in the afternoon and flurries later.

Security was tight across Washington, with several streets near the White House and Capitol Hill closed off. Humvees and city buses were being used to block intersections. Volunteers fanned out near the Mall to help direct the crowds.

Lawmakers and other officials slowly trickled onto the platform on the West Front of the Capitol where Obama was to be sworn in. Former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were in attendance, along with former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.

David Richardson of Atlanta and his two young children were among the early crowds heading to the National Mall Monday even before sunrise.

""We wanted to see history, I think, and also for the children to witness that anything is possible through hard work,"" Richardson said.

Wendy Davis of Rome, Ga., was one of thousands of inaugural attendees who packed Metro trains before sunrise headed for the Capitol and parade route. Davis came four years ago as well but was among the many ticketholders who couldn't get in because of the massive crowds. She was determined to get in this time.

""I thought I was early last time but I obviously wasn't early enough,"" she said.

By 8 a.m. thousands of people were also waiting in security lines that stretched a block to gain access to the spots along the parade route that were accessible to the general public without a special ticket.

The cold weather was easily tolerated by Marie-France Lemaine of Montreal, who received the trip to the inaugural as a birthday present from her husband. She headed up an Obama advocacy group in Quebec that cheered on the president from north of the border.

""The American president affects the rest of the world,"" she said.

The president was officially sworn-in shortly before noon on Sunday, in keeping with the Constitution's mandate that presidents begin their new term on Jan. 20. But because inaugural ceremonies are historically not held on Sundays, the public celebration was pushed to Monday, coinciding with the birthday of late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

Condoleezza Rice, who served as secretary of state under former President George W. Bush, called on Obama to put electoral politics aside in his second term if he hopes to accomplish those objectives.

""It requires now a kind of humility and a reaching across the aisle,"" Rice said on CBS ""This Morning. ""And reaching across the aisle, by the way, means reaching out to Americans who may not have voted for him.""

Following his swearing-in, Obama will attend the traditional luncheon with lawmakers before joining marching bands and floats in the inaugural parade, which winds its way from Capitol Hill to the White House.

The president and first lady will then slip into formalwear for two swanky inaugural balls. That's far fewer than the 10 they attended after the 2009 inauguration, though this year's events are still expected to draw up to about 40,000 people.

The centerpiece of Monday's activities was Obama's inaugural address. Aides said he would make the case that the nation's founding values can still guide the country through changing times. He is not expected to outline specifically policy proposals, saving them instead for his Feb. 12 State of the Union address.

Some Americans, weary after four years of shaky economic news, implored Obama to focus on patriotism, not politics, in his remarks.

""I'm just hoping for a nice eloquent speech that makes people feel good about being an American,"" said Sean Payton, a 32-year-old Democrat from Highland Ranch, Colo.

Monday's celebrations bring to a close three days of inaugural fanfare across Washington, including a day of service, a wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery, and a concert honoring military families.

The quirk in the calendar meant Obama would end up being sworn in for his second term twice. Sunday's ceremony was an intimate gathering at the White House, with only a dozen family members on hand to witness Chief Justice John Roberts administer the oath of office.

Obama placed his hand on a Bible used for years by Michelle Obama's family. On Monday, he'll take the oath using two — one owned by King and one by Abraham Lincoln.

Vice President Joe Biden was also to be sworn in for the second term a second time Monday. Biden took the oath of office Sunday at the Naval Observatory in northwest Washington. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, appointed by Obama as the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court, administered the oath to Biden, who placed his hand on a Bible his family has used since 1893.

Ahead of his swearing-in Sunday, Obama, along with Vice President Joe Biden, solemnly honored the nation's fallen soldiers during a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. On a crisp, sun-splashed morning, Obama and Biden placed a large wreath adorned with red, white and blue ribbon, in front of Arlington's Tomb of the Unknowns. Holding their hands over their hearts, the two leaders stood motionless as a bugler played taps.

Neither did voters on Nov. 6.

Remember this shocking, game-changing revelation? Neither did voters on Nov. 6.

According to Nielsen numbers, Hannity lost around half of his audience in the weeks after the election, while his Fox News colleague Bill O’Reilly — who steadfastly refuses to identify himself politically as a conservative — retained around 70% of his audience. So what happened to Hannity? The going wisdom is that viewers who basked in his preelection anti-Obama rhetoric tuned him out when they were stunned to wake up on Nov. 7 and discover that the President had won a second term — a scenario that Hannity had all but promised could never happen.

“The right-leaning outlets like Fox News and Rush Limbaugh’s show are far more intellectually closed than CNN or public radio. If you’re a rank-and-file conservative, you’re probably ready to acknowledge that ideologically friendly media didn’t accurately inform you about Election 2012. Some pundits engaged in wishful thinking; others feigned confidence in hopes that it would be a self-fulfilling prophecy; still others decided it was smart to keep telling right-leaning audiences what they wanted to hear.”

The election left a little tarnish on the crown of the Clown Prince of Conservative Entertainment Complex™. New York Daily News: The NYDN quotes Conor Friedersdorf from The Atlantic for some perspective:For what it's worth, the more left leaning and centrist pundits, Rachel Maddow on MSNBC and Anderson Cooper on CNN, have seen little audience erosion. Maddow lost little and Anderson virtually none.

I'd certainly like to think that it reflects a permanent dispiriting that would signal a major realigning of the goals and tactics of the Conservative Entertainment Complex™. I'd like to think they'll wake up and recognize that constantly catering to the basest instincts of the Republican Party—however divorced from reality they might be—is not ultimately a good strategy. I'd like to dream of a world where the unmitigated bullshit the Conservative Entertainment Complex™ spews becomes their own undoing when the populous decides to seek out better sources of information.

But Conservative Entertainment Complex™ appears to have learned nothing from the election results.

I really think it's a cyclical blip. The Conservative Entertainment Complex™ won't see the light that easily, and their viewers haven't realized Hannity is feeding them a pack of lies. They're basically just dispirited and depressed and want to avoid all the bad news. They want to avoid having their nose rubbed in their fail during this very sensitive time. And, of course, they're all at guns shows stocking up. They have bunkers to build, dammit.

The fact that the lefter-leaning media is untouched indicates people who are able to cope with information from the reality-based universe are still interested and engaged in politics, and those who can't are just hiding out.

But the need Fox News' crowd feels to escape from reality and make their own alternative universe will not go away overnight.

And, by the time midterms roll around, Hannity will continue to feed his viewers lies and distortions and ridiculous hyperbolic nonsense. And his audience will sense—in their gut—that ""this time will be different!"" And they will follow him right over the Conservative Entertainment Complex™ cliff once again. Whatever charlatan Hannity and company will anoint as the savior of the conservative movement, they'll rally around them. There will be 2014 version of Romney, Mourdock, Cain, Akin, O'Donnell, Angle and Palin ... (or maybe those actual people, past failure is never a disqualifier).

Whoever it is, they will have finally found their ""true conservative"" and this time, the perfect conduit for the message! They'll find a silver bullet, be it Benghazi or the birth certificate or some new fabricated poutrage, and that one will really make the voters finally see the ""truth.""

And so it will continue.

Which is not to say we shouldn't savor this sweet moment of schadenfreude. Happy New Year! Please enjoy."

http://news.yahoo.com/democrats-ditch-historic-u-senate-rule-blamed-gridlock-153435717--sector.html,,[],Democrats ditch historic U.S. Senate rule blamed for gridlock,"By Thomas Ferraro and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate, in a historic and bitterly fought rule change, stripped Republicans on Thursday of their ability to block President Barack Obama's judicial and executive branch nominees. The action fundamentally altered the way Congress' upper chamber has worked since the mid-19th century by making it impossible for a minority party, on its own, to block presidential appointments, except those to the U.S. Supreme Court. The change in the so-called ""filibuster"" rule does not apply to legislation, which can still be held up by a handful of senators. The now-defunct rule, a symbol of Washington gridlock, has survived dozens of attacks over the years largely because both major political parties like to use it. The action will undoubtedly come back to haunt Democrats the next time they lose the Senate and the White House simultaneously. Getting rid of it was considered so momentous and divisive that it was dubbed the ""nuclear option"" in the Senate. On a nearly party-line vote of 52-48, the Senate reduced from 60 to 51 the number of votes needed to end procedural roadblocks. Obama, a former senator, praised the action, calling the filibuster ""a reckless and relentless tool to grind all business to a halt."" The change will speed up the confirmation of Obama appointments to the courts as well as to cabinet and regulatory agencies. One beneficiary is likely to be Representative Mel Watt, whose nomination to take over the agency that regulates mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was being blocked by Republicans. But the immediate spark was Democratic frustration at Republican use of the filibuster to block Obama's appointments to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, considered the nation's second most important court after the U.S. Supreme Court. The Washington-based appeals court handles crucial disputes over the powers of the presidency and Congress, along with regulatory matters involving air and water pollution, banks, securities trading, telecommunications and labor relations. It has also been a feeder to the Supreme Court, with four of the current justices being former D.C. Circuit judges. NEW RULE USED QUICKLY Democrats quickly used the new rule by ending a Republican filibuster against one of those court nominees, Patricia Millett, on a vote of 55-43. A vote to confirm her nomination will be held later. Millett is a Harvard-trained lawyer who worked in the administration of both Democratic President Bill Clinton and Republican President George W. Bush. The American Bar Association gave her its top rating for the D.C. Circuit post. As is often the case with stalled nominations, Republicans did not contend that Millet lacked qualifications. They simply do not want to give Obama more appointments to the important court, which they argue is underworked anyway. For nearly two years, Republicans held up confirmation of Richard Cordray as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because they objected to the bureau's powers, not to Cordray, who has since been confirmed. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, led the charge on the rules change, accusing Republicans of record obstructionism and saying the American public is right to believe that ""Congress is broken."" Reid said that of the 168 filibusters against presidential nominees in U.S. history, half were held against Obama's picks. ""It's time to change,"" Reid said. Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa fired back, ""This is a naked power grab."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell insisted that there was no reason for a rule change, saying Republicans had confirmed the vast majority of Obama's judicial nominees. McConnell also accused Democrats of taking the action merely to divert attention from the botched launch of Obama's healthcare law, known as Obamacare. But with Congress's approval rating in single digits and no indication Republicans will compromise with Obama on much of anything, Reid decided to pull the trigger. Reid assumes that voters, who polls show are disgusted with a largely ""do-nothing"" Congress, won't be upset by a rule change to confirm stalled nominees, Democratic aides said. Reid also figured that if he did not change the rules, that increasingly anti-compromise Republicans would change them when they win control of the Senate, which could happen in next year's election, the aides said. Stephen Hess, a congressional analyst at The Brookings Institution, said, ""There's a good reason why it's called 'the nuclear option.' This does change the system."" ""And whether it's good or bad depends on from whence you view it and at what moment,"" Hess said. ""It is good for Democrats on the 21st of November, 2013. And it may not be good (for Democrats) if the landscape changes in the mid-term election"" next year and Republicans take control of the Senate. Asked whether the Democrats' move could worsen relations with Republicans and make it more difficult to pass legislation, Hess said ""I don't know that relations this bad can get an awful lot worse.""

On the call, according to a donor who was on it, McConnell personally named Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) as Tea Party conservatives he views as problematic for him. “The bulk of it was an attack on the Tea Party in general, Cruz in particular,” the source, a prominent donor, said in a phone interview with Breitbart News.

But the most memorable line came at the end of the call.

“McConnell said the Tea Party was ‘nothing but a bunch of bullies,'” the source said. “And he said ‘you know how you deal with schoolyard bullies? You punch them in the nose and that’s what we’re going to do.'”

Rove, as well as American Crossroads President and CEO Steven J. Law who also serves as the president of sister group Crossroads GPS, were also on the call. Rove “talked in a slightly gentler way, or let’s say, a more diplomatic way,” the source said. “But the message was pretty well the same: That if we’re going to save this thing, we have to back real Republicans.”

Pointing to how Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid just invoked the “nuclear option,” breaking 225-year old Senate rules to slip through President Obama’s liberal nominees, an aide to a Tea Party lawmaker said that McConnell’s focus on trying to go after the Tea Party has jeopardized Senate Republicans’ chances at actually beating Democrats. “Under Sen. McConnell’s watch, Republicans today just got rolled over by Democrats who pushed the button on the nuclear option, destroying years of well-established Senate order,” the aide said in an email to Breitbart News. “Perhaps if he focused less on destroying the Tea Party and more on defeating Democrats, he’d have more to show for his leadership.”

Rove spokesman Jonathan Collegio denies that anything was said about Cruz, Lee, or the Tea Party in general but admits the call did take place and that “some discussion” about the government shutdown and the Senate Conservatives Fund took place.

“Your source is ascribing things to the call that simply were never said,” Collegio said in an email. “There was no ‘anti-tea party donor call.’ There was a call, and there was some discussion about the government shutdown and the Senate Conservatives Fund (note this was one day after SCF launched a dishonest ad about McConnell), but nothing about the Tea Party or Sens. Cruz or Lee.”

Collegio declined to provide a transcript or recording of the call to Breitbart News. McConnell’s office has not commented on the matter."

USA TODAY

Special election for remainder of Frank Lautenberg%27s term is Oct. 16

Chiesa%2C currently New Jersey%27s attorney general%2C says he will not run

Nominating petitions for special election due Monday%2C June 10

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appointed state Attorney General Jeff Chiesa to be the interim U.S. senator Thursday.

Chiesa, a Republican and former chief counsel to Christie, said he will not be a candidate in the special election Oct. 16 for the remainder of Frank Lautenberg's term.

Lautenberg, 89, died Monday of complications from viral pneumonia. The U.S. Senate is paying a final tribute to Lautenberg, whose body is lying in repose this afternoon in the chamber.

Chiesa, 47, attorney general of New Jersey since January 2012, is a longtime Christie ally. They've known each other for more than 20 years, since Christie interviewed him for a clerkship at his law firm. Chiesa would later serve as a federal prosecutor for nine years at the U.S. attorney's office.

""I'll use my best judgment,"" Chiesa, a self-described conservative, said at a news conference with Christie.

""I don't kid myself that I'm going to go down there with a bunch of bills,"" he said. ""I want to understand the process, I want to understand the people that I'll be working with and develop relationships with them and do the best I can.""

Chiesa will join the U.S. Senate on Monday — the same day special election candidates must submit petitions with 1,000 signatures to New Jersey's election division. Primaries will be held Aug. 13.

Because of the compressed election schedule, New Jersey moved quickly into a political frenzy — even before Lautenberg's casket arrived at the U.S. Capitol. Lautenberg, the last World War II veteran in the Senate, will be buried Friday at Arlington National Cemetery.

Christie, who is running for a second term in November, is taking heat from Democrats for the timing and costs of the special election. State law on filling vacancies conflicted, and some Republicans wanted Christie to delay the special election until November 2014.

Democrats wanted a special election this November to help boost turnout for state Sen. Barbara Buono, who lags Christie in all statewide public opinion polls.

The primary and the general election will cost New Jersey about $12 million each, which Christie said the state will pay. Christie said he would have faced a lawsuit if he scheduled the special election for next year.

""I was confronted with a set of imperfect choices,"" Christie said, ""but I don't believe that ... letting people select their senator as soon as possible and sending him to Washington as soon as possible is"" wrong.

Hours before Christie announced his appointment, Democratic Rep. Rush Holt declared his candidacy. Holt, an eight-term congressman and a physicist, said he is the best person ""to continue the passionate advocacy for progressive values that Sen. Lautenberg exemplified.""

Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who had declared his intention to run for the Senate in 2014, is gathering signatures for his nominating petition, according to The Star-Ledger.

Booker, a popular Democrat with a national following, has raised nearly $2 million for the 2014 Senate race and would be able to use those funds for the special election.

Rep. Frank Pallone, a 14-term Democratic congressman, is also likely to run for the vacant Senate seat. Pallone can transfer funds from his House account — about $3.4 million — into another account for a Senate race.

Steve Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota, is running for the GOP Senate nomination.

End presidential term limits

By Jonathan Zimmerman,

Jonathan Zimmerman is a professor of history and education at New York University. His books include “Small Wonder: The Little Red Schoolhouse in History and Memory.”

In 1947, Sen. Harley Kilgore (D-W.Va.) condemned a proposed constitutional amendment that would restrict presidents to two terms. “The executive’s effectiveness will be seriously impaired,” Kilgore argued on the Senate floor, “ as no one will obey and respect him if he knows that the executive cannot run again.”

I’ve been thinking about Kilgore’s comments as I watch President Obama, whose approval rating has dipped to 37 percent in CBS News polling — the lowest ever for him — during the troubled rollout of his health-care reform. Many of Obama’s fellow Democrats have distanced themselves from the reform and from the president. Even former president Bill Clinton has said that Americans should be allowed to keep the health insurance they have.

Or consider the reaction to the Iran nuclear deal. Regardless of his political approval ratings, Obama could expect Republican senators such as Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.) to attack the agreement. But if Obama could run again, would he be facing such fervent objections from Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.)?

Probably not. Democratic lawmakers would worry about provoking the wrath of a president who could be reelected. Thanks to term limits, though, they’ve got little to fear.

Nor does Obama have to fear the voters, which might be the scariest problem of all. If he chooses, he could simply ignore their will. And if the people wanted him to serve another term, why shouldn’t they be allowed to award him one?

That was the argument of our first president, who is often held up as the father of term limits. In fact, George Washington opposed them. “I can see no propriety in precluding ourselves from the service of any man who, in some great emergency, shall be deemed universally most capable of serving the public,” Washington wrote in a much-quoted letter to the Marquis de Lafayette.

Washington stepped down after two terms, establishing a pattern that would stand for more than a century. But he made clear that he was doing so because the young republic was on solid footing, not because his service should be limited in any way.

The first president to openly challenge the two-term tradition was Theodore Roosevelt, who ran for a third term as president in 1912 on the Bull Moose ticket. When he stepped down in 1908, Roosevelt pledged not to seek a third term; reminded of this promise in 1912, he said that he had meant he would not seek a “third consecutive term.” The New York Times called Roosevelt’s explanation a “pitiful sophistication,” and the voters sent Woodrow Wilson to the White House.

Only in 1940, amid what George Washington might have called a “great emergency,” did a president successfully stand for a third term. Citing the outbreak of war overseas and the Depression at home, Democrats renominated Franklin D. Roosevelt. They pegged him for a fourth time in 1944 despite his health problems, which were serious enough to send him to his grave the following year.

To Republicans, these developments echoed the fascist trends enveloping Europe. “You will be serving under an American totalitarian government before the long third term is finished,” warned Wendell Wilkie, Roosevelt’s opponent in 1940. Once the two-term tradition was broken, Wilkie added, nobody could put it back together. “If this principle dies, it will be dead forever,” he said.

That’s why the GOP moved to codify it in the Constitution in 1947, when a large Republican majority took over Congress. Ratified by the states in 1951, the 22nd Amendment was an “undisguised slap at the memory of Franklin D. Roosevelt,” wrote Clinton Rossiter, one of the era’s leading political scientists. It also reflected “a shocking lack of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the people,” Rossiter said.

He was right. Every Republican in Congress voted for the amendment, while its handful of Democratic supporters were mostly legislators who had broken with FDR and his New Deal. When they succeeded in limiting the presidency to two terms, they limited democracy itself.

“I think our people are to be safely trusted with their own destiny,” Sen. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) argued in 1947. “We do not need to protect the American people with a prohibition against a president whom they do not wish to elect; and if they wanted to elect him, have we the right to deny them the power?”

It’s time to put that power back where it belongs. When Ronald Reagan was serving his second term, some Republicans briefly floated the idea of removing term limits so he could run again. The effort went nowhere, but it was right on principle. Barack Obama should be allowed to stand for re election just as citizens should be allowed to vote for — or against — him. Anything less diminishes our leaders and ourselves.

He last flew down after his father died in October. More than 500 people attended the funeral at Seaview Baptist Church. A roadblock had to be erected in a town where many of the roads are still dirt paths. Friends said he did not talk of his troubles.

Beverton Roye said Thompson had assured him earlier that he would prevail. “He said: ‘Don’t worry about me. I’m going to be all right. I’m clean,’ ” said Roye, who is chief public health inspector for St. Elizabeth parish. “Those are the exact words he said to me.”

The usually media-shy Thompson basked in the spotlight each year during the televised, black-tie NAACP Image Awards. For more than a decade, TCBA had been the accounting firm that tabulated the results. But last year, the NAACP used other accountants.

President Obama, Gov. O’Malley, Del. Norton and Del. Donna M. Christensen, who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands, have returned contributions they believed were associated with Thompson. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) also returned money that had been given to his gubernatorial campaign.

TCBA is now BCA. Thompson sold his 79 percent interest to Ralph Bazilio. He has sold some of his properties, including the salon that he allowed his hairdresser to use.

Lawyer Charles Parsons sued Thompson when he tried to renege on the sale of the salon. “His assets are being stripped, and here I was, one of the strippers,” Parsons said.

Parsons said he met with Thompson in person three or four times. They settled in March. Parsons noticed that Thompson never showed up in his tailor-made suits.

“I thought he would be a very arrogant guy. . . . He’s had so much money sloshing around the gas tank,” Parsons said. “The fact of the matter is he wasn’t without his charm. He saw the humor in things. He laughed. He was laughing at a time when his world was coming down.”

USA TODAY

Chris Christie and Hillary Rodham Clinton are the ""hottest politicians"" in the nation, according to one new poll.

The coldest: Congressional leaders from both parties.

Christie, the New Jersey governor and potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, rates 53.1 degrees on what Quinnipiac University calls its ""thermometer of voters attitudes towards the nation's major political figures.""

Clinton, the former secretary of State, senator, first lady and potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, is second at 52.1 degrees.

A surprising third place: First-year Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., at 49.2 degrees.

President Obama is in fourth at 47.6 degrees, tied with Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

""Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's score is not surprising given her lengthy political career and especially strong support among Democrats and women,"" said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.

He added: ""But Gov. Christopher Christie's rating is impressive given that his experience -- less than four years as governor -- pales compared to Mrs. Clinton' s résumé. What is interesting is that only two of the 22 figures rate better than the absolute middle of the scale, not exactly a ringing endorsement of the nation's political establishment.""

The four lowest rated politicians in this survey are all congressional leaders: Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi (38.4); Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell (37.5); Republican House Speaker John Boehner (36.7); and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid (33.8).

By some forecasts, it may not be a pretty sight.

Gathered with him that evening were several of the nation’s leading historians, who reminded him of the sorry litany of second terms — the cascade of scandal, war, recession, political defeat and other calamities that afflicted past presidents after the heady crescendo of re-election.

For Mr. Obama, who will be sworn in for another four years in a quiet ceremony on Sunday and then again in more public fashion on Monday, the lessons were familiar if daunting. Embarking on the next half of his presidency, he and his advisers are developing a second-term strategy intended to avoid the pitfalls of his predecessors with a robust agenda focused on the economy, gun control, immigration and energy.

“We’ve talked a lot about this,” said David Plouffe, the president’s senior adviser who is leaving the White House at the end of the week. “We have spent a lot of time trying to figure out both what to pursue but also these issues of making sure you’re bringing the same sort of energy and same sort of focus as the first term.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/after-a-bitter-election--bloomberg-and-de-blasio-make-peace-195157227.html,,[],"After a bitter election, Bloomberg and de Blasio look to make peace","NEW YORK — They spoke in voices so hushed it was hard to judge exactly what the conversation was about, but their body language said it all.

Just hours after New York voters overwhelmingly picked Democrat Bill de Blasio to succeed Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the two political nemeses met for the first time, sitting across from one another at a wooden conference table inside the mayor’s office at City Hall.

The post-election night get-together has been a long tradition in New York politics, a sign of two rivals putting aside the bitterness of the campaign to move forward for the good of the city. But this meeting was of particular curiosity — given that de Blasio, who currently serves as the city’s public advocate, rode to a landslide victory over his Republican rival by essentially casting himself as the anti-Bloomberg.

Unlike past efforts by political rivals to make nice with each other in front of cameras, De Blasio and Bloomberg skipped any pretense of jocularity and didn't speak to the large press scrum who came to watch. Instead, reporters were led in groups of six at a time to witness minute-long snippets of their meeting, which was held overlooking the infamous “bullpen” — the open floor plan of desks that Bloomberg installed inside the mayor’s office at City Hall.

Journalists shifted in and out of the room to eye the two politicians, demonstrating the same kind of curiosity that they might have at an exhibit of caged zoo animals. De Blasio seemed fidgety, rearranged his six-foot-five frame several times in his chair, leaned forward and back, and whispered occasionally audible phrases like “What did…” and “How did you…” and “Didn’t he…"" It suggested a friendly curiosity by the mayor-elect toward the incumbent, though de Blasio never smiled.

Bloomberg, who wore a blank look, whispered answers in return, his hand resting near a digital clock that tallied up the length of the meeting, which by then was past the half-hour mark. Nearby, another digital click ticked down — this one counting the hours he has left until he leaves office on Dec. 31.

The outgoing mayor has never projected much warmth and didn't do so today. He clutched a cup of coffee, while de Blasio had a can of ginger ale. But neither man took a sip.

At one point, Bloomberg looked past de Blasio to the reporters who held their iPhones and tape recorders aloft, trying to capture the meeting. He crossed his arms and frowned — a moment that quickly made the rounds through a photo posted on Twitter.

Aides said there would be no read-out of the details of their roughly hour-long conversation.

De Blasio later held a press conference to announce the formation of a transition team to help him prepare to take office in 55 days. And he offered rare praise for Bloomberg, telling reporters their meeting had been “very, very productive,” “very cordial,” “very helpful” and “very collegial."" He said he planned to work “very closely” with Bloomberg during the next few weeks, though he still offered no details on what the two had discussed.

“He and his team have been very forthcoming, very positive,” de Blasio said of Bloomberg. “It is obvious this is going to be a smooth and productive transition, and I want to thank him for the spirit in which he is approaching this and for the helpful advice he gave this morning.”"

It may be cold and gloomy outside today but it is warm and sunny in my world. This message is long overdue…it has been weighing heavily on me how much gratitude I owe each and every one of you. The unbelievable outpouring of support from ABC began from the first moment I received my diagnosis. Phone calls, emails, cards, flowers, blankets, care packages, food, pajamas, slippers, help with insurance, medical advice….The list goes on and on…It was truly overwhelming how many of you thought of everything anyone could possibly want or need during a time of medical crisis. It brought so many tears of joy to my eyes and warmed my heart more than you’ll ever know to see what my ABC family did for me and for my entire family. In fact, there have been so many emails, it may take me weeks to get back to each and every one of you!

Physically and emotionally I have been through the ringer, but I am emerging on the other side so much stronger. I have a greater appreciation for life, for health and for how such simple acts of kindness can be so incredibly powerful. I am looking through a different lens now…and I am thankful for that as well. There was my life before October 30th and now my life after.

My prognosis is good, I got very lucky finding the cancer through our ABC sponsored mammogram and I got lucky choosing an aggressive approach, bilateral mastectomy, because while in surgery last week my surgeon found a second, undetected malignant tumor. No MRI, no mammogram, no sonogram had found it…it was only through the mastectomy that she discovered it. My cancer had spread to my sentinel lymph node, but not beyond, so I will have more treatments ahead of me, but none that will take me out of work. As of right now, I plan to head back into the building Monday, December 2nd and I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work.

Your support and love has made this all an experience that has given me the strength to fight the fear and hopefully help others do the same in the days/weeks/years to come!

With much love,

Amy"

Of course you do. Towards that end, the Republican party has launched the Growth & Opportunity Project, chaired by such luminaries as Henry Barbour and Ari Fleischer, to recommend how best to not screw things up quite so horribly next time. And to help with that, they're using that most scientific of all tools, an internet survey

The questions are, sadly, rather generic:



Which issues do you think Republicans should spend MORE time talking about? (please select one)

- Fiscal issues, like taxes, government spending, and the debt

- Economic issues, like unemployment, housing, and high energy prices

- National Security issues, like terrorism, foreign policy, and national defense

- Social issues, like abortion and family values

They also ask you to rate how much ""improvement"" the party needs in areas like ""Diversity within the Party"" and ""How the Party communicates with voters.""

Republicans looking to interject their opinions will probably be disappointed, however. In a dozen or so pages of questions to fill out, only four or so invite you to give your input on the actual Republican Party and their efforts. All the others are demographic questions—data mining stuff. What's your name? What age are you? What's your email address, little feller? You know, the kind of questions you teach your kids not to answer during their own internet sessions.

Hey, at least the party leaders are asking for opinions, right? Your opinion is only worth about 1/4th of the content on an actual opinion survey, but it's a start? Surely it's not just a flimsy effort towards party list-building under the guise of momentary introspection."

The ugly, clunky Drudge Report site still harvests record numbers of eyeballs because it serves up a hearty meal at a good price: free. The content rule is true across mediums. How many graphic makeovers and relaunches has CNN attempted to arrest its slow slide? The simple truth is that most people feel there is no reason to watch CNN, and they are happy not to. Meanwhile, “Storage Wars” racks up viewers and “Dog,” the bounty hunter, has a new series.

So it is in politics. A Republican renaissance will inevitably be driven by policy.

Today, social media fulfill much of the need for community and togetherness that were once provided by bowling leagues, church suppers and, yes, political parties. Like interests are drawn together through the invisible connectivity of virtual communities.

For 2016, the Democrats seem headed toward a fight between Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Both launched their careers in the 1970s; what will their slogan be, “Another Century of Service”? On our side, we have Paul Ryan, Nikki Haley, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Susana Martinez and more. Who has the best opportunity to win that generational battle?

So whatever ""content"" is, it consists of publishing faked or misleading news stories peddled by GOP insiders and the cheap sensationalism of mid-tier reality shows, and that's still better than whatever CNN is dishing out on any given day. Noted.Policy like ""Drudge"" and ""Storage Wars,"" or like Drudge? I have no idea where Stevens is going with this one. Neither does he, since he then goes on to praise Michael Gerson and Alex Castellanos for their contributions to noting the overpowering stench of decay coming from the party, which is a bit like praising your child for recognizing that maybe stapling their thumb to their forehead wasn't such a great idea after all. I mean it's fine, but the standards have gotten a little low.Facebook is actually a hell of a lot like church suppers, at least as I remember them. The bitter recriminations, the snide comments that seem to be insults but you're never quite sure, the people who are way too proud of their current food product; ah, brings me back. All right, so we've learned that Republicans don't have a technology problem, and that technology is good, and that Republicans can win by adopting good, sensible policies like those featured on the Drudge Report and Honey Boo Boo. But what about the young people? How will Republicans compete with the likes of Obamacare and gay marriage for the hearts of the young people?Ah. As the GOP plan for wooing Hispanic Americans consists of the phrase ""Hey look, here's Marco Rubio,"" the GOP plan for wooing young people will be to say, ""Hey, look! We've got Chris Christie and Jeb Bush! They're pretty young, right? I mean, they've at least still got their original hips.""

Well, you can't argue with that logic. Republicans are going to win the next generation by turning Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie and Jeb Bush into a boy band, which will then appeal to the young folks because content, where content means calling Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton old farts. This column really demonstrates how deep-thinking Republican strategy sessions must be. Really, I can't imagine why they lost.

She Started At The Times In', 'Recently Completed A Knight-Wallace Fellowship At The University Of Michigan.']",Rove has blunt advice for California Republicans,"SACRAMENTO — GOP operative Karl Rove had blunt words Saturday for California Republicans, who are trying to claw their way back to political relevancy in the state.

“My message is this: get off your ass,” Rove told nearly 500 Republicans gathered for a convention luncheon at a downtown hotel. “Get back in the game and fight. Don’t give in to what the other side wants.”

The gathering is taking place as the state GOP is at a crossroads. A Republican politician has not been elected to statewide office in seven years, GOP voter registration has plummeted, and the party is mired in debt.

But Rove said it was possible to turn the situation around and pointed to his experience in Texas. When he moved there, he said, no Republican had been elected statewide in more than a century, and only 13 members of the 150-member house were Republicans. Now, 101 members of the House are Republican and in 1998, when George W. Bush was reelected governor, Republicans swept all 28 statewide offices, he said.

Rove said that rebuilding must not simply focus on the tactical, such as getting voters to the polls on election day or opening GOP clubs on college campuses. Rather, he said, Republicans must change how they communicate their principles and adapt to the times.

He said it would not be easy, but a strong Republican Party is vital for not only California’s health but also for the nation’s.

“You’ve got a big task….It’s going to be tough,” he said. “You can keep going in the direction you’re going, and we in Texas will be grateful for the businesses and, more importantly, the people you send us, because you’re sending your best and brightest…. Or you can get up off the matt and throw yourself back into this contest. Think smart, be active, be committed, rebuild the organization and ask for votes in the right way, and speak boldly and proudly about our principles.”

Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis is in third place with 8%. The poll of 1,000 likely Virginia voters was conducted on October 20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.

Though McAuliffe’s lead in Tuesday’s poll was significantly higher than in previous polls, it was just the latest information that confirmed the bad news Virginia Republicans have known for several months. It is clear that the Cuccinelli campaign is headed towards a disastrous outcome in November unless dramatic changes are undertaken. But, with only two weeks remaining until election day, it may be a case of too little, too late.

Conservatives and Tea Party activists have been sounding the warning bells with the consultants running the Cuccinelli campaign for months. Given the extraordinary vulnerabilities of the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, mired as he is in dual investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Homeland Security of GreenTech Automotive, many Virginians are wondering how a candidate so beloved by the conservative base has run such a weak campaign.

McAuliffe’s campaign has succeeded in framing the election around social issues by outspending Cuccinelli at least two to one in television advertising. The pace of that outspending appears to have accelerated recently. Several Virginia residents told Breitbart News on Tuesday that Cuccinelli has been hammered mercilessly over the past several weeks with an onslaught of highly negative attack ads, while his own mild responses have been seen but not remembered.

McAuliffe has also benefited from significant spending on his behalf by outside liberal interest groups, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent endorsement.

Tea Party activists in Virginia are not surprised that the Cuccinelli campaign has performed so poorly. The problem, they believe, began when Cuccinelli hired a campaign team staffed heavily by Washington insider Republican consultants.

That error by itself could have been overcome, but the Cuccinelli team then proceeded to give Tea Party activists and groups around the Commonwealth the cold shoulder. Eager to help Cuccinelli win by providing the power and energy of a vigorous ground game, Tea Party activists were given no opportunity to be involved in the campaign.

This fundamental strategic error drew all of the energy out of the Cuccinelli campaign, and was compounded on August 15 by Cuccinelli’s own ill-advised criticism of the grassroots for their lack of interest in volunteering for his campaign. Activists throughout the Commonwealth saw Cuccinelli’s comments as a public slap in the face, and many have subsequently washed their hands of both the candidate and the campaign team.

Rather than working with the grassroots on the development of a ground game and get-out-the-vote infrastructure, the Cuccinelli campaign has relied on television ads and press releases. Some of these press releases have been considered sophomoric by Tea Party activists.

An “RRR” spoof poll released by the Cuccinelli campaign in late August is the most visible example of the campaign’s communications missteps. In an effort to counter the polls released by the PPP company, a well known left leaning polling firm, all of which show McAuliffe with a strong lead and Cuccinelli with high negatives, the Cuccinelli campaign has issued a series of press releases about phony polls conducted by the fake “RRR” (Republican Republican Republican) polling firm that purportedly show Cuccinelli with a significant lead.

Tea Party activists in Virginia are reluctant to publicly criticize the Cuccinelli campaign because of their loyalty and affection for Cuccinelli personally. However, they have been eager to offer suggestions to Attorney General Cuccinelli on how he can turn his campaign around. Unfortunately, few, if any of them have been able to even obtain a hearing from the Cuccinelli campaign team to communicate these views.

Larry Nordvig, Executive Director of the Richmond Tea Party, told Breitbart News last month that “conservatives are highly concerned about Obamacare, immigration, and moral decline, and are looking for reassurance and leadership in those areas. Attorney General Cuccinelli has not taken a hard stand on those issues. The net effect is that he’s not exciting his base, which dampens campaign volunteer activism. “

But for Nordvig when he spoke with Breitbart in September, “re-engaging his base” was “even more critical for Attorney General Cuccinelli.”

“Cuccinelli is not going to win the money race,” Nordvig said. “That means he will stand, or fall, based on grassroots support. He has got to start reassuring conservatives that he will fight for their deepest-held beliefs. Oh, and it wouldn’t hurt to court the Tea Party a little more,” Nordvig added. “We’re the major component of the grassroots support he needs to win.”

Unfortunately for Cuccinelli, it is virtually impossible to mount an effective ground game on just two weeks notice. Such an effort requires months to develop an infrastructure of volunteers and systems.

“I hate to say this,” one Virginia source told Breitbart News on Tuesday, “but unless grassroots lightning strikes in the next two weeks, get used to saying ‘Governor McAuliffe’ . . . and ‘President Clinton.’ “"

Bloomberg and Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York appears headed for a sharp left turn when voters select a new mayor in November.

“I’m a progressive,” said Bill de Blasio, the city’s public advocate and dominant front-runner in the mayoral campaign. “I believe in an activist role of government. I’ve been exceedingly clear that I borrow from the distant but still very pertinent examples of Franklin Roosevelt and [former mayor] Fiorello La Guardia. And I think it is time, especially at this moment in history, for activist, progressive government that will address the inequalities we are facing.”

The lanky de Blasio was digging into a bowl of penne pasta at a corner restaurant near his home in Brooklyn. It was a day after his first general election debate against Republican Joe Lhota, and the press reviews noted that the front-runner acted almost like the underdog, pounding his opponent rather than sitting on his lead. “In general I believe in an aggressive strategy,” he told me. “I’m not a rope-a-dope kind of guy.”

Not so many months ago, de Blasio was a distinct underdog in a four-way Democratic primary, overshadowed by City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, the early favorite, and Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman who decided to seek redemption by running for mayor.

In the end his rivals faded, and de Blasio won the primary without a runoff. Today, polls show him with a lead of roughly 40 points. If current trends hold, he would be headed toward one of the biggest victories in an open-seat race in the modern history of the city.

De Blasio’s campaign theme is “a tale of two cities.” He represents a clear departure from many of the policies of the Bloomberg administration, as well as the national Republican Party, to which he has sought to tie Lhota. He wants to sound an alarm about a city in which nearly half the population lives on incomes of 150 percent of the poverty level or less.

“I talk about a crisis of inequality because it’s not just about the cost of living,” he said. “It’s not just about the dumbing down of wages and benefits. It’s not just about the effects of the recession. It is all that plus continuing inequalities in education, continuing inequalities in health care, obviously deeper inequalities in policing that we experienced, say, a decade ago.”

De Blasio wants to raise income tax rates on the wealthy to pay for early childhood and after-school programs. He advocates more-generous paid sick leave for families. He has challenged the Bloomberg administration’s charter school policies, particularly the policy of allowing such schools to use city facilities rent-free. He was sharply critical of the city’s stop-and-frisk policy, a key element of its anti-crime efforts that was later declared unconstitutional by a federal judge.

“He is poised to be the most progressive big-city mayor in America,” said Howard Wolfson, deputy mayor under Bloomberg and someone who has known de Blasio for many years.

Giuliani and Bloomberg

New York is heavily Democratic. But for the past 20 years, voters have looked to politicians of other stripes to address problems that had become intolerable.

Giuliani, a Republican, tackled the city’s crime problem with relentless focus. Today, crime is not considered a major issue.

Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent, applied his management skills to the problems of local government and made the city more efficient, among other successes.

Bloomberg will leave office with net positive ratings, and yet de Blasio has run a successful campaign that has been both explicitly and implicitly critical of the incumbent. He said that the “sharp, sharp stories of people’s economic duress” persuaded him that there was a hunger for a change in direction.

De Blasio sees inequality as a national problem but says the federal government has defaulted on the problem. He blames Republicans in Congress for that. “You can’t wait on the cavalry to come from Washington,” he said. “It’s not coming anytime soon.”

If de Blasio becomes mayor, he will face potentially significant obstacles as he seeks to implement his campaign promises.

New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said last week that

he opposes the tax increase de Blasio is calling for to pay for his early childhood and after-school program.

Business leaders are wary of his expansive view of government and his tax policies.

Giuliani has called him anti-police.

School reformers dislike his charter schools policy.

“I think we’ve all been to this movie before,” de Blasio said of the resistance he faces. But he remains unapologetic about his views. “I think progressives can’t be looking over their shoulder,” he said. “If you look over your shoulder, you might as well declare defeat.”

Still, de Blasio is a politician. Even before the election, he has been spending time with groups wary of his agenda, seeking to explain why his policies are not as threatening to them as they think. “There’s a certain demystification I’m trying to achieve,” he said.

He said he also wants to explain to these audiences why it’s important to them that he address inequality as aggressively as he plans to do. “I think some of them have not given enough thought to what happens to society if more and more inequality grows and fewer and fewer people have opportunities,” he said. “My hope over time is that there will be a recognition that this is in everybody’s interest.”

Vision and leadership

De Blasio’s politics long have been rooted in the left.

In the 1980s he worked for a social justice organization that delivered food and medicine to Nicaragua during the war there. A profile of him in the New York Times called him “an ardent supporter of the Nicaraguan rebels.”

Later he turned to more conventional politics. He served as campaign manager for Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2000 U.S. Senate campaign and spent eight years on the City Council before he was elected as public advocate.

That background, he said, has prepared him to be mayor.

Others, including his opponent, question whether he has the managerial experience needed to run an enterprise as large and complex as New York City. Lhota, who was a deputy mayor and budget director under Giuliani, asserted in last week’s debate that de Blasio was “untested” and unready to be mayor. “I can be mayor on day one without any training,” he said.

When I asked de Blasio about this, he talked about a lunch he had about two years ago with former mayor Ed Koch, who died earlier this year. De Blasio said he had sharply disagreed with some of Koch’s policies but admired what he had done on housing. He said he had sought out the Democrat for advice. “I tried to draw out of him how he went from junior liberal congressman to in many ways an extraordinarily effective CEO of New York City in very adverse times,” de Blasio said.

What did he learn? “He said it’s really about leadership,” de Blasio said. “It’s really about a vision of where you’re trying to go . . . and rally people around it. . . . To him it was something more human, more intrinsic, because he hadn’t run anything bigger than a congressional office. But he knew he had the human capacity. So in my own humble way, I feel the same way.”

If the polls hold, and there’s little to suggest they won’t, New York will soon be under new management. New Yorkers — and people around the country — will be paying close attention to the next chapter in the city’s history."

Cheney, 46, who moved from Virginia to Wyoming last year to assay a possible run, made her intentions known in a six-minute YouTube video released 30 minutes after Enzi declared his intentions to seek a fourth term.

The Republican lacerated President Obama and “his liberal allies” — after going on at some length about her family’s deep Wyoming roots — but never mentioned the name of her opponent, a reliable and well-liked conservative. The closest she came to criticism was a suggestion that it was time “for a new generation of leadership to step up to the plate.”

Enzi, a family friend of the Cheneys, appeared caught off-guard. Speaking in Washington, he said he received no heads-up before the announcement. “She said that if I ran she wasn’t going to run, but obviously that wasn’t correct,” Enzi told reporters in the Capitol. “I thought we were friends.”

Enzi’s colleagues were quick to rally to the incumbent, vowing to place the party’s campaign machinery behind his reelection bid. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said he would use party resources to back Enzi in the primary, even if that meant diverting money from the GOP’s larger effort to win control of the Senate in the fall.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he would support Enzi, as did his Wyoming colleague, Republican Sen. John Barrasso, who stood by Enzi’s side during his impromptu news conference.

Cheney, the elder of two Cheney daughters, is “very talented and has a bright future,” Barrasso said, but Enzi “is a tremendous senator” deserving of another term.

Enzi, who won office in 1996, has a history of easy reelections, though he conceded he has never been a strong fundraiser. Money shouldn’t be a problem for Cheney, who has both nationwide name recognition and the benefit of the extensive political network her father, a former Wyoming congressman, built over the decades.

Cheney has long been an informal advisor to her father and an outspoken voice in conservative circles, especially on defense and foreign policy issues. During the administration of President George W. Bush and her father, she worked in the State Department and the Agency for International Development in Washington. Shortly after her announcement, Fox News said it would end her role as a paid on-air commentator.

The contest, which promises to be a marquee race in 2014, is unlikely to affect the balance of power in the Senate. Wyoming is a staunchly Republican state, and the winner of the primary seems almost certain to win the general election.

“A bright, shiny object” was how Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, described the contest: Interesting but ultimately a diversion from more important races.

Simultaneous nominations mark administration%27s more aggressive judicial strategy

For Obama%27s nominations to succeed%2C he must overcome Republican opposition

When George W. Bush left office%2C nearly six in 10 federal judges were GOP nominees

WASHINGTON — President Obama's simultaneous nominations of three judges to fill the nation's most powerful appellate court signals a new chapter in a political battle that's been raging for more than a quarter century.

It has taken Obama well into his fifth year in office to bring the federal judiciary essentially back to even: There are nearly as many judges nominated by Democratic presidents as there are Republican nominees on the bench.

Now the president is poised to make his mark on the federal district and appeals courts in much the same way Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush did — something even his liberal allies lament he has failed to do since 2009.

""This is the first signal that the Obama administration is getting serious or is stepping up its game when it comes to judicial nominations,"" said Jonathan Adler, a Case Western Reserve University law professor and conservative legal commentator. ""It has been fair to say that Obama did not make lower-court nominees a priority up until now.""

But for Obama to succeed, he must overcome Republican opposition that has grown more defiant over the years, since Democrats first began blocking Reagan nominees in the late 1980s.

Both sides cite statistics for every stage of the process to make their case: vacancies, nominations, delays, filibusters, confirmations and judicial caseloads. ""The longer you go with these things, the more statistics there are to throw around,"" said Arthur Hellman, a University of Pittsburgh law professor.

What's clear is the partisan trend. When George W. Bush left office, nearly six in 10 federal judges were Republican nominees. Now the GOP edge is 51%-49%; Obama has 3½ years remaining to tilt the courts his way.

""We're clearly at a tipping point in the federal courts, which is why the Republicans are putting up such a fight,"" said Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. ""For many years, the Republicans have had an ideological edge in the courts, particularly in some key circuits. Since President Obama's election, that edge is slowly but surely being eroded.""

Still, liberal and conservative advocacy groups agree that recent GOP presidents have taken more of an active interest in turning the federal courts in their direction. ""The Republicans nominate and appoint more conservative people than Democrats nominate and appoint liberal people,"" says University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.

What's less clear is which presidents have been treated more unfairly by their opponents during the Senate confirmation process. That has become a blizzard of data, as the White House cites longer delays for Obama's nominees and Republicans complain about longer appeals-court filibusters under Bush than President Clinton.

Obama's nominations Tuesday of Georgetown law professor Nina Pillard, appellate litigator Patricia Millett and federal District Judge Robert Wilkins focused attention on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that serves as a frequent springboard to the Supreme Court.

The appeals court reviews administration regulations and executive orders and handles controversial issues ranging from the environment to national security — often, in recent years, to the chagrin of the White House.

It has been the scene of bitter nomination battles in the past. Both Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan were blocked, though Roberts eventually won confirmation. Democrats blocked two Bush nominees, Miguel Estrada and Peter Keisler. Republicans blocked Obama's first nominee, Caitlin Halligan of New York, before confirming Sri Srinivasan last month.

The three new nominations, unveiled Tuesday in a grand Rose Garden ceremony befitting a Supreme Court nominee, opened up another statistical battle. The White House argued it simply was seeking to fill three vacancies on the 11-seat court, now operating with eight active judges and six retired ""senior"" judges.

""Imagine if a third of the seats on the highest court — the Supreme Court — were empty,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""We would rightly consider that a judicial crisis.""

Republicans called it an effort to ""pack"" a court that has fewer pending cases per judge than all but two of the 11 other circuit courts, and far fewer filed cases per three-judge panel than any appeals court. By contrast, 33 other district and appellate courts across the nation have caseload problems that qualify as ""judicial emergencies"" by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.

""The question (is) whether this circuit court, which is apparently less busy than all but one circuit court in the nation, needs to have a full complement of judges,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.

The Judicial Conference of the United States, headed by Chief Justice Roberts, wants them filled — along with the D.C. Circuit. That's where Obama has decided to make his fight.

""He's playing for the long term here,"" Hellman said. ""He sees his legacy as being decided to some substantial extent by the D.C. Circuit."""

San Diego is planning a joint bid with Mexican neighbor Tijuana

Romney oversaw the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City

The USOC is talking to 10 cities about a possible bid for the 2024 Olympics

SAN DIEGO (AP) — San Diego Mayor Bob Filner said Saturday that he wants Mitt Romney to lead a bid to bring the Olympic Games to the city and its Mexican neighbor, Tijuana.

Filner, a Democrat, said that he plans to ask the former Republican presidential nominee to be honorary chairman of the bid for the 2024 Summer Games.

""Wouldn't he give instant credibility to it? He has some experience with Olympics,"" Filner said.

Romney oversaw the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. He also owns a house in San Diego's wealthy La Jolla coastal area.

A message to Marriott International Inc., where Romney is a board member, and an email to a Romney aide werent' immediately returned Saturday.

Filner said that he and Tijuana Mayor Carlos Bustamante hope to name a binational committee next week to lead the effort.

The U.S. Olympic Committee is talking to 10 cities about a possible bid for the games. Following failed U.S. bids for the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, the USOC sent out letters to 35 American cities in February to gauge interest in a potential run for 2024.

Los Angeles, which hosted the 1932 and 1984 Olympics, and Philadelphia have announced their interest.

The mayor of Tulsa, Okla., Dewey Bartlett, told the USOC in a letter last month the city would be interested in submitting a bid with a ""Native America theme.""

The United States hasn't hosted a Summer Olympics since the 1996 Atlanta Games."

Speaking on ""The Boiling Frogs Show,"" Tice claimed the intelligence community had ordered surveillance on a wide range of groups and individuals, including high-ranking military officials, lawmakers and diplomats.

""Here's the big one ... this was in summer of 2004, one of the papers that I held in my hand was to wiretap a bunch of numbers associated with a 40-something-year-old wannabe senator for Illinois,"" he said. ""You wouldn't happen to know where that guy lives right now would you? It's a big white house in Washington, D.C. That's who they went after, and that's the president of the United States now.""

Host Sibel Edmonds and Tice both raised concerns that such alleged monitoring of subjects, unbeknownst to them, could provide the intelligence agencies with huge power to blackmail their targets.

""I was worried that the intelligence community now has sway over what is going on,"" Tice said.

After going public with his allegations in 2005, Tice later admitted that he had been a key source in a bombshell New York Times report that blew the lid off the Bush administration's use of warrantless wiretapping of international communications in the U.S. The article forced Bush to admit that the practice was indeed used on a small number of Americans, but Tice maintained that the NSA practice was likely being used the gather records for millions of Americans. The NSA denied Tice's allegations.

In the wake of recent reports detailing the extent of the NSA's data surveillance programs, Tice has again come out as a skeptic of the administration's response. While defenders of the program have insisted that there is nothing to suggest the government has the authority -- or desire -- to listen in on people's phone calls without a warrant, Tice told The Guardian that he believes the NSA has developed the capability ""to collect all digital communications word for word.""

Ed Markey, with a 41-27 favorability rating versus 44-41 for the Democrat. And he's keeping things close thanks to his 47-31 lead with independents, as well as the fact that he's drawing 21 percent of Democrats. Some of these may be folks who voted for Rep. Stephen Lynch in the primary who, as Tom Jensen puts it, may be ""a little reticent about supporting Markey in the general."" (Lynch did immediately endorse Markey, though, so hopefully he won't be reluctant to keep stumping on his behalf.) Jensen adds, though, that Brown held a 64-32 lead with independents in their final 2010 poll, so Gomez still has a lot of ground to make up if he's going to be the next Scott Brown.

In 2012, one aspect of PPP's Massachusetts polling continually stood out: Undecided voters were much more likely to favor Democrats than Republicans. That's why, even though the head-to-head matchups between Brown and Elizabeth Warren often appeared close, Warren had the edge, since those last few up-for-grabs voters had a strong predilection for Team Blue. The big difference between then and now is that Barack Obama was at the top of the ticket, drawing out lots of voters who won't show up for an early summer special election. Indeed, as Jensen notes, this sample is about 5 points more favorable to Mitt Romney than the 2012 election results were.

But even without Obama, Massachusetts is still a blue state. The undecideds in this poll went for Obama by an 18-point margin last fall, include more self-identified liberals than conservatives, and are over 60 percent female. Those are all positives for Markey, and if he can avoid stumbles and self-inflicted wounds, he should be able to win over the bulk of those undecided voters.

It's far from a walkover, though. Gomez may look like a proverbial fresh face, so Markey is going to have to make voters aware of his true ideology—and that a Gomez win would put Mitch McConnell and the GOP one seat closer to regaining control of the Senate. In other words, he's going to have to run a normal, competitive campaign and not simply coast in the belief that ""Massachusetts would never elect a Republican senator.""

The other question here is whether national Republicans will commit any money to Gomez. After all, this is only one poll, and while the GOP would love to torment Democrats in Massachusetts yet again, the NRSC may conclude that this race is fool's gold, and that they'd rather save their pennies for next fall. Indeed, whoever wins this seat would have to run again in 2014 for the full six-year term, which means Republicans would need to immediately defend this seat again. That wouldn't be an easy task, but it would certainly be easier than trying to wrest the seat from a Sen. Markey, which would probably be almost impossible.)

The biggest difference between now and the 2010 special that elected Scott Brown, though, is the general political environment—the backdrop, if you will. Three years ago, the economy still felt like it was in free fall to many voters, negative headlines about the Affordable Care Act were a daily feature, and conservatives were convinced that electing Brown would derail the ACA and bring the Democratic agenda to a dead halt. None of that is true today. Indeed, Jensen observes that Obama's job approval rating in Massachusetts stands at 53-41 now, versus 44-43 when Brown won.

And there's also the Martha Coakley factor, which is to say that Democrats are damn well determined not to get caught sleeping a second time. That just means, though, that Democrats know they have to work hard to make sure this seat stays blue. Markey may have a small edge, but from now until the special election on June 25, it's nose to the grindstone and absolutely no letting up."

Wife of 2012 GOP presidential nominee sits down for first solo post-election interview

Ann Romney was credited with softening her husband%27s edges

President Obama defeated Mitt Romney by about 4 percentage points

WASHINGTON — Ann Romney said mistakes were made by both sides in the 2012 presidential election, but has no regrets about the grueling campaign or its outcome.

""You'd always love to turn the page back and go back and say, 'Boy, if we had the crystal ball, wouldn't it have been nice to have done things a little differently.' But I still think, you know, every campaign makes mistakes. Both sides make mistakes,"" Romney said on CBS This Morning.

Thursday's session with CBS News was the first solo interview that Romney, wife of GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, has given since the election. The Romneys have been doting grandparents and done some traveling since President Obama defeated the former Massachusetts governor in November.

Romney was viewed as an integral part of the 2012 campaign, helping to soften her husband's edges and delivering a key speech on his behalf at the Republican National Convention last summer in Tampa. Those efforts, however, did not sway women voters, who overwhelmingly chose Obama over Romney. The 20-point gender gap was the largest measured by Gallup since 1952.

Romney blamed the gender gap on the way her husband was portrayed as a ""ruthless businessman"" and on the ""negative nature of the campaign.""

""Mitt and I did everything we could,"" she said.

Looking ahead to the 2016 presidential race, Romney said she and her husband are ""very, very partial"" to his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, and hope the Wisconsin congressman makes his own White House bid.

As for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who toured his storm-ravaged state with President Obama a week before the election, Romney said she has no ""bitterness"" toward one of Mitt Romney's most vocal surrogates.

""We're fine,"" she said.

Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford reportedly asked his ex-wife to manage his campaign for Congress, just as she had when he first ran for the U.S. House in 1994 during happier times.

In a New Yorkmagazine story, the disgraced Republican who tearfully admitted on national TV that he had an extramarital affair not only went to Jenny Sanford asking for her blessing to re-enter politics, he also had a proposal to join forces again.

""Since you're not running, I want to know if you'll run my campaign,"" Sanford is quoted as saying. ""We could put the team back together.""

Jenny Sanford said no, the story says. Sanford then came back with this sweetener: ""I could pay you this time,"" he is quoted as saying.

Sanford is running for his former House seat, which is vacant because Tim Scott is now in the Senate. He has talked for weeks about his ""mistakes"" and how people should forgive and focus on his plans to reduce the nation's debt. At least one of Sanford's GOP primary opponents, state Rep. Andy Patrick, has said that the campaign should not become Sanford's ""personal redemption tour.""

Jenny Sanford's political stock rose in 2009 when Sanford admitted to the affair, and she was considered by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley earlier this year as a possible appointee to the Senate. She opted against running for the open 1st District seat because she still has a teen-aged son at home.

Given Mark Sanford's name recognition, he is considered the front-runner among 16 GOP candidates in the March 19 primary. Elizabeth Colbert Busch is the leading Democratic candidate."

He Is A Professor At Georgetown University', 'A Senior Fellow At The Brookings Institution', 'A Frequent Commentator For Npr', 'Msnbc. His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",EJ Dionne: Chris Christie’s debate phobia,"“We are not a debating society. We are a political operation that needs to win.”

Thus did Chris Christie offer one of the most pregnant statements yet in the ongoing Republican argument over the party’s future. At the risk of sounding like one of those “professors” the New Jersey governor regularly condemns, I’d argue that these 15 words, spoken at a Republican National Committee meeting in Boston last week, raise more questions than they answer. Here are a few.

How do you decide on a winning strategy without debating it first? What is wrong with debating differences on policy and philosophy that people in political parties inevitably have? Don’t the voters expect to have some idea of what a party and a candidate believe before they cast their ballots — and doesn’t that imply debate? Doesn’t the phrase “political operation” risk implying that you are seeking power for power’s sake and not for any larger purpose?

There is also this: Isn’t Christie himself engaged in an important debate with Sen. Rand Paul over national security issues? There’s nothing academic about that.

One of two things is going on here: Either Christie knows he’ll need to have the debate he claims he wishes to avoid but doesn’t want to look like he is questioning fundamental conservative beliefs, or he really believes that the “I can win and the other guys can’t” argument is enough to carry him to the 2016 Republican presidential nomination he shows every sign of seeking. The latest signal came Friday when, under pressure from pro-gun activists, he vetoed a weapon ban he once advocated.

His target audience, after all, is an increasingly right-wing group of Republican primary voters who are unforgiving of ideological deviations. The last thing Christie needs is the sort of debate that casts him as a “moderate.”

Let’s stipulate that Christie is far less “moderate” than either his fans among Democrats and independents or the hardest-core conservatives seem to believe. Simply because Christie was nice to President Obama after Hurricane Sandy — at a moment when New Jersey needed all the federal help it could get — lots of people forget how conservative the pre-Sandy Christie was.

In 2011, he went to the summer seminar sponsored by the Koch brothers in Colorado, heaped praise on them and said, among other things: “We know the answers. They’re painful answers. We’re going to have to reduce Medicare benefits. We’re going to have to reduce Medicaid benefits. We’re going to have to raise the Social Security age. We’re going to have to do these things. We’re going to have to cut all type of other government programs that some people in this room might like. But we’re gonna have to do it.”

If I were on the right, I’d be taken with Christie’s skills at making conservative positions seem “pragmatic” and “practical.” Candidates who are perceived as dogmatic or highly ideological rarely win elections.

But here’s the problem: You can’t run as a pragmatic candidate if your party won’t let you. For Christie to win, he will have to convince the grass-roots Republicans who decide nominations that the party’s steady march rightward is a mistake.

Surely Paul, Ted Cruz and others among Christie’s potential opponents won’t let him slide by without challenging him hard — yes, “debating” him — about what he really stands for. Christie needs something more substantial than “You guys are losers,” even though he would relish saying it.

Mitt Romney’s experience in 2012 is instructive. He was a relatively pragmatic governor, especially on health care, and could have been a more attractive candidate than he turned out to be. Yet the dynamics of a Republican primary electorate that is short on middle-of-the-roaders pushed Romney away from his old self and toward positions that made him less electable. Faced with opponents to his right, he was reactive and drifted their way. In the end, it wasn’t clear who Romney was, other than the candidate who spoke derisively about the “47 percent.”

Those who understand how a “political operation” works know that genuine pragmatism requires a defeated party to engage in rethinking, not just repositioning. Bill Clinton laid out a detailed program and a set of arguments as a “New Democrat.” George W. Bush spoke of “compassionate conservatism” and challenged at least some of the most reactionary positions held by congressional Republicans.

Winning reelection this November by the biggest possible margin will buy Christie time. But eventually the debating society will beckon. He’ll have to be very clear, if not professorial, about the argument he wants to make.

Asked about the oft-cited quote that 47 percent of Americans can't be persuaded to take personal responsibility, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee said, ""Actually, I didn't say that ...That's how it began to be perceived, and so I had to ultimately respond to the perception, because perception is reality.""

At a May 2012 closed-to-the-press fundraiser in Florida, Romney said, ""And so my job is not to worry about those people -- I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. What I have to do is convince the 5 to 10 percent in the center that are independents, that are thoughtful, that look at voting one way or the other depending upon in some cases emotion, whether they like the guy or not, what it looks like.""

But Romney told Balz that the focus of his remarks was on swing voters, not on those who were already in President Barack Obama's camp. ""[I]t was saying, 'Look, the Democrats have 47 percent, we've got 45 percent, my job is to get the people in the middle, and I've got to get the people in the middle,'"" he said. ""They’ve got a bloc of voters, we've got a bloc of voters, I've got to get the ones in the middle. And I thought that that would be how it would be perceived -- as a candidate talking about the process of focusing on the people in the middle who can either vote Republican or Democrat.""

Romney's argument that the remarks were taken out of context is a new defense for him. During the campaign, he said at first that they were ""not elegantly stated"" and then that they were ""completely wrong.""

Also in the interview with Balz, Romney claimed that Obama had made a similar comment: ""And I think the president said he's writing off 47 percent of Americans and so forth. And that wasn't at all what was intended. That wasn't what was meant by it. That is the way it was perceived.""

Romney nonetheless acknowledged that the quote was ""very damaging"" to his campaign. Indeed, the Obama campaign seized on the remark, creating an ad based on it, and the former Massachusetts governor took a hit in the polls."

They didn’t use that word, of course. Republican leaders frown on such labeling because it makes the House majority look, well, crazy.

It is, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said from the dais, “the word that we don’t like to say in this committee, and I’m not about to utter here in this particular hearing.”

One of the majority’s witnesses, Georgetown law professor Nicholas Rosenkranz, encouraged the Republicans not to be so shy. “I don’t think you should be hesitant to speak the word in this room,” he said. “A check on executive lawlessness is impeachment.”

This gave the lawmakers courage. “I’m often asked this,” said Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) “You got to go up there, and you just impeach him.”

Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tex.), who has said there are enough votes in the House to impeach Obama, added: “We’ve also talked about the I-word, impeachment, which I don’t think would get past the Senate in the current climate. . . . Is there anything else we can do?”

Why, yes, there is, congressman: You can hold hearings that accomplish nothing but allow you to sound fierce for your most rabid constituents.

The Republicans in the House know there is no chance of throwing this president from office. Yet at least 13 of the 22 Republicans on the panel have threatened or hinted at impeachment of Obama, his appointees or his allies in Congress. They’ve proposed this as the remedy to just about every dispute or political disagreement, from Syria to Obamacare.

Tuesday’s hearing was titled “The President’s Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws.” The unanimous view among Republicans was that Obama had not done his duty, and it’s true that this president has stretched the bounds of executive authority almost as much as his predecessor, whose abuses bothered Republicans much less (and Democrats much more).

But what to do about it? They’ve failed at cutting off funding, they’ve had difficulty suing Obama in court and they lost the 2012 election. That basically leaves them with the option of making loud but ineffectual noises about high crimes and misdemeanors.

In recent days, Rep. Steve Stockman (Tex.), one of the more exotic members of the Republican caucus, has distributed proposed Articles of Impeachment to his colleagues. Last month, 20 House Republicans filed Articles of Impeachment against Attorney General Eric Holder. Around that time, Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) accused Obama of “impeachable offenses.”

Rep. Trey Radel (R-Fla.), before his cocaine arrest and guilty plea, invoked the prospect of impeaching Obama over gun policy. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) raised the specter of impeachment over Obama’s threat to bomb Syria without congressional approval. Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-Mich.) said it would be his “dream come true” to write the Articles of Impeachment, and Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.) said that if “the House had an impeachment vote it would probably impeach the president.”

Sen. Jim Inhofe said Obama could be impeached over the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, while fellow Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn said in August that Obama was “getting perilously close” to meeting the standard for impeachment (though he called Obama a “personal friend”). Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) thought it would have been an impeachable offense if Obama unilaterally raised the debt ceiling. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) branded Obama “lawless.”

On the House Judiciary panel, impeachment has been floated by GOP Reps. Jason Chaffetz (over Benghazi), Louie Gohmert and King (default on the debt), Darrell Issa (presidential patronage), Trent Franks (Defense of Marriage Act enforcement) and Lamar Smith (who said Obama’s record on immigration comes “awfully close” to violating the oath of office). Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) gets creativity points for proposing the impeachment of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

At Tuesday’s hearing, the committee chairman, Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), accused Obama of “picking and choosing which laws to enforce” and of being “the first president since Richard Nixon to ignore a duly enacted law simply because he disagrees with it.”

Contributed Smith: “The president has ignored laws, failed to enforce laws, undermined laws and changed laws, all contrary to the Constitution.”

The majority’s witnesses added to the accusations. George Washington University’s Jonathan Turley said Obama had “claimed the right of the king to essentially stand above the law.”

This excited Franks, who embraced impeachment back in 2011. Obama’s actions, he said, “could be considered royal prerogatives, which is, if my history’s right, what we had that little unpleasantness with Great Britain about.”

Yikes! Why bother with impeachment? They need a revolution.

At the time then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel, who headed the effort, infuriated many on the left by aggressively recruiting dozens of “blue dog democrats” to challenge GOP incumbents. The effort worked, but the Democrats soon forgot the lesson.

After Obama’s election, Democrat leaders believed they had a mandate for progressive policies. In the first two years of his term, Congress tacked far to the left, tackling cap-and-trade and ObamaCare. Corporate bailouts and billions in stimulus repelled independents. In 2010, House Democrats suffered the biggest electoral loss in history. Blue Dog Democrats, who had made up almost 25% of the Democrat caucus, were decimated.

Obama’s reelection has apparently again convinced national Democrats they have a mandate for their progressive ideas. Obama has all but ruled out serious spending cuts and is aggressively pushing for even more tax increases. Democrats across the country are pursuing gun control legislation with a zeal that hasn’t been seen in decades.

They are also vowing action on climate change, amnesty and a hike in the minimum wage. They are moving much further down the left-policy road than the rest of the country.

When Democrats lost the House in 2010, they also lost hundreds of seats in state Legislatures, giving Republicans a strong hand in redistricting. As a result, to win back the House, Democrats need to win more than a dozen seats that were won by Mitt Romney last year.

Obama’s hard tack to the left may be good for his base voters. The political fortunes’ of House Democrats are not built on his base voters, though. They need to appeal to independent, moderate voters who live in areas that lean GOP. They are building the wrong agenda for that task.

Pat McCrory is expected to sign any day, would allow political parties to send 10 roving ""observers"" from precinct to precinct on voting days, and it would authorize citizens to challenge the legality of votes cast in the county where the challenger lives. (Under the current law, you can only challenge a vote cast by someone living in your precinct.)



Supporters contend that the law will help observers catch people in the act of fraud, but critics point out that evidence of this type of fraud is scarce. They insist that the real goal is to intimidate Democratic-leaning black voters, some of whom may remember the threats and assaults that swept the South in the late 1960s, after the 1965 Voting Rights Act toppled the official barriers blacks had faced at the polls.



""In my mind, the only reason the change is occurring is to have a harmful impact on eligible voters who are trying to exercise their constitutional right,"" said Bob Phillips, the director of Common Cause North Carolina, a progressive group.

""We have hundreds of precincts located in all the communities across our state, and now you're going to be introducing outside observers who are not residents of those precincts and who are really are up to, in my opinion, intimidation.""



In addition to boosting the presence of poll observers, the law would require every voter to display specific forms of government-issued identification, which minorities and low-income people disproportionately lack. It would also cut back on the hours allotted for early voting, prohibit people from registering on the same day that they vote, and cancel a popular program to register high-school students -- practices that have boosted electoral participation among young and black voters and may have helped President Barack Obama carry the state in 2008.

The state’s Republican-dominated Legislature passed the law in July, despite scant evidence of voter impersonation fraud in North Carolina (or in any other state). In a statement, Phil Berger, the leader of the State Senate, said the bill ""restores clarity, transparency and confidence in the voting process. It curtails the questions of voter fraud by folks on both sides of the aisle and helps ensure every candidate wins or loses on his or her own merits.""

In recent years, more than 30 states around the country have passed laws requiring voters to show ID. North Carolina would become one of at least three states to allow behavior by poll watchers or poll observers that could threaten voting rights, according to a report by the progressive groups Demos and Common Cause.

Even among the voter laws in other states, North Carolina’s stands apart. Mainstream election experts have panned the proposal, calling it the most sweeping anti-voter law in the country.

For Jay Delancy, though, it doesn't go far enough. Delancy, a retired Air Force office and the head of a group called the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina, is one of the state’s best-known activists in the campaign against fraud and a proponent of even stricter election rules, like ending early voting altogether. Last year, he repeatedly challenged the validity of the state's voter rolls, at one point claiming that nearly 30,000 registered North Carolina's voters were actually names of deceased people.



A state investigation eventually undermined this claim, and Delancy now admits that concerns about counting dead people as voters are ""greatly exaggerated."" But he remains adamant that voter fraud is pervasive, and although he has little evidence to back this up, he hopes the new rules will make it easier for groups like his to catch people cheating at the polls.

He plans to train people to act as observers, a strategy modeled on True the Vote, a national tea party-affiliated organization that has stirred up controversy by sending observers into African-American districts in recent years. ""We need to safeguard the ballot box, just like banks,"" Delancy says.



According to one state election official, however, the expected influx of observers could have the opposite effect.



""You're going to have more observers than you have actual workers,"" said Gary Sims, deputy director of the Wake County Board of Elections. ""Some of our polling places are very small. I don't know how we're going to fit 15, 16 people in there. We're not going to have enough poll workers to make sure observers are following the law.""

During last year’s early voting period, there were reports of official poll observers and campaign workers interrogating and harassing voters, hovering over them as they voted and getting into shouting matches with each other. The state board of elections sent out a memo reminding employees that they were obliged to “prevent and stop improper practices and attempts to obstruct, intimidate, or interfere with any person in registering or voting.”

Now that job could get harder, election officials say. Some worry that the increased presence of observers could overwhelm poll workers, contributing to long lines and effectively discouraging people from voting.



""How do you police people?"" asked Sims. ""We're not in the police business.""



If the bill is signed, Delancy and his allies in North Carolina will owe its success in part to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in June on the Voting Rights Act, which cleared the way for North Carolina and other Southern states to pass restrictive voter laws that the federal government could have previously prohibited. In the landmark case, a 5-4 majority ruled that areas with histories of extensive discrimination, including 40 counties in North Carolina, no longer needed to submit their electoral policies to the federal government for approval.



In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the South has changed so dramatically since the Voting Rights Act was passed almost half a century ago that the need for special federal oversight has been eliminated. Civil-rights advocates tend to agree that things have improved since the ‘60s. Yet they see the furor over voter fraud as a thinly veiled attempt to roll back those changes.

""What we've seen recently are efforts by Republicans in largely non-white communities to go in and systematically challenge ballots,"" said Kareem Crayton, a law professor at the University of North Carolina. ""Maybe people in these communities aren't familiar with the process of voting, or aren't entirely clear what their rights are, and in the face of people telling them ‘if you vote illegally or inconsistently with the rules you can be challenged in court under a felony conviction’, that can be intimidating.""



In a recent interview, Delancy dismissed the suggestion that his crusade against fraud and the voter-suppression tactics of the Jim Crow era are in any way alike.

No one in today’s North Carolina needs to worry about “dogs and fire hoses and all that,” he said. “It's laughable.”

Then he corrected himself: “It's really not laughable. It's tragic. I think in the end, as I tell every black activists who will dare to have a civil conversation with me, we are not who you say we are. What I care about is open and honest elections.”"

Pollak'],"Debate Commission Co-Chair: Yeah, Candy Crowley Was a 'Mistake'","In a lecture to conservatives at the Las Vegas Country Club, Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, admitted that the selection of CNN’s Candy Crowley to moderate the second presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney in October 2012 had been a “mistake.”

Crowley stirred controversy by intervening in the town hall-style debate to support Obama’s contention that he had referred to the Sep. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi as a terrorist attack the day after it had occurred. In fact, as Crowley herself later admitted, Obama had not done so, referring only to “acts of terror” in general. In a CBS interview taped the same day, Obama declined to refer to the attack as a terrorist act, and subsequently supported a false story about a protest over an anti-Islamic video that never took place.

After Crowley backed up the president, some members of the audience burst into applause, in violation of the rules. The effect was not lost on the audience, which scored the debate as an Obama win–nor was it lost on Romney, who was sufficiently chastened that he refused to bring up the Benghazi issue again in the third presidential debate, even though that debate was specifically focused on foreign policy and national security.

Though it was likely not the only factor, or even the major factor, in Romney’s defeat, Crowley’s error slowed the new momentum that Romney had enjoyed since defeating Obama soundly in the first presidential debate. Her intervention also reinforced the media lack of interest in pursuing the Benghazi issue with the president.

Fahrenkopf, a stalwart Republican, co-chairs the Commission on Presidential Debates with Mike McCurry, who served as press secretary in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Politico’s Dylan Byers reports that the executive director of the Commission, Janet Brown, has refused to comment on Fahrenkopf’s remarks."
http://news.yahoo.com/schumer-immigration-bill-pass-senate-135548070.html,,[],Schumer: Immigration bill to pass Senate by July 4,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawmaker who helped negotiate a bipartisan bill to overhaul immigration predicted on Sunday that comprehensive legislation would overwhelmingly pass the Senate by July 4 while House Republicans cautioned that they would write their own version, one piece at a time.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he anticipates as many as 70 of the 100 senators will vote for the measure heading to the full Senate on June 10. Even if it passes there, the proposal faces tough prospects in the Republican-led House, where lawmakers are at work on their own piecemeal approach that could stall a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in this country illegally.

""We are moving forward because we believe in a bipartisan way this is so vital for America, and we'll have a good bill,"" Schumer said, pledging to allow colleagues to amend the legislation.

Not so fast, House lawmakers cautioned.

""That Senate bill is not going to move in the House,"" said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla.

For months, four Democratic senators met with four Republican colleagues behind closed doors and developed a proposal that would enact new border controls and enforcement mechanisms in the workplace, allow tens of thousands of workers into the country legally for high- and low-skilled jobs and create a 13-year path to citizenship for those already living here illegally. It passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee last month by a vote of 13 to 5; three Republicans joined the Democratic majority.

House lawmakers, though, have pledged to put together their own measure — likely taking components of the comprehensive Senate plan one at a time and adding their own priorities.

""We think it's better to do it with a step-by-step approach,"" said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.

""We'll continue down that path, but the final outcome in terms of the form of the legislation is not yet known,"" he added.

Democrats and Republicans alike recognized the political potency of the issue. The Senate, led by Democrats, is putting added pressure on the House, led by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

Story continues

""Congressman Boehner is in a box. There are about 60 or 70 of his people who are against any immigration reform. But at the same time, he knows that the Republican Party will be consigned to a minority party for a generation if they're anti-immigration,"" Schumer said.

In 2012, President Barack Obama won re-election with 71 percent of Hispanic voters and 73 percent of Asian voters backing him. A thwarted immigration overhaul could send those voting blocs more solidly to Democrats' side.

""We are hard at work on this problem. We have a broken immigration system in the country, it needs to be fixed, our legal immigration, our enforcement and figuring out the appropriate legal status for people who are not lawfully present in the United States all need to be addressed,"" Goodlatte said.

But it is unlikely to be a sweeping answer in the House, lawmakers said.

""I don't know if we'll have comprehensive reform or we will have it piece-by-piece. But that Senate bill may not even pass the Senate itself,"" Ros-Lehtinen said.

Schumer spoke to NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Ros-Lehtinen was interviewed on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Goodlatte was on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Even though candidates prize endorsements from labor unions, their value is hard to determine. In the past, many unions have sided with losing candidates, and in mayoral campaigns especially, union members may vote in accordance with their own political instincts, rather than hewing to the recommendations of their union. But this year, with all of the Democratic candidates vowing to participate in a public financing system with relatively low spending limits, labor’s support could be crucial.

The leaders of 1199 vowed to work harder than they have for any other local candidate in many years to help Mr. de Blasio win, and said they were considering participating in a “super PAC” to spend money on the race. “We wanted to send a strong signal: De Blasio was so far ahead of everyone else it was really a race to the bottom,” Mr. Gresham said.

Mr. Finnegan added, “We plan on a massive effort.”

News of the endorsement caps a strong week for Mr. de Blasio. He reported raising the maximum amount of money allowed for the primary under the city’s voluntary public matching funds program. He also picked up the endorsements of yet another celebrity (Russell Simmons) and progressive group (New York Communities for Change)."

While those in more conservative states won their elections, others lost to Democrats who might have been ineffective against more moderate opponents — leading establishment Republicans to blame them for bungling an opportunity to gain control of the Senate.

In Texas, Mr. Cornyn saw Mr. Cruz snatch a Senate seat out from under Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the deep-pocketed Republican who most believed had the 2012 race locked up.

Although Mr. Cornyn says he is prepared for a primary challenge, his prospects of getting “Dewhursted,” as some Texas Republicans have taken to calling it, appear slim.

“It’s impossible to do to Cornyn what’s been done to Dewhurst,” Mr. Mackowiak said.

For one thing, there is no obvious Cruz-like challenger waiting to challenge him; thus far, he has one primary opponent, Erick Wyatt, a military veteran from Rockport, a self-described “constitutional conservative” who is aligned with the Tea Party. Nor is there early evidence of a Democratic candidate likely to give Mr. Cornyn a run for his money in the general election.

For another, Mr. Cornyn’s seniority, national fund-raising connections and Senate leadership post are valuable assets that make him less vulnerable to the rumblings of the far-right interest groups that called for his head after his reluctant vote for the fiscal cliff deal.

Since then, both Mr. Cornyn and Mr. Cruz voted against Senator John Kerry’s confirmation as secretary of state, notable because they were two of just three senators, all Republicans, to do so. Mr. Cornyn, who has voted against several of President Obama’s nominees, said Mr. Kerry had a “long history of liberal positions,” while Mr. Cruz said he had a “less-than-vigorous defense” of national security."

Circuit on Monday, leaving Democrats with two options for filling the court's empty seats: change the rules and take away the GOP's power to filibuster certain nominees, or call it a day.

As expected, Republicans lined up to block a procedural vote for Robert Wilkins. His nomination needed 60 votes to advance. Instead, the Senate voted 53 to 38, with just two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), siding with Democrats to let him get a confirmation vote.

The GOP blockade on Wilkins was no surprise. In the last month, Republicans filibustered Obama's two other D.C. Circuit nominees, Patricia Millett and Nina Pillard. They'll readily admit their opposition isn't personal; they just don't want Obama to put any of his nominees on the court. Some argue the court isn't busy enough to warrant filling its three empty seats, and others make the counterintuitive argument that Obama is ""court-packing"" by filling vacancies. Both arguments gloss over the fact that the president has a constitutional duty to fill empty seats on a court.

Democrats have been warning for weeks that they're prepared to invoke the ""nuclear option"" and strip Republicans of their ability to block Obama's nominees if they keep filibustering. With Wilkins' vote now blocked, Democrats have to decide if they have it in them to change institutional rules that both parties are typically reluctant to mess with.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and other Democratic leaders are expected to weigh their next steps in a Monday night leadership meeting. One idea being considered is stripping Republicans' ability to filibuster judicial and executive nominees, but not nominees to the Supreme Court. Aides emphasized that nothing has been decided, however, and leaders will likely discuss their options with the full Democratic caucus during lunch on Tuesday.

By the sounds of it during Wilkins' vote, some Democrats are ready to go nuclear right now.

""I fear that after tonight, the talk about changing the cloture rules for judicial nominations will no longer be just talk. There will be action,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""We cannot allow this unprecedented, wholesale obstruction to continue without undermining the Senate’s role provided in the Constitution and without harming our independent federal judiciary.""

“When will we say enough is enough? Repeatedly over the past month, a minority of senators has blocked qualified nominees by abusing the Senate rules,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said. ""The rules on nominees are not working, and we need to change them.""

But Republicans are largely shrugging off Democrats' threats, suspecting it's all talk. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the real reason Democrats want to keep talking about the D.C. Circuit is to take attention away from the rocky rollout of the president's health care law.

Democrats are trying to ""distract Americans from the failings of Obamacare,"" McConnell said ahead of Wilkins' vote. ""I hope the Senate will focus on things people care about rather than spend its time trying to distract them.""

Shortly after the vote, Obama railed against Republicans for blocking another of his key nominees.

""This obstruction is completely unprecedented,"" he said in a statement. ""When it comes to judicial nominations, I am fulfilling my constitutional responsibility, but Congress is not. Instead, Senate Republicans are standing in the way of a fully functioning judiciary that serves the American people.""

In other words, we want government to back off and not infringe upon our rights. I think there will be a lot of us who start saying ‘GOP, if you abandon us, we have nowhere else to go except to become more independent and not enlisted in a one or the other private majority parties that rule in our nation, either a Democrat or a Republican.’ Remember these are private parties, and you know, no one forces us to be enlisted in either party.”

One of the few uncertainties left about the modern Republican Party is the precise date and time they will devolve into cannibalism. For those of you that are making your own predictions, here's actual Republican vice presidenting candidate Sarah Palin answering a Fox News viewer's Twitter question (yes, I know) on whether she might consider abandoning the dirty rotten liberals in the GOP and forming a new ""Freedom Party"" for the nation's real conservatives Yeah, I'm not seeing Sarah Palin follow through on something that sounds like so much work.

The problem here, I'm beginning to realize, is that John McCain taught her the word ""maverick"" and she loved the notion so much that she's now devoted her entire life to an extended sketch on the topic. Suddenly, being lazy is a virtue, and being a stubborn, ignorant crank is the patriotic ideal? There have been people who have been stubborn, ignorant cranks all their lives and have been waiting that whole time for a party to acknowledge their contribution to American freedomz; they must be absolutely giddy now that it's an actual movement.

So deep within the conservative bowels of the party, there's a deep growling sound: These damn Republicans are too liberal. They're infringing our rights just like the Demmycrats. They're not tearing down our stop signs and unpainting the crosswalks; they're not sympathetic enough to every crackpot conspiracy theory that gets sent through the conservative wires along with the desperate pleas from flighty African nobles and bored Russian women; they're not entirely allowing us to shoot poor people for sport, though you can't say we haven't made great strides on the subject. No sir, what we need here is an even meaner, dumber party. That'll fix everything.

Yellen told friends in recent weeks that she did not expect to be nominated as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Although she had been the Fed’s vice chairman since 2010 and would make history as the first woman to hold the job, President Obama’s aides made clear throughout the summer that he wanted Lawrence H.

Now, awkwardly, it appears that the president may have to circle back to Ms. Yellen after Mr. Summers withdrew from consideration on Sunday, bowing to the determined opposition of at least five Senate Democrats. On Monday, Ms. Yellen became the front-runner by elimination, officials close to the White House said.

Supporters of Mr. Summers, including many of the president’s closest advisers, had raised some concerns about Ms. Yellen in recent months. Perhaps most potently, they said that institutions benefited from fresh leadership and argued that Ms. Yellen’s crucial role in creating the Fed’s current policies could inhibit her ability to make necessary changes.

Some presidential advisers also argued that Mr. Summers brought crisis management experience and a working knowledge of financial markets that Ms. Yellen lacks — although so did Ben S. Bernanke when President George W. Bush selected him as chairman."

Texas Sen. Wendy Davis

2014 is election year in Texas, and Rick Perry will be running for an unprecedented fourth term. Maybe . We'll know soon enough. But either way, voters will be deciding on their next governor at that time.

Texas has been inhospitable to Democrats for a while. In fact, it's been a full generation (20 years), since the Democrats last won a statewide-elected office in the state. And while demographic changes are shaking up the state, its poor-performing Latino community (51st in the nation in voter participation) has severely undermined Democratic chances.

But polling has already showed Hillary Clinton competitive in hypothetical 2016 Texas matchups, the same polling that also showed this:





@ppppolls In January we found Wendy Davis trailing Rick Perry just 47-41 despite- at that time- pretty low name recognition: http://t.co/...

No one knew who Wendy Davis was when that poll was conducted. It's a whole different reality today for the Fort Worth Democrat.

The problem with Texas isn't that Republicans outnumber our people, it's that our people don't vote—Latinos, African Americans, young voters, single women, etc.

Last night's epic filibuster (the talking kind, which are okay) was a national phenomenon, Battleground Texas is rebuilding the state's infrastructure, millions of Latinos will be left uninsured thanks to Perry's rejection of Obamacare, and so on. Things are changing at the speed of light.

Wendy Davis would nationalize that Texas governor's race, and help accelerate the state's transition to Purple (and eventually Blue) status.

So what do you think? Should we launch a draft movement?

Update: So the answer was ""hell yes!"". Click here to join the Draft Wendy Davis movement. Lend your name, leave an encouraging message, and drop a few dollars if you've got 'em into her campaign. Let's show her we've got her back!

Because Davis will turn Texas Blue ahead of schedule."

She Is Native Of Minnesota', 'Holds Degrees Boston College', 'Uc Berkeley S Graduate School Of Journalism.']",Second term brings out a more relaxed Obama,"WASHINGTON — Finally unburdened by worries about running for another election, President Obama is acting different these days.

Second-term Obama is noticeably quicker to speak his mind and get personal on subjects he once avoided. His schedule at times ignores concerns about “optics,” Washington-speak for what voters might perceive.

On Friday, for example, the president delivered an unexpectedly personal, and at times off-the-cuff, speech in Chicago about the root causes of urban violence. The famously reserved president spoke bluntly about the Kenyan-born father whom he barely knew, and his wayward high school days in Hawaii.

“I wish I had had a father who was around and involved,” he said.

In the past, Obama typically wove the uplifting version of his personal narrative — raised by a single mother, loved by doting grandparents — into his campaign message. He rarely admitted to having “issues,” as he did in Chicago.

Then, over the Presidents Day weekend, Obama headed to Florida for a golf outing with the guys. The president stayed in an exclusive resort near West Palm Beach, Fla., and hit the course with several friends and high-power donors, plus Tiger Woods. The president’s wife and two daughters, meanwhile, jetted west to ski in Aspen, Colo.

Obama’s vacations have been rare, brief and regularly interrupted by crises at home and overseas. Most recently, he suspended his Christmas holiday in Hawaii to rush back to Washington for a few days to deal with congressional negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff.

The White House stressed that the president took his work to the Floridian Yacht and Golf Club.

“The president traveled to Florida for the weekend to spend some time with friends on the golf course, but the military aides, White House staffers and Secret Service agents who traveled with him are a reminder that he’s never far from the responsibilities of his job,” said spokesman Josh Earnest.

Still, it is hard to imagine Obama taking that sort of getaway before the election, particularly after a week when he delivered his State of the Union speech and unveiled an economic plan aimed at fighting poverty and providing relief for the middle class. It’s harder still to imagine him golfing with Woods — who saw his marriage, endorsement contracts and career tank in 2009 amid disclosures of sexual infidelities — while trying to woo female voters.

Obama’s Valentine’s Day date with First Lady Michelle Obama almost certainly would have become campaign fodder a few months ago. The first couple went to minibar, a Washington restaurant so avant-garde it doesn’t use capital letters, where the nightly prix fixe dinner for two runs $450, not including drinks, taxes and tips, according to its website. That’s more than a week’s pay at the $9-per-hour minimum wage Obama is advocating (and which is unlikely to go anywhere in Congress).

Presidential historians typically focus on the so-called second-term curse, the seemingly inevitable and usually self-created calamity that befalls many a president after reelection. But historian Gil Troy says a less-discussed phenomenon is the “second-term blessing.”

“In a lot of presidential biographies and memoirs, they talk about the night before the second reelection campaign ends. There’s always a touch of nostalgia, but far more than nostalgia, there’s a tremendous sense of relief when you get a sense that you don’t have to justify yourself anymore in that way and you’re not under that kind of scrutiny,” said Troy, a presidential historian at McGill University. “And that’s the basis of the second-term blessing.”

Troy says presidents tend to ease up, stop living by the polls and start thinking about their legacy.

There’s no doubt Obama has loosened up. He shed tears at his final campaign rally, a show of emotion that was rare in his first term but has happened several times since.

Long a stickler for adhering to his prepared remarks, Obama now sometimes goes off-script. As he announced his new public preschool program last week, he cracked himself up with an ad-libbed joke at Congress’ expense.

Advertisement

“That whole playing well with others, by the way, is a trait we could use more in Washington,” Obama said. “So maybe we need to bring the teachers up every once in a while, have some quiet time. Time out.”

“He definitely appears to be a lot more relaxed in his comments and seems more freewheeling in the way he addresses issues,” said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman during President George W. Bush’s second term. “I feel like that has been a change we’ve seen since election day. There’s no question about that.”

Obama may be buoyed by his polls, which show his public approval rating has inched up since his reelection, his battles with House Republicans over taxes, and his efforts to reduce gun violence since the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn.

Still, historians say overconfidence can quickly turn the second-term blessing into the presidential curse.

Franklin D. Roosevelt’s failed attempt to pack the Supreme Court with extra justices in 1936 is the most often cited example, along with Bill Clinton’s impeachment by the House of Representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice in 1998.

“Sometimes it has led to hubris and overreach,” Troy said.

WASHINGTON -- While the swearing-in ceremony might have been the main draw for many on Inauguration Day, plenty of people turned out early along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route between the Capitol and the White House.

As Willie Geist of NBC News reported on Monday morning, some of the most sought-after spots were near the Navy Memorial at 7th Street NW, opposite the National Archives. It was around that location where President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama got out of their limousine and started walking along the processional route four years ago during the president's first Inauguration.

And sure enough, for their second Inauguration, the president and first lady left their limousine around 9th Street NW and walked for approximately three blocks before getting back in their motorcade. They arrived in the vicinity of the White House around 4:10 p.m. where they later gathered to watch the remainder of the Inauguration parade from the official review stand opposite Lafayette Park.

The parade took a momentary pause as the first family, Vice President Biden and his family and their guests made their way into the review stand just before 4:45 p.m.

The parade was originally scheduled to start around 2:30 p.m. but was delayed by the Inauguration luncheon in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, which was also behind schedule.

The procession, which included 59 groups and 8,800 people, started to leave Capitol Hill around 3:15 p.m., went west along Constitution Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue and ended at 17th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House.

Among the groups featured in the parade were the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Boy Scout Troop 358 from Philadelphia, the Boston Crusaders Drum & Bugle Corps, the Georgia State University Marching Band, the Lesbian and Gay Band Association of St. Louis, Military Spouses of Michigan, the Navajo Nation Band of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the University of Maryland Mighty Sound Marching Band, the Virginia Military Institute Marching Unit and the Palmview High School Mariachi and Folkloric Group of La Joya, Texas, among many more.

Some of the most recognized landmarks in the nation's capital sit along the processional route.

The president passed the U.S. Department of Labor, the Canadian Embassy, the Newseum, the National Gallery of Art, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Archives, the Navy Memorial, the FBI headquarters, the Justice Department, the Old Post Office Pavilion, Freedom Plaza, the John A. Wilson Building and the Treasury Department, among other buildings, memorials and statues.

There were some protesters along the route, including members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who received a permit to demonstrate at John Marshall Park near 4th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue.

At the John A. Wilson Building, the seat of the District of Columbia government, local officials had a protest banner on full display decrying the lack of full and equal congressional representation for residents of the nation's capital.

Council candidate asks opponent to exit race as at-large election nears,"D.C. Council candidate Elissa Silverman tried to broker a deal to get Matthew Frumin to drop out of Tuesday’s election for an at-large seat, a last-ditch effort to reduce the number of Democratic candidates counting on support from the city’s majority-white neighborhoods.

A representative of Silverman’s campaign met with Frumin earlier this month and suggested he quit the race, both candidates confirmed over the weekend. About a week ago, Silverman reached out in an e-mail asking Frumin to get out.

If he obliged, Silverman pledged she would help Frumin, who serves on a Ward 3 Advisory Neighborhood Commission, unseat D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) next year, according to sources familiar with the discussion.

Frumin confirmed that account Sunday, although he said he would have preferred that it had not been made public. “I am not trying to end with a story like this,” he said.

Silverman’s offer provides a window into a special election that could come down to a few hundred votes because the city’s Democratic majority appears closely divided among the candidates.

Silverman said her campaign treasurer, Ken Archer, met with Frumin to urge him to leave the race. But Silverman, a former reporter on leave from the Fiscal Policy Institute, denied that she tried to link Frumin’s candidacy this year to Cheh’s political future and said the discussion was supposed to be confidential.

One of six candidates in the contest, Silverman said she was merely trying to coalesce “reform and progressive” Democrats behind her candidacy to keep incumbent Anita Bonds (D-At Large) or Republican Patrick Mara from winning the seat.

“I want to see a true progressive win,” Silverman said. “I don’t think Mara is a progressive reformer, and I don’t think Anita is a progressive reformer.”

Mara, making his third council bid in five years, is banking on a strong turnout from Republicans in an election that is predicted to draw just 10 percent of registered voters. Bonds, the only African American Democrat in the race, is expected to do well in neighborhoods in the eastern part of the city.

Frumin, Silverman and Democratic candidate Paul Zukerberg are hoping for strong support from Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the western part of the city. Perry Redd, a member of the Statehood Green Party, also is seeking the seat.

In Silverman’s discussion with Frumin about a week ago, she shared with him a private poll that indicated she had more citywide support than he did.

Frumin rebuffed Silverman’s request, saying the at-large race is fluid and that his campaign remains confident of his chances.

Frumin said Sunday that he doesn’t “fault” Silverman for trying but questioned whether it undermines her argument that she is a reformer.

“It was explicit that she would support me in a Ward 3 race, including against Mary Cheh,” said Frumin, who has consistently said he has no interest in running against Cheh next year. “The idea of an attempted deal, maybe that is what happens in politics, but when you are claiming a whole new politics, that is something of an issue.”

Silverman said she pledged to support Frumin “if he decided to run again” but did not specifically target Cheh’s seat.

Cheh said Sunday that she was aware of the discussion between the Silverman campaign and Frumin. Cheh declined to comment further.

The dust-up comes on the final weekend of the campaign, and all six candidates raced across the city looking for support while finalizing get-out-the-vote strategies. With turnout expected to be low, candidates say it might take as few as 15,000 votes to win.

Mara, who is hoping for crossover support from Democrats, said he had 75 volunteers on the streets reminding supporters to vote Tuesday.

“The groundwork all of my volunteers have been laying now for months is paying off,” said Mara, who represents Ward 1 on the State Board of Education.

But Al Malik Farrakan, a Ward 4 activist who is working for Bonds, predicted that “there is no question” Bonds will win, boosted by what he expects to be a robust turnout in majority black neighborhoods.

Farrakan used a van Saturday to shuttle voters to early voting. At the same time, Zukerberg was using pedicabs to get his voters to the polls. Zukerberg, who is pushing to decriminalize marijuana, sponsored a free concert on the Mall, and the pedicabs then shuttled concert-goers to early voting.

“I’ve already won,” said Zukerberg, noting all six candidates now support efforts to decriminalize marijuana. “I’ve changed the way people think. I’ve changed the dialogue and I’ve changed minds.”

There was support for each candidate among Saturday’s early voters.

Bill Schmidt, a Republican from Logan Circle, brought his girlfriend, a Democrat, so they could both vote for Mara.

“We argue about politics quite often, but for me, this is about school reform,” said Leslie Duche, 29, referring to one of Mara’s campaign themes.

Sharon Harley, 55, of Wesley Heights voted for Bonds because she said she wants to support an African American candidate.

“It’s not that I don’t believe non-African Americans can represent diverse opinions, but visually and philosophically, it’s important for African Americans to feel D.C. is still a place for them,” Harley said.

Frumin’s extensive direct-mail campaign won over Chip Walgreen, 50, of Shaw.

“He is a refreshing voice, and I think it would be beneficial to have someone on the council who doesn’t have a long history on the council,” Walgreen said.

Paul Russell, 38, of Brookland voted for Silverman because he believes she is better versed in tax policy.

“The other ones seem interested more in education, and one wanted to legalize marijuana, and at this particular time, that doesn’t really affect me,” Russell said."

Cuccinelli, who trails Democrat Terry McAuliffe in polling, said his campaign was beating their turnout and grass roots goals.

Cuccinelli stressed repeatedly that President Obama’s decision to campaign on Sunday with McAuliffe was a “great opportunity” for the Republican’s campaign. “[The Democrats] are having a rally to celebrate ObamaCare,” Cuccinelli said. He noted that he was the “first person in the country” to fight ObamaCare, referencing the fact that he was the first to file a lawsuit challenging the health care law, and welcomed the introduction of the issue into the Governor’s race.

He dismissed the possibility that Obama’s appearance would energize Democrats to turn out for McAuliffe. He noted that McAuliffe has released very few specifics about his proposals, making it difficult to increase interest in the campaign. “Voters want to be for something,” Cuccinelli said.

McAuliffe has maintained a steady lead in recent polling. The Democrat has been helped by a significant fundraising advantage. In recent weeks, McAuliffe has enjoyed a 3 or 4-1 advantage on the airwaves. In the closing days of the campaign, union and Democrat interest groups have poured additional resources into McAuliffe’s campaign, but additional ad spending at this stage in the campaign delivers diminishing returns.

“We may be out raised,” Cuccinelli said. “But, we won’t be outworked.”

Tuesday’s election is expected to have a very low turnout, certainly much lower than the turnout in 2012. The electorate in odd-years tends to be older and more conservative than in presidential years, giving the Cuccinelli campaign hope of a strong finish.

McAuliffe certainly hopes that Obama’s campaign appearance creates enthusiasm among Democrat voters. It is just as likely, however, to galvanize the Republican and conservative base. If Cuccinelli prevails on Tuesday, it will be because conservatives returned to Republicans and opposition to ObamaCare. It’s a message that GOP leaders in DC should heed."

Marco Rubio

Sen. Marco Rubio

For President Obama to continue the charade of making things like the Blue Angels the culprits of our debt and, therefore, the first thing on the chopping block when government must slim down is an insult to the American people.

Florida Republican Boy Wonder Marco Rubio is very upset about sequestration. His reason, as conveyed in an op-ed, seems to boil down to two words: Blue Angels The Blue Angels are relatively cheap! The savings could have been found elsewhere to preserve Americans' right to see military planes flying demonstrations! Why, why, why?

Oh, Rubio has room for a passing mention of some of sequestration's other inconveniences:



President Obama’s administration should be ashamed for trying to convince the American people that our only choices when it comes to dealing with the debt are either to leave government as big and bloated as it is, or accept a new reality where our people have to endure longer lines at the airport, endless flight delays, the loss of safety net medical assistance, the denial of education services, and many other inconveniences and negative effects to people’s day-to-day lives.

Umm, whut? As Rubio points out, he did vote against the Budget Control Act that produced the sequester. His reasoning was basically this: Slash Medicare, not the military budget, and OMG, what if this leads to tax increases? Well, we got sequestration rather than tax increases on the wealthy and corporations because Rubio's party wanted it that way. And now he's whining that President Obama is posing some kind of false choice between big government and flight delays, as if magical budget fairies are going to sneeze out the services people expect, want, and need from the government without it costing anything or requiring revenue.

Sequester effects that Rubio doesn't have room to mention: cuts to unemployment insurance checks, domestic violence programs, Meals on Wheels, national parks. Rubio doesn't spare a word for all the federal workers who are losing big chunks of their pay to furloughs. He spends more words on flight delays that Congress already acted to prevent than he does on Head Start cuts (if that's even one of the things he means by ""education services"") that are leaving low-income kids without preschool, teachers without jobs, and parents having to scramble to find child care if they're going to be able to keep their jobs or look for work. ""The loss of safety net medical assistance,"" meanwhile, is a nicely bloodless way to describe cuts to cancer treatment for Medicare patients.

The Blue Angels, though? Rubio has room for six full paragraphs about them."

Peters'],"A Former Engine of the G.O.P., the Town Hall Meeting, Cools Down","“The reason 2009 was so successful for the grass roots was because the politicians never saw it coming,” said Jennifer Stefano, the state director for the Pennsylvania chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a Tea Party group. “Now they know. And they are terrified.”

Many lawmakers, often from safe districts, are still holding town halls throughout the month. While a number of them are drawing voters outraged over Mr. Obama’s health care law, the intensity is nothing compared to the scale of 2009.

But where there are no gatherings, some groups have decided to take matters into their own hands.

After seeing a paltry schedule of Congressional town hall meetings this month, another major conservative group, Heritage Action for America, decided it would stage public forums of its own from Arkansas to Pennsylvania. The aim is to recruit people for a group it calls the Sentinels, a citizens’ brigade of sorts, to reach lawmakers through other means, like writing letters to the editor, dialing in to talk-radio programs and mastering the language of Twitter and Facebook.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is sending its advocates into Republican districts with two-dimensional cutouts of members without a traditional town hall on the calendar. Anyone who is feeling especially theatric is being encouraged to debate their cardboard congressman.

This month, the committee sent a batch of rubber ducks to Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois, who is under pressure to support a broad immigration overhaul. (The joke: He is “ducking” questions in an ethics investigation.)

Others on the Democrats’ target list have included Representative Tim Griffin of Arkansas, who was greeted at an airport by protesters calling for an end to the across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester, and Representative John Kline of Minnesota, who is also being pressed to support immigration overhaul and was picketed after attending a closed-door Chamber of Commerce event. Not one of the Republican congressmen has a town hall scheduled this month."

Of the $17.5 million collected so far to support mayoral hopefuls Wendy Greuel and Eric Garcetti, roughly one-third — a record $6.1 million — has gone into independent political action committees that can accept contributions of any size.

The rise of the parallel campaign finance system, awash in five- and six-figure donations that dwarf the limits approved by voters, has watchdogs of political influence sounding alarms.

“This is not the system that the reformers envisioned,” said Benjamin Bycel, who was executive director of the city’s Ethics Commission in the 1990s. The surge in independent campaign spending, he said, “essentially guts” laws setting contribution limits.

Many of the outsized PAC donations come from interests with a financial stake in City Hall decisions, including public employee unions looking to protect pay and benefits that have long used their financial might to elect political allies.

But increasingly, other donors — developers, entertainment moguls, philanthropists — are utilizing the system of limitless donations to promote their favored candidates.

The rise of the super PAC in L.A. city elections is another byproduct of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that have gradually diluted federal, state and local efforts to limit campaign contributions and spending. Los Angeles’ ethics laws cap individual and company contributions in mayoral contests at $1,300 during the primary election and another $1,300 in a runoff, if one occurs.

For decades, the high court has held that unlimited spending by independent campaign groups — and unlimited donations to those entities by individuals and companies — is constitutionally protected free speech. The only real restriction: The advertising, polling and get-out-the vote activities funded by the PACs can’t be coordinated with campaign operations controlled by the candidates.

Independent expenditures first became a significant factor in L.A.'s mayoral elections in 2001, when $1.9 million was spent by unions, billboard companies and other business interests in the contest between James Hahn and Antonio Villaraigosa. In a rematch four years later, the number jumped to $4.3 million.

A watershed came in 2008, when organized labor spent more than $8.5 million to elect state lawmaker Mark Ridley-Thomas to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. That was nearly nine times what Ridley-Thomas raised for his own campaign.

With mixed success, labor groups have been seeking to replicate that winning formula at City Hall and, this year, some prominent business interests have joined their efforts.

In the current mayor’s race, two candidate super PACs — Working Californians for Wendy Greuel and Lots of People Who Support Eric Garcetti — have received the biggest share of the unlimited money, taking in five- and six-figure donations from unions, contractors, developers and others.

Garcetti is also getting help from the Committee for a Safer Los Angeles, created by Obama campaign fundraiser Samantha Millman. And Greuel has been assisted by a committee created and financed by EMILY’s List, a Washington, D.C.-based group that backs Democratic women who favor abortion rights.

McCourt Group, headed by former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, has given $50,000 to Working Californians for Greuel, which is headed by officials with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the union that represents Department of Water and Power employees. McCourt is expected to develop property near the team’s Chavez Ravine stadium.

Petrochem Manufacturing, which produces road resurfacing materials for the city, gave $10,000 to Working Californians. Construction management firm AECOM, which regularly seeks city contracts at the airport and harbor, gave $25,000 apiece to PACs backing Greuel and Garcetti. And Meruelo Enterprises, a company involved in real estate, banking and media, spent $34,500 to help Garcetti.

The biggest super PAC donations by far have come from organized labor. The DWP union, which is looking to negotiate a new contract, has put at least $1.45 million into Working Californians for Greuel. Another private-sector branch of the same union, which is pushing for a law allowing new digital billboards in Los Angeles, gave the committee $250,000. So did the city firefighters union, which opposed Garcetti’s vote to reduce staffing at stations during a budget crisis.

“The bottom line is, we would have given the same amount of money whether it was Wendy or whether it was Eric,” said Frank Lima, president of the United Firefighters of Los Angeles. “The members didn’t go with Eric based on the cuts.”

Unions have spent so much on Greuel — $3.5 million in unlimited donations, or more than nine times the amount for Garcetti — that their spending has threatened to become a drag on her campaign. In a USC Price/Los Angeles Times poll conducted last week, voters named Greuel as the candidate who cares more about unions representing city employees than about Los Angeles as a whole.

By comparison, organized labor, mostly private-sector unions, had given $382,000 in uncapped contributions to efforts to elect Garcetti. The Teamsters and longshore workers at the Port of Los Angeles contributed $100,000 each, and the supermarket clerks union, which is fighting a Wal-Mart supermarket in Chinatown, kicked in $50,000.

The flow of uncontrolled money has come on top of more than $11.3 million collected directly by the Greuel and Garcetti campaigns through thousands of small donations at or under the $1,300 limit.

Entertainment interests led the way, with studios, producers, directors and others providing at least $955,000 for Garcetti and at least $555,000 to Greuel, an analysis by The Times found. Not far behind were real estate, development and construction interests, which gave at least $809,000 to Greuel and at least $666,000 to Garcetti. Lawyers and law firms came in third, giving Greuel slightly more than Garcetti.

Garcetti took $14,700 from employees of Jamison Services, which leases office space to various city agencies. He received $8,400 in contributions from employees of McCormack Baron Salazar, a firm that recently completed a 90-unit affordable housing project with $12.3 million in city funding.

Greuel received a combined $9,600 from eight employees of Tutor Perini, parent company of the firm that won a $266-million contract to rebuild a runway at Los Angeles International Airport. At least $6,500 came from executives at Fifteen Group, which is looking to raze and rebuild one of the city’s largest apartment complexes in Boyle Heights.

By complying with the city’s spending limits, Greuel and Garcetti also secured a combined $2.9 million in taxpayer funds for their campaigns. That was another voter-approved reform intended to widen the field of City Hall candidates and encourage those who lack personal wealth or backing from well-heeled special interests to run for office.

The growing reliance on unlimited money has spread to other races. Backers of city controller candidate Dennis Zine, including the LAX police officers’ union, have been funding the Committee to Control Wasteful Spending. Supporters of City Atty. Carmen Trutanich, who is in a tough reelection fight, created L.A. Residents for Accountability. Independent campaign operations also have sprung up in an array of City Council races.

Jaime Regalado, professor emeritus of political science at Cal State L.A., said this year’s campaign is stark evidence that unlimited donations to super PACs are beginning to eclipse sums gathered from a broader cross section of average citizens, undermining the spirit of “one person, one vote.”

“The more a role that large money plays in politics,” he said, “the less democratic [the system] becomes.”

Mark Sanford wins South Carolina House seat,"WASHINGTON — Two years after Mark Sanford left the South Carolina governor’s office tarred by an adultery scandal, he has completed an unlikely political comeback to win a special congressional election. Sanford defeated Democratic neophyte Elizabeth Colbert Busch, sister of late-night satirist Stephen Colbert, in the Republican-leaning 1st District. He reclaims a House seat he once held for three terms.

The bitter race had been expected to be tight, but the Associated Press called it for Sanford about 8:30 p.m. — 90 minutes after the polls closed.

The Charleston-based seat, which spans five counties along the coast, is considered reliably Republican. Mitt Romney carried the district by 18 points over Barack Obama in 2012.

But national Democrats made a serious play for the seat after Sanford emerged as the Republican nominee. The national GOP all but abandoned Sanford, who at one point was considered a possible presidential hopeful before he admitted cheating on his wife with an Argentine mistress whom he called his “soul mate.”

The affair came to light in 2009 when the governor vanished from public view. His staff told questioners he was hiking the Appalachian Trail alone, when in fact he was in Argentina with his mistress. That personal and professional debacle led to Sanford’s divorce.

The scandal flared up during the House campaign when his ex-wife, Jenny Sanford, accused him of violating their divorce agreement by trespassing in her house. He is to appear in court Thursday to answer her complaint.

While still in the governor’s office, Sanford was censured by his state’s Republican Legislature and paid fines for misusing government resources in connection with his affair. He rebuffed calls to resign, however, and served out his second term.

His political career appeared to be finished — until Sen. Jim DeMint’s surprise resignation from the Senate last December. Tim Scott, who represented the 1st District, was appointed to replace DeMint, opening up Scott’s House seat. Amid a crowded field of primary candidates, Sanford’s high name recognition — warts and all — powered him over lesser-known Republican hopefuls.

When Sanford wasn’t working to address voters’ concerns about his personal foibles, he was pointing to his record as a fiscal hawk while he was a congressman and governor. He also argued that a vote for Colbert Busch would be a vote for the agenda of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. He debated a cardboard cutout of the San Francisco Democrat at one stop in the final weeks.

Given the unique circumstances of the race, neither party was prepared to tout a favorable result as a potential indicator of national political trends. In fact, strategists on each side saw a potential benefit in losing.

For Republicans, a win by Colbert Busch would have ensured that a different Republican candidate would be on the ballot in 2014 in already favorable terrain, while Democrats would be forced to spend heavily to protect the seat.

Democrats, while playing hard for a win, saw a potential upside in seeing Sanford join a fractious Republican majority, replacing the lone African American Republican in the House as the national GOP struggles to regain its footing with women and minorities.

“The only thing that Democrats could get from losing is a sense of schadenfreude,” said Amy Walter, national political analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “They know that he is going to be a big thorn in the side of the Republican leadership.”

The chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Steve Israel, seized on that sentiment after Sanford’s victory.

“House Republicans’ outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face,” Israel said. “Republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until election day.”

Israel’s Republican counterpart, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), congratulated Sanford, adding: “These results demonstrate just how devastating the policies of Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi are for House Democrats in 2014.”

She described how she had tried repeatedly to address local party clubs about her candidacy for a hotly contested congressional seat in the Inland Empire, only to learn four of those organizations had endorsed a rival, Redlands Mayor Pete Aguilar.

The backing, announced by the Aguilar campaign, “suggests that information needed to participate fully in the Democratic Club endorsement process has intentionally been withheld” from other candidates, Reyes, a Colton attorney and first-time candidate, said in her letter. She asked the state party to look into the matter.

Although four Democrats are taking on Rep. Gary Miller (R-Rancho Cucamonga) in next year’s June primary, party leaders months ago decided to back Aguilar, funneling endorsements from a bevy of elected officials and campaign contributions his way. That leaves Reyes, former Rep. Joe Baca of Rialto and San Bernardino school board member Danny Tillman with an uphill climb.

Nor can they expect help from the state Democratic Party, which, according to spokesman Tenoch Flores, has no jurisdiction over local clubs and won’t make its own endorsements until March. Most observers expect Aguilar to emerge with that backing too.

According to interviews and their campaign websites, the four Democrats differ little on policy matters, and each has strong roots and at least a modest political base in the 31st Congressional District. The biggest issue in this Democratic-tilting, largely working-class district is who has the best chance of beating Miller.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee decided on Aguilar, even though he made an unsuccessful run at the same seat last year. That was a seminal year in California elections, with districts drawn for the first time by an independent commission and a new “top-two” primary system that sent the first- and second-place finishers to the fall ballot, regardless of party.

The four Democrats split the vote, and although Aguilar placed first among his party peers, the two Republicans, Miller and state Sen. Bob Dutton, outpolled him, knocking him out of the race and dashing Democratic expectations for winning the district.

This time, Democrats have made the district a top target in their battle to wrest control of the House from Republicans. So it’s not surprising they would choose a preferred candidate quickly, said Shaun Bowler, a UC Riverside political scientist.

“This is what you’ve got to do — settle on one candidate, [hope to] scare off the others and focus your efforts,” Bowler said. “You don’t want to have candidates spending a lot of time and money fighting each other.... You don’t want to have it competitive within the party.”

The risk of such a strategy is giving voters the appearance of backroom dealing and building resentment in the candidates, who resent the party establishment and won’t help the primary winner in the fall.

Baca and Reyes insist they can win and said Aguilar already had his chance.

After 12 years in Congress representing much of the area, Baca decided to seek reelection last year in a neighboring district and lost. Now he’s offering himself as an experienced lawmaker and known quantity who can beat Miller, whose hard-line record on immigration could make him vulnerable in this heavily Latino district.

Baca said he endorsed Aguilar last time and would have again had he won but now believes “he’s not a viable candidate.”

He said he’s attending events throughout the district and cited his name recognition and accomplishments, including obtaining $575 million in economic stimulus funds for the district.

“Every time there’s a crowd of 10 people, I’m there,” Baca said.

He said he doesn’t “need to raise as much money because I’m known,” downplaying the $36,605 cash on hand he reported earlier this year, versus Aguilar’s $437,725.

Baca was elected to a community college board four times, then won election to the state Assembly in 1992 and the state Senate in 1998. In Congress, he racked up a more conservative voting record than most California House Democrats, according to Congressional Quarterly’s Politics in America.

Reyes is a lifelong district resident, whose first job, at 12, was picking onions with her mother and siblings. She has the backing of Emily’s List, a national organization that helps female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights. A longtime community volunteer who has worked on other campaigns, Reyes closed her law practice to concentrate on the race and lent her campaign $100,000.

Over lunch recently at the 75-year-old Mitla Café in San Bernardino, Reyes said she would make families her priority and work to bring back jobs to the district, which was especially hard hit by the recession.

“My mom told me I was always fighting for everybody, and that’s what I plan to do in Congress,” Reyes said.

Aguilar, who has been on the Redlands City Council since 2006, said he can bring "" fresh ideas” and a local perspective to Congress. He owns a small communications company and is a fourth-generation resident of the Inland Empire.

Standing near his boyhood home in a modest San Bernardino neighborhood, Aguilar said he has “worked across the aisle” with Republican elected officials “to serve the best interests of middle-class families” and to encourage job growth.

“I don’t subscribe to ‘you should get one shot and then you should go away,’” he said, rattling off a list of prominent politicians who lost elections before winning big. He calls Miller’s election “a fluke.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/25/Report-McConnell-Targets-Nebraska-Conservative-Senate-Candidate,2013-11-25 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Report: McConnell Targets Nebraska Conservative Candidate Ben Sasse,"After the Senate Conservative Fund (SCF) endorsed Matt Bevin, the Tea Party challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), McConnell has reportedly gone on a rampage against SCF allies and the conservative candidates it has endorsed.

Most recently, McConnell reportedly directed his anger at Nebraska conservative Senate candidate Ben Sasse, whom the SCF has endorsed in the open primary.

According to National Review, on November 12, “Sasse walked into Mitch McConnell’s office to clear the air” and let him know he never intended to oppose McConnell’s leadership, but McConnell was having none of it. The outlet notes that McConnell’s incident with Sasse in his war with SCF is “notable” because “it involves an attractive, promising candidate in an open primary as collateral damage in the intramural fight.”

Josh Holmes, McConnell’s top adviser, “privately told friends afterward it was the most uncomfortable meeting he’d been in”; Sasse reportedly turned to Holmes when he walked out of meeting and said, “That didn’t go well!”

McConnell reportedly “lit into” and grilled Sasse about “exactly when Sasse had first interacted with Matt Hoskins, the hard-charging executive director of SCF” who is “working to elect McConnell’s primary challenger.” The SCF was started by former South Carolina Senator and current Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, who feuded with McConnell because he backed candidates–like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul–that went up against McConnell’s handpicked candidates in Republican primaries.

McConnell reportedly asked Sasse about the YouTube video (embedded below) that was highlighted on the Drudge Report in September in which Sasse said it was time for “every Republican in Washington, starting with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, to show some actual leadership.”

In that video, Sasse also ripped Washington’s permanent political class, saying that elected officials are not kings and the American people are not “peasants.” He said there is not “one set of rules for the Washington elite and another for the masses” and called on McConnell to show leadership and give up his Obamacare subsidies. The outlet also reported that “the bad blood between Sasse and McConnell escalated” when Sasse met with National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) political director Ward Baker.

McConnell, along with the Republican establishment like the NRSC, is mounting an organized effort against conservatives and Tea Partiers. For instance, McConnell, as Breitbart News reported, said he would like to punch the SCF “in the nose” on a conference call with donors of Karl Rove’s political group on October 30. McConnell has taken steps to put his words into action; National Review reported that “pressure from McConnell allies convinced SCF’s bookkeeper, Lisa Lisker, to part ways with the group,” even though “Lisker has previously worked for Republican candidates locked in tense primary elections without incident.” McConnell has been accused of “bullying” the bookkeeper.

Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, in response to McConnell’s hostile words, told Breitbart News, “Why would Senator Mitch McConnell want to ‘punch in the nose’ the millions of patriotic moms, grandmoms and veterans who stand up for America through the Tea Party and groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund?”

“The people supporting SCF are the same people going to Tea Party meetings and rallies across the country. We elect our representatives to represent us, not to threaten us with physical violence during secret meetings with Karl Rove’s friends,” she told Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle. She added that “everything” the Tea Party said “about Obamacare turned out to be true.”

She continued, “If they’ve got so much fight in them, then where were they when we needed them to stand up and fight against Obamacare?” Martin also emphasized that the “Tea Party Patriots shares Senate Conservatives Fund’s goal of holding establishment Republicans accountable, and specifically, we shared the goal of defunding Obamacare.”

McConnell has not endorsed Sasse’s primary opponent in the race, but Sasse is being considered “collateral damage” in a fight he never wanted in McConnell’s and the Republican establishment’s broader war on conservative Tea Partiers and specifically against SCF."

Senators Fail to Head Off Primary Challenges by Tea Party Rivals,"WASHINGTON — For the past two years, Republican senators facing re-election have very deliberately spent millions of dollars, hired multiple consultants and cast scores of conservative votes with one goal in mind: avoiding the embarrassing primary conflagrations that befell their party in 2010 and 2012 and cost Republicans a chance at taking back the Senate.

It has not worked. Despite their careful efforts, some of the best-known and most influential Republicans in the Senate have been unable to shake threats from the right and have attracted rivals who portray these lawmakers as a central part of the problem in Washington.

In Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, the party’s Senate leader, is fending off a charismatic and wealthy conservative challenger. In South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, one of the Senate’s most reliably conservative voices on foreign policy, is being painted by primary opponents as a veritable clone of President Obama.

In Tennessee, Tea Party activists have vowed to take out Lamar Alexander, the veteran senator, former cabinet officer and two-time presidential candidate. “Senator Alexander has never been a true conservative,” said Ben Cunningham, president of the Nashville Tea Party. “His support for the amnesty bill has caused great problems for us,” he said, referring to the Senate immigration bill. “He is at best a moderate.”"

In her first, she highlights a little-remarked upon aspect of the 2012 Presidential campaign--that George W. Bush, ""history's actor,"" the last Republican to hold the White House, presiding over our country for eight seemingly endless years--was nowhere to be seen.

It's an appropriate introduction for Dr. Maddow. The shadow of Bush looms not only over today's Republican Party, but on all of us, and especially on Maddow herself. In a real sense she owes her career--and Markos owes the success of this site--to the depravity of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.

Bush made no noteworthy appearances for any candidate in 2012. He was a non-entity at the Republican National Convention. Not even the corporate media that had fawned over his worst excesses seemed interested in what he thought--about anything. His was the ""name that shall not be named,"" terminating the lofty aspirations of his heir apparent brother and bringing the family dynasty to a screeching halt. For a two-term President to have been utterly shunted by his own Party to the silent dustbin of history is a singular accomplishment. Maddow points out that no former Bush official holds any major visible position in today's Republican hierarchy:

[B]y the time the Bush era was winding down, the whole administration, including the president, was stewed in terrible, Cheney-level disapproval ratings. And now, almost no one who played a significant role in that administration is anywhere to be found in electoral politics, beyond the tertiary orbits of Punch-and-Judy cable news and the remains of what used to be the conservative “think tank” circuit.

The 2008 Republican presidential primaries were like some odd eight-year cicada hatch in which the candidates went underground in 2000 and then birthed themselves after Bush and Cheney were gone, as if the intervening years had never happened.

2012 simply cemented the consensus felt by the GOP in 2008, that the Bush name carried the toxicity and accompanying shelf-life of a nuclear meltdown:The Bush legacy is so tainted that it has spawned an ideological shift in a GOP that, however dimly, recognizes that the face in the rear-view mirror is too hideous for most Americans to bear. Hence the outsized rise of the Libertarian elements in the party (perceived by Maddow as having at least the potential to win over a more youthful demographic). But even of those, the search for viable new leaders is crippled by the wreckage left in Bush's wake. The damage done by Bush to his own party is historic in and of itself.

She believes that the Bush experience contains a cautionary note for the Democrats as well. While President Obama's tenure is hardly likely to leave the negative blowback on the Democratic Party that Bush foisted on the GOP, the President's legacy to his Party is something he should be aware of and working on at this point in his second term. The rise of a more progressive breed of Democrats, particularly in the Senate, ought to inspire that effort going forward. And although hailed by the corporate soothsayers as the inevitable nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton thus far (in Maddow's eyes) simply hasn't generated the grassroots enthusiasm one would expect from the Democratic base:



Unless Vice President Biden’s presidential hinting suddenly takes a turn for the serious, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is the obvious inheritor of the party’s mantle. But, as in 2008, the Beltway may be overstating her inevitability. The grass roots aren’t all with her, frankly, and it’s yet to be seen if she’s interested in trying to win them over. Mainstream press may buy big-dollar donors (and more mainstream press), but it can’t buy the passionate volunteers and activists and excitement that are the oxygen for a winning campaign and sustained, effective leadership.



The bottom line? The President should be concerned about the legacy he leaves when he departs the Oval Office. And if Hillary is to inherit that legacy, she will first and foremost need to answer to us."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gop-analysis-20130106,0,787706.story",2013-01-05 08:00:00,[],Republican Party divide increasingly a matter of region,"WASHINGTON — The budget battles rocking the capital have exposed a deepening fault line within an already fractured Republican Party: the divide between the GOP’s solid Southern base and the rest of the country.

That regional split became evident when members of the House of Representatives cast votes last week on a budget deal designed to avoid massive tax hikes and spending cuts: Almost 90% of Southern Republicans voted against the “fiscal-cliff” compromise. At the same time, a majority of Republican representatives from outside the South supported the deal, which was approved in large part because of overwhelming Democratic support.

The GOP’s geographic schisms burst anew after House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) canceled an expected vote on a $60-billion disaster relief package for victims of Superstorm Sandy.

Rep. Peter T. King (R- N.Y.) accused his party of “cavalier disregard” toward New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a potential 2016 GOP presidential contender, lashed out at what he called the “toxic internal politics” of his party’s House majority, noting that Republicans had speedily approved support for storm relief in “Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Alabama …""

Boehner moved quickly to smooth things over, but the upheaval was a reminder that divisions within the party could play an influential role as the new Congress begins to tackle Washington’s top agenda items, including an attempt in coming weeks to avoid a national debt default and President Obama’s promised effort to overhaul the nation’s immigration system.

The image projected by the battles in the House — the only part of the federal government controlled by Republicans — could influence public attitudes toward the GOP and its candidates heading into the 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential contest.

In particular, the South’s preeminence could pose challenges to national GOP efforts to broaden the party’s appeal on social and cultural issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.

“An increasing challenge for Northeastern Republicans, and West Coast Republicans, for that matter, is the growing perception among their constituents that the Republican Party is predominantly a Southern and rural party,” said Dan Schnur, a former GOP campaign strategist who directs the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. “There’s always been a political and cultural disconnect between the South and the rest of the country. But as the parties have sorted themselves out geographically over the last few decades, the size of that gap has increased.”

To an unprecedented degree, today’s Republican majority in the House is centered in the states of the old Confederacy. The GOP enjoys a 57-seat advantage across the 11-state region that stretches from Texas to Virginia.

Outside the South, however, it’s a different story.

As a result of reapportionment and the 2012 election, the GOP no longer controls a majority of non-Southern congressional districts. In the last Congress, Republicans held a slim, two-district majority in non-Southern states; now Democrats have a 24-seat edge. Still, the Republicans have a comfortable 33-seat overall majority in the House — two seats are vacant — and only the most optimistic Democrats believe that Republicans will lose control of the chamber in 2014.

Merle Black, an Emory University political science professor who is an authority on the rise of the Republican Party in the South, said opposition to the fiscal cliff compromise appeared to be concentrated in congressional districts with the highest percentages of conservative voters.

“The Deep South is the most conservative area of the nation,” Black noted.

Few would dispute that the battle over the fiscal cliff and internecine sniping over Superstorm Sandy aid left Republicans in Washington deeply divided at a time when the party is still trying to recover from a presidential election defeat that many did not see coming.

“Any time a party loses an election, it goes through a process of internal debate. What the fiscal cliff did was to force that into becoming a little more public than usually happens,” said Republican strategist Ed Brookover.

Not everyone in the party agrees that its increasing concentration in the South poses a threat at the ballot box.

“No one in New Hampshire isn’t going to vote Republican because our base is in the South,” said Dave Carney, a campaign consultant based in New Hampshire whose clients have included Texas Gov. Rick Perry. “I don’t think there’s a disqualification because a majority of the party members come from below the Mason-Dixon line. What would be an issue is who the candidates will be at the national level and what their message will be.”

Yet the South’s dominance and internal politics have reinforced the tilt toward sharply conservative views.

In the House, most members of both parties represent districts that have lopsided partisan majorities. The threat of a primary challenge, often from a more extreme member of their own party, is a greater threat to many incumbents than opposition in the general election from the other party’s candidate.

That tends to foster attitudes that can run counter to a party’s national goals. The recent presidential campaign, in which Republican Mitt Romney was targeted by Democrats for adopting more conservative positions as he sought the nomination, demonstrated the limits of hewing to the Southern approach. The positions Romney and others have taken secured the support of white voters, but that is a declining share of a national electorate that is becoming increasingly diverse, with the emergence of a fast-growing Latino vote that has strongly favored Democratic candidates.

“Republicans across the country need to take a long, hard look at where this party is headed. Demographically, it cannot survive on the trajectory it’s taken,” said Dick Wadhams, a former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party. “The question for House Republicans is whether they are going to be an aid or an obstacle. I am hopeful the longer view is taken and that Republicans will understand the political predicament we would be in if responsible, substantive changes aren’t made in the tone and substance of the party’s relationship to Hispanics.”

Brookover, a former political director of the House Republican campaign committee, contrasted opposition to the fiscal cliff compromise in the House with the high level of GOP support in the Senate, where officeholders often have to build a broader base of support to win statewide. Only five Republican senators voted no.

Most of the dissenters were first-termers who came into office with the support of the tea party in 2010, including potential combatants in the next round of Republican presidential primaries: Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky.

In a deep red state, Sam Brownback - who has used Kansas as an experiment in hopes of a presidential run, finds himself in a dogfight with Democratic Candidate Paul Davis.

Paul Davis, Democratic Senate Minority Leader in our state has made a hardened effort to hit the road, appear in multiple counties.



Sam Brownback's administration is at it's lowest popularity rating.. well, period. What makes this result interesting is that a similar poll was released earlier in the week with an error:

http://cjonline.com/...

Republicans pointed out the poll wasn't valid because the question was asked with the wrong name attached. The Wichita Eagle tossed the results and had the survey run again, different numbers, different respondents to see what the results would be.



""Sam Brownback can't hide from the truth: his policies are hurting Kansas families and they know it,"" Joan Wagnon, the chairwoman of the Kansas Democratic Party, said in a news release. When asked their opinion of Brownback, 22 percent called it ""favorable"" and 47 percent said ""unfavorable."" The remainder were unsure or neutral. Clay Barker, chairman of the Kansas Republican Party, expressed skepticism about the polling data. ""They didn't get the name of the Democratic candidate for governor right,"" Barker said via email. ""If they can't get someone's name right, what's your confidence in their ability to accurately do higher math?""

How did it turn out? With more respondents and a the question corrected... Brownback fell farther in the second attempt, making it a 4 point gap instead of a 2 point gap between the candidates.

Whoops.

At this point with a survey sample in two polls taken over one week there is no denying that Brownback faces a real challenge in 2014.

Kansas deserves better leadership. Paul Davis offers a real chance for some change in this state. Kansas is not 'out of reach' or unwinnable, and poll after poll should put Kansas as a state worth the fight.

If you're in this state and you've written it off in the past this is your chance to get active. If you're a democrat in a safe state that wants to make a serious difference in the direction of our country, this is a chance to put an end to policies like: Forced Ultrasounds; the ability of biological fathers to sue for emotional damages after abortions; resuming prosecutions of spousal abusers and domestic abuse cases; an education system that isn't hell bent on overturning scientific theory.

If you've got it to spare, and you want a candidate who has the ability to shock a nation, Paul Davis is worthy of a drop or two.

Shelby County, Ala., is making the case against the voting law. Section 5 of the act empowers the federal government to negate new local and state voting rules if they would lead to discrimination against minority voters. It has been enforced primarily in Southern states that had a long, dismal history of preventing African Americans from voting. Shelby County contends that the problem has been remedied and so Section 5 is no longer justified.

Rep. John Lewis of Georgia begs to differ. Lewis was severely beaten in Selma during the 1965 “Bloody Sunday” police riot directed against peaceful civil rights marchers. The horror of that scene as it played out on America’s television screens led directly to congressional approval of the Voting Rights Act.

In an interview with USA Today, Lewis talked about the methods used to bar blacks from voting back in 1965, and insisted that more subtle impediments still are being employed to undercut voting rights today.

“You may not have what we had, such as the literacy tests or asking people to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap or the number of jelly beans in a jar,” Lewis said. “It may not be the overt acts of violence that we had and witnessed during the ‘60s. But the result is the same.”

As recently as 2006, both houses of Congress agreed with Lewis. After extensive testimony, lawmakers determined that a long list of problems still exists and they renewed the Voting Rights Act for an additional 25 years. The vote was overwhelming in the House unanimous in the Senate and was hailed by President George W. Bush as a victory for American democracy.

In court on Wednesday, however, Scalia mocked that vote. He said the Senate’s unanimity simply proved the law had not been given serious consideration. The senators were afraid, he said, to cast a vote against a law with a “wonderful” name. He went on to assert that the reauthorization of the act was merely “a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement.”

That sort of legal reasoning may be good enough for someone sitting on a bar stool well into his third pint, but it is not good enough for the highest court in the land. Scalia makes self-serving assumptions about what was on the minds of senators in 2006 -- afraid, not serious, enamored with a name -- with no facts to back up his barbs.

Tossing actual statistics back at Scalia, Justice Elena Kagan cited a string of continued voting-rights violations. As to the state of mind of the senators, she said the unanimous vote was pretty good proof that the evidence of contemporary abuses was convincing, even to conservative Southerners.

“It was clear to 98 senators, including every senator from a covered state, who decided that there was a continuing need for this piece of legislation,” Kagan said.

Undeterred, Scalia opined that a law governing voting rights is “not the kind of question you can leave to Congress.” Oh, really? The right to vote is the core of our constitutional democracy. It is not, as Scalia says, “a racial entitlement,” it is an American entitlement. It seems that might be a very useful thing for Congress to watch over and protect. It was eminently important in 1965 and remains important today.

One need only consider the outrageous voter suppression measures attempted in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and other states in the 2012 election cycle to see that the right to vote is still something certain Americans must fight for. It is true that impediments put in the way of black and Latino voters now are not so much about racial animosity as they are about the fact that those racial groups overwhelmingly vote for Democrats, but the effect, as Lewis says, is the same.

Given the weirdness of his comments, it might not be wrong to assume Scalia’s true concern is less about “racial entitlement” than it is about making sure his fellow Republicans are entitled. Entitled, that is, to manipulate elections when they can no longer win fair and square."

Word of Ms. Cheney’s announcement went out just minutes after Mr. Enzi, in a barely veiled message to Ms. Cheney, issued his own statement that he would seek a fourth term. “I intend to run for re-election for Wyoming’s Senate seat in 2014,” Mr. Enzi said. “When I announce formally, I will let everyone know that date in the future. In the meantime, I will do the job I was already elected to do. My trips to Wyoming almost weekly, the public listening sessions, the groups I meet with and speak to, working behind the scenes — this is what I have been doing since I was elected, and this is what needs to be done.”

Talking to reporters in the Capitol after the video went public, Mr. Enzi said he was not notified by either Ms. Cheney or her father — whom he has known for over 30 years — about Ms. Cheney’s intentions.

“I thought we were friends,” he added.

Mr. Enzi said in an interview this month that he was planning on running again but that he wanted to delay any declaration until closer to the election. Yet he also revealed at the time that Ms. Cheney had called him to say she was considering challenging him.

Her ambitions had been rumored since she moved from suburban Washington to the Jackson Hole, Wyo., area last fall and immediately became a regular at state political and civic events. Ms. Cheney, a former senior State Department official in President George W. Bush’s administration, has been a Fox News contributor."
http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/a-teachable-moment/,2013-10-16 00:00:00,['Topics.Nytimes.Com Top Opinion Editorialsandoped Oped Columnists Rossdouthat Index.Html'],A Teachable Moment,"One of the themes running through my various government shutdown posts has been the importance of seeing the current wave of right-wing populism clearly and weighing its merits and demerits judiciously. That requires understanding the strategic thinking that led to the shutdown in the first place … acknowledging the legitimate sense of political disappointment that underlies the right’s inclination toward intransigence … and most importantly, recognizing that relative to the G.O.P. establishment (such as it is), today’s right-wing populists often have better political instincts and better policy ideas.

But with tonight’s vote done and the government open once again, I want to return to the theme of my Sunday column, and stress once more the essential absurdity of the specific populist gambit we’ve just witnessed unfold, drag on, and now finally collapse. However you slice and dice the history, the strategery, and the underlying issues, the decision to live with a government shutdown for an extended period of time — inflicting modest-but-real harm on the economy, needlessly disrupting the lives and paychecks of many thousands of hardworking people, and further tarnishing the Republican Party’s already not-exactly-shiny image — in pursuit of obviously, obviously unattainable goals was not a normal political blunder by a normally-functioning political party. It was an irresponsible, dysfunctional and deeply pointless act, carried out by a party that on the evidence of the last few weeks shouldn’t be trusted with the management of a banana stand, let alone the House of Representatives.

This means that the still-ongoing intra-conservative debate over the shutdown’s wisdom is not, I’m sorry, the kind of case where reasonable people can differ on the merits and have good-faith arguments and ultimately agree to disagree. There was no argument for the shutdown itself that a person unblindered by political fantasies should be obliged to respect, no plausible alternative world in which it could have led to any outcome besides self-inflicted political damage followed by legislative defeat, and no epitaph that should be written for its instigators’ planning and execution except: “These guys deserved to lose.”

And it’s important for conservatives and Republicans to recognize this, and remember it, because what just happened can happen again, and next time the consequences may be more severe. The mentality that drove the shutdown — a toxic combination of tactical irrationality and the elevation of that irrationality into a True Conservative (TM) litmus test — may have less influence in next year’s Beltway negotiations than it did this time around, thanks to the way this has ended for the defunders after John Boehner gave them pretty much all the rope that they’d been asking for. But just turn on talk radio or browse RedState or look at Ted Cruz’s approval ratings with Tea Partiers and you’ll see how potent this mentality remains, how quickly it could resurface, and how easily Republican politics and American governance alike could be warped by it in the future.

So for undeluded conservatives of all persuasions, lessons must be learned. If the party’s populists want to shape and redefine and ultimately remake the party, they can’t pull this kind of stunt again. If the party’s leadership wants to actually lead, whether within the G.O.P. or in the country at large, they can’t let this kind of stunt be pulled again. That’s the only way in which this pointless-seeming exercise could turn out to have some sort of point: If it’s long remembered, by its proponents and their enablers alike, as the utter folly that it was."

He has been popular in Iowa%2C earning favorability ratings in the 60%25 range

Senator chairs a key committee on health-care issues

He has served 27 years in the Senate and 10 in the House

Tom Harkin, Iowa's powerful Democratic U.S. senator, won't seek re-election in 2014, he told The Des Moines Register Saturday morning.

His retirement is expected to leave a huge void for Iowa, but clears the way for Democrats trying determine their lineup for the mid-term elections.

The next generation of Democratic candidates depended on whether Harkin, 73, chose to run again, party operatives have said. Rep. Bruce Braley is the favored replacement, Democrats have said.

""I have mixed feelings,"" said Harkin, who was born in Cumming and has served in the Senate for 27 years and in the U.S. House 10 years before that. ""You know what, it's somebody else's turn.""

He added: ""To walk away from this position and this power is not an easy thing. But I think it's the right thing. And I have two years left. I'm not passing the torch sitting down; it's a running relay. I intend to be very active over the next two years.""

The news was unexpected: Many leading Democrats thought Harkin would run again. He and his Republican counterpart, Sen. Chuck Grassley, 78, are a major force in the federal government.

Following Harkin's announcement, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada called the Iowan a ""pillar of the Senate"" whose ""work on behalf of people with disabilities has changed millions of lives and advanced the cause of equality for which he has fought tirelessly for decades.""

Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, said in a statement: ""Tom Harkin comes from the heartland of America and represents the best of that region's values, combining strong convictions with a deep, personal humility.

""His hard work and abiding commitment to caring for one's neighbor has made him one of the Senate's most respected progressives,"" Schumer said. ""He will be deeply missed by senators on both sides of the aisle.""

Harkin is popular in Iowa, regularly earning job approval ratings in the 60% range in the Iowa Poll.

He is a big voice on social issues, and he has the ear of party leaders. Since Democrats control his chamber, he can move bills and tuck in an amendment here or there. He has left a thumbprint on agriculture, improvements for people with disabilities, health care and various progressive causes for decades.

Harkin shoulders an important assignment in the Senate: He's chairman of the HELP committee, which stands for Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, a huge jurisdiction. The No Child Left Behind education law and the 2010 health care reform law — the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare — originated there. Those assigned to this powerful committee generally aren't supposed to serve on other committees, but Harkin has taken on three others: agriculture, appropriations and small business.

Democrats have to defend 20 seats in 2014; the Republicans 14. Democrats currently have a 55-45 voting advantage, with two independents organizing with them.

Harkin is the third senator up for re-election to say he is not running again. His decision follows Friday's surprise announcement that Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., would not seek re-election. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., is also retiring.

Harkin's seat is likely to be in play in a swing state that Obama won both times.

So why, in an exclusive survey of fast-growth CEOs, do 36 percent of these entrepreneurs say they’d support Hillary Clinton for President? That's more than any other potential Presidential candidate except for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whom 47 percent of survey respondents said they would support.

The findings are based on a survey of the Inc. 5000, our annual ranking of the fastest-growing private U.S. companies.

Some of the other contenders were Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, with 34 percent; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with 31 percent; and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, with 21 percent. After Clinton, the best-scoring Democrat was New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Nine percent of fast-growth entrepreneurs said they’d support him.

Strange Bedfellows

The conventional wisdom is that two-thirds of business owners are Republican and one-third are Democrats. That’s misleading. In the Inc. survey, 47 percent of fast-growth CEOs describe themselves as Republicans, compared to only 17 percent who say they’re Democrats. But more than a third--36 percent--say they’re independents.

When asked about their political philosophy, as opposed to party affiliation, the results are telling. Only 31 percent say they’re conservative. Liberals are an even smaller minority, at only 10 percent. Everyone else--a whopping 59 percent--claims to be moderate.

Women CEOs, not surprisingly, are even less likely to be Republican. About a third of fast-growth women entrepreneurs said they are Republicans, a third said they are Democrats, and about a third are independents. While about two-thirds of fast-growth CEOs who are men voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the last U.S. presidential election, more than half the women--53 percent--voted for Barack Obama.

The fact that so many of the Inc. 5000 consider themselves moderates doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for candidates on either edge of the political spectrum, be they Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (6.3 percent) or Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas (15 percent). But it leaves plenty of business owners who are willing to back a Democratic woman for President--especially one whose bridge-building efforts have won praise from both sides of the political aisle and who is widely regarded as having had a successful tenure as the U.S. Secretary of State. Forty percent of fast-growth CEOs who said they were independents also said they’d back Clinton. Eighty-seven percent of Democrats said they’d support her, as did 13 percent of Republicans. Among women, 61 percent said they’d back Clinton for President.

It’s telling that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican who got flak from his own party by appearing to buddy up with President Obama just a bit too much during Hurricane Sandy last year, was the only one to make a stronger showing than Hillary. More than half of independents--53 percent--said they’d back Christie for president.

It undoubtedly helps both Christie and Clinton that neither of them is currently serving in Washington. When it comes to the federal government shutdown, the threatened debt default, and the record-breaking level of dysfunction in D.C., their hands are clean. For now.

Based on the results of an October survey of Inc. 5000 entrepreneurs. The survey had 306 respondents."
http://news.yahoo.com/much-huma-hillary-154316970.html,,[],How Much Is Huma Like Hillary?,"Bill and Hillary Clinton are reportedly upset that Huma Abedin is implicitly comparing herself to Hillary so much. ""The Clintons are upset with the comparisons that the Weiners seem to be encouraging — that Huma is ‘standing by her man’ the way Hillary did with Bill, which is not what she in fact did,"" a New York Democrat tells the New York Post's Frederic U. Dicker. In private conversations with Democrats, Weiner and Abedin have cited the Clintons' example as proof he can win over voters in the New York City mayoral race. On CBS on Sunday, former Bill Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Meyers said the Clintons, ""like many of us, would like to see"" Weiner quit the race. (She followed up with an email saying, ""I haven't spoken to either of them about the situation."") The Post's source says, ""How dare they compare Huma with Hillary?"" This is a fascinating question. How can they make the comparison between Huma and Hillary? Let's examine what they have in common, and what they don't.

Résumé

RELATED: Huma Abedin Had an Incredibly Sweet Deal at the State Department

""The Clintons are pissed off that Weiner’s campaign is saying that Huma is just like Hillary,"" the Post's Democrat says. ""How dare they compare Huma with Hillary? Hillary was the first lady. Hillary was a senator. She was secretary of state.""

RELATED: The New York Times New DC Chief; Bon Jovi's 9/11 Tribute

It's true that Clinton's résumé is now far more illustrious than Abedin's. But when Gennifer Flowers claimed she'd had an affair with Clinton during the 1992 Democratic presidential primary, Hillary Clinton was not secretary of state. Or a senator. She was the first lady of Arkansas, an unelected position. She had worked on the congressional committee investigating Watergate, and was an important lawyer in Arkansas.

Story continues

By contrast, Abedin worked as deputy chief of staff to the secretary of state. That is a much bigger deal. Granted, the secretary of state was Clinton. But Abedin was up to the task, or Hillary wouldn't have promoted her, right?

Feminist credentials

""Hillary didn’t know Huma would do this whole stand-by-your-man routine, and that’s one of the reasons the Clintons are distancing themselves from all this nonsense,"" the Post's source says.

It's not entirely fair to point this out, since Clinton was living in a red state 20 years ago, but she worked to fit into a very traditional wifely role. In 1982, when her husband ran for reelection, her last name was an issue. As The New York Times reported, she said, ""I've been Mrs. Bill Clinton. I kept the professional name Hillary Rodham in my law practice, but now I'm going to be taking a leave of absence from the law firm to campaign full time for Bill and I'll be Mrs. Bill Clinton. I suspect people will be getting tired of hearing from Mrs. Bill Clinton."" (In 1993, The Wall Street Journal polled Americans to ask, ""Should the First Lady be known as Hillary Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton?"" Sixty-two percent picked Hillary Clinton. She went by Hillary Rodham Clinton until she ran for president.)

Abedin has kept her own last name.

Standing by your man

The Post reports the Clintons don't like the comparison that ""Huma is ‘standing by her man’ the way Hillary did with Bill, which is not what she in fact did."" But it is in fact what she did. I have found no record of the Clintons filing for divorce, or of Hillary moving out of the White House. The Clintons did many side-by-side interviews, and Hillary allowed herself to be photographed dancing in her swimsuit with her husband on vacation in the Virgin Islands.

His résumé

The biggest difference between the Clintons and Weiner and Abedin doesn't seem to be the wife so much as the husband. In the early 90s, Clinton was a rising star in the Democratic Party, and when the Monica Lewinsky scandal struck, he was, of course, president of the United States. Weiner, by contrast, is a former congressman with a meagre legislative record who is mostly known for going on cable TV. If the Clintons are really annoyed at Abedin, it's more likely not because she's standing by her man, but because she's standing by a loser."

Cotton, a freshman congressman who is running for Senate in 2014, warned feminists in a 1997 article for the Harvard Crimson that no-fault divorce will backfire on them by enabling their husbands to leave them for trophy wives.

""Feminists say no fault divorce was a large hurdle on the path to female liberation,"" Cotton wrote. ""They apparently don't consult the deepest hopes or greatest fears of young women.""

Cotton, who is unmarried, wrote that he surveyed several women -- whom he referred to as ""Cliffies,"" or female students at Radcliffe -- and they all told him the same thing: that their ""greatest fear"" in life was to be left by their husbands, and their ""deepest hope"" was to be ""a good wife and mother."" To that end, he says, feminists should stop trying to make it easier to get divorced.

""If men have easy access to divorce, many will choose it thoughtlessly,"" he wrote. ""They may not gain true happiness with their new trophy wives, but they certainly will not slide into the material indigence and emotional misery that awaits most divorced women.""

Cotton tried to make the case for ""covenant marriages,"" in which people can only divorce in cases where there's fault, ""defined as abandonment, physical abuse, adultery or conviction of a capital crime.""

The National Organization for Women denounced covenant marriage in 1997 when Louisiana became the first state to create it as a legal category, arguing that it was intended to trap women in bad marriages and re-establish patriarchy. But Cotton wrote that women should support the policy in order to restrain men from leaving, so that they will stay and ""fulfill women's deepest hopes.""

""[Men] can learn that personal happiness comes from the desire to devote and sacrifice oneself to one's beloved,"" he wrote. ""A few men can see this by themselves, and women are quite lucky to hook them. Ordinary women must not only defend these men against feminism, but also demand that all other men accept the lifelong nature of marriage. If not, one-half of all women who marry see their ‘greatest fear’ come true.""

Laws allowing no-fault divorce across the country were considered a victory for women's rights in the 1970s. A 2003 Stanford Business School study found states that passed no-fault divorce laws saw a 20 percent reduction in female suicide after 20 years and a 33 percent reduction in domestic violence and murder against women.

Cotton's campaign did not immediately comment on whether the congressman stands by the article, but Cotton remains a staunch social conservative. He opposes abortion rights, equal pay for women, marriage equality and women in combat, and he voted against every version of the Violence Against Women Act that has come up since he took office.

Cotton is challenging Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), the lone Democratic senator in an increasingly Republican state. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) began personally fundraising for Pryor this week, writing in an email to supporters that Cotton is ""recklessly anti-woman.""

CORRECTION: This article previously cited a 2004 Stanford Business School study on no-fault divorce. The study was published in 2003."

2012 Republican VP nominee says party must avoid internal squabbles.

Paul Ryan told conservatives Saturday they must show they have better ideas.

Could include rejecting the President%27s ideas or recasting them to make them better.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee said Saturday that the party needs to stick together and pick its fights during President Barack Obama's new term as it seeks to rebound from a second straight presidential loss.

In a speech to conservatives, Rep. Paul Ryan said Republicans should reject some White House proposals outright and try to infuse others with conservative principles. He warned that Obama would attempt to divide Republicans.

""We can't get rattled. We won't play the villain in his morality plays. We have to stay united,"" Ryan said at the National Review Institute event. ""We have to show that if given the chance, we can govern. We have better ideas.""

The Wisconsin congressman outlined a pragmatic approach for a party dealing with last November's election defeats and trying to determine whether to oppose Obama's agenda at every turn or shape the president's proposals with conservative principles.

With a surging minority population altering the electorate, Republican leaders have discussed the need to attract more women and Hispanics while at the same time standing firm to the values that unite conservatives.

How the party moves forward was a major theme of the three-day meeting of conservative activists who also heard from Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Govs. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Bob McDonnell of Virginia were scheduled to address the conference on Sunday.

The theme also dominated the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, which ended Friday in Charlotte, North Carolina.

With a surging minority population altering the electorate, Republican leaders have discussed the need to attract more women and Hispanics while at the same time standing firm on the values that unite conservatives. Republicans said despite the losses, the party could return to power by projecting optimism and attracting new voters with a message of economic opportunity.

Walker, a star among conservatives after surviving a union-led campaign to recall him from office in Wisconsin, said government needed ""brown-bag common sense,"" a reference to his frugal practice of packing his own lunch of ham-and-cheese sandwiches every day. Qualities like optimism, staying relevant to voters and showing courage in tackling big problems would be rewarded at the voting booth, he said.

""We've got to learn to be more optimistic. We've got to learn to give a viable alternative to the voters,"" Walker said.

Cruz said Republicans needed to use upcoming fights over the budget and the deficit as ""leverage points"" to tame long-term spending and debt. Projecting an upbeat outlook for the party, he said Obama's policies would drive many voters to Republicans just as many Americans turned to Ronald Reagan after the economic turmoil of the late 1970s.

""We're on the verge of a rebirth of conservativism,"" Cruz said.

Looking ahead, Ryan rejected the notion that Republicans were ""in the wilderness,"" noting that the party controls the House of Representsatives and most statehouses. But he said Obama's victory over Mitt Romney meant that Republicans would need to recalibrate their approach to deal with the new political realities.

""If we want to promote conservatism, we'll need to use every tool at our disposal,"" Ryan said. ""Sometimes, we will have to reject the president's proposals - that time may come more than once. And sometimes we'll have to make them better."" He said Republicans should have two main goals for the next four years, namely ""to mitigate bad policies"" and ""to advance good policy wherever we can.""

Ryan acknowledged that ""we all didn't see eye to eye"" on the recent ""fiscal cliff"" vote to deal with a combination of spending cuts and higher taxes that were set to take effect at the start of the year. He defended his support for the bill even though it raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans, saying it was the only way to avoid sweeping tax increases and prevent the economy from going into a free-fall.

As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan said Republicans needed to guard against a debt crisis for the country that would undermine the economy. He said he would promote changes to Medicare and Medicaid - the government programs that provide health care coverage to the elderly and poor - and would propose a budget ""that will balance and pay down the debt.""

But November's election results still linger. Ryan said he was ""disappointed"" by the outcome, saying he had been ""looking forward to taking on the big challenges"" while living at the vice president's residence. ""My kids were looking forward to having a pool,"" he joked."

The noon appointment, which will be held in the President's private dining room, is closed to the press. The White House did not disclose the purpose of the meeting. However, as with anything related to Clinton these days, discussion in the media will likely circle back to one topic: 2016.

NBC is so confident Clinton will play a starring role in 2016, it just announced plans for a four-episode miniseries about the former Secretary of State, set to debut during the heat of the general election. A big-screen dramatization of the her life is also slated for a 2016 release.

Obama has not voiced support for a presidential candidate, laughing off the subject during an interview with Clinton on ""60 Minutes"" in January. The rare joint interview nonetheless triggered a frenzy of speculation about his preferences. Vice President Joe Biden, who previously sought the Democratic nomination twice, is also eying a possible run.

Clinton, for her part, has not signaled anything definite with regard to her presidential ambitions. Since stepping down as Secretary of State in February, she has kept busy delivering speeches to a variety of industry groups across the country, collecting $200,000 an appearance. She is widely considered the early favorite to win the Democratic nomination and polls ahead of potential Republican nominees."

Mark Sanford wins South Carolina House seat,"WASHINGTON — Two years after Mark Sanford left the South Carolina governor’s office tarred by an adultery scandal, he has completed an unlikely political comeback to win a special congressional election. Sanford defeated Democratic neophyte Elizabeth Colbert Busch, sister of late-night satirist Stephen Colbert, in the Republican-leaning 1st District. He reclaims a House seat he once held for three terms.

The bitter race had been expected to be tight, but the Associated Press called it for Sanford about 8:30 p.m. — 90 minutes after the polls closed.

The Charleston-based seat, which spans five counties along the coast, is considered reliably Republican. Mitt Romney carried the district by 18 points over Barack Obama in 2012.

But national Democrats made a serious play for the seat after Sanford emerged as the Republican nominee. The national GOP all but abandoned Sanford, who at one point was considered a possible presidential hopeful before he admitted cheating on his wife with an Argentine mistress whom he called his “soul mate.”

The affair came to light in 2009 when the governor vanished from public view. His staff told questioners he was hiking the Appalachian Trail alone, when in fact he was in Argentina with his mistress. That personal and professional debacle led to Sanford’s divorce.

The scandal flared up during the House campaign when his ex-wife, Jenny Sanford, accused him of violating their divorce agreement by trespassing in her house. He is to appear in court Thursday to answer her complaint.

While still in the governor’s office, Sanford was censured by his state’s Republican Legislature and paid fines for misusing government resources in connection with his affair. He rebuffed calls to resign, however, and served out his second term.

His political career appeared to be finished — until Sen. Jim DeMint’s surprise resignation from the Senate last December. Tim Scott, who represented the 1st District, was appointed to replace DeMint, opening up Scott’s House seat. Amid a crowded field of primary candidates, Sanford’s high name recognition — warts and all — powered him over lesser-known Republican hopefuls.

When Sanford wasn’t working to address voters’ concerns about his personal foibles, he was pointing to his record as a fiscal hawk while he was a congressman and governor. He also argued that a vote for Colbert Busch would be a vote for the agenda of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. He debated a cardboard cutout of the San Francisco Democrat at one stop in the final weeks.

Given the unique circumstances of the race, neither party was prepared to tout a favorable result as a potential indicator of national political trends. In fact, strategists on each side saw a potential benefit in losing.

For Republicans, a win by Colbert Busch would have ensured that a different Republican candidate would be on the ballot in 2014 in already favorable terrain, while Democrats would be forced to spend heavily to protect the seat.

Democrats, while playing hard for a win, saw a potential upside in seeing Sanford join a fractious Republican majority, replacing the lone African American Republican in the House as the national GOP struggles to regain its footing with women and minorities.

“The only thing that Democrats could get from losing is a sense of schadenfreude,” said Amy Walter, national political analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “They know that he is going to be a big thorn in the side of the Republican leadership.”

The chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Steve Israel, seized on that sentiment after Sanford’s victory.

“House Republicans’ outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face,” Israel said. “Republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until election day.”

Israel’s Republican counterpart, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), congratulated Sanford, adding: “These results demonstrate just how devastating the policies of Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi are for House Democrats in 2014.”

(CNN) —

Democrat Terry McAuliffe, buoyed by strong results from voters in Northern Virginia, has defeated Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli in the race for Virginia’s governor, CNN projects.

While both campaigns took on national issues, such as the partial government shutdown earlier this year and the health care law’s flawed rollout, the race was nasty from the outset and devolved into incessant mudslinging and personal attacks. Voters throughout the commonwealth of Virginia were bombarded by negative ads.

Libertarian Robert Sarvis, a third-party candidate, has pulled in 7% of the vote with more than 90% of the vote counted. That’s a significant chunk when the Republican and Democratic candidates are so close.

McAuliffe will succeed Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who’s not running for re-election because Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms.

What might make results from Virginia – along with races including a gubernatorial contest in New Jersey, a race for mayor in New York City and a primary battle for a U.S. House seat in Alabama – most interesting is what they may tell us about 2014 midterms and the 2016 race for the White House.

5 things to know about this year’s most important race

Democrat Bill de Blasio has defeated Republican nominee Joe Lhota in the race for mayor of New York City, CNN projects, making the public advocate the first Democrat to lead the nation’s largest city in 20 years.

After de Blasio won the Democratic nomination in a crowded and circus-like field earlier this year, the liberal Democrat’s victory in the general election was never in question. All polls going into the election had de Blasio defeating Lhota in a landslide, with one released Monday indicating de Blasio was ahead of Lhota with likely voters by more than 40%.

Earlier Tuesday night, in another long-predicted result, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won four more years leading the Garden State by defeating Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono in the state’s gubernatorial race.

Christie’s victory became a forgone conclusion long before polls closed in New Jersey, as public opinion polls for months have indicated the tough-talking Republican headliner was far ahead of his Democratic challenger.

There are national implications to the race, too. With Christie considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, his re-election campaign is seen as a tuneup or stepping stone for that likely White House bid.

According to CNN exit polls of New Jersey voters, Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats. Early exit polls indicate the GOP governor grabbing 56% of the female vote, and winning all age groups other than those 18-29. Christie also took a fifth of the African-American vote and 45% of Latinos, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections.

Virginia and New Jersey are the only two states that hold elections for governor in the year after a presidential contest.

And as a more moderate Republican won in New Jersey and a conservative Republican lost in Virginia, the establishment candidate defeated the tea party candidate in a Republican primary runoff for a congressional seat from Alabama’s 1st district.

Bradley Byrne, a former state senator, defeated businessman Dean Young in the race, according to CNN projections. The contest was seen as a precursor to more intraparty fights ahead in primary elections for the 2014 midterms and was the first time Republican voters could weigh in on which direction they want to take their party after the partial federal government shutdown in October.

Here’s a closer look at some of the night’s most interesting races and ballot measures:

A nasty race in purple Virginia

The McAuliffe and Cuccinelli campaigns engaged in nasty political warfare that took over the airwaves in Virginia. McAuliffe made sure women were aware of Cuccinelli’s support of “personhood” legislation that critics say restricts abortion and some forms of birth control, while Cuccinelli frequently highlighted federal investigations of an electric car company that McAuliffe co-founded.

Both sides also attempted to frame the race as a referendum on larger national issues. Cuccinelli’s supporters argued a vote against McAuliffe was a vote against Obamacare.

McAuliffe and Democrats pinned Cuccinelli as a tea party activist, linking him to conservative lawmakers in Washington who initiated a strategy that eventually led to last month’s government shutdown.

What Christie’s 2013 re-election bid tells us about 2016

Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats.

Early exit polls indicate the GOP governor grabbing 55% of the female vote, and winning all age groups other than those 18 to 29. Christie also took one fifth of the African-American vote and half of the Latino vote, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections.

What Christie’s victory means for the next presidential race

NYC picks first Democratic mayor in a generation

At the center of the race were disagreements over taxes and the city’s controversial “stop-and-frisk” program backed by incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

De Blasio campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten, an idea Lhota vehemently opposed.

While Lhota painted himself as a fiscal conservative, he sought distance from national Republicans on social issues by reiterating his support of abortion rights and same-sex marriage.

De Blasio expected to win NYC mayoral race

Deep-pocketed Republicans pick winner in Alabama

Byrne, the establishment candidate, far outraised Young, the tea party candidate, thanks to major help from the business wing of the party, including the Chamber of Commerce. He also garnered endorsements from establishment figures, including several Republican House leaders.

In total, Byrne has raised nearly $700,000, with substantial donations from business community political action groups and individual business donors. Young, on the other hand, has raised $260,000 and has received donations from a political action committee run by former Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle, a darling of the tea party movement, as well as endorsements from conservative talk show hosts Mark Levin and Erick Erickson.

However, despite that support for smaller tea party personalities, Young was largely ignored by the national tea party groups. Tea Party Express, Club For Growth and FreedomWorks – three of the largest national tea party groups – sat on the sidelines of the intra-party fight.

Establishment beats tea party in Alabama runoff

Also on the ballot

New York is not the only major city holding a mayoral contest on Tuesday. Voters in Boston, Seattle, Detroit and Cleveland are also electing mayors.

And voters in six states will be weighing in on 31 ballot measures. Among the most interesting: genetically modified food labeling in Washington state, a proposed special marijuana tax in Colorado, secession in 11 Colorado counties and a push to raise New Jersey’s minimum wage to $8.25 per hour.

The fact that Chris Christie rolled to a second term in New Jersey and Terry McAuliffe won in Virginia wasn’t a surprise. Public opinion polls have consistently shown both men in the lead.

HUCKABEE: People do forget that. And by the way, [caller] know, that when you bring that up you get people who get crazy on us, and they’ll start saying, “Oh there you go comparing to the Nazis.” And I understand the reaction, but it’s the truth. You cannot take people’s rights away if they’re resisting and if they have the means to resist, but once they’re disarmed and the people who are trying to take over have all the power, not just political, not just financial, but they have the physical power to domesticate us and to subjugate us to our will there’s not a whole lot we can do about it other than just plan to die in the course of resistance. […] In every society and culture where dictators take over, one of the things they have to do is get control of the military and the police and ultimately all of the citizens and make sure the citizens are disarmed and can’t fight in the streets. Gosh I hope it doesn’t come to that.

Radio host and perennial ""prominent Republican"" Mike Huckabee is rapidly becoming what Rush Limbaugh used to be 20 years ago. (What Rush is now we'll leave as the topic for another time.) Here Huckabee is embracing the far-right militia logic of violence and conspiracy theories with open arms, and then some Getting the first thing out of the way, no, it's not true; the Nazi regime weakened gun regulations, it didn't strengthen them. That's a lost cause, however, as it's one of the conservative ""facts"" that will stick around until long after the fall of civilization itself, and even after that, as future alien archeologists will be finding primitive cave paintings of Hitler taking people's guns away and displaying them in their alien museums as the one of the few remaining artifacts of western culture. So we're just going to ignore that part.

What's more interesting to me is that Mike Huckabee, the once supposedly reasonable Republican, continues to peddle crackpot, militia-level conspiracy theories to his audience with no apparent shame—but gosh, I hope it doesn't come to that, he says. The core notion is that we need lots and lots of guns in case patriots need to start murdering the government, so it goes without saying that fighting off even the most basic of gun safety efforts is a noble, patriotic clause. The current rate of mass murders and other random killings aren't the symptom of a problem, in this mindset, they're just the necessary validation that the citizenry does indeed have enough access to high-powered weaponry to murder a very large number of people quickly if any single one of them feels like it. Forget talk of well-regulated; any talk of regulating the ability of any one random person to commit such acts is tantamount to nascent dictatorship.

These people, the ostentatiously Christian Mike Huckabee included, look to the prospect of potential mass murder against the government as a perfectly valid political position to have. They look to such acts as potential patriotism; others would call the same thing terrorism, but all terrorists consider themselves patriots for one cause or another. The rather unusual thing about this particular crowd is how circular the logic is. They need to be able to murder the government if the government appears to be taking actions that limit their ability to murder that government, and that's usually the extent of the argument. Not as a group, mind you, but as individual citizens, each making the decision as to what would require government assassinations on their own, based on their own internal logic, armed with enough firepower by themselves to inflict enough necessary ""damage"" to make their point.

That's now the advocated-for position among everything from conservative radio hosts to the National Rifle Association to any number of obviously unhinged, heavily armed YouTube video hosts. How is that not nuts?

At a time when almost everything Mrs. Clinton publicly says feeds presidential speculation, she has also used the speeches to address issues like the Arab Spring, the conflict in Syria and the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.

Mrs. Clinton does not make her speechmaking schedule public, but the trade groups typically publicize the events. A spokesman for the former first lady declined to comment.

But her political rivals have already started to keep tabs on her speaking schedule, looking for any hint of a conflict of interest. (So far, Mrs. Clinton’s staff appears to have carefully chosen where she has given speeches, avoiding paid talks to potentially controversial groups.)

“We’re starting immediately to monitor both Hillary and the other Democratic rising stars and collect, tag and characterize their speeches so we can hold them accountable when the campaign begins in earnest,” said Tim Miller, the executive director of America Rising, a conservative political action committee.

Mr. Miller said that it was too early to send operatives to covertly buy tickets to Mrs. Clinton’s speeches, but that the group was watching from a distance “to monitor whether she’s hobnobbing with investment bankers in New York City that might seem like favoritism down the line.”

Since Mrs. Clinton stepped down as secretary of state, she has divided her time between writing a memoir and juggling a growing schedule of engagements, paid and unpaid. The unpaid appearances are typically focused on her advocacy work for women and girls as part of the Clinton Foundation, the charitable organization founded by her husband. (She is not completely avoiding politics, and will campaign for Terry McAuliffe, a family friend who is running for governor of Virginia.)"

USA TODAY

Don't touch Dante de Blasio's Afro.

The 16-year-old Brooklyn Tech student is being credited with giving his father, Bill de Blasio, a big boost in New York City mayor's race. The elder de Blasio was the top vote-getter in Tuesday's Democratic primary and is slightly above the 40% support he needs to avoid a runoff with William Thompson. The winner will face Republican Joe Lhota on Nov. 5.

Dante, with his big smile and even bigger hair, starred in a campaign commercial that helped push de Blasio and the candidate's message of ending economic inequality for New Yorkers to the top of the Democratic field.

""Bill de Blasio will be a mayor for every New Yorker and I'd say that even if he weren't my dad,"" Dante proudly says in the TV ad.

Nearly 6 in 10 registered Democrats, or 59%, who saw the ad said they liked Bill de Blasio even more after seeing it, a poll by NBC News 4/Wall Street Journal/Marist Institute for Public Opinion showed.

Dante, his hairdo and his dad's strength at the ballot box have combined into one social media phenomenon: the Twitter hashtag #fromentum.

Chiara de Blasio, the candidate's 18-year-old daughter, joked about her little brother's emerging fame while managing to put him in his place. ""My brother ... may look good on TV, but there's only one de Blasio who got to vote for her dad today,"" she said at the candidate's primary night party.

But it was Papa de Blasio who had the best line, celebrating not only his daughter but his son as well.

""In her enthusiasm Chiara just attempted to touch the hair,"" de Blasio joked. ""Security was ready to intervene.""

At a conservative conference earlier in the year, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, ridiculed the 2016 Democratic field as “a rerun of ‘The Golden Girls,’ ” referring to Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is 70.

And Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, seizing on the Fleetwood Mac song that became a Clinton family anthem, quipped to an audience in Washington, “If you want to keep thinking about tomorrow, maybe it’s time to put somebody new in.”

The 2016 election may be far off, but one theme is becoming clear: Republican strategists and presidential hopefuls, in ways subtle and overt, are eager to focus a spotlight on Mrs. Clinton’s age. The former secretary of state will be 69 by the next presidential election, a generation removed from most of the possible Republican candidates."

It has been a disheartening experience. In fairness to House Republicans, there is little one legislative chamber can do to affect the direction of the federal government. The tools they do have, however, they have often declined to use. Paul’s filibuster of the Brennan nomination on Wednesday, however, showed the emergence of a new opposition to Obama. Based in the Senate, it is providing the American public a stark contrast to Obama’s ever-expanding government.

Paul’s filibuster was not based on a traditional partisan issue. Its goal was simply to clarify that the President did not have the authority to assassinate American citizens, on domestic soil, who are suspected of cooperating with terrorists. Such clarity ought not require a 13 hour filibuster. The event, however, exposed the public to a reasoned articulation of conservative, constitutional principles. It was a brilliant counter-point to Obama’s doctrine of expanding government power in every direction.

On Friday, Sen. Marco Rubio joined Sen. Ted Cruz in announcing his opposition to any continuing resolution funding the government that didn’t also defund ObamaCare. House Republicans have long since given up this fight, passing a continuing resolution this week that continues to fund ObamaCare’s expansion. Sixteen House Republicans bucked their leadership and opposed the move, but enough Democrats joined Republicans to pass the measure.

With this week’s moves, the center of political gravity has shifted to an emerging band of leaders in the Senate. Sens. Paul, Rubio, and Cruz are providing the nucleus of a new and robust conservative opposition to the Obama Administration. They will likely lose most of their battles. Unlike House Republicans, however, they understand that their primary responsibility is to articulate to the American public an alternative vision for the country. It requires one to pick an occasional battle and present one’s case to the public.

House Republicans are obsessive about “governing,” even though they lack the levers of power to do so. They would rather put off an ideological fight on principle in order to pass legislation. This may make sense tactically, but strategically it’s a losing bet. Worse, it denies the American public a clear choice. A party ought to articulate why it should be entrusted with legislative power.

Sens. Paul, Rubio and Cruz understand this. They are providing the tip of the spear ahead of the 2014 midterms. Based on initial responses to Paul’s filibuster this week, they will have an army behind them.

http://news.yahoo.com/happens-no-one-wins-presidential-election-110211060.html,,[],What happens when no one wins a presidential election?,"We don’t talk a lot about the 12th Amendment at the National Constitution Center, but today marks a milestone that is an important part of the Constitution: It allows Congress to settle disputed presidential elections.

The first test of the 12th Amendment came on December 1, 1824, when the period for choosing electors for the Electoral College ended, and it became clear that a candidate wouldn’t have a majority of the votes needed to become president.

The 12th Amendment was ratified 20 years earlier to put a clear procedure in place after the tumultuous election of 1800.

The Constitution’s original provision for electing a president and vice president didn’t last more than a decade. The bitter 1800 election between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams left Jefferson in an election tie—with his own running mate, Aaron Burr.

Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution required electors in states to cast two ballots. There wasn’t a separate vote for vice president, and it was up to the political parties to coordinate among their electors to make sure vice presidential candidates had at least one fewer electoral vote than presidential candidates.

The Federalist Party did just that, making sure one elector voted for John Jay and ensuring that Adams had the most votes from his party. Jefferson wasn’t as attentive, leaving him in a tie with Burr.

The contingent runoff election between Jefferson and Burr was a true constitutional crisis. Jefferson ultimately won the House election on the 36th ballot after a week of voting. Alexander Hamilton, Jefferson’s long-time enemy, supported Jefferson instead of his old rival from New York, Burr.

And the 12th Amendment quickly followed. It was written, approved in Congress and ratified within three years, so that it was in effect for the 1804 election. The next amendment to the Constitution wouldn’t be ratified until December 1865.

The 12th Amendment made sure separate ballots were cast in the Electoral College for president and vice president; the House would settle an election without a majority winner with a contingent election featuring the top three vote getters; and the House would determine rules for conducting the election.

Story continues

Twenty years later, Congress found itself in position to settle another presidential election that involved an Adams.

In this case, it was John Quincy Adams, who was one of four candidates who received electoral votes in a bitterly contested 1824 election much like the 1800 race involving his father.

During the eight years prior to the 1824 race, political partisanship was at an all-time low. In the “Era Of Good Feelings,” President James Monroe ran basically unopposed for re-election in 1820.

But the unity inside the Democratic-Republicans, the one remaining political party in the United States, crumbled as the issues of slavery, states’ rights, regionalism, and the economy drove wedges between former comrades.

Two of the candidates had been in Monroe’s nonpartisan cabinet: Secretary of State Adams and Treasury Secretary William Crawford. Andrew Jackson was the hero of the War of 1812, while Henry Clay of Kentucky was the powerful speaker of the House of Representatives.

In the general election, Jackson led on December 2, 1824 with 99 electoral votes, but he needed 131 to win the presidency. Clay came in fourth with 37 electoral votes, which was enough to cost Jackson the election.

Under the provisions of the 12th Amendment, the election in the House involved the top three vote getters: Jackson, Adams, and Crawford (who also had suffered a stroke during the election campaign).

A lame-duck Congress was left with the task of selecting a new president over the next two months. (A vice presidential candidate, John C. Calhoun, has easily won a majority of ballots.)

It was Clay, like Hamilton in 1800, who interceded to decide the House election, in favor of the New Englander, Adams. Clay secured enough votes for Adams to win on the first House ballot on February 9, 1825, despite Jackson’s wide lead in the popular vote.

The 12th Amendment worked. It allowed the House to adopt rules about conducting the vote that became a precedent, and a winner was selected on the first ballot. Each state had one vote in the process.

But what happened next had a longer-term effect on the American political system.

Adams appointed Clay as Secretary of State, which was the second-highest position in 1824 politics, and the usual job held by the favorite to become the next president.

The anger of Jackson and his supporters about the “corrupt bargain” led to the official formation of the Democratic Party, with Jackson as its leader. Jackson won the 1828 presidential election and the two-party system that dominates current American politics was born.

After Jackson’s re-election in 1832, the remaining political factions united to form the Whig Party, to oppose the Democrats.

In an interesting footnote to history, the 1824 election wasn’t the only contest settled by the 12th Amendment. In 1837, Martin Van Buren won the election to replace Jackson as president, but there was dissent within the Democratic Party about the vice presidential candidate, Richard Mentor Johnson. During the Electoral College voting, 23 faithless electors refused to vote for Johnson.

According to the 12th Amendment, a contested vice presidential election is decided by the Senate. In February 1837, the Senate chose Johnson over a Whig rival, in a runoff election.

If at first you don’t succeed, try to change the rules.

A proposal under consideration in Virginia’s Republican-led state Legislature would change how the commonwealth allocates its 13 electoral votes in the wake of Democratic President Barack Obama’s re-election last November.

Obama won the popular vote in the crucial battleground state to claim all 13 electoral votes, even though GOP challenger Mitt Romney beat him in seven of the 11 congressional districts.

Under the proposed alternative system, electoral votes would get divvied up by congressional districts won. In addition, Virginia’s two other electoral votes – one for each U.S. Senate seat – would go to the candidate who won the most congressional districts.

If the district-based system had been in effect in Virginia last year, Romney would have gotten nine electoral votes to four for Obama.

Jindal urges GOP to stop being ‘stupid’

While a subcommittee has advanced the Virginia proposal, skepticism expressed by some GOP state senators raised doubts that it would proceed any further.

Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, does not support the plan, according to his spokesman.

“He believes Virginia’s existing system works just fine as it is. He does not believe there is any need for a change,” Tucker Martin said in statement.

However, Reince Priebus, newly re-elected chairman of the Republican National Committee, called the idea worth examining.

“I think it is a state issue, but personally I’m pretty intrigued by it,” he told reportersFriday.

Opinion: Where the stupidity really lies

The state party chairman in Florida, Lenny Curry, questioned the wisdom of such a move at a time when the party is trying to broaden its support.

“It seems to me we ought to be focused on connecting with voters and bringing them into our party versus trying to change the game,” Curry said.

To Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst at RealClearPolitics, the concept doesn’t violate democratic principles, but he called it a bad idea.

“Close elections would likely always result in extensive recounts, we could see huge disparities between the popular and electoral vote, and the partisan motive behind it would be transparent,” he wrote Friday on the group’s website.

Currently, only Nebraska and Maine use a district-based plan for allocating electoral votes.

Their systems differ from the Virginia proposal by awarding the two additional electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote, rather than who won the most districts. Last year, both split their electoral votes between Obama and Romney.

Other GOP-controlled state legislatures reportedly contemplating changes to their electoral vote allocation include Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.

Under the Electoral College system, each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population. Winning the presidency requires a majority of the electoral vote, regardless of who wins the popular vote.

States have the power to decide how their electoral votes get allocated, the National Conference of State Legislatures noted on its website.

It cited a similar push for change after the 2000 election, when Democratic Vice President Al Gore won the national popular vote but lost the electoral vote, and therefore the decision, to Republican George W. Bush.

From 2001 to 2006, bills proposing adoption of the district system were introduced in many states, but failed to pass, according to the NCSL website. Both Maine and Nebraska adopted their district-based systems before 2000.

The issue reflects the regionalization of America’s deep partisan divide, with splits in many states between populous urban areas that tend to be more liberal and larger, less populated rural areas that generally are more conservative.

In Virginia, Obama got strong support in two heavily populated northern districts close to Washington as well as a district that includes much of Richmond and Norfolk. Romney won more rural districts in the central, southern and western parts of the state.

Overall in Virginia, Obama got 51% of the total vote – more than 1.97 million – compared to Romney’s 1.82 million for 47% of the total.

(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)

Republican Patrick Mara is pushing back against criticism of his support for Mitt Romney in last year’s presidential race, saying his endorsement pales in comparison to those made by Democratic candidates.

In an interview this week, Mara stood by his endorsement of Romney, saying he knew the 2012 GOP presidential nominee was never going to carry the District’s three electoral votes.

“We all knew he wasn’t going to win in the District of Columbia, but supporting him was an important part of growing a two-party system in the District of Columbia and growing a check and balance,” said Mara, who served as a Romney delegate at last year’s GOP national convention and contributed money to his campaign.

Mara faces five other candidates in the April 23 special election for an at-large seat on the D.C. Council. Several of the other candidates, including incumbent Anita Bonds (D-At large) and Democrat Elissa Silverman, have questioned whether Mara’s past support for Romney proves he’s out of touch with the city’s heavily Democratic electorate.

Mara shot back this week by accusing Silverman of endorsing former council chairman Kwame R. Brown and council member Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) when she wrote the City Paper’s Loose Lips column in 2004.

“She has endorsed a whole bunch of people, and that impacts a heck of lot more people than being a delegate for Mitt Romney,” Mara said. “The folks who supported [politicians] locally have done a lot more harm to the District than Mitt Romney has.”

But it’s debatable whether Silverman really supported Brown, who resigned last year after pleading guilty to bank fraud, and Barry in 2004.

According to a review of Silverman’s past writings, she urged readers to support Brown in the general election. But in the Democratic primary earlier that year, Silverman was sharply critical of Brown and urged readers to support his opponent, Sam Brooks.

“In the election that really counted, I didn’t endorse Kwame,” Silverman said in an interview.

Mara’s charge that Silverman supported Barry also appears questionable. In the primary that year, Silverman wrote she “cannot support another Barry comeback, and neither should Ward 8 voters.” But after Barry won the primary, Silverman made what appears to be a light-hearted endorsement of the former mayor.

Barry was running against Republican Cardell Shelton, a perennial candidate with a thin record.

“LL picks unfit over absurd,” Silverman wrote.

Despite that back-handed nod to Barry, Silverman blasted Mara’s attempt to tie her to him.

“This is him trying to deflect off Pat Mara being a true Republican, not a liberal, fiscally sound one,” Silverman said. “There are plenty of Republicans I know who voted for Barack Obama because they did not think Mitt Romney reflected their Republican Party, but Pat helped get Mitt Romney on the ballot.”

Chuck Hagel, filibustered Republican nominee.

The Senate is going to take a second stab at a confirmation vote for former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to be defense secretary next Tuesday, and indications are that this time Republicans won't have the votes to sustain their filibuster. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) will vote for Hagel on Tuesday. Damning him with faint praise, Shelby told thethat Hagel is ""probably as good as we're going to get,"" in announcing his vote switch.

What else could Republicans really do at this point, particularly after the national humiliation of the ""Friends of Hamas"" debacle? There is a diehard corps of Republicans, though, that don't seem to get that they've made themselves public laughingstocks, and who just aren't capable of being embarrassed into backing down. That would be the 15 who wrote a letter to President Obama demanding that he withdraw the nomination. They include Lindsey ""I'm a tea partier! Really!"" Graham, Jim ""Hamas is like the Salvation Army"" Inhofe, and Ted ""Calgary"" Cruz who, and this is true, has a list of the communists who have infiltrated Harvard Law School. Oh, and 2016's would-be golden boy, Marco Rubio.

But with Shelby moving on, the gig is up. Republicans Thad Cochran, Mike Johanns, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted with Democrats last week to end cloture, and very likely will again. With all 55 Democrats, that's all she wrote. Even John McCain appears to know that enough is enough, and is ready to give up and vote for cloture. If there are already enough Republican votes to get it done, though, McCain will probably just be pissy enough to vote no. Because that's just who he is.

The pointless delay of Hagel's confirmation has accomplished a few things about Republicans, however. First, no matter how outlandish the story, if Breitbart reports it, they'll run with it. Second, these are the people who have de facto control over the Senate! They'll filibuster anything on the flimsiest of grounds, just because the can, new filibuster rules be damned.

That still has to change. If you haven't already, please sign our petition urging Harry Reid to re-open the process of filibuster reform in the Senate."

(Pete Souza/The White House)

The White House is considering nominating a top female official at the Treasury Department to fill one of the vacant seats at the Federal Reserve, according to two people familiar with the process, amid criticism over the role of women in the Obama administration.

As undersecretary for international affairs, Lael Brainard is one of the most highly ranked — and most visible — female members of President Obama’s economic team. Her name has long been circulated in the insular world of Fed watchers as a potential candidate to sit on the central bank’s influential board of governors.

But her conversations with the administration have ramped up recently, and she is seriously considering accepting the nomination, according to the two people, who requested anonymity to discuss personnel issues. The White House declined to comment.

Brainard’s nomination could help solve a public-relations problem for the White House, which has been assailed over the lack of women in premier posts. Obama is weighing whether to name Lawrence H. Summers, a close former adviser, to the top job at the Fed — a move that would mean passing over Janet Yellen, the vice chair at the central bank whom many once considered a shoo-in.

That has turned what typically has been an uncontroversial appointment into a political lightning rod. The National Organization for Women has decried what it called a “sexist whispering campaign” against Yellen, and 20 Senate Democrats, including key members of the banking committee, sent a letter to the White House urging Obama to appoint her. Summers also has been dogged by accusations of gender bias after suggesting while he was president of Harvard University in 2005 that women were not as talented as men in math and science, a statement he later called an act of “spectacular imprudence.”

In addition to naming a new chair for the Fed, Obama could fill up to four seats on the central bank’s board. Two of them were held by women: Fed governor Elizabeth A. Duke resigned last month, and governor Sarah Bloom Raskin has been nominated as deputy secretary at Treasury. Governor Jerome H. (Jay) Powell’s term ends in January, but he could continue serving. If Yellen is not nominated for the top job, she is not expected to stay at the Fed. (Another top female official, Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto, is retiring in January, but her successor will be selected by the bank’s board of directors.)

Brainard worked under White House economic adviser Gene Sperling when he served in that role in the Clinton administration. She then moved to the Brookings Institution to work on global development issues before returning to Treasury in 2010 as the agency’s highest-ranking woman at the time. As the head of the department’s international affairs division, she has been on the front lines dealing with the European crisis, pushing for tough requirements before debt-saddled countries are thrown financial lifelines.

Brainard’s confirmation for her Treasury post in 2010 was delayed by concerns over late payments of property taxes. She was eventually confirmed in a bipartisan vote.

Obama could nominate at least one more woman to the central bank. The two people, who are also familiar with Brainard’s consideration for the Fed, said Janice C. Eberly, a former senior economist at the Treasury and now a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, is also under consideration. But they were unsure how far the discussions at the White House over Eberly had progressed.

It was also unclear whether the announcements would be made at the same time Obama names his pick to lead the Fed. That decision is expected in the coming weeks, though the escalating turmoil in Syria could delay it.

Story highlights Benjamin Jealous: Rand Paul's attempt to heal rift between blacks and GOP fell short He says if GOP wants to draw black votes, it can start by committing to civil rights One way is criminal justice reform, Jealous says Jealous: Sentencing reform, education would bring down spending. GOP, get on board

Editor’s Note: Benjamin Todd Jealous is president and CEO of the NAACP.

(CNN) —

Earlier this month Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) visited Howard University to take a swing at repairing relations between African Americans and the Republican Party.

As famed sportscaster Harry Kalas would have said, it was largely a swing and a miss.

Paul struck out when he tried to equate today’s Republican Party with the party of Abraham Lincoln, while ignoring much of the 150 years in between. (He even acknowledged his mistakes shortly after). But his willingness to step up to the plate can provide a lesson for a GOP struggling to get on top.

Republicans will not win black votes by paying lip service to party history while attacking social programs and voting rights. But they can make inroads by showing a commitment to civil rights, something Paul managed to do briefly in his remarks.

Paul received applause when he told the Howard crowd, “We should not have drug laws or a court system that disproportionately punishes the black community.” He illustrated using one issue where the GOP can connect with black voters: criminal justice reform.

Benjamin Todd Jealous

Just before the 2012 elections, the NAACP took a nonpartisan survey of black voters in key swing states. We found that 55% of African Americans believe Republicans “don’t care at all about civil rights” while another 32% think the party “just says what minorities want to hear.” But 14% said they would be more likely to vote for a Republican in the future, if they found a candidate who demonstrated a strong commitment to civil rights.

Mass incarceration is a fundamental civil rights issue. African Americans make up 40% of the 2.4 million people in America’s bloated prison system. That includes the vast majority of those in prison for nonviolent drug offenses. If current trends continue, one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during his life.

As Paul demonstrated, mass incarceration is also a fundamental conservative issue. State spending on prisons has tripled over the last 30 years, reaching $70 billion in 2008. Federal prisons are at 139% capacity, often thanks to harsh mandatory minimum sentences. And who pays for all these guards, beds and three square meals a day? Taxpayers.

In fact, some red states have led the way on criminal justice reform. In Georgia, South Carolina and Texas, Republican legislatures have teamed up with progressives to increase options for parole and reduce mandatory minimums. In Texas, the NAACP and progressive activists worked with leaders of the Tea Party to pass a dozen reform measures. Last year, Texas scheduled the first prison closure in state history.

Rand Paul is not the first national Republican leader to speak up, either. Newt Gingrich and Jeb Bush are both members of the conservative think tank Right on Crime. And in 2011, Gingrich joined Grover Norquist and other unlikely allies - including Mike Jiminez, the president of California’s prison guard union – to endorse the NAACP’s report, Misplaced Priorities: Over Incarcerate, Under Educate. The report revealed how the rise in prison spending has caused states to spend less on education.

These alliances should draw the attention of Republican leaders. Many Democrats shy away from talking about criminal justice reform, for fear of being labeled “soft on crime.” According to the NAACP’s election survey, 42% of African American voters believe the Democratic Party is failing them on criminal justice. The GOP has a chance to fill the leadership vacuum and demonstrate their civil rights bona fides.

Paul is poised to lead the conversation on criminal justice reform. At Howard he touted the “Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013,” which he recently introduced with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, the Democratic senator from Vermont. The bill would allow federal judges to bypass federal mandatory minimum sentences if the sentence is too lengthy or if it simply does not fit the crime.

Paul told students that his friends called him “either brave or crazy” for showing up at Howard University, a statement that says more about his friends than the audience at Howard. Nonetheless, Paul and his Republican Party would display true bravery, and political savvy, by taking this opportunity to walk Lincoln’s walk and take on the new Jim Crow.

Moving from “tough on crime” to “smart on crime” would be good for this country. It would also be a smart move for the Republican Party if they ever hope to get on base with black voters.

Public Campaign Action Fund, a campaign finance reform advocacy group, and USAction, a progressive grassroots advocacy group, are purchasing air time in three Kentucky media markets beginning Friday and running through Oct. 13. The ads aim to challenge McConnell to explain his opposition to campaign finance restrictions.

""The ad is intended to get a response out of McConnell about why he thinks unlimited campaign contributions are the way to go,"" said Public Campaign Action Fund executive director David Donnelly.

McConnell's lawyer has been allowed time to argue before the Supreme Court for the elimination of campaign contribution limits on Oct. 8 in the McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission case.

The McCutcheon case challenges the aggregate limit on contributions by an individual donor. For the 2014 election, an individual donor may give $123,200 in total to candidates, parties and political action committees -- a limit the McCutcheon case threatens to overturn.

McConnell's argument before the Supreme Court will challenge the court's longtime distinction between campaign contributions and campaign spending. The court ruled in the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo case that campaign spending restrictions violate First Amendment free speech rights. But the court found that limits on campaign contributions are constitutional. Contribution limits have been upheld in every major campaign finance case since.

Donnelly said campaign finance reform groups may have failed to adequately stir public interest before the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allows unlimited campaign contributions. He said McConnell's role in the McCutcheon case is a chance to bring attention to the issue.

""We need to sound the alarm earlier, and engaging in a debate with Sen. McConnell is probably the best way to raise the stakes on this,"" Donnelly said.

The ads are not designed to take sides in McConnell's reelection. McConnell faces a GOP primary challenge from Matt Bevin. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is the leading Democratic candidate in the general election.

Still, Donnelly said McConnell's campaign finance views are likely to become a campaign issue.

""I can't imagine how it won't be,"" Donnelly said. ""Arguing before the high court that we should have no campaign limits whatsoever. Someone predicted the race will be $100 million. What will it be with no limits? It's just outrageous."""

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/ten-ways-republicans-want-change-next-election-105724986--election.html,,[],Ten ways Republicans want to change before the next election,"Growth & Opportunity Project

Within a month after last year's presidential election, the Republican National Committee launched a massive project to diagnose the problems that contributed to the party's defeat. Now, the final draft of the ""Growth & Opportunity Project"" is here and, as promised, it's a behemoth.

The RNC on Monday released the findings of the three-month project led by a group of veteran Republican strategists that propose ways the party can improve its outreach to minorities, the primary election process, messaging, fundraising and its relationship with third-party groups.

The dense, 100-page report includes 219 recommendations that are a result of input from about 36,000 online surveys, thousands of conference calls and personal meetings with the project's co-chairs, more than 50 focus groups, 3,000 listening sessions in nine states and the District of Columbia, and surveys targeting the views of women, Hispanics, pollsters, consultants, campaign volunteers and field staff.

Below are 10 lessons the Republican Party learned from its exhaustive search—and what it plans to do about it.

1. Sustain outreach to minority communities, even in years without elections



From the report:

We need to do a better job connecting people to our policies. Our ideas can sound distant and removed from people’s lives. Instead of connecting with voters’ concerns, we too often sound like bookkeepers. ... If we believe our policies are the best ones to improve the lives of the American people, all the American people, our candidates and office holders need to do a better job talking in normal, people-oriented terms, and we need to go to communities where Republicans do not normally go to listen and make our case. We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate that we care about them, too.

The RNC will devote $10 million to hire hundreds of new employees in communities across the country who will have a permanent presence. The project will focus on neighborhoods with heavy black, Hispanic and Asian populations to sustain relationships with those communities in years with and without elections and establish new, senior-level advisory councils for those voters.

Story continues

The party is also preparing an ""aggressive marketing campaign"" at historically black colleges and universities.

2. Recruit more minority Republican candidates

The RNC is launching an ambitious campaign that partners with state parties to build a recruitment program for minority candidates. The party also will hire communication specialists to work with Republican minority leaders to maximize their voice in the media.

3. Don't be afraid of going on 'The Daily Show'

To better reach young voters, the report recommends that Republicans get their candidates on more shows in popular culture and tap into the power of celebrity endorsements.

From the report:

Establish an RNC Celebrity Task Force of personalities in the entertainment industry to host events for the RNC and allow donors to participate in entertainment events as a way to attract younger voters. ... Republican leaders should participate in and actively prepare for interviews with The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, MTV and magazines such as People, UsWeekly, etc., as well as radio stations that are popular with the youth demographic.

4. Give Democratic candidates hell, and dish it early

One of President Barack Obama's re-election campaign's greatest successes was defining Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney early in the election. It was very difficult for Romney to shake that image of him as an out-of-touch rich boss by the time the Obama campaign was done with him.

The report recommends establishing an outside group ""that focuses solely on research"" of Republican opponents to ""define Democrats early in election cycles."" They want to see conservative groups tracking Democratic candidates' every move, while building websites that do ""nothing but post inappropriate Democrat utterances and act as a clearinghouse for information on Democrats.""

5. Train new Republican activists with online and mobile campaign education programs



Republicans will build a mobile voter registration program that makes it easier for voters to register online. For those who want to become actively involved in the party, the RNC is overhauling its Political Education Department to teach activists how to better use voter data and buy political ads on television and online. All of those resources will be made available on the Web.

6. Release the voter data



The Republican Party has billions of pieces of voter data that it plans to make available to friendly vendors and campaigns in a way that allows them to create new apps and programs based on the information.

The RNC hopes to integrate voter data into everything it does—from fundraising to door-to-door canvassing—to ensure every decision is more calculated and results are measurable.

The party plans to establish a new field office near Silicon Valley to have close access with tech firms, while holding ""hackathons"" in ""tech-savvy cities"" to ensure it remains up to date on the latest technologies.

7. Shrink the primary



If you thought the Republican primary process felt like it lasted forever, well, so did the top brass at the Republican Party. Next time, the RNC will compress the Republican primary season to a few months in 2016 so the candidates don't have to spend so much money and resources battling each other.

8. Hold fewer primary debates



Before Republicans chose a presidential candidate in 2012, they held more than 20 debates. Never again. The RNC will conduct only about a dozen debates that will begin no earlier than September 2015.

""While we were playing footsie debating each other 23 times, what was the other side doing? They were spending potentially hundreds of millions of dollars on data, technology, voter outreach,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""They were getting the job done.""

Indeed, many of the Republican primary candidates' most embarrassing moments occurred on debate stages across the country.

9. Adios, August convention

As part of the emphasis on securing a presidential candidate earlier in the primary process, the Republican National Convention will be held in June or July. That will allow the party and the campaign to coordinate sooner and, along with outside groups, help the candidate build more momentum before the November election.

10. Change the tone, but not the message

Republicans believe they have a communication problem, not a message problem. While the Growth and Opportunity Project was never meant to be a policy document, there appears to be no movement in the direction of shifting principles in the near future. “I don’t think our platform is the issue,” Priebus said during a stop on his listening tour in Iowa earlier this month.

http://news.yahoo.com/george-p-bush-starts-small-amid-high-expectations-122933798.html,,[],George P. Bush starts small amid high expectations,"FRISCO, Texas (AP) — On a recent evening, George P. Bush was telling a packed room of wealthy North Texans how he got his start in politics. It was May 1979 and the then 3-year-old was in a Houston park, clutching a balloon and watching his grandfather, George H.W. Bush, announce his first campaign for president.

""It was my first memory,"" Bush recalled. ""I was wearing a George P. Bush, er, uh, George H.W. Bush for President T-shirt.""

Drowned out temporarily by laughter, Bush insisted it wasn't a Freudian flub. An aide approached a reporter scribbling notes and jokingly commanded: ""Stop writing!""

The light moment underscores the dilemma of the latest scion of an American political dynasty.

How does Bush keep his family's powerful past from overwhelming his present? How can he ease into his first campaign for elected office amid lofty expectations that he will help save a Republican Party in Texas that's endangered by the state's booming Latino population?

Bush, 37, says he's more than just a famous surname. Both his grandfather and uncle were presidents; his father, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, may run for the White House in 2016.

George P. Bush is running for state land commissioner, a post unfamiliar to most Texans, because he says it best suits his skills, not because it could launch him to bigger things in the largest Republican-leaning state.

""It's a legacy that I embrace and that I'm not going to run away from,"" Bush told The Associated Press in an interview during a recent visit to the affluent Dallas suburb of Frisco. ""But certainly, in this campaign, I have to identify myself and talk about my own track record.""

That isn't always easy.

People want to know how often he calls assorted relatives for advice and what sleeping at the White House was like. Political observers wonder if the Spanish-speaker who offers a unique blend of Republican royalty and Hispanic heritage can slow what looks like Texas' inevitable demographic slide toward a Democratic-leaning state. His mother, Columba, is from Mexico.

Story continues

Jeremy Bird, who helped President Barack Obama win re-election last year by using data analysis to tailor voter mobilization to the most promising areas, helped tilt Nevada and Colorado to the Democrats in the 2012 presidential race. Now, Bird and other Obama veterans are leading Battleground Texas, a group that hopes to do the same thing in Texas.

""This is something not to be taken lightly. It's a well-capitalized, well-financed group that's intent on developing a long term strategy. That's problematic,"" Bush said. ""It's going to require more for candidates like myself and people from the party to step up their game. Not necessarily change our principles, but change our tactics.""

He said Republicans will have to recruit more Spanish-speakers, campaign more frequently along Texas' border with Mexico, and improve their youth outreach on college campuses and via social media.

Bush said he considers himself an asset to the party's Hispanic outreach efforts. But he also said the GOP's long-term strategy cannot simply be running more bilingual candidates.

""I've been asked whether knowing Spanish and being Hispanic myself is a positive in getting Hispanic voters and I don't believe it is,"" he said. ""I think Hispanics look for a friend, they look for someone who understands, whose willing to relate, to hear their issues and welcome them to the party and to their campaigns. That's what we're doing.""

Bush's campaign style, though, has been criticized by some as uncomfortable, and his stump speeches occasionally can sound canned.

""I'm not running for office to be somebody but really just to do something. ... This isn't about making a statement. It's about making a difference,"" he told about 600 homeowners and GOP activists who crowded into the clubhouse of a new Frisco subdivision.

Bush has raised $3.3 million since November even though no Democratic candidate has emerged for land commissioner.

A Democrat hasn't won any of Texas' 29 statewide offices since 1994, the nation's longest streak of single-party dominance. But Hispanics accounted for two-thirds of Texas' population growth over the past decade and now make up 35 percent of its population. They tend to vote Democratic, with Obama capturing 71 percent of the Latino vote nationwide last year.

Closer to home, no Republican represents any majority Hispanic district in the Legislature, even though the GOP holds sizable majorities in the House and Senate. The only Hispanic ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Texas, Ted Cruz, is a Republican whose father was born in Cuba. Many top GOP leaders are counting on him and Bush to remake the party's image with Hispanics.

Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, scoffs at that.

""How is it,"" he asked, ""that these people think that if they're fortunate to be born to a Hispanic mother and are of Hispanic heritage, that gives them the right to have the support of the Hispanic community?""

Bush said Hispanics ""don't vote in a monolith."" He sidestepped questions about national issues such as immigration, choosing to focus on the responsibilities of the land commissioner. The office oversees vast oil and mineral rights which help fund public education. It also administers benefits to military veterans.

""This is an office I've had my heart on for years,"" Bush said. ""I'm a former educator, a veteran and I have a strong energy and asset background. This is kind of what I'm excited about.""

Born in Houston, Bush grew up in Florida, where his father was governor from 1998 until 2007. He graduated from and played baseball for Rice University in Houston before teaching school in inner-city Miami and working on George W. Bush's presidential campaign.

He earned a law degree from the University of Texas and clerked for a federal judge, then later founded a capital company in Fort Worth. In 2010, he served an eight-month tour in Afghanistan with U.S. Naval Intelligence.

Bush is on the board of Uplift Education, a major charter school operator in North Texas, and is a strong proponent of school choice for all families. On June 3, his wife Amanda gave birth to the couple's first child, Prescott, and Bush joked that he was looking forward to his son carrying on the family tradition ... of playing baseball at Rice.

Most everyone else, though, is interested in another family tradition.

""You just don't know about political dynasties,"" said Sharon Born, a 66-year-old flight attendant who chatted with Bush at the Frisco event. ""But on the other side we might have Hillary (Clinton) after Bill, and then Chelsea. So, I'll take the Bushes."""

prev Image 2 of 2

Ship of State Obama (conveniently SOS Obama) is sailing forward Monday on the next leg of its journey amidst battles over guns, immigration, debt and pretty much everything else. The big question is whether the media will continue to serve as crew for another four years.

That has been the policy for the first cruise. Capt. Obama, who seems to have learned the trade from Queeg, Bligh, and Hook, set sail pretending to chart a neutral course. The actual path was far different. Four years under Obama have been reminiscent of a pirate voyage and not the Caribbean kind with Johnny Depp playing a quasi-good guy.

No, it’s been all a plunder-the-rich, take-no-prisoners trip infuriating close to half the American population – just none of them in the news media. Obama didn’t have to press gang any of them to get on board. Journalists signed up to serve king and country, especially the king part. It didn’t matter whether it was taxes, Libya, Fast & Furious or gun control (er, “gun violence”), the media have followed Obama like he is their personal master and commander-in-chief.

Let’s talk a little mutiny and remind journalists they don’t have to jump when the captain says so, they can jump ship. Had they tried that, we might have heard more about some of these stories and many more.

• The Choom Gang: Even when we found Bill Clinton was one toke over the line, some in the media actually covered it. When the Post’s David Marianiss revealed that the president hadn’t just inhaled, but that he’d been a full-fledged Hollywood-teen-flick-style stoner, the media briefly noted it and moved on. Little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin gets the VP nod and half the American media descend on the tundra. Obama runs for president and major news organizations believe his autobiographies like they were divine writ.

• The Other Phony Girlfriend: Long before Notre Dame’s Manti Te'o redefined the term incomplete pass, it was Obama’s dating life that was fictional. In one of the most entertaining revelations of the Marianiss book, we learned Obama’s autobiography “Dreams From My Father,” was heavy on “dreams.” “;Obama acknowledged that, while Genevieve was his New York girlfriend, the description in his memoir was a ‘compression’ of girlfriends,” quoted Politico. Ironically, after these revelations, Marianiss grew concerned the right was using his book to show “all the things in Obama's autobiography which are not true.” Horrors!

• The Transparent Lie: When Obama took office, he promised “transparency.” There’s even a memo to that effect on the White House website. Reality has been far different. Team Obama has fought the press, opposed document releases even after the fact, and helped keep newsies out of the oil disaster area in the Gulf after the BP spill. Had any Republican president treated the media that way, he’d have been skewered. With Obama, journalists mocked slightly and continued to support his every move. The liberal Politico sarcastically called the administration the “Most transparent White House ever,” for one of its endless anti-press efforts.

• Freedom of What? Under the Obama administration, freedom of religion has become hotly contested and often litigated. The idea about faith and “prohibiting the free exercise thereof ”; has gone out the stained-glass window. Catholic groups and businesses from the church to companies like Hobby Lobby are fighting against new healthcare mandates that force them to violate their faith. That controversy and what it likely means to 75 million Catholics got almost no coverage from secular journos bent on sweeping it under the pew. Reporters were too bashing Chick-fil-A.

• Gaffe Masters: Who can forget Republican VP Dan Quayle and “potato?” Or George Bush and “stategery?” GOP gaffes become enshrined in political discourse – like “47 percent.” Democratic gaffes get either ignored or soon dropped into the recycling bin (only green for Team Obama!). From VP Joe Biden’s “big f***ing deal”; to Obama’s “57 states,” Team Obama has made some classics. My favorite is when he tried to curry favor with Argentina and undercut our ally Britain. He wanted to call the Falkland Islands their Argentinean name, the Malvinas. Instead, he called the islands the Maldives, off by half a planet. Where’s Carmen Sandiego when you need her?

• That Pesky Economy: When George Bush ran for reelection, and the economy was good, the media criticized him for it and then blamed him. When Obama ran for reelection and the economy was bad, not so much. America has undergone four years of awful economic circumstances and the Democratic media apparatus blames Bush or the House GOP, which is somehow now the most powerful branch of government according to the media.

USATODAY

A good bit of Chris Christie%27s appeal stems from a pension overhaul.

Most of the states and cities in trouble have gotten where they are under Democratic leadership.

Mayor of San Jose%2C Calif.%2C is leading an effort of Democratic mayors to amend his state%27s constitution.

This month's races for governor sent a widely noted message that Republicans will do much better if they nominate center-right candidates like New Jersey's Chris Christie than far-right candidates like Virginia's Ken Cuccinelli.

Less remarked was the message that the New Jersey race sent to Democrats. It is not often that a state votes for a Democratic president by nearly 18 percentage points one year and then for a Republican governor by an even larger margin the next.

One lesson is that public disgust with government — and particularly government spending — includes anger over the unaffordable sweetheart deals that states and localities signed with public employee labor unions, a core Democratic constituency.

A good bit of Christie's appeal stems from a pension overhaul he engineered that pushes back retirement ages and requires workers to contribute more. Similarly, in Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker faced down public-sector unions and survived a recall election. ""Wisconsin's pension system is the only one in the country that is fully funded,"" Walker writes in his bookUnintimidated, which comes out today.

Fueling taxpayers' anger is that they are financing benefits no longer available to most private-sector workers. Some state and local government workers can retire in their 50s, after 33 years of service, and continue drawing the same income.

Estimates for the total shortfall of public pensions start at about $700 billion. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office said that $2 trillion to $3 trillion was more accurate. Even a long bull market won't make the problem go away.

Some of the pension shortfall is the result of governments not putting as much into the plans as they promised. But a prime reason that pension costs have spiraled out of control is that spineless public officials buy votes by creating liabilities that won't come due until long after they leave office.

If Democrats become the party that ignores this crisis, they will face a lot more New Jerseys and Wisconsins in their future. Democrats aren't the only ones who have created extraordinary pension liabilities, but most of the states and cities in trouble have gotten where they are under Democratic leadership.

Detroit is Exhibit A for municipal irresponsibility. It negotiated generous pensions, even overpaid in some cases, as the city began its long descent into bankruptcy. Illinois tops most lists of states in trouble.

Some Democratic officeholders see the growing resentment against public-sector pensions and are trying to get in front of the issue. The mayor of San Jose, Calif., Chuck Reed, is leading an effort of Democratic mayors to amend his state's constitution to allow cities to renegotiate pensions of current employees for future years worked.

For Democrats, the choice is clear. They can let their communities fall deeper and deeper into debt. Or they can lead on the issue, and even make a progressive case for pension reform. Excessive retiree benefits — which account for 20% of San Jose's $1.1 billion budget, for instance — drain governments of the money needed for education, housing, parks and public safety.

If Democrats don't take on this issue, they will see their communities deteriorate. They will also invite more Republicans like Chris Christie to come in and begin the work that they refuse to do.

But instead, Reid offered deal after deal to Senate Republicans. They accepted some. They honored none. Instead, the delaying tactics have continued. Frequently they have been used to block the implementation of laws the Senate had passed — the two-year filibustering of the first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for example, just because Republicans didn’t like the law. And Republicans have paired judicial nullification with legislative nullification, blocking a record number of Obama’s judicial appointees — a power the Constitution actually mentions, unlike the filibuster — for no real reason other than that they were Democratic nominees, not Republican ones. (Democrats were guilty of this under President George W. Bush as well, it must be noted, and deserve criticism for that, even if the number of filibusters was lower.)"

On Tuesday, Khanna announced his race for Congress in California’s 17th District.

...But the biggest reason is that the whole Obama campaign apparatus—the grassroots organizing, the data analytics, the wired-to-the-hilt technology—will be applied at the House level.

Rick Perry said midway through a 27-minute criticism of California, he wasn’t in Anaheim to criticize California.

That might have come off a tad hollow, given that Perry had already asserted that the state comes in a distant second to his by almost every measure imaginable -- tax rates, poverty levels, business growth, even freedom, by the governor’s sights.

“The purpose of my visit is not to bash California,” he said on the first day of the state Republican Party convention. “This is a wonderful state with great innovative people.”

But, he said, the very “future of the nation” depended on a blunt conversation about which course was best: California’s “big government, protectionist, nanny state” or Texas’ “limited-government, unsubsidized, freedom state.”

Perry’s remarks centered on new jobs for his state’s residents, but they seemed intended to enhance the chances of a new one for him. The governor already has announced that he will not seek reelection and is said to be pondering a second presidential bid.

The first one didn’t end all that well -- entering the race as, essentially, the frontrunner, he stumbled badly and iced his own chances by being unable to remember parts of his own governing proposals during a candidate debate. “Oops” was the grave marker for his hopes.

A second try depends on Perry’s ability to dramatically alter his image. To that end, the governor is coursing across the country with new hipster glasses and a more disciplined approach, taking on Democratic governors’ policies, trying to swipe their state’s jobs, and putting himself prominently in the public eye. A Texas group has aired ads in several areas that depict Perry. He has repeatedly courted gun manufacturers, and, by extension, their influential voter base.

The weekend’s convention, at which Perry will deliver Saturday night’s signature address, puts him in close contact with people who, even if the state is a goner for his party in presidential contests, remains a key source of primary votes, activists and, most especially, money.

His only criticism of Republicans came when he was asked about the party’s regular inability to attract Latino voters nationally and in California. “The California Republican Party needs to take a look at their policies, the words that they use,” he said. “I would suggest that that matters.”

Asked why, if his broad assertions were correct, Californians appeared fairly happy with their Democratic governor and the state’s economic revival, rising housing prices and dropping unemployment rate, Perry replied: “This isn’t about Jerry Brown.”

“The governor is not the issue here,” Perry said. “It’s the policies that are the issue.”

Brown spokesman Evan Westrup took note of the location from which Perry spoke, less than a mile from Disneyland.

“It seems our friend from Texas took a detour to neighboring Fantasyland while in Anaheim today,” Westrup said. “We hope his stay is pleasant. In case you missed it, while Gov. Perry spent his afternoon politicking, Gov. Brown was taking action to bolster the state’s business climate. ... Also, a reminder that California has had 26 consecutive months of job growth.”

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']","Dana Milbank: Lindsey Graham, watching his right flank","Lindsey Graham is turning himself into the mad dog of Capitol Hill.

First, the Republican senator from South Carolina opposed Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be defense secretary because of Hagel’s foreign policy views. Then he argued that Hagel had not produced sufficient background material. Now he’s arguing against Hagel because of the administration’s handling of the attack on U.S. diplomats in Benghazi, Libya, last September — when Hagel was a professor at Georgetown University.

“I am going to fight the idea of jamming somebody through until we get answers about what the president did personally when it came to the Benghazi debacle,” he said in the Senate TV studio Wednesday, a day before his unprecedented filibuster of a nominee to a national-security Cabinet post.

“How do you respond to critics who say you’re just moving the goal posts?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked.

“Oh, I’m going to take every opportunity. I’m not denying it,” he answered.

“You are moving the goal posts?” Bash asked. Several of us in the room chuckled.

“No!” Graham said, then explained how he was indeed moving the posts. “I’m going to hit you and keep hitting you, absolutely,” he said, raising his voice. Thumping the lectern, he added, “You better believe I’m not going to let this thing go.”

Fox News’s Chad Pergram pointed out that the treatment he was giving Hagel was in a “rare category.”

Graham made a fist. “Am I supposed to sit on the sidelines and be a good compliant Republican and just let this administration not account for what I think is a national security breakdown of monumental proportions?” He added that “I guaran-damn-tee you” that Democrats would treat a Republican president even worse.

And I guaran-damn-tee you this: Graham’s antics have as much to do with events in Columbia, S.C., as with events in Washington. His sentiments are no doubt genuine, but the ferocity with which he has been attacking the Obama administration — taking a high-profile role on Benghazi, Susan Rice, Hagel and gun control — are helping him to repel a tea party primary challenge at home.

Graham acknowledged the pressure when I asked him about the influence of home-state politics on his recent actions. “You know, I’m in a red state. I know I’m always exposed in a Republican primary,” he said. But he argued, correctly, that he continues to take a leading role on immigration, which infuriates many conservatives.

“I think it’s positive for me to one day beat the hell out of them and the next day see if we can do a deal,” he said. He described his role in the opposition as a balance between saying “yes for the common good of the country where you can” and saying “no because you need to.”

The problem is Graham, to get through the 2014 primary, needs to say “no” more often now. And Congress can hardly afford for one of its few remaining dealmakers to take an obstreperous turn. But perhaps Graham should be given some slack. The Republican primary system has gone haywire, and this may be the only way a sensible lawmaker can survive it.

Not too long ago, Graham had been in deep trouble with South Carolina conservatives because of his talk about climate-change legislation, his votes for both of Obama’s Supreme Court nominees, his criticism of the Bush administration’s wiretapping and interrogation programs, and his championing of “Grahamnesty” immigration reforms.

But the gradual repositioning has apparently worked. A survey by Public Policy Polling in December found that the percentage of Republicans saying they would vote for him in a primary has climbed to 51 percent from 37 percent in January 2011.

And Graham isn’t letting up. At a hearing on gun control, he unnerved a witness, a U.S. attorney, by beginning his questions with a blunt inquiry: “Do you own a gun?” At a Benghazi hearing, he got the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to admit he was “surprised” about Hillary Clinton’s ignorance of the ambassador to Libya’s request for more security shortly before he was killed.

And Graham delivered a memorable hectoring of Hagel for the nominee’s prior claim that lawmakers are “intimidated” by the Israel lobby. “Name one,” Graham challenged. Hagel couldn’t.

Graham, who has voted the conservative line 90 percent of the time over his career, argues that his new positions are consistent with his previous ones — and they are. But the difference is in the emphasis. In order to survive the Republicans’ backward primary system, Graham needs to de-emphasize anything that might make him appear to be reasonable.

For the first time, the activities of the Obama administration are receiving a sustained public vetting. Americans’ outrage over Benghazi is amplified by the Internal Revenue Service’s intimidation of conservative grassroots organizations and a cascade of negative headlines. There is the real sense the Obama administration has been less than forthright with the American people, the press and lawmakers.

Recent events have rightly focused the nation’s attention squarely on the actions of the Obama administration. It is incumbent upon the House of Representatives to conduct oversight hearings on those actions, but it would be imprudent to do anything that shifts the focus from the Obama administration to the ideological differences within the House Republican Conference.

To that end, we urge you to avoid bringing any legislation to the House Floor that could expose or highlight major schisms within the conference. Legislation such as the Internet sales tax or the FARRM Act which contains nearly $800 billion in food stamp spending, would give the press a reason to shift their attention away from the failures of the Obama administration to write another “circular firing squad” article.

Make no mistake, principled conservatives will still oppose bad policy if it comes to the floor. Rather than scheduling such legislation for consideration, we urge you to keep the attention focused squarely on the Obama administration. As the public’s trust in their government continues to erode, it is incumbent upon those of us who support a smaller, less intrusive government to lead.

Sincerely,

Michael A. Needham

According to a fellow Jewish member of the OCRP, it sounds like they may have decided to ""appease"" the Jewish members by having a ""Rabbi"" speak...except that the ""Rabbi"" was actually a member of ""Jews for Jesus"" which is, if anything, even more offensive to Jewish people.

(CNN) – He flirted with a presidential run that never materialized in 2012, but Donald Trump is again making forays - serious or otherwise - into White House politics.

The real estate mogul and reality television host trekked to Iowa this weekend, along with other potential 2016 candidates Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, to speak at the evangelical Family Leader Conference.



And he told ABC News that he was willing to spend big on a presidential campaign - that is, if he decides to run for real this time.

“If I did it, I'd spend whatever it took,” Trump told ABC’s “This Week.”

Claiming a fortune of more than $10 billion, the magnate said voters would see a candidate who has “built a great company with a tremendous net worth.”

Many voters, however, still see Trump as the loudest backer of the “birther” movement, which questions President Barack Obama’s birthplace and thus his eligibility to serve as commander in chief.

Trump’s unfulfilled run for the 2012 Republican nomination included his demand that Obama make public his full birth certificate from Hawaii.

The president previously had provided a shorter version that serves as the public record in Hawaii, but amid the media glare on the issue raised in part by Trump's repeated questioning, the president released it in April 2011.

Noting he’s still not convinced the long form certificate is legitimate, Trump said in the interview Sunday that the “birther” issue wouldn’t disqualify him as a candidate, despite widespread condemnation of the issue from most Republicans.

“How does that make me not serious? I mean, I think that resonated with a lot of people,” he said.

During his address at the Family Leader event Saturday, Trump predicted a tough presidential contest in 2016, no matter the GOP candidate.

“Somebody is going to have to emerge who is really smart and really tough,” he said. “Because Obama should have been beaten. Hillary is going to be tougher to beat. And the Republicans have to do what's right. If they don't pick the right person, and I mean, it has to be the perfect person, they are going to get dropped in the 2016 election.”"

Do we dare to hope that the Bush administration is finally at an end? After four years of bending the Constitution, the constitutional law professor now in the White House is trying to unloose the Gordian knot of W.’s martial and moral overreaches after 9/11. Safely re-elected, President Obama at long last spoke bluntly about the Faustian deals struck by his predecessor, some of them cravenly continued by his own administration. In a speech at the National Defense University, Obama talked about how we “compromised our basic values,” and he concluded with a slap at W.: “Our victory against terrorism won’t be measured in a surrender ceremony at a battleship or a statue being pulled to the ground.”

See, Maureen? Stop trying to make silly prom metaphors and you get to go places. Like this page.

Doyle McManus takes a deeper look at Obama's defense speech.

President Obama's speech last week on the future course of America's 11-year-old war against Al Qaeda was long overdue. Never before has he offered the public such a detailed explanation of his anti-terrorism strategy. In part, that's surely because so much of it was officially secret — but also because the public hasn't demanded a position more nuanced than ""tough on terrorism."" The president did three big things in his speech Thursday at the National Defense University in Washington. He argued that America's fight against terrorism should be narrower and more sharply focused. He formalized, in particular, new limitations on drone strikes. And he promised that the war against Al Qaeda will end someday.

Like it or not, this speech is likely to define Obama's legacy a decade from now.

Catherine Rampell has bad news for anyone hoping to build their own blimp... or fans of common sense.

The values of gold and silver have dropped like a stone in international trading markets. Coffee futures are hovering near a three-year low. But the price of one commodity has been rising as if it were lighter than air — and in this case, well, it is. The market value of refined helium gas has nearly doubled over the past five years, even as the Standard & Poor’s benchmark commodities index, the GSCI, has fallen by some 20 percent. ... What makes this market saga particularly quirky, though, is the role played by the United States government. For much of the 20th century, the federal government had a domestic monopoly on the production of helium, which was used for airships, missile guidance and other national security measures. In 1960, it began a program to stockpile the helium it was extracting in an underground reservoir near Amarillo, Tex., amassing a debt of $1.3 billion in the process.

Short version: Congress passed a law forcing the government to sell off the helium reserve in about the stupidest way possible. The revenues generated are small, the impact on the market large, and both health and science research are threatened. In the meantime, I'm socking away tanks of helium in my basement (yes, really).

Dana Milbank notes that the real winner of the election was, as usual, the 1%

On Thursday, senators held a confirmation hearing for Obama’s nominee to be commerce secretary: a billionaire who benefits from offshore tax havens, whose family owned a failed savings and loan and who is accused by unions of mistreating workers. Turns out the wealthy didn’t lose the 2012 election; rather, the Republican rich lost to the Democratic rich. ... “You will certainly have my vote,” commerce committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller (average estimated net worth: $103 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics) assured the nominee (net worth $1.85 billion, according to Forbes). “My hope,” said Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner ($228 million), is that “this committee will recommend you.” Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill ($22 million) told Pritzker, “I find it very refreshing to find someone who is stepping up like you are in this position.” Another committee member, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut ($100 million), didn’t speak at the hearing but issued a statement calling the heiress “a longtime friend with a lifetime of business experience and acumen that will serve her well.”

Sometimes, you really long for a zombie uprising.

Robert Kaiser says the problems with Congress go beyond partisan differences.

Congress is a human institution with a distinct culture, and the modern version of that culture is hostile to creative problem-solving. If we have a mediocre Congress — even when it manages to accomplish something — it is because of the people in it and the culture they have created. The men and women who now run for Congress have special features. Most of them are much wealthier than their constituents. Surprisingly few have strong policy interests or experience. Most are willing to spend a day or two or three each week asking strangers for money on the telephone, a demeaning but obligatory exercise. Most have internalized an ethical code that allows them to solicit campaign contributions from people directly affected by legislation they vote on. This is not rare or even unusual — it’s standard.

Again, it doesn't matter what you think is the most important issue facing the nation. That issue won't be solved until the connection between huge dollars and politics is smashed. If you think that can never happen, then don't bother looking for solutions on anything else.

Max Plotkin doesn't think much of Virginia's all Tea Party, all the time GOP lineup.

One candidate stood out right away. There was a sea of red baseball hats with yellow lettering bearing the name “Jackson” and the slogan “Let liberty light the way for Virginia.” No other candidate had hats. Hats carried the day! E.W. Jackson was a political nobody when he ran in 2012 against George Allen for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate. Relegated as “fringe,” he finished a distant fourth. But last weekend Jackson was the story, the steak and the sizzle. He gave a stemwinder of a speech. Even country-club Republican Jay Garner of Westmoreland County, attired in seersucker with a perfectly tied bow tie, told me Jackson was the only candidate that “brought them to their feet.” He said that Jackson “can rally folks” and “tells it like it is.” Jackson is a dazzling eclectic: an African American, a Marine Corps veteran, a Harvard Law grad and a practicing preacher from Chesapeake. He has also made life difficult for himself and his party with inflammatory rhetoric, such as this: “Planned Parenthood has been far more lethal to black lives than the KKK ever was.”

One of the great untold stories in science is the process of science itself. I don't mean stories about what scientists have discovered and what those discoveries tell us; we (and many others) cover those every day. ... What's missing is the background for these stories of discovery. How do you take an idea from its beginning as a casual musing all the way through an actual research program? What's involved in that process? How do you sort out the good ideas from the bad and choose what to pursue and what to abandon? That's the story I want to tell. To understand how I choose between good ideas and bad ideas, we need to step back from actual physics and science and take a look at the structure of the research community that I work in. Research takes resources. I don't mean money—all right, I do mean money—but it also requires time, people, lab space, and support. There is a human and physical infrastructure that I have to make use of. I may be part of a research organization, but I have no automatic right of access to any of this infrastructure."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/22/Exclusive-McConnell-Tea-Party-a-bunch-of-bullies-who-me-and-Karl-Rove-are-going-to-punch-in-the-nose,2013-11-22 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Exclusive — McConnell: Tea Party 'Bullies' Who Need Punch in Nose,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on a conference call organized by Karl Rove’s Crossroads organization for large donors and their advisers on Oct. 30 that the Tea Party movement, in his view, is a “nothing but a bunch of bullies” that he plans to “punch … in the nose.”

On the call, according to a donor who was on it, McConnell personally named Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) as Tea Party conservatives he views as problematic for him. “The bulk of it was an attack on the Tea Party in general, Cruz in particular,” the source, a prominent donor, said in a phone interview with Breitbart News.

But the most memorable line came at the end of the call.

“McConnell said the Tea Party was ‘nothing but a bunch of bullies,'” the source said. “And he said ‘you know how you deal with schoolyard bullies? You punch them in the nose and that’s what we’re going to do.'”

Rove, as well as American Crossroads President and CEO Steven J. Law who also serves as the president of sister group Crossroads GPS, were also on the call. Rove “talked in a slightly gentler way, or let’s say, a more diplomatic way,” the source said. “But the message was pretty well the same: That if we’re going to save this thing, we have to back real Republicans.”

Pointing to how Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid just invoked the “nuclear option,” breaking 225-year old Senate rules to slip through President Obama’s liberal nominees, an aide to a Tea Party lawmaker said that McConnell’s focus on trying to go after the Tea Party has jeopardized Senate Republicans’ chances at actually beating Democrats. “Under Sen. McConnell’s watch, Republicans today just got rolled over by Democrats who pushed the button on the nuclear option, destroying years of well-established Senate order,” the aide said in an email to Breitbart News. “Perhaps if he focused less on destroying the Tea Party and more on defeating Democrats, he’d have more to show for his leadership.”

Rove spokesman Jonathan Collegio denies that anything was said about Cruz, Lee, or the Tea Party in general but admits the call did take place and that “some discussion” about the government shutdown and the Senate Conservatives Fund took place.

“Your source is ascribing things to the call that simply were never said,” Collegio said in an email. “There was no ‘anti-tea party donor call.’ There was a call, and there was some discussion about the government shutdown and the Senate Conservatives Fund (note this was one day after SCF launched a dishonest ad about McConnell), but nothing about the Tea Party or Sens.

It will be 10, not 20. This version has been corrected.

A GOP-friendly electoral map, along with a spate of retirements among red-state Democratic senators, has once again favorably positioned Republicans to take control of the Senate in 2014.

But Republican operatives are working feverishly to ensure that the bitter split between the party establishment and insurgent tea party conservatives does not lead to a squandered opportunity and GOP disappointment for the third consecutive cycle of elections.

Democrats must defend 21 seats in 2014, including six in states that President Obama lost in 2012 by double-digit margins, while Republicans are defending 14. In addition, veteran Democrats John D. Rockefeller IV (W. Va.), Carl Levin (Mich.) and Tom Harkin (Iowa) — whose appeal at the ballot box will be hard for their party to replace — are retiring.

Republicans need to pick up six seats to retake the majority they lost in 2006, and recent history suggests that the task is doable, if difficult. More concerning for Republicans, however, is whether they will again have to endure nasty primaries that produce either triumphant insurgents with limited appeal or establishment survivors who underperform with conservative voters in the general election.

There are already declared and potential candidates that the GOP establishment sees as less than desirable, including Reps. Paul C. Broun and Phil Gingrey of Georgia, Rep. Steve King (Iowa), Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) and former congressman Jeffrey M. Landry (La.).

Senate Republicans have conducted an internal review of their recent failures to better prepare themselves for the pitfalls ahead, both in defending incumbents and in playing offense in winnable races.

The review is similar to the “autopsy” that the Republican National Committee performed after Mitt Romney’s disappointing loss to Obama last year.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) surveyed candidates, staff and consultants involved in 20 Senate races over the past three elections. The single biggest problem identified was poor communication support in dealing with the fast pace of modern campaigns, GOP strategists said.

For example, when candidates made gaffes in debates or local interviews, it would sometimes take days to repair the damage. The NRSC dispatched senior media advisers from Washington to stumbling campaigns in places such as North Dakota and Wisconsin in 2012 and Nevada and Kentucky in 2010.

They lost three of those races, and the NRSC postmortem determined that by the time the top advisers got to the states, it was too late to fix the problems. In 2014, they hope to avoid falling behind and to use the disparity in the number of seats up for grabs to their advantage.

2012 surprise

But for Democrats, playing defense will be nothing new.

In November, they had to defend 23 of the 33 Senate seats up for grabs in 2012. They could afford to lose only four seats to maintain a majority, and several of their veterans retired after long runs representing conservative states.

But instead of losing ground, Democrats gained seats —which seemed unthinkable in March 2011 — by holding all 23 and picking off two from Republicans.

Moreover, in the past four elections, just two Democrats lost reelection bids, while 12 GOP incumbents fell.

The NRSC is planning at least eight boot camps for staff in states with competitive races. Kevin McLaughlin, a veteran operative hired to work with campaign staff around the country, will run the communications schools with an eye toward preventing mishaps. He will also be in charge of a kind of campaign fire department, charged with quickly putting out blazes once mistakes are made.

NRSC officials say they are also taking a new approach to contested primaries.

In 2010, the committee endorsed preferred candidates, only to see five of them defeated. In 2012, the NRSC chose to make no endorsements and provided only behind-the-scenes guidance to its preferred candidates.

This time, the committee intends to stay neutral unless a particularly undesirable nominee begins to emerge. In addition, if Democratic groups wade into GOP primaries to help a candidate they deem weaker and easier to beat, the NRSC promises to fight back.

This neutrality approached will be vigorously tested in several places. Already, former South Dakota governor Mike Rounds and Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia — early establishment front-runners to claim seats being vacated by retiring Democrats — are being targeted by GOP outside groups that say they are not conservative enough despite having no declared opponents. The Club for Growth has made it known that it doesn’t like Capito, and the Senate Conservatives Fund announced Tuesday that it will seek an alternative to Rounds.

At the same time, conservatives recoiled at the news that legendary GOP strategist Karl Rove was starting a group to challenge their influence and to nominate more “electable,” candidates.

Mitch McConnell

In 2012, Republicans needed just three seats and a Romney victory to take control of the Senate but came up short. Instead, Democrats got a chance to boost their margin going into 2014 and are eyeing 2016, when they think the election map will finally tilt in their favor; Republicans will be defending 24 seats to the Democrats’ 10.

For Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, 2014 may be his chance to realize a 50-year-old dream of becoming majority leader, and one of the key races that will decide that question is his reelection contest in Kentucky.

Should McConnell, 71, cruise to a sixth term without a real primary challenge from the right, it could signal that Republicans have broken the spell of their damaging internal feuds and are positioned for the majority.

Democrats, however, are betting that McConnell is vulnerable to the kind of conservative primary challenge that has hobbled the GOP in recent elections.

This week, the much anticipated Democratic candidacy of actress Ashley Judd fizzled as she abandoned the race before it started. With Judd out, Democrats are turning to Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, 34, whose father was state Democratic chairman and a friend of former president Bill Clinton.

Still the most important Kentucky politician of his generation, McConnell is already running hard against whoever eventually emerges to challenge him.

In 2011 and 2012, when he wasn’t even up for reelection, McConnell raised more than $7.5 million — as much money as his Kentucky colleague, Rand Paul (R), spent in his entire 2010 Senate race. That Paul win was a tea party triumph that signaled its ascendancy against the establishment. McConnell, for his 2014 race, has hired Paul’s campaign manager, Jesse Benton, to help navigate the tea party waters during his reelection effort. As a whole, the party has decided it needs to take similar action beyond Kentucky if it is to press its numbers advantage over Democrats.

“We’d rather be us than them, but . . . it’s early, and it’s incumbent upon us to capitalize on the opportunity,” said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the NRSC.

Less than two months after the Republican National Committee announced a multi-million dollar campaign to improve minority outreach, one of its state Hispanic directors is leaving the Republican Party altogether.

In a letter released by The Florida Nation on Monday, RNC State Director Of Florida Outreach Pablo Pantoja announced that he is changing his political affiliation to the Democratic Party.

""It doesn’t take much to see the culture of intolerance surrounding the Republican Party today,"" he wrote. ""I have wondered before about the seemingly harsh undertones about immigrants and others. Look no further; a well-known organization recently confirms the intolerance of that which seems different or strange to them.""

Back in March, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus announced that the organization was investing $10 million to send hundreds of workers into Hispanic, black and Asian communities to improve standing with voters. Here in May, questions continue to linger whether a line of amendments proposed by Republican voices will derail immigration reform, and subsequently dampen chances for improving relations with minority voters.

Pantoja is not the first Republican in the Sunshine State to recently change their party affiliation. Back in December, former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist moved over from the GOP to the Democratic Party, hailing how he was ""proud and honored"" to make the switch. Democrats eked out a 2012 presidential election win in Florida, with President Barack Obama defeating GOP challenger Mitt Romney by less than 75,000 votes."

http://news.yahoo.com/decision-day-njs-accelerated-us-senate-race-050236056.html,,[],Decision day in NJ's accelerated US Senate race,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey's abbreviated U.S. Senate race went to the populace Wednesday with candidates characterizing the contest as a referendum on the partisan gridlock that has paralyzed Washington in recent weeks.

Democrat Cory Booker and Republican Steve Lonegan each cast a ballot early in the morning in the special election to fill the seat of the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who died in June.

The election is the first since the partial federal government shutdown began more than two weeks ago. It came the same day Senate leaders announced a deal had been struck to reopen the government and avert a Treasury default.

""This is the only election in America right now where we will get a chance to make a statement about what is going on in Washington,"" Booker said after voting in downtown Newark. ""This is a chance for us to send a message about the shutdown, about the gridlock, about all those forces that my opponent represents — the tea party — that says we shouldn't compromise, we shouldn't work together.""

Booker, the high-profile mayor of New Jersey's largest city, had circulated a petition to end the shutdown and accused Congress of failing voters by not finding a way to work together.

Lonegan supported the shutdown, arguing the Affordable Care Act should be delayed a year and objecting to the concept of government-directed health insurance. In recent days, he has accused Booker of not even living in Newark.

After voting in Bogota, the city he led as mayor for three terms, Lonegan said he has been able to unite Republicans of all stripes.

""We've unified and I'm proud of that,"" he said. ""The entire Republican party, from the tea party to the moderate wing to pro-life and not so pro-life. Everybody who cares about individual liberty.""

In the shore town of Point Pleasant, nurse Mary Martin said she voted for Lonegan, a decision that wasn't influenced by the government shutdown.

""I'm a longtime Republican and I just think with the way we're headed, we need more conservative people in there,"" she said.

Polls closed at 8 p.m.

The two-month campaign played out under a compressed schedule and was the subject of controversy even before the two candidates were chosen.

Republican Gov. Chris Christie appointed a GOP caretaker and ordered the election held Oct. 16, the soonest date the law allowed following an unprecedented August primary.

Critics accused the governor of keeping the race off the Nov. 5 ballot, when he is up for re-election, to make it easier for him to win big as a Republican in a Democratic-leaning state and aid his potential national ambitions. During his first debate, he refused to rule out a run for president in 2016.

Public opinion polls showed Booker, 44, the second-term mayor of Newark, with a double-digit-percentage advantage heading into the election, where he hoped to secure a seat as the second African-American in the Senate along with Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina.

Booker on Wednesday called the opportunity to serve as senator ""one of the greatest privileges any Jersey boy could have.""

Marcy Phillips, a 30-year resident of Newark, covered her car in Booker signs and was driving around the city Wednesday urging people to vote.

""He's the best out of the candidates right now, and he's the one we need,"" she said. ""As the mayor of Newark, he did his best and right now the whole city has changed.""

Lonegan, 57, the former state director of Americans for Prosperity, a group advocating limited government that was founded by the billionaire Koch brothers, ran an aggressive, in-your-face campaign.

""We want a leader, not a tweeter,"" he said at one point, referring to Booker's prolific use of Twitter, where he has 1.4 million followers.

Both candidates drew on some big names for support — Oprah Winfrey helped raise funds for Booker, while the nation's largest tea party political action committee brought former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in to campaign for the GOP nominee.

The campaign took odd twists and turns for both candidates.

Booker was forced off-message to explain G-rated correspondence with a stripper he met while filming a social media documentary. Lonegan was forced to dump a longtime strategist after a lengthy, profanity-laced interview with a political website in which he claimed Booker's banter with the stripper ""was like what a gay guy would say.""

While in Newark, Booker has worked with Christie on common education goals, such as ending lifetime teacher tenure and increasing the number of charter schools. Newark schools remain under state control.

Lonegan repeatedly knocked Booker for the city's high crime rate and unemployment. At one point in the campaign, Booker announced a new crime-fighting strategy to cope with a string of 10 homicides in 10 days.

Lonegan said that as a mayor, he also has reached across the aisle in working with a Democratic borough council.

But Booker painted him as a tea party extremist, one who would — if sent to Washington — make the capital's gridlock worse.

http://news.yahoo.com/george-p-bush-starts-small-amid-high-expectations-122933798.html,,[],George P. Bush starts small amid high expectations,"FRISCO, Texas (AP) — On a recent evening, George P. Bush was telling a packed room of wealthy North Texans how he got his start in politics. It was May 1979 and the then 3-year-old was in a Houston park, clutching a balloon and watching his grandfather, George H.W. Bush, announce his first campaign for president.

""It was my first memory,"" Bush recalled. ""I was wearing a George P. Bush, er, uh, George H.W. Bush for President T-shirt.""

Drowned out temporarily by laughter, Bush insisted it wasn't a Freudian flub. An aide approached a reporter scribbling notes and jokingly commanded: ""Stop writing!""

The light moment underscores the dilemma of the latest scion of an American political dynasty.

How does Bush keep his family's powerful past from overwhelming his present? How can he ease into his first campaign for elected office amid lofty expectations that he will help save a Republican Party in Texas that's endangered by the state's booming Latino population?

Bush, 37, says he's more than just a famous surname. Both his grandfather and uncle were presidents; his father, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, may run for the White House in 2016.

George P. Bush is running for state land commissioner, a post unfamiliar to most Texans, because he says it best suits his skills, not because it could launch him to bigger things in the largest Republican-leaning state.

""It's a legacy that I embrace and that I'm not going to run away from,"" Bush told The Associated Press in an interview during a recent visit to the affluent Dallas suburb of Frisco. ""But certainly, in this campaign, I have to identify myself and talk about my own track record.""

That isn't always easy.

People want to know how often he calls assorted relatives for advice and what sleeping at the White House was like. Political observers wonder if the Spanish-speaker who offers a unique blend of Republican royalty and Hispanic heritage can slow what looks like Texas' inevitable demographic slide toward a Democratic-leaning state. His mother, Columba, is from Mexico.

Story continues

Jeremy Bird, who helped President Barack Obama win re-election last year by using data analysis to tailor voter mobilization to the most promising areas, helped tilt Nevada and Colorado to the Democrats in the 2012 presidential race. Now, Bird and other Obama veterans are leading Battleground Texas, a group that hopes to do the same thing in Texas.

""This is something not to be taken lightly. It's a well-capitalized, well-financed group that's intent on developing a long term strategy. That's problematic,"" Bush said. ""It's going to require more for candidates like myself and people from the party to step up their game. Not necessarily change our principles, but change our tactics.""

He said Republicans will have to recruit more Spanish-speakers, campaign more frequently along Texas' border with Mexico, and improve their youth outreach on college campuses and via social media.

Bush said he considers himself an asset to the party's Hispanic outreach efforts. But he also said the GOP's long-term strategy cannot simply be running more bilingual candidates.

""I've been asked whether knowing Spanish and being Hispanic myself is a positive in getting Hispanic voters and I don't believe it is,"" he said. ""I think Hispanics look for a friend, they look for someone who understands, whose willing to relate, to hear their issues and welcome them to the party and to their campaigns. That's what we're doing.""

Bush's campaign style, though, has been criticized by some as uncomfortable, and his stump speeches occasionally can sound canned.

""I'm not running for office to be somebody but really just to do something. ... This isn't about making a statement. It's about making a difference,"" he told about 600 homeowners and GOP activists who crowded into the clubhouse of a new Frisco subdivision.

Bush has raised $3.3 million since November even though no Democratic candidate has emerged for land commissioner.

A Democrat hasn't won any of Texas' 29 statewide offices since 1994, the nation's longest streak of single-party dominance. But Hispanics accounted for two-thirds of Texas' population growth over the past decade and now make up 35 percent of its population. They tend to vote Democratic, with Obama capturing 71 percent of the Latino vote nationwide last year.

Closer to home, no Republican represents any majority Hispanic district in the Legislature, even though the GOP holds sizable majorities in the House and Senate. The only Hispanic ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Texas, Ted Cruz, is a Republican whose father was born in Cuba. Many top GOP leaders are counting on him and Bush to remake the party's image with Hispanics.

Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, scoffs at that.

""How is it,"" he asked, ""that these people think that if they're fortunate to be born to a Hispanic mother and are of Hispanic heritage, that gives them the right to have the support of the Hispanic community?""

Bush said Hispanics ""don't vote in a monolith."" He sidestepped questions about national issues such as immigration, choosing to focus on the responsibilities of the land commissioner. The office oversees vast oil and mineral rights which help fund public education. It also administers benefits to military veterans.

""This is an office I've had my heart on for years,"" Bush said. ""I'm a former educator, a veteran and I have a strong energy and asset background. This is kind of what I'm excited about.""

Born in Houston, Bush grew up in Florida, where his father was governor from 1998 until 2007. He graduated from and played baseball for Rice University in Houston before teaching school in inner-city Miami and working on George W. Bush's presidential campaign.

He earned a law degree from the University of Texas and clerked for a federal judge, then later founded a capital company in Fort Worth. In 2010, he served an eight-month tour in Afghanistan with U.S. Naval Intelligence.

Bush is on the board of Uplift Education, a major charter school operator in North Texas, and is a strong proponent of school choice for all families. On June 3, his wife Amanda gave birth to the couple's first child, Prescott, and Bush joked that he was looking forward to his son carrying on the family tradition ... of playing baseball at Rice.

Most everyone else, though, is interested in another family tradition.

""You just don't know about political dynasties,"" said Sharon Born, a 66-year-old flight attendant who chatted with Bush at the Frisco event. ""But on the other side we might have Hillary (Clinton) after Bill, and then Chelsea. So, I'll take the Bushes."""

He Previously Served As Head Of The Washington Post S Afghanistan-Pakistan Bureau', 'Based In Islamabad', 'Kabul. He Has Also Reported Iraq', 'The District']",Brown’s departure makes for a fluid D.C. Council race featuring six candidates,"Michael A. Brown’s abrupt departure from the coming D.C. Council election has upended what was already a fluid contest.

Brown cited “very important personal and family matters” last week when he ended his campaign to return to the council. He has declined to elaborate. The former at-large independent lost his reelection bid in November.

The candidates in the April 23 election — an off-year race to fill a seat vacated when Phil Mendelson (D) became council chairman — are entering the final scramble for votes in what could be a close and potentially polarizing contest.

In December, the D.C. Democratic State Committee selected Anita Bonds — the committee’s chairwoman — to temporarily fill the seat pending the special election.

But she has struggled to gain traction on the campaign trail, and some Democrats fear the seat could fall to Republican Patrick Mara, a Ward 1 school board member making his third attempt at a council seat.

The race also includes Democrats Elissa Silverman, Matthew Frumin and Paul Zukerberg — all of whom see paths to victory in a race that could draw fewer than 50,000 votes. Perry Redd, a member of the Statehood Green Party, also is running.

Bonds and Mara appear to have the broadest support, based on past city voting patterns and the crowded field.

Mara is banking on strong turnout among the city’s 31,000 registered Republicans, many of whom have been mailed instructions from the D.C. GOP about voting by absentee ballot. With Brown out of the race, Bonds, the only black Democrat in the race, is expected to do well both in her home base of Northeast and majority African American neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River.

George T. Johnson, head of Local 20 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which endorsed Bonds hours after Brown withdrew from the race, said there is a strong desire within the black community to ensure the seat is held by an African American.

There are seven white and six black council members, including Bonds.

“People have perceptions about what this city is becoming . . . and they want this council to remain black, and if they don’t get out there and put black folks in there, there will be a white city council,” Johnson said. “That is a rough thing to say, but that is the truth.”

Bonds, an aide to several former mayors in the 1980s and 1990s, has the support of Democratic council members Jack Evans (Ward 2), Muriel Bowser (Ward 4), Vincent B. Orange (At Large) and Marion Barry (Ward 8). A mailing sent Friday shows Bonds with President Obama and says that she will “fight for anyone who has been pushed aside.”

Mara, who, if elected, would be the first Republican to win a council seat since 2008, is pushing to unite the “reform vote” behind his candidacy.

“I can be that fiscal and ethical watchdog,” Mara said.

At a forum Thursday night in the Chevy Chase neighborhood, Mara urged about 100 people in the audience to vote as a bloc. “Please don’t split the vote,” said Mara, who promises to improve schools while also controlling spending and taxes.

But Mara is battling considerable head winds: Local pollsters say surveys shows city voters hold deeply negative views about the GOP, even in wealthy neighborhoods such as Chevy Chase. That leaves an opening for the other Democrats in the race.

Silverman, a former reporter on leave from the liberal Fiscal Policy Institute, is targeting voters who agree with her message of building a progressive tax code, improving city services and strengthening government ethics.

“I don’t think D.C. voters mind paying taxes,” said Silverman, a Ward 6 resident who said she will campaign hard for African American votes. “What they mind are bad services, and I think D.C. voters want an honest, transparent approach to taxation.”

Frumin, a lawyer and Ward 3 advisory neighborhood commissioner, was relatively unknown when he started the race . But he has raised more than $100,000 to fund a mail campaign promoting his vision of improved neighborhood schools and better-managed growth.

“The geometry of this race is tricky and in many ways unpredictable,” said Frumin, who has a base of support in Upper Northwest. “It’s all about this final two weeks and reaching as many voters as possible, and I think we have reached as many voters as anyone.”

Zukerberg, a lawyer who has made the legalization of marijuana the centerpiece of his campaign, also remains confident. His message appears to resonate at candidate forums and debates.

“My position cuts across all wards, all demographics,” said Zukerberg, who lives in Adams Morgan. “The message I am hearing is, ‘Keep going, don’t give up.’ ”

Redd is an author and activist who is pushing for more progressive tax policies. The Green Party, though, has been unsuccessful in recent elections.

Political strategist Tom Lindenfeld said the race will remain fluid.

“The real questions in this race are: Will the independent expenditures for Anita be able to promote her into the election?” he said. “And will Mara be an acceptable candidate for white voters? And if not, is there a place for anyone else in the race, and who would that be?”

The candidates will debate at noon Monday on “The Kojo Nnamdi Show” on WAMU (88.5 FM)."

And that explains why a seat on the Financial Services Committee is so coveted.

Political action committees — set up by lobbying firms, unions, corporations and other groups trying to push their agenda in Congress — have donated more money to Financial Services Committee members in the first six months of this year than to members of any other committee. The $9.4 million total is nearly $2 million more than the total for the Armed Services Committee, the only House panel with more members.

With so many lawmakers clamoring to be on the Financial Services Committee, it has grown to 61 members from 44 since 1980, forcing the installation of four tiered rows of seats in the Rayburn House Office Building — with the first row of lawmakers on the floor, just in front of the tables used for witnesses.

The committee’s chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, remains the top recipient of donations from industry PACs this year, taking in $282,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks the influence of money in politics. But three Republican freshmen — Mr. Barr and Representatives Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ann Wagner of Missouri — have raised more money from industry PACs than many longtime committee members like Representative Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican who served as the panel’s chairman until the end of last year.

The imbalance is apparent on the Democratic side as well. Each of the seven freshman Democrats on the committee has raised more industry PAC money so far this year than the committee’s top Democrat, Representative Maxine Waters of California, who has had a testy relationship with the industry.

These freshman Democrats joined this year with Republicans on the committee — over the objection of Ms. Waters and the Obama administration — to support measures advocated by Wall Street banks that would roll back some of the strictest provisions of the landmark Dodd-Frank financial regulations, which were passed in 2010 in the aftermath of the global recession."

In what could be a sign of challenges to come across the country, two U.S. House races in Michigan mark a turnabout from several years of widely heralded contests in which right-flank candidates have tried — sometimes successfully — to unseat Republican incumbents they perceive as not being conservative enough.

In the Michigan races, longtime Republican businessmen are taking on two House incumbents — hardline conservative Reps. Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio — in GOP primaries. The 16-day partial government shutdown and the threatened national default are bringing to a head a lot of pent-up frustration over GOP insurgents roughing up the business community's agenda.

Democrats hope to use this rift within the GOP to their advantage. Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House committee to elect Democrats, insists there's been ""buyer's remorse with House Republicans who have been willing to put the economy at risk,"" and that it is opening the political map for Democrats in 2014.

That's what the Democrats would be expected to say. But there's also Defending Main Street, a new GOP-leaning group that's halfway to its goal of raising $8 million. It plans to spend that money on center-right Republicans who face a triumvirate of deep-pocketed conservative groups — Heritage Action, Club for Growth and Freedom Works — and their preferred, typically tea party candidates.

In one race, the group plans to help Idaho eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson, who faces a Club for Growth-backed challenger in a GOP primary.

""These conservative groups have had it all their own way,"" said former Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio, head of the new group. ""They basically come in with millions of dollars and big-foot a Republican primary and you wind up with these Manchurian candidates who are not interested in governing.""

Story continues

LaTourette said that for the past three years, some ""40, 42 House members have effectively denied the Republican Party the power of the majority"" that it won in the 2010 election by blocking the GOP agenda.

Defending Main Street is meeting Nov. 5 in New York with wealthy potential donors.

Call it the wrath of establishment Republicans and corporate America, always considered the best of friends. Since the Republican takeover of the House in 2010, they've watched the GOP insurgents slow a transportation bill and reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, block a treaty governing the high seas and stand in the way of comprehensive immigration legislation.

The final straw was the bitter budget standoff that partly shuttered the government, precipitated by Republicans like Amash and Bentivolio who enlisted early in the campaign demanding that President Barack Obama dismantle his health care law in exchange for keeping the government operating.

Even after 16 days of a shutdown, falling poll numbers for the GOP and a threatened economy-jarring default, the two broke with their House Republican leaders and voted against the final deal to reopen the government.

Long before the shutdown, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has spent tens of millions boosting mainly Republicans in congressional races, urged the GOP to fund the government and prevent a default, then double back and try and work out changes to the health care law later.

A significant number of House Republicans have given a cold-shoulder to the Chamber's agenda. Rob Engstrom, the group's political director, said the Chamber will see how races develop before deciding on its involvement next year.

The latest political dynamic promises to affect the midterm elections — but how? Republicans hope the widespread animosity generated by the shutdown dissipates by next November and they can hold their House majority. Currently, Republicans control 231 seats and Democrats 200. Democrats are widely expected to win the special House election in Massachusetts for the seat of Sen. Ed Markey and would need to gain 17 seats next year to seize control.

""As long as we stay focused on the priorities of the American people, I think we're going to be fine,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week when asked about whether the GOP can hold onto the House.

What about the Michigan races?

In the state's 11th Congressional District, just northwest of Detroit, David Trott, a businessman involved in real estate finance and a member of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce Board of Trustees, is challenging Bentivolio.

In the 3rd Congressional District in the southwest part of the state, Brian Ellis is a 53-year-old Grand Rapids businessman who owns an investment advisory firm and serves on the school board. He describes himself as the true conservative Republican in the race, criticizing Amash's votes against Rep. Paul Ryan's budget that cut nearly $5 trillion and a measure reducing taxes for small businesses.

Ellis makes it clear that he would have sided with Boehner on the House GOP's last-ditch plan to avoid default. He says it never would have reached that point if Republicans hadn't embraced the tactic of linking the health care law to government funding.

""I certainly agree that Obamacare is an 'Obama-onation,'"" Ellis said in an interview. ""But I think the tactic, especially threatening to default on our debt, that is very reckless and not a good way to run our country. I'm in the financial world and I know that would have some far-reaching consequences that would not be good.""

In seizing on the rift, Israel and Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's national finance chairman, sent a letter to more than 1,000 business leaders reminding them that Democrats voted unanimously to end the shutdown and avoid default while House Republicans ""turned their backs on business in favor of the radical demands of the tea party.""

Republicans dismiss this Democratic outreach to the business community as wishful thinking.

""I don't think Democrats will be successful because the biggest headwinds we face in the economy right now are of their making, from regulation to the Affordable Care Act to this obsession with higher taxes,"" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. ""Certainly the uncertainty of the last month has not been helpful, but that's on top of a heap of other uncertainty.""

Even if the business community isn't ready to embrace Democrats, Israel insists that the recent budget stalemate has helped his candidate recruitment while boosting the campaign committee's fundraising. At the end of September, the committee had $21.6 million on hand to $15.7 million for the National Republican Campaign Committee.

Potential recruits who Israel jokingly said had put his number on the ""do-not-call-list"" have suddenly been announcing their candidacies, including Democrat Pete Festersen, the president of the Omaha City Council, who is running against eight-term Rep. Lee Terry, and attorney Bill Hughes Jr., who is looking to unseat 10-term Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J.

The specter of libertarianism is haunting America. Advocates of sharply reducing the government’s size, scope and spending are raising big bucks from GOP donors, trying to steal the mantle of populism, being blamed for the demise of Detroit and even getting caught in the middle of a battle for the Republican Party. Yet libertarians are among the most misunderstood forces in today’s politics. Let’s clear up some of the biggest misconceptions.

Still, hard to take any column (or movement) seriously that pretends Ayn Rand was an intellectual.

Dana Milbank:

Republicans need to make up their minds: Is President Obama a socialist or a corporate stooge? “The president claims his economic agenda is for the middle class. But it’s actually for the well-connected,” Paul Ryan, the GOP’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, wrote this week in USA Today, rejecting Obama’s latest proposal for a corporate tax cut. “There’s no doubt that it works well for them. But for the rest of us, it’s not working at all.”... Republican lawmakers seem to think that Americans have short memories and lack Internet connections, for their latest line of attack — that Obama’s health-care and tax policies favor the corporate elite — directly contradicts their previous allegation that Obama was waging “class warfare” with “socialist” policies attacking these very same corporate elites.



Making Obama out as the defender of the elite is the populism side of libertarian populism. Yeah, its as awkward as it reads here, but the GOP literally has nothing else.

Matthew Yglasias:

I've been meaning to write a deadly dull low-traffic blog post on the subject of ""libertarian populism"" for a while now, and I think my bottom line is this—economic populism can (and probably should) become more libertarian, but libertarianism can never be populist.

I'll have my own deadly dull low-traffic blog post on the subject tomorrow, Matt, so you don't have to and much more today after the fold."

But a rare sequence of events is drawing some big names to an off-season congressional race in South Carolina's Low Country.

A primary is scheduled for March 19 to fill the U.S. House seat of now-Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. In December, Gov. Nikki Haley appointed Scott to succeed former Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, who resigned to become president of the conservative Heritage Foundation.

With no incumbent, the field was wide open for both novice and experienced politicians to enter the race for South Carolina's Republican-leaning 1st Congressional District. The candidates have poured in; two Democrats and 16 Republicans are running.

Mark Sanford, who represented this district for three terms in the U.S. House from 1995 to 2001 before being elected governor in 2002, is the GOP frontrunner. Hand-painted campaign signs underscore his reputation as a fiscal conservative.

""Folks have had a lot of fun with it,"" said Sanford, also a former Fox News contributor. ""Ultimately, campaigns are about messages. And it's certainly a reinforcement of what people have come to know about me for 20 years.""

Sanford's apparent lead comes less than four years after he secretly left the country for an extramarital affair. Several days into his 2009 disappearance, Sanford announced through a spokesman that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. But when confronted by reporters upon his return, he admitted he had actually been in Argentina visiting his mistress Maria Belen Chapur.

The revelation ultimately ended Sanford's marriage. At the time, many thought it would also end his political career. Sanford was among them.

""I, for all the obvious reasons ... thought that politics was forever over for me,"" said Sanford, who's now engaged to Chapur.

But when the District 1 vacancy arose, Sanford said friends convinced him he had a rare opportunity to do something about spending in Washington, using everything he had learned at the statehouse, on Capitol Hill and even from his personal scandal.

""If you go through the experience that I went through, it humbles you,"" Sanford said. ""And I think that if there's anything that's needed in Washington, D.C., right now it's a little bit greater level of humility from either party's perspective in where they're coming from.""

While Sanford runs on his experience, fellow Republican Teddy Turner, the son of billionaire media mogul and CNN founder Ted Turner, is running against the political establishment.

""We can't send more politicians to Washington,"" Turner said. ""It's the definition of insanity -- doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.""

As a high school economics teacher, Turner is no career politician. However, his family name recognition is a mixed blessing for a Republican trying to distance himself from his father's liberal views.

""I've had a lot of access to a lot of great things in my life because of my father,"" Turner said. ""That part is a huge asset. I am who I am because of him. But in a political race, it makes it a lot more difficult because people assume they know who you are. Just they hear the name. They assume. And they also assume, unfortunately, that I'm liberal.""

Turner is not the only candidate with a famous family member. On the Democratic side, political satirist and comedian Stephen Colbert is bringing his star power to the campaign of his sister, Elizabeth Colbert Busch.

""With 11 brothers and sisters, you'd better learn how to negotiate,"" Colbert Busch told reporters at a recent campaign event.

Colbert Busch faces an uphill battle running as a Democrat in a district that favors Republicans. However, her career in maritime trade and involvement in economic development initiatives have earned the respect of many in the business community, according to Kendra Stewart, a political science professor at the College of Charleston.

""There's a lot of Yankee Republicans in this district who are more concerned with fiscal issues than social issues,"" Stewart said. ""So, they would be much more willing to consider a candidate who wasn't terribly left-leaning, but was a Democrat who had good business values and maybe a little more fiscally conservative.""

Colbert Busch has another advantage in that she faces only one Democratic challenger in the March 19 special primary, perennial candidate Ben Frasier. But with 16 contenders vying for the GOP nomination, it's unlikely any Republican will pass the 50 percent of the vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff on April 2.

Colbert Busch ""can step back and save all her money and watch the Republicans slug it out, while she capitalizes on their attacks on each other,"" Stewart said.

""We need to pass a budget,"" said Republican candidate Larry Grooms, who currently serves in the South Carolina State Senate. ""It needs to be a responsible budget. And we need to learn to live within our budget. That's not happening in Washington.""

All the candidates agree fiscal responsibility is a key issue in this race. The debate is over which candidate is uniquely qualified to make it happen in Washington.

Other candidates in the Republican field include environmental consultant Keith Blandford; former Charleston County Councilman Curtis Bostic; engineer Ric Bryant; military prosecutor Jonathan Hoffman; systems engineer Jeff King; former State Sen. John Kuhn; defense contractor Tim Larkin; State Rep. Chip Limehouse; State Rep. Peter McCoy; Charleston County school board member Elizabeth Moffly; former Dorchester County Sheriff Ray Nash; State Rep. and former Secret Service agent Andy Patrick; and attorney Shawn Pinkston.

""I believe in duty,"" said Pinkston, an Army veteran who served in Iraq. ""I believe in putting the country's interest above my own.""

The winners of South Carolina's 1st District primaries will face each other in a general election on May 7."

He Left The Post In April']",Republican Party could learn a lot from the Democrats of 1989,"The Republicans of 2013 look a lot like the Democrats of 1989 — shut out of the presidency, beholden to a shrinking base and on the wrong side of major demographic shifts in the country.

That’s the argument two longtime Democratic strategists — Bill Galston and Elaine Kamarck — make in an essay titled “The New Politics of Evasion” in the fall edition of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas. For any Republican hoping to win back the White House in 2016, it’s an absolute must-read.

What Galston and Kamarck set out to do is revisit a famed essay they wrote in 1989 about their own side’s political and policy failing, titled “The Politics of Evasion: Democrats and the Presidency.”

In that first essay, Galston and Kamarck write, “we debunked the views of our Democratic colleagues who hoped, as do so many Republicans today, that their fortunes would start looking up when a popular two-term President passed from the scene, and we laid out the kinds of changes the party would have to embrace if it wished to regain its competitiveness in presidential elections.”

The diagnoses and proposed prescriptions the duo outlined for Democrats almost a quarter-century ago also apply to Republicans today.

First, what’s wrong. Galston and Kamarck broke the Democrats’ problems into three basic “myths”: the myth of “liberal fundamentalism,” the myth of “mobilization” and the myth of “the congressional bastion.”

The first myth centered on the idea that Democrats had come up short at the presidential level in 1980, 1984 and 1988 because the candidates they had nominated — Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis — were insufficient adherents to liberal orthodoxy. If only the party had nominated a “true liberal,” the argument went, they would have won. Sound familiar? The critique from many within the GOP over the past two elections is that neither John McCain nor Mitt Romney were dyed-in-the-wool conservatives, and that had the party nominated someone like, say, Rick Santorum, it might have won.

The second myth — of mobilization — is all about demographics. In the 1980s, Democrats insisted that if only blacks and Hispanics would vote in numbers commensurate with their share of the population, the party’s nominee would win. They didn’t, and Democrats didn’t win. Fast-forward to today and some within the Republican Party are making that same losing argument about consolidating the white vote. “[T]he Republicans’ demographic problem is the mirror image of the one that Democrats faced a quarter-century ago,” Galston and Kamarck write. “Back then there weren’t enough minorities to make the Democrats’ electoral strategy work; today, there aren’t enough whites to make the Republican strategy viable. The same long-cycle trends that gradually helped Democrats are now hurting Republicans.”

This demographic myth is perhaps the most dangerous for Republicans as they seek a way back to the White House in 2016. Remember that the white vote as a percentage of the overall electorate has declined in every presidential election since 1992. As GOP strategist Pete Wehner has noted, if Romney had carried the white vote by 20 points — as he did in 2012— with the demographic makeup of the country as it was in 2000, he would be president today. But, he’s not.

The final myth is that of the “congressional bastion,” the idea that if the party out of the White House still controls a chamber of Congress and/or a number of state and local offices then it’s evidence that all is well and major change isn’t required. This is the most prevalent argument you hear from Republicans today; yes, the party has lost two presidential elections in convincing fashion, but the fact that it retains control of the House and has a chance to retake the Senate majority in 2014 are a testament to the continued strength of the GOP’s messaging. But, holding a House majority in a deeply gerrymandered set of districts is not the same as winning a national presidential election. And the 2012 election proved that the massive gains the GOP made in the 2010 midterms are more the exception than the rule.

The diagnosis by Galston and Kamarck of what ails the Republican Party is not new; Wehner and former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson wrote a terrific piece for Commentary magazine this past spring entitled “How to Save the Republican Party” that makes many of the same arguments.

The problem for smart Republican strategists is not figuring out what’s wrong, but developing a real and pragmatic plan to fix it. Democrats fixed their problems of the 1980s with one man: Bill Clinton.

“There’s no substitute for a leader with the guts to break with outdated party orthodoxy, as Clinton did on trade, fiscal policy, welfare and crime among other issues,” Galston and Kamarck write. “And he did more than that: In that famous Sister Souljah episode, he spoke out against a tendency in the party’s base that crossed the line from protest to extremism.”

The obvious analog to Clinton in the modern Republican Party is former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Bush, like Clinton, spent much of his formative life as a governor and, on issues ranging from education to immigration, has shown a willingness to break from Republican orthodoxy and the party’s base.

Unlike Clinton, who long signaled his plan to run for president in advance of the 1992 race, Bush remains an elusive figure when it comes to his future plans. If Bush decides against a bid, there is no other obvious figure who fits the Clinton-circa-1992 mold, although Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) probably has the most chance to remake the Republican coalition among those candidates expected to run.

History has a way of repeating itself. Republicans would do well to realize that the Democratic Party of 1989 has many lessons to teach the GOP of today. And they would do well to realize it sooner rather than later."

Shear'],Obama Plans to Nominate 3 Judges for Key Court,"WASHINGTON — President Obama will soon accelerate his efforts to put a lasting imprint on the country’s judiciary by simultaneously nominating three judges to an important federal court, a move that is certain to unleash fierce Republican opposition and could rekindle a broader partisan struggle over Senate rules.

In trying to fill the three vacancies on the 11-member United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit at once, Mr. Obama will be adopting a more aggressive nomination strategy. He will effectively be daring Republicans to find specific ground to filibuster all the nominees.

White House officials declined to say who Mr. Obama’s choices will be ahead of an announcement that could come this week, but leading contenders for the spots appear to include Cornelia T. L. Pillard, a law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center; David C. Frederick, who often represents consumers and investors at the Supreme Court; and Patricia Ann Millett, a veteran appeals lawyer in Washington. All three are experienced lawyers who would be unlikely to generate controversy individually.

Several legal advocates who have been in communication with the West Wing said officials had repeatedly discussed those names in recent months."

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and his ilk that enough is enough. The Republicans interested in governance are now participants in the political scrum. The biggest of the conservative magazines, whose editors should know better, are too timid. They poke and prod here and there, but really stand up to the destructive right wing? No. They fear a full throttle debunking would put at risk their place in the conservative cosmos. They mistakenly believe that their role is to rebuke only liberals."

But you have the question mark: How is this person going to adjust to being on the other side?”

But, he added, “What struck me was how quickly and effectively Jay plunged into his new role, his ability and the energy he put into in defending the vice president.”

In early 2011, when Robert Gibbs, a longtime aide to Mr. Obama, resigned as White House press secretary, Mr. Carney was picked to succeed him.

Until now, Mr. Carney’s admirers and his detractors have given him credit him for avoiding the classic missteps often made by a spokesman forced to volley each day with the press on a range of topics — from the war in Syria to the federal budget to the president’s personal habits — in an hourlong televised event often peppered with preening reporters who seem to relish the opportunity to rough up the press secretary before the cameras.

White House press secretaries tend to come in two models: There is the consummate insider, like Mr. Gibbs; Jody Powell, who served during the presidency of Jimmy Carter; and James C. Hagerty, who served under Dwight D. Eisenhower — all men who had known and worked with their bosses for years. The other type, like Mr. Carney, Mr. Nessen or Larry Speakes, who worked for President Ronald Reagan, is often less involved in the development of policy or its packaging, but rather in selling it.

“Access is a two-edged sword,” said Bill Plante, a White House correspondent for CBS News. “If you are really in the inner circle, you are very guarded about what you give up. If you’re not in the inner circle, you are not going to have as much context for what you do say. Frankly I think the latter is preferable.”

Yet there also appears to be an unspoken expectation in the White House that Mr. Carney can somehow control the news-hungry animals with which he once shared the zoo, which is largely untrue."

And by cover, I mean walking for miles in bone-chilling cold and waiting for hours with hundreds of thousands of strangers to watch the proceedings on giant video screens.

Inauguration morning may have looked good on TV. The pomp, the crowds, the soaring rhetoric, the patriotic songs.

In real life, it involved rising before dawn to navigate barricaded streets with confused crowds given faulty directions by clueless volunteers and out-of-town police. I wound up so far back in the National Mall crowd I could barely hear or see.

I had barely defrosted from the Inaugural Parade — a two-hour wait for a 10-second glimpse of the commander-in-chief — when it was time to set out for the Inaugural Ball.

That too was not what you might think.

Barricades and checkpoints made it a three-mile walk from my hotel — in heels, at 26 degrees — to the Convention Center. There was no orchestra, no gourmet food, no carpet or chandeliers. Just a concrete cavern where 30,000 people in fancy clothes munched on pretzels and corn nuts, and waited in long lines for tickets to buy $10 mixed drinks.

If you timed it right and were situated to see over the crowd and sea of cellphone cameras, you might have been able to catch the First Couple’s dance on the fuzzy ballroom Jumbotron.

But at least I knew enough to prepare better this time around.

Four years ago, I braved the cold in a strapless dress, open-toed shoes and a shawl that covered my shoulders. I nearly froze waiting in line with the mink-coated ladies for cabs that ran out before my turn came.

Advertisement

This time, I wore a big coat, suede boots and a knit cap so warm that I didn’t mind that it made a mess of my hair.

I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised by this year’s proletariat style. There was a fairy-tale dimension to the celebration last time. But nothing is as magical the second time around.

Four years ago, there were almost 2 million people celebrating Barack Obama’s inauguration on the National Mall.

Advertisement

This time, the crowd was less than half that size. Beyoncé seemed to get the biggest applause. The president hadn’t even finished his speech before folks began streaming out.

Last time, there were dozens of “official” balls, with lavish buffets and photo stands where guests could pose for keepsakes in front of the presidential seal. The crowd was heavy with big names, big donors and politicos. It had the feel of a grown-up senior prom.

Advertisement

By comparison, Monday night’s bash made a mockery of the whole ball concept. Call it a reception, maybe. Or an open house. It had the vibe — with a DJ blaring Michael Jackson songs — of a high-spirited stadium concert.

But the crowd didn’t seem to mind.

Advertisement

I met an old black woman in a wheelchair, who shared her memories of the March on Washington from 50 years ago. And a multi-generational family from Ecuador, mom trying to keep tabs on her restless son while translating our chat for grandma.

When the music was good, I made my way through throngs of gay revelers celebrating on the dance floor. A lesbian couple drew me into their group, and a giddy young woman in froufrou pink planted a kiss on my cheek.

::

I could analyze the inaugural events for signs of how time has passed and how things have changed.

Advertisement

But the moment that struck and stays with me is simple and devoid of political import:

I’m shivering with the crowd on the National Mall, peering at the jumbo screen. We’ve dutifully applauded the procession of politicians and dignitaries.

Advertisement

Then Malia and Sasha appear, click-clacking down the Capitol stairs, eyes on their feet so they don’t trip. Cheers rise and I hear scattered calls:

“The girls!” from the elderly women next to me. “The girls!” from the flag-waving troupe of pre-teens aiming cellphones at the jumbo screen.

Advertisement

The girls. It’s what I’ve always called my daughters — and still do, though the youngest of the three is now 22. It’s a phrase that freezes them in place, binds sisters into a unit.

The Obama daughters are clearly outgrowing the shorthand.

Advertisement

Sasha is no longer the little kid who clings to Daddy when she’s tired; she’s a wisecracking 11-year-old with a budding sense of style. And Malia has finessed the awkward passage into adolescence, fashion-model pretty at 14, with her mother’s presence and her father’s smile.

We’re watching them grow up in the White House; and for all the trappings of privilege, they seem so ordinary, so natural, so unimpressed with it all.

Advertisement

The girls found the week’s festivities, at times, as boring as I did. They diddled with their cellphones, made faces into their cameras. Malia texted. Sasha yawned.

They could have been my daughters, or yours. We’ve embraced them as ours. They connect us to this president in a way that can’t be measured by politics or experienced at a ball.

Advertisement

The learning curve of a president is not much different, in some ways, from the learning curve of a father. Teenagers can be as intractable as John Boehner or Mitch McConnell.

Obama lamented to reporters this month that his daughters aren’t so keen anymore about having him around. I felt a twinge of sympathy; there are limits to his power.

For years they could shout down any attempt to point out the extent to which their policies favored the elite over the poor and the middle class; all they had to do was yell “Class warfare!” and Democrats scurried away. In the 2012 election, however, that didn’t work: the picture of the G.O.P. as the party of sneering plutocrats stuck, even as Democrats became more openly populist than they have been in decades.

As a result, prominent Republicans have begun acknowledging that their party needs to improve its image. But here’s the thing: Their proposals for a makeover all involve changing the sales pitch rather than the product. When it comes to substance, the G.O.P. is more committed than ever to policies that take from most Americans and give to a wealthy handful.

Consider, as a case in point, how a widely reported recent speech by Bobby Jindal the governor of Louisiana, compares with his actual policies.

Mr. Jindal posed the problem in a way that would, I believe, have been unthinkable for a leading Republican even a year ago. “We must not,” he declared, “be the party that simply protects the well off so they can keep their toys. We have to be the party that shows all Americans how they can thrive.” After a campaign in which Mitt Romney denounced any attempt to talk about class divisions as an “attack on success,” this represents a major rhetorical shift."

The deal, between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), fell short of the sweeping reforms sought largely by liberal senators and their allies at the start of the new Congress. The package of changes was expected to come to a vote late Thursday.

Excluded from the deal was a key component that would have required any senator wishing to conduct a filibuster to remain talking on the Senate floor in the style James Stewart made famous in the film “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”

Instead, the top Senate leaders have crafted a more modest agreement that would allow legislation to be more quickly brought up for debate, and limit debate over certain nominations from the White House, including those for judges on the circuit courts and positions of sub-Cabinet members.

The past few years have seen record numbers of filibusters, largely led by Republicans seeking to block President Obama’s agenda in the Senate in what has become an escalating procedural arms race. A filibuster can tie the chamber in knots because it only comes to an end with a 60-vote supermajority, which has proven difficult in this partisan era.

Even if the supermajority is reached, procedures still require at least three days for each filibuster to be overcome. Democrats also sought to obstruct then-President George W. Bush with the filibuster.

“The incremental ‘reforms’ in the agreement do not go nearly far enough to deliver meaningful change,” said a statement from Fix the Senate Now, a coalition of legal scholars and liberal activists that has pushed the issue. The group said the Senate “missed an opportunity to restore accountability and deliberation to the Senate, while not raising the costs of obstruction.”

To be sure, the agreement being forged between Reid and McConnell would help usher legislation along more swiftly in the slow-moving chamber.

Under the deal, senators would give up their ability to filibuster -- or hold endless debate -- on the procedural step that is required to proceed to a piece of legislation. In exchange for giving up the right to filibuster on the motion to proceed, both sides would be guaranteed the opportunity to offer two amendments to the bill -- a particularly important provision for the minority Republicans, who have long complained they are forced to filibuster because Reid blocks them from trying to amend bills with votes on provisions Democrats dislike.

Even though senators could still filibuster the actual bill, eliminating the filibuster on the procedural step would cut days off the debate time.

Over the years, senators have reached a gentlemen’s agreement not to press the requirement that they remain on the floor talking for any filibuster, as was the case in the Frank Capra classic, and that arrangement appeared to be holding on Thursday.

One aspect of the so-called “talking filibuster” would be put in place: Once the Senate achieves the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster and vote on a bill, senators would need to remain speaking on the floor if they refused to waive the 30 hours of final debate time that is allowed. But that change was expected to be a gentlemen’s agreement rather than an official rules change as senators and activists sought.

Once the vote threshold is reached to end a filibuster on White House nominees to district court, debate time would be reduced from 30 hours to two; for sub-Cabinet positions, it would be limited to eight hours.

“It’s not everything I wanted, and what we filed and advocated for, but I think this is progress in terms of making the institution work better,” said Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), who had led efforts with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) to change the filibuster rules.

The ability to filibuster has long been part of Senate history, and the ability to cut off debate with a supermajority was only allowed after a rule change in 1917, when then-President Woodrow Wilson sought to overcome Senate reservations about entering the post-World War I Treaty of Versailles. Then-Sen. Strom Thurmond’s record 24-hour filibuster stalled civil rights legislation.

The result has gummed up the Senate, a chamber the forefathers designed to move more slowly than the fiery House -- but perhaps not as slowly as this. But veteran senators have been hesitant to change the rules of the Senate, often considered the more institutional of the two chambers.

Prior To That', 'She Ran Coverage Of Local Politics In D.C.', 'State Politics In Virginia. As A Reporter', 'She Covered A Range Of Local', 'National Beats']",Sarah Palin lampoons D.C. at Faith and Freedom Coalition conference,"Before an adoring crowd of religious conservatives, Sarah Palin mocked recent scandals swirling around the Obama administration, performing her own version of a “Saturday Night Live” parody.

“They have this skit where they do this fake newscast, and they read this completely absurd news report and finish it with an incredulous ‘Really?’ ” Palin told the audience Saturday afternoon at the JW Marriott in downtown Washington. “As in, our government spied on every single one of your phone calls but it couldn’t find two pot-smoking, deadbeat Bostonians with a hotline to Terrorist Central in Chechnya.

“The IRS says it can’t figure out how it managed to spend more than $4 million on training conferences because it didn’t keep its receipts,” she said to uproarious laughter. “Really?”

“We’re gathering in a town that is awash in scandal,” said Palin, the closing speaker at the annual meeting of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. “In other words, just another Saturday afternoon in Washington, D.C.”

The Faith and Freedom Coalition, a 501(c)(4) organization, was founded in 2009 by Ralph Reed as a way to join together tea party activists and religious conservatives. The theme of the three-day conference was “Road to Majority” and featured a lineup of conservatives from Sen. Marco Rubio to Grover G. Norquist to Herman Cain.

Palin criticized Obama’s leadership, including his foreign policy efforts, and argued that the United States should not intervene in Syria, but instead “let Allah sort it out.”

“Where is our commander in chief?” she said. “We’re talking now more new interventions. I say until we know what we’re doing, until we have a commander in chief who knows what he’s doing, well, let these radical Islamic countries who aren’t even respecting basic human rights, where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line, ‘Allah Akbar,’ I say until we have someone who knows what they’re doing, I say let Allah sort it out.”

The line drew laughter from the audience.

Speaker after speaker offered strategies for conservatives to win control of Congress and the White House.

Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza who cut short his bid for the GOP nomination after he was accused of sexual harassment and having an extramarital affair, said he had a formula for winning. “ETA,” said Cain, with the flair of a man who became known for his “9-9-9” tax plan. He said the phrase was shorthand for “enthusiasm, targeted races and activists.”

Conservatives need to target races and cultivate fresh faces, he said. “We have got to stop sending nearly 90 percent of the people in D.C. back to D.C.,” said Cain, who has a radio talk show. “We should expand what we’ve already been doing. Create a groundswell of activists, and citizens and patriots.”

Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another former Republican presidential candidate, told the conference that conservative activists have “a long way to go” to make an impact on national politics and advised them to shift their tone.

“We stand for the principles that made America great,” Perry said. “We should exude those principals with joy. Smile when you disagree with a liberal. As Ronald Reagan said, liberals know so much that isn’t so. Our conservative convictions will win this country back if our tone shows we’re comfortable with our own ideals.”

Among the speakers who brought attendees to their feet was E.W. Jackson, a Chesapeake minister who was a virtual political unknown until a month ago, when he clinched the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia. Since then, liberals and some national GOP figures have bemoaned controversial Jackson comments, including his belief that Planned Parenthood has harmed black Americans more than the Ku Klux Klan and that gays and lesbians are “very sick people.”

Jackson offered a fiery 10 minutes on how the left is assaulting religious freedom and trying to redefine liberty.

“Freedom doesn’t mean ‘Do whatever you want.’ It’s the pursuit of character, integrity, decency, honor. Now we’re being told freedom is license,” he said.

Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate and former Alaska governor, had some harsh words for some GOP leaders who have blamed far right candidates for the party’s recent national losses.

“To our Republican leadership, you don’t marginalize, discredit and dismiss everyday, hardworking Americans,” she said. She urged tea party activists to keep at it. “Start on a local level affecting change, as you work on the higher levels of politicos,” she said. “Or do both. Just do both.”

Americans need to “rededicate” the country to “our one true heavenly Father,” said Palin, who is writing a book about faith and Christmas and returns to the airwaves Monday as part of the “Fox & Friends” program on Fox News. “If we rededicate our land to our Lord, things will turn around.”

Michele Bachmann says 'spanking the president' will take away his 'magic wand,' so there's that","You have looked directly into her eyes. Now your fate is sealed.

It's my prediction that the House Republicans could put themselves in a position where they could actually lose the gavel in 2014. Because I think the president—even by executive order—can again wave his magic wand before 2014, and he'd say now, all of the new legal Americans are going to have voting rights. Why do I say that? He did it in 2012! Do you remember, he—anyone who was here as a Latina under, uh, age 30, he said ""You get to vote!"" What? He decides you get to vote?

I'm going to miss Rep. Michele Bachmann after she's gone. There's really only a few other prominent Republicans—well, a few dozens, two or three hundred tops—who have such a tight connection to the conservative fringe and who aren't afraid to let their fringe flag fly. Here she is explaining her opposition to ""amnesty,"" if ""explaining"" is really the right word to use here Not sure what she's going on about, but she's apparently made up a new magical power that gives the president the impressive supposed ability to give non-citizens voting rights, a right usually reserved only for American citizens and certain large energy companies. This is done, as is befitting all imaginary things, via pointed magic stick. As for the separate conspiracy theory about how he already did that last November with young female brown folks that's largely unparsable, but sounds suspiciously like an ACORN and/or lightbulb and/or Illuminati-based theory. She's saying this to World Net Daily, though, I'm sure they know exactly which one of their 20 different conspiracy theories on that subject she might be talking about. These people have a language unknown to us mere mortals.

After that goes on to say that these new magic-wand-enabled suspiciously non-white voters will allow Democrats to control the House, Senate and White House in 2014, at which point the wolf will eat the sheep and the lion will punch the lamb and the few remaining Republicans will rove the landscape looking for scraps of food and cursing their new magic-having overlords. And the only way to avoid this new dystopia of the president waving his magic wand and allowing all the non-citizens to go to the voting ball in a giant voting pumpkin is to put him through a Congressional Spanking Machine and good lord I just do not even know how her mind works but:



This is working for the president. It's not working for the American people, but it's—hey, it's great by him, he has a perpetual magic wand and nobody's given him a spanking yet and taken it out of his hand. That's what Congress needs to do, give the president a major wake-up call, and the way we spank the president is we do it through the checkbook. We're the ones who say, ""No, you can't have the money!"" What's wrong with us?

Woo, boy.

All right, what have we learned? We learned that magic wands are subject to congressional budget resolutions, so that's something. We've learned that spanking beats magic, which never came up in the Harry Potter series but which really would have saved some considerable time had it been implemented. And we've learned that the reason the current Congress is so incompetent that they cannot even manage to keep the government running is because they are all off in their own little fantasy worlds, worlds of imaginary conspiracy theories that can be seen only by them, can be explained only by them, and set right only by them.

I don't suppose America would agree to just staging an important vote to lure them and then locking them all in the building forever as America's best-appointed loony bin? We could send food in through the mail slots, and we'd even keep the cameras running so that they would not die due to lack of media exposure.

Rubio says ""more government"" -- and Obama's plans -- will ""hold you back"" NEW: ""Unconstitutionally undermining"" Second Amendment rights is wrong, he adds The Floridian delivered the official Republican rebuttal to Obama's State of the Union He referenced his personal story as a son of immigrants, while touting GOP positions

Claiming Barack Obama thinks a “free enterprise economy” is “the cause of our problems” – not, as he sees it, the solution – Sen. Marco Rubio argued Tuesday that the president’s proposals would hurt middle class citizens more than help them.

“Mr. President, I don’t oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich,” the Florida Republican said in his rebuttal to Obama’s State of the Union address. “I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors.”

The 41-year-old lawmaker, viewed as a possible presidential candidate and declared by Time magazine as “The Republican Savior,” was tapped to give his party’s response to the speech.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, also rebutted Obama on behalf of the conservative tea party caucus.

Rubio largely kept to his prepared remarks, except when he abruptly stopped talking about halfway through to reach for a drink of water.

The son of Cuban immigrants referred emotively to his personal story and that of his family, though his policy criticisms and proposals were largely in line with prevailing mainstream and, in some cases, conservative Republican thinking.

On immigration, for instance, on which Rubio has been one of his party’s most outspoken proponents of efforts to “modernize” the current system, he didn’t mention his past support of a route to citizenship for undocumented immigrants now in the United States.

The senator did generally advocate “a responsible, permanent solution to the problem of those who are here illegally.” But he added that first, “we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws.”

Speaking about gun control measures, one of the most emotional parts of Obama’s State of the Union speech, Rubio said he was for “effectively” dealing with such violence, then added, “but unconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is not the way to do it.”

CNN Fact Check: Rubio says Obamacare needs a check up

He sharply criticized Obama on many fronts.

The president, Rubio claimed, had unfairly cast Republicans as opposing the environment and seniors, and only caring about rich people.

He contended that it was Obama who,if his plans are enacted, would hurt the majority of Americans by preventing the economy from growing.

“The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle class families,” Rubio said, referring to Obama. “It will cost them their raises. It will cost them their benefits. It may even cost some of them their jobs.”

His remarks often reflected the sharp partisan divide on budgetary matters.

Top Democrats, including Obama, have consistently said that increased government revenues should be paired with spending cuts to bring down the deficit.

Congress already raised tax rates on top income earners as part an agreement in January to avert the worst aspects of the so-called fiscal cliff. And now, Obama and Democrats want to eliminate some tax breaks and loopholes to further raise revenue.

Republican leaders have sought to reduce the size of government and, therefore, generally oppose any increase in tax revenue.

5 things we learned from the State of the Union

They have called for aggressive spending cuts and steps to overhaul entitlement programs, while rejecting any new attempts to increase revenue as part of further steps to reduce the deficit.

Obama’s “solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more,” Rubio said.

The president did, in fact, propose several new programs aimed at bolstering the economy, though he insisted they wouldn’t add to the deficit.

Opinion: Rubio missed the year of the woman

“The idea that more taxes and more government spending is the way to help hardworking middle-class taxpayers, that’s an old idea that has failed every time it’s been tried,” Rubio said. “More government isn’t going to help you get ahead. It’s going to hold you back.”

Rubio said he agreed with Obama on lowering the corporate tax rate, but didn’t mention the president’s support for closing tax loopholes that inordinately benefit the rich.

Rubio backed school choice for all parents and said that student financial aid should evolve to help more “nontraditional students.”

Talk Back: Is giving the State of the Union the political ‘kiss of death’?

On energy policy, the senator derided Obama’s administration for “wasting … taxpayer money on so-called clean energy ventures like Solyndra.” Rubio favors “reform” of energy regulations and opening up “more federal lands for safe and responsible (oil and gas) exploration,” both common Republican themes.

He spoke, too, of Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors, arguing that changes are needed for it to continue. The president suggested he’d support “modest reform” of this entitlement program, but Rubio said Obama does not go far enough.

“I would never support any changes to Medicare that would hurt seniors like my mother,” he said. “But anyone who is in favor of leaving Medicare exactly the way it is right now is in favor of bankrupting it.”

Near the end of his speech, Rubio prayed that Democrats and Republicans “can come together to solve our problems,” contending that, if they don’t, the consequences will be stark.

“If we can get our economy healthy again, our children will be the most prosperous Americans ever,” Rubio said. “And if we do not, we will forever be known as the generation responsible for America’s decline.”

The pace of modern politics and the desire of journalists (scourges!) to always look ahead to the next campaign put a reelected incumbent in a race against irrelevancy from the second he is sworn in again. Scandals tend to creep in or escalate — Watergate, Iran-Contra, Monica Lewinsky — and investigations follow, often drifting far afield. Momentum toward any meaningful achievement fades.

Usually, a president has until the midterm elections of his second term to get big things done; after that, attention moves on to deciding who will next occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. But Obama may not have the luxury of even that truncated timeline. The split control in Congress — Democrats in charge in the Senate, a Republican majority in the House — combined with the tea party’s continued demand for conservative purity from its elected officials and the politicization of just about everything makes it hard to imagine that 2014 will afford Obama any chance to move his agenda through Congress. And his addition of John Podesta, a vocal advocate of taking executive action to end-run lawmakers, to the White House staff suggests that the president has effectively given up trying to work with the Hill.

All of which makes what happened — or more accurately, what didn’t happen — in 2013 that much more dire for Obama’s chances of leaving a lasting legacy on his party, Washington and politics more broadly.

Let’s start from the beginning, or a bit earlier. Despite a tenuous economic recovery and an unpopular health-care law, Obama surged to a convincing win in November 2012. The victory gave him a mandate to continue in the vein of his first four years, as well as providing a damning assessment of the GOP’s ability to attract any voters other than white men.

Obama used that momentum to cut a favorable deal with Republicans to avert the “fiscal cliff,” and he was able to unite the country after the horrific murder of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

On Jan. 1, then, it wasn’t difficult to imagine the passage of a broad gun-control measure, an immigration reform package, and a series of bills addressing the country’s debt and spending issues. The reasons none of these things came to be all lead back to Obama."
http://news.yahoo.com/politicians-beating-latest-polls-133806385.html,,[],Politicians take a beating in latest polls,"Polling numbers are starting to roll in after last week’s deal in Washington to end the shutdown and raise the debt ceiling. And it looks like the folks on Capitol Hill face some historically bad numbers that could foreshadow a rocky midterm election in 2014.

In a CNN/ORC International poll released Monday morning, the backlash seems to be mostly against Republicans, but other recent surveys spread the blame more equally.

The CNN poll said that 31 percent of those surveyed had more faith in House Republicans than President Obama to handle major problems facing the country. In comparison, 44 percent of people had more faith in President Obama.

That is actually a worse number than the GOP received in 1996, when Republicans faced criticism for a government shutdown that featured Speaker Newt Gingrich taking on President Bill Clinton. The bad feelings against the GOP in 1996 were seen as a contributing factor in Bob Dole’s defeat in that year’s election against Clinton.

Also in the CNN poll, 12 percent of people thought Congress was doing a good job, a number near its historic low of 10 percent, which was set last month. Back during the 1995-1996 shutdown, the congressional approval rating stood at 30 percent.

And in two other questions that might concern Republicans, the favorability rating of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, was up 4 percentage points from late September, despite headlines about its website problems and withering attacks on the ACA by Republicans.

Americans also are clearly unhappy with John Boehner, with 63 percent saying he should be removed as Speaker of the House.

A Pew Research poll from last week showed low numbers for President Obama and Democrats, as well as the Republicans.

“Approval ratings for President Obama (43 percent approve), Democratic congressional leaders (31 percent) and GOP leaders (20 percent) all are at or near all-time lows, yet are not substantially more negative than they were in early September, a month before the shutdown started,” Pew said.

Story continues

Pew said the 20 percent approval rating for GOP leaders was driven by unrest among Republicans.

In the Pew survey, 74 percent of Americans wanted to see most members of Congress defeated if they ran for re-election. That is a record in the survey for data gathered back to 1990 about midterm elections. (The previous record was 57 percent in 1996.)

Over at Gallup, polling data released Monday show that President Obama’s approval rating was down after the debt debacle, but not at its historic low.

It stands at 44.5 percent in his 19th quarter as president. In comparison, President George W. Bush had a 43.9 percent rating as the same point in his second term.

During the shutdown, other polls showed growing dissatisfaction with Congress.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said 60 percent of those Americans surveyed said they would replace the entire Congress in the same election if they could—including their own representative. About 31 percent of those polled blamed Obama for the budget breakdown, while 44 percent blamed Republicans in Congress.

A Fox News poll from October 3 found that the disapproval rating of Congress stood at 81 percent. Fox said 45 percent of Americans had a favorable view of Democrats, in general, with the Republicans stood at 35 percent.

Another Gallup poll showed the favorability of the GOP fell 10 percent between September and October, to 28 percent, its lowest rating since Gallup started asking the question in 1992. The Democrats were down 4 percent to 43 percent for the same time period.

And in a telltale sign, 25 percent of Americans said they didn’t like either party.

About 60 percent of Americans—the same number that would vote out Congress—would favor the creation of a third political party.

He attended a pre-inaugural party with Democrats from Iowa, the first caucus state, and invited the governor of New Hampshire, the first primary state, to his private swearing-in ceremony. In two other likely early primary states, he will address the Democratic State Convention in South Carolina next month and appear at a testimonial for the retiring Senator Carl Levin in Michigan. He is enlisting candidates and collecting money for midterm elections.

“He is already generating lots of good will among House Democrats and Democratic candidates across the country,” said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “He is diving into races. He is making recruiting calls. He is fund-raising. He is firing up our core supporters across the country.”

Aides said Mr. Biden would do those things regardless of his own ambitions. And the preliminary moves do not address the more fundamental challenge: How would he run against Mrs. Clinton, who seemed to be Mr. Obama’s anointed heir in a joint interview they gave to the CBS program “60 Minutes” earlier this year? Mr. Biden would not have exclusive claim to the Obama legacy and, like any vice president, he would need to distinguish himself from the departing president. He could run to the left of her, emphasizing a more populist approach. Or he could run as the insurance policy in case she does not run or if she falters.

It is not clear that a presidential campaign makes sense for Mr. Biden, who would turn 74 shortly after the 2016 general election and 82 before the end of a second term.

But it is in his interest to keep the option open as long as possible to maintain his influence and to see what Mrs. Clinton decides to do. The moment Mr. Biden declares he will not run, he becomes a lame-duck No. 2 in a lame-duck administration."

Mr. Weiner, not known for his equanimity, responded by telling Mr. McDonald that he had “anger issues.”

Mr. McDonald has been outspoken in his disdain for Mr. Weiner, who resigned from Congress in 2011 after sending sexually explicit messages to women online.

Bird’s new organization, “Battleground Texas,” will target Hispanic voters in the state to try to swing the Lone Star state in the direction of Democrats. Texas has for a long time been a Republican Party stronghold, and its 38 electoral college votes are crucial to any GOP presidential candidate’s run for office. If Texas becomes a battleground or Democratic Party state, Republican presidential candidates may be in dire danger. They’d have to spend time and money campaigning in the state, taking their focus off states that are already hotly contested.

Bird appears to understand this, and that’s why he’s targeting the state. “With its diversity and size, Texas should always be a battleground state where local elections are vigorously contested and anyone who wants to be our commander in chief has to compete and show they reflect Texas values. Yet for far too long, the state’s political leaders, both in Austin and in Washington, D.C., have failed to stand for Texans,” Bird told Politico. “Over the next several years, Battleground Texas will focus on expanding the electorate by registering more voters — and as importantly, by mobilizing Texans who are already registered voters but who have not been engaged in the democratic process.”

Politico quoted several anonymous Democratic consultants who said Bird plans to bring in top campaign talent and make a serious effort at competing in the state.

Republicans, on the other hand, are still regaining their footing after the beat down they endured in the last election cycle – and didn’t have a specific plan when Breitbart News asked for one.

Washington (CNN) - In a potential preview of the next presidential election, a new national poll suggests Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie would be neck and neck if the 2016 contest were held today.

But a CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday also indicates Clinton leading eight other possible Republican White House hopefuls in hypothetical general election matchups.



According to the poll, 48% of registered voters say they would support support Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, if he were the GOP nominee, with 46% saying they would back Clinton, the former secretary of state, U.S. senator, and first lady, if she captured the Democratic nomination. Christie's 2-point margin is within the survey's sampling error. The CNN poll is the third non-partisan, live operator national survey conducted this month to indicate a possible matchup between Clinton and Christie basically all tied up.

If she decides to run, Clinton would instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. And Christie, fresh off his landslide re-election last month as New Jersey governor, is on top of the pack in recent polls of the race for the Republican nomination.

So what's the secret of Christie's strength against Clinton?

""He performs particularly well among independents, winning nearly six in 10 in that key group,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland siad. ""He also wins a majority of suburbanites and older voters, something that no other GOP hopeful [that was] tested was able to do against Clinton.""

""Christie doesn't win in the Northeast, although he does hold Clinton to a bare majority there, but he has a solid edge in the Midwest while playing Clinton to a draw in the South and West,"" Holland said.

Not surprisingly, the survey indicates a gender gap: Christie has a 14-point lead among men but loses women to Clinton by 10 points.

Clinton leads in other 2016 showdowns

The statistical tie between the Garden State governor and the former secretary of state is pretty remarkable compared to how Christie's potential GOP rivals do against Clinton in the CNN poll at this early stage of the game.

Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, loses to Clinton by eight percentage points. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky trails by 13 points. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a 2008 GOP presidential candidate, is down by 15 points.

And it doesn't get any better for the GOP from there.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who ran for the nomination in the last election, is down 17 points to Clinton; freshman Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas trails by 18 points; Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rick Santorum, a 2012 GOP presidential candidate and former senator from Pennsylvania, are 19 points behind; and former two-term Florida Gov. Jeb Bush faces a 21-point gap between himself and Clinton

.

One thing to remember: Surveys taken this early in a presidential cycle are often heavily influenced by name recognition.

""Keep in mind that polls taken so many years before an election have little or no predictive value,"" Holland said.

The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from December 16-19, with 950 registered voters nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points."

But to turn public opinion in his favor, Obama’s goons trucked in barricades to keep out World War II vets and other visitors. By one estimate, the barricades and workers cost $100,000.

The same punish-the-people attitude led to shutdowns of other parks and historic sites that get no federal funding.

“We’ve been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. It’s disgusting,” a Park Service ranger told The Washington Times.

The ranger cited the order to close the parking lot at George Washington’s home in Mount Vernon so visitors couldn’t use it. The cheap trick captured the contrast between a revered president and the current one.

I’ve been saying for a while that there is no bottom to Obama. He’s not just ruthless. He’s without scruples and honor.

However the shutdown ends, it will bring only a temporary respite from the crisis atmosphere in Washington. When it comes to his countrymen, Obama always chooses conflict over cooperation.

Meanwhile, Jimmy Carter can rest easy. We have a new worst president.

Instead, the vanquished Republican nominee spent the day at home in La Jolla, out of sight if not quite out of mind.

Former campaign aides said they had no details on how Romney spent his day, or whether he was among the millions of TV viewers who watched the events in Washington from afar.

But his absence from public view was consistent with the low profile Romney has kept since being soundly defeated by President Obama in both the Electoral College and popular vote.

The former Massachusetts governor surfaced soon after the election, telling a group of donors that Obama had won reelection thanks to “gifts” the administration had given to blacks, Hispanics and young voters. (Romney was apparently unaware that reporters were listening in on the conference call.)

QUIZ: How much do you know about presidential inaugurations?

Since then, there have been occasional Romney sightings: pumping gas in San Diego, visiting Disneyland with family members — one photo captured the former candidate in a rollercoaster car hanging on in a seat behind sons Craig and Josh; taking in a screening of the new “Twilight” movie in Del Mar, and stocking up on paper towels, wrapping paper and V8 juice in early December.

Appearing in a more formal setting, Romney stopped by for lunch at the White House in late November, joining the president for a private conversation over white turkey chili and grilled chicken salad. Romney left without speaking to reporters.

He has also been largely absent from the social media sphere. Romney’s last tweet, to more than 1.6 million followers, was on Nov 10, thanking supporters and saying he would be “forever grateful to every one of you.” On Christmas Day, he posted the photo from his family Christmas card of himself and his wife, Ann, surrounded by their 18 grandchildren, the girls in hot pink dresses and the boys in teal polo shirts.

While Romney lay low Monday, his former running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, congratulated the president via Twitter, saying he joined the country “in celebrating this American tradition.” He offered a more expansive posting on his Facebook page.

“We may disagree on matters of policy,” Ryan wrote. “But today we remember why we take those matters so seriously — because we seek the public good. It’s our highest duty — one that we share — and one for which we’re grateful.”

Within hours, Ryan had accumulated more than 200 “likes.”

C-Span ratings would go through the Capitol dome, giving Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s “Veep” a run for its money.

It was sweet justice for a man who was the victim of friendly fire from White House aides after he blurted out his support for gay marriage during the campaign while the president was still dithering, spurring Obama to do the right thing. From the beginning of their alliance in 2008, Biden felt passionately that he needed to interpret the dispassionate Obama for regular folk. It was an attitude that probably annoyed Obama, who does not like to feel dependent or beholden, having fought his way up in the world mostly under his own steam.

But when Obama let Biden take over the cliff talks, and when he noted with asperity that he would not debate Congress again over paying its bills, he dug into his revulsion at playing the game, his reluctance to even fake the flattering, schmoozing and ring-kissing needed to coax Congress into doing what he wants.

Even members of his own party have lost faith in his ability to use the White House as a social lubricant to get his agenda passed, or to use that big brain of his to become a more clever negotiator, rather than a scolding lecturer.

“His inability to engage the politicians here has been a real liability,” one Democratic lawmaker complained. It’s odd, given that he was renowned for making a group of egotists feel that they were being heeded at The Harvard Law Review.

The vice president was in the Senate for 36 years while the president merely breezed through. Obama radiates contempt at Congress for not being a bunch of high-minded, effective people, and for expecting him to clean up its mess. He thinks reasonable people should see things his way in a reasonable amount of time, and gets impatient when ideology, ego, identity politics and pork-project whining hold up progress.

Biden is a realist. He understands lawmakers’ limitations, motivations and needs. He leans right in and speaks — and speaks and speaks — their language. That’s who he is. And he believes, as creaky and unwieldy as the system is, that it still has integrity. More Rocky than Spocky, Biden can spread everything out on the table and negotiate his way through all of his former colleagues’ shortcomings, weaknesses, fears and frailties."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/08/cory-booker-announces-senate-candidacy-saturday/,2013-06-08 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Cory Booker announces Senate candidacy Saturday,"8 years ago

(CNN) - Newark, New Jersey Mayor Cory Booker on Saturday declared his candidacy for the Senate in this year's special election to fill the seat of the late Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg.

Booker's campaign sent out an email release the day before stating that the mayor would make an announcement regarding his candidacy at the event in Newark, followed by a similar event a few hours later in the southern part of the Garden State.

At Saturday's news conference, Booker cited a track record of compromise as Mayor of Newark as an example of how he can help change gridlock in Washington.

""I am here because I believe that people who care, can find solutions to even the most difficult problems. I am here because when we work together, I know from experience that there is no problem we can't solve,"" Booker said.

Lautenberg died Monday at age 89 and was buried on Friday at Arlington National Cemetery. On Tuesday New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced plans to hold a special Senate election this year, with the Democratic and Republican primaries on August 13 and the general election on October 16. The winner would serve the final 14 1/2 months of Lautenberg's term. An election to a full six-year term will be in November 2014.

CNN reported Thursday that Booker had begun collecting signatures to run in the special election. Candidates hoping to run in the race must hand in 1,000 signatures by 4 p.m. ET on Monday.

Booker, considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, earlier this year announced he was exploring a run for Senate in 2014. He made the news before Lautenberg announced he would not run for re-election.

Booker will become the second Democrat to formally jump into the race. Rep. Rush Holt, who's in his eight term representing New Jersey's 12th Congressional District, said in a statement that on Thursday that, ""I ask for your support as I seek to serve as your Senator in that seat. The reason is simple: I believe I am the best candidate to continue the passionate advocacy for progressive values that Sen. Lautenberg exemplified.""

Rep. Frank Pallone, who's also considered likely to make a bid, has not made any announcements. A Democratic source with knowledge of Pallone's thinking told CNN ""an announcement will be forthcoming"" but added that it would come after the late senator's funeral process is over, ""out of respect to Lautenberg, who was a close friend to the congressman.""

Pallone has the biggest war chest of the three Democrats, with approximately $3 million cash on hand. Booker, who is seen as the favorite in the Democratic nomination battle and who has the potential to raise a large sum of money thanks to his star power and national connections, currently has a smaller war chest than Pallone, with Holt having around $700,000 in the bank.

On the GOP side, former Bogota, New Jersey, Mayor Steve Lonegan says he'll run. Other possible candidates include Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, Rep. Jon Runyan, and biotech executive John Crowley. State senators Joe Kyrillos and Tom Kean Jr., who have both run for the Senate in the past, seem to be leaning against making another bid this time around. Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnic has said he won't run.

Christie on Thursday appointed state Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa, a fellow Republican, to serve as interim senator until the October election but Chiesa said he won't run.

As for Booker, he challenged critics Saturday who say Washington can't be fixed, a sure campaign theme of his going forward.

""We in New Jersey know a thing or two about toughness, about resiliency and strength. I know this and I've seen it over and over at every point in my career as an elected official. I know the truth of who we are when we are together and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, especially here in New Jersey, that there is nothing we can't do together,"" Booker said.

USA TODAY

Fundraising dropped for two-thirds of new House Republicans who led effort to dismantle Obamacare

Several Tea Party-aligned incumbents face primary challengers

Business groups increase political involvement with centrist Republicans

WASHINGTON — Campaign donations to some of the House's most prominent Tea Party insurgents tumbled in recent months, and several of the chamber's most conservative new members struggled to match the fundraising pace of their business-backed primary challengers, new campaign filings show.

Fundraising fell in the July-to-September fundraising quarter for two-thirds of the 42 House Republicans elected since 2010 who signed an August letter that urged House leaders to tie dismantling the Affordable Care Act to a bill funding the government, a USA TODAY analysis shows. That letter, circulated by first-term Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., helped ignite the budget showdown that shuttered parts of the government for 16 days this month.

In Detroit's upscale Oakland County suburbs, first-term Republican Rep. Kerry Bentivolio raised $59,177, a 10% drop from his haul in the previous fundraising quarter. In less than a month on the campaign trail, Bentivolio's primary challenger, lawyer David Trott, raised nearly $650,000. Trott tapped $200,000 of his own funds plus donations from prominent business leaders in Michigan, including billionaire Amway heir Dick DeVos.

In Florida, first-term Rep. Ted Yoho, who argued that a debt default would ""stabilize the world's markets,"" took in $51,000 during the third quarter, down from $117,900 during the previous three months.

Another Tea Party-aligned lawmaker, two-term Tennessee Rep. Scott DesJarlais, failed to match the fundraising pace of his GOP primary challenger, state Sen. Jim Tracy. Tracy ended September with nearly five times the cash reserves of DesJarlais, whose support among the party's establishment eroded after a series of personal scandals.

""This could be the beginning of the revenge of Main Street,"" said Jack Pitney, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif. Republicans rode a wave of Tea Party anger with the health care law and bank bailouts to take control of the House in 2010, he said, but ""a lot of mainstream Republicans are starting to worry that Tea Party Republicans are costing the party more than the support they bring in.""

In recent weeks, primary challengers to Tea Party-aligned incumbents have emerged in at least other three other congressional districts — in North Carolina, Alabama and in western Michigan. In Michigan, Rep. Justin Amash, a rising star among conservatives who was part of an attempted coup this year against House Speaker John Boehner, faces investment manager Brian Ellis. (Ellis entered the race in October after the books closed on the third fundraising quarter of the year.)

The fundraising reports come as a growing number of Washington trade groups, typically aligned with Republicans in Congress, have raised concerns about the economic toll of Washington's fiscal crises. Several business leaders say they are considering backing primary challengers to Tea Party incumbents.

""Our members are going to be a lot more active because they are getting frustrated,"" said the National Retail Federation's chief lobbyist, David French, citing the recent fiscal showdown and the ""general sense of dysfunction in Washington.""

He said it's too soon to put a precise price tag on the shutdown's cost to the industry, but retailers are worried about the effect of recurring budget confrontations on consumer confidence as the nation heads into the $602 billion holiday retail season. ""Pessimistic and disengaged consumers are not good for retail,"" French said.

The National Association of Manufacturers plans to host a fundraiser this year for Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, an eight-term Republican. He faces a primary challenge from Bryan Smith, a lawyer backed by the anti-tax Club for Growth and Tea Party-affiliated FreedomWorks. Both groups have supported Republican upstarts in recent elections and called this week for lawmakers to vote against the Senate-brokered deal that ended the partial government shutdown.

FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe denounced the agreement as ""complete surrender,"" because it failed to delay or disrupt the health care law.

In the end, Simpson was one of 87 House Republicans who voted for the compromise. ""The easiest, most politically expedient thing for me to do would have been to vote 'no' and protect my political right flank,"" he said in a statement. ""Doing so, however, would have been the wrong thing to do for my constituents and our economy.""

Simpson, a veteran appropriator and Boehner ally, is ahead in the money race. He raised $437,000 in the July-to-September fundraising period — including $4,000 from Boehner, federal records show. Smith collected nearly $276,000.

Asked about Simpson's fundraising edge, Smith campaign manager Carrie Brown said in an e-mail that she's ""confident that as voters become aware of Mike Simpson's liberal voting record and support for higher taxes and more spending that they will support Bryan in next year's primary.""

Russ Walker, FreedomWorks' political director, said the early fundraising advantage of Republicans in the party's business-oriented wing, doesn't mean they will prevail.

""Money can't buy the support of the grass roots,"" he said. ""After these last several weeks, the grass roots will be more fired up than ever to replace the guys in D.C. who favor the status quo.""

Campaign-finance reports released this week do not cover candidates' fundraising during the partial government shutdown, which began Oct. 1. Some Tea Party-aligned lawmakers saw an increase in campaign funds during the third quarter. Meadows, the freshman Republican from North Carolina who first circulated the letter seeking to link the Affordable Care Act to continued government funding, saw a 49% increase in his total receipts over the previous quarter.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who became the public face of the fight against the health care law after leading a 21-hour filibuster-style Senate speech in late September, collected nearly $1.2 million for his Senate re-election committee and leadership PAC, from July 1 through Sept. 30. That's roughly on par with his previous fundraising."
http://news.yahoo.com/palin-new-jersey-wwii-memorial-175935879.html,,[],"Sarah Palin stands with WWII vets, stumps for N.J. Senate candidate","Sarah Palin returned to the national stage over the weekend at a pair of public events highlighting the tea party's fight against President Barack Obama.



On Saturday, Palin and her Tea Party Express bus rolled into New Jersey to stump for Steve Lonegan, the Republican Senate candidate running against Newark Mayor Cory Booker in Wednesday's special election to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Frank Lautenburg's death in June.



A poll released last week by Quinnipiac University showed Booker's lead over Lonegan — which was 28 points in August — has been cut to 12. According to the New York Times, Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota, N.J., has surged ""by framing the election as a referendum on Mr. Booker’s celebrity.""



“My opponent, Cory Booker, was anointed by Hollywood,"" Lonegan said. ""He was anointed by Oprah.""



Yet it was Lonegan who called on Palin's star power on Saturday.



More than 2,000 people turned out at a racetrack to see the former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate praise the GOP's stance against Obama's Affordable Care Act and bash the closing of war memorials during the shutdown.



“But Michelle Obama’s really groovy ‘Let’s Move!’ video is still up and running, because you can’t be chubby,” Palin said. ""And our government thinks they can shut down our memorials that honor our vets? For shame.""



Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Gov. Rick Perry have both campaigned for Lonegan, but their popularity pales in comparison to Palin, who has a combined 4.7 million followers on Facebook and Twitter. The last time Palin appeared at a Tea Party Express rally was in 2012.



“Something big is happening here,"" Palin said of Lonegan's surge. “The country knows it, the media knows it.”



At one point, Palin compared the legality of Obamacare to the Prohibition-era ban on alcohol. “I believe now you can get a beer with your famous New Jersey pizza,"" Palin said.



On Sunday, Palin appeared at the World War II and Lincoln Memorials with Sen. Ted Cruz in Washington, D.C., where she continued her rant against the White House.



""We're here to show that the size of America's heart for our veterans is immeasurable,"" Palin said. ""But look around. Barricades to shut down our memorials? Is this how a commander in chief expresses his gratitude? This 'shutdown' priority proves a shameful lack of respect.""

Palin then quoted former President Ronald Reagan.

""Ronald Reagan said, 'Some people live an entire lifetime wondering if they ever made a difference in the world,'"" she said. ""You vets need never ask that of yourselves. You made all the difference. Our war memorials remind us of the cost to keep us free. You paid the price. Rest now. We will pick up the mantle. We won't let you down. We now take up the fight for freedom."""

The Republican candidate, Joe Lhota, campaigned on warnings that De Blasio, a staunch liberal who has served as the city’s public advocate since 2010, would drag New York back to the days of sky-high crime, no-go neighborhoods and racial tension.

But throughout the campaign, opinion polls showed Lhota, who was deputy mayor under Rudolph Giuliani and who last year served as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, lagging about 40 percentage points behind De Blasio.

De Blasio, 52, went to his polling place with his wife and children, who became something of a campaign issue when critics accused the Democrat of exploiting their multi-racialism. De Blasio’s wife is black, he is white, and his telegenic son and daughter proved a hit with voters when they starred in TV ads for their father.

“This morning is an extraordinary moment for me and my family,” De Blasio said after voting. “It has been a very, very long journey, and to get to this morning at our polling site, in our neighborhood, to finally cast our vote is an incredibly emotional moment.”

Lhota said he would not have changed anything about his campaign, even though political experts said he was a lackluster candidate who waited too long to attack De Blasio as soft on crime.

“Everything I’ve done I wanted to,” Lhota, 59, said after voting in Brooklyn. “I’m very optimistic about tonight.”

The election closed out a campaign with no shortage of unexpected twists, including the May arrival into the Democratic primary race of disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner, who was forced to resign his congressional seat in 2011 amid a sexting scandal, shook up a Democratic field that had long been led by the City Council speaker, Christine Quinn.

Quinn, hoping to become the city’s first female and first openly gay mayor, lost ground to Weiner. She suffered further as the other Democrats seized on her close relationship with the outgoing mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, and blamed her for enabling him to serve a third term.

As Weiner lost backers after admitting to more online relationships with women, much of his support went to De Blasio.

De Blasio also won points with black and Latino New Yorkers by bashing as racial profiling the police department’s stop-and-frisk tactic in high-crime neighborhoods.

De Blasio vowed to fire the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, if elected. He also said he would fund educational programs with a tax on New York residents earning $500,000 a year – something that would require state legislative action.

Both promises helped catapult him over six other candidates to clinch the ballot spot without a runoff.

Lhota’s closest primary rival was a billionaire supermarket magnate, John Catsimatidis, a political novice. He portrayed Lhota as a heartless cat-hater after the former transit chief questioned the wisdom of officials closing a subway line for hours so that kittens lost on the track could be saved.

“I’m not the anti-kitten candidate,” Lhota declared as he sought to defend himself at one of the Republican debates.

In the end, he easily defeated Catsimatidis on primary day, but he never was able to make a dent in De Blasio’s huge lead.

The Democrat had a built-in advantage because of the city’s political makeup. Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 5 to 1. De Blasio also benefited from the controversy over stop-and-frisk, which many blacks and Latinos – who overwhelmingly support De Blasio – say unfairly targets them.

In addition, polls showed that voters were ready for a change after 12 years under Bloomberg, whom De Blasio portrayed as out-of-touch with working-class New Yorkers.

He and Lhota both tried to present themselves as far different from Bloomberg, whom they portrayed as Manhattan-centric and too focused on billionaires and big business to notice regular residents’ problems.

Bloomberg did not endorse either candidate, saying he didn’t want to interfere in the race, but said Tuesday he believed he was leaving the nation’s largest city in good shape.

“We’ve made a lot of progress that I don’t think should be turned back,” said Bloomberg, whose legacy will include a legal battle over one of his most controversial moves: the banning of super-size sugary drinks to combat obesity in the city. De Blasio has said he supports the effort; Lhota opposed it.

Bloomberg, who was elected as a Republican but switched to an independent, won praise from many moderate Democrats for pushing for stricter gun control measures nationwide – a fight he was able to fund with his own wealth – and for making the city more pedestrian-friendly with bike lanes and pedestrian malls.

But as demographic shifts brought more racial diversity to New York and raised the number of Democrats, even fans of Bloomberg said it was time to take the city in another direction.

“I like what he’s done for the city in terms of the bike lanes and bringing businesses here, and I think he’s right to worry about our health,” said Jonathan Simpson, who voted for Bloomberg in past elections. “But New York is more than a bunch of skyscrapers and rich people in Manhattan, so that’s why I think we need to have someone totally different like De Blasio in office for awhile.”

Bloomberg said he wasn’t worried about the changes that the next mayor might bring, noting that candidates often make promises that fall by the wayside.

“The real issue is not what they said during the campaigns,” Bloomberg said after voting. “The real issue is what do they do when they get elected?”

Overall%2C roughly 58 percent of the nation%27s voters participated in 2012 election

Blacks and whites are expected to remain biggest racial groups of voters



Black voter turnout fell below historic levels in 2004

WASHINGTON (AP) — America's blacks voted at a higher rate than other minority groups in 2012 and by most measures surpassed the white turnout for the first time, reflecting a deeply polarized presidential election in which blacks strongly supported Barack Obama while many whites stayed home.

Had people voted last November at the same rates they did in 2004, when black turnout was below its current historic levels, Republican Mitt Romney would have won narrowly,according to an analysis conducted for The Associated Press.

Census data and exit polling show that whites and blacks will remain the two largest racial groups of eligible voters for the next decade. Last year's heavy black turnout came despite concerns about the effect of new voter-identification laws on minority voting, outweighed by the desire to re-elect the first black president.

William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, analyzed the 2012 elections for the AP using census data on eligible voters and turnout, along with November's exit polling. He estimated total votes for Obama and Romney under a scenario where 2012 turnout rates for all racial groups matched those in 2004. Overall, 2012 voter turnout was roughly 58 percent, down from 62 percent in 2008 and 60 percent in 2004.

The analysis also used population projections to estimate the shares of eligible voters by race group through 2030. The numbers are supplemented with material from the Pew Research Center and George Mason University associate professor Michael McDonald, a leader in the field of voter turnout who separately reviewed aggregate turnout levels across states, as well as AP interviews with the Census Bureau and other experts. The bureau is scheduled to release data on voter turnout in May.

Overall, the findings represent a tipping point for blacks, who for much of America's history were disenfranchised and then effectively barred from voting until passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

But the numbers also offer a cautionary note to both Democrats and Republicans after Obama won in November with a historically low percentage of white supporters. While Latinos are now the biggest driver of U.S. population growth, they still trail whites and blacks in turnout and electoral share, because many of the Hispanics in the country are children or noncitizens.

In recent weeks, Republican leaders have urged a ""year-round effort"" to engage black and other minority voters, describing a grim future if their party does not expand its core support beyond white males.

The 2012 data suggest Romney was a particularly weak Republican candidate, unable to motivate white voters let alone attract significant black or Latino support. Obama's personal appeal and the slowly improving economy helped overcome doubts and spur record levels of minority voters in a way that may not be easily replicated for Democrats soon.

Romney would have erased Obama's nearly 5 million-vote victory margin and narrowly won the popular vote if voters had turned out as they did in 2004, according to Frey's analysis. Then, white turnout was slightly higher and black voting lower.

More significantly, the key states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida and Colorado would have tipped in favor of Romney, handing him the presidency if the outcome of other states remained the same.

""The 2012 turnout is a milestone for blacks and a huge potential turning point,"" said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who has written extensively on black politicians. ""What it suggests is that there is an 'Obama effect' where people were motivated to support Barack Obama. But it also means that black turnout may not always be higher, if future races aren't as salient.""

Whit Ayres, a Republican consultant who is advising Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a possible 2016 presidential contender, says the last election reaffirmed that the Republican Party needs ""a new message, a new messenger and a new tone."" Change within the party need not be ""lock, stock and barrel,"" Ayres said, but policy shifts such as Republican support for broad immigration legislation will be important to woo minority voters over the longer term.

""It remains to be seen how successful Democrats are if you don't have Barack Obama at the top of the ticket,"" he said."

These children and grandchildren of prominent politicians went on to launch their own political careers.

The two major parties here don’t agree on many things. One of them is that it is only a matter of time before Georgia goes from being a Republican stronghold to a state that is up for grabs.

In next year’s elections, Democrats will be looking to speed that process along with a couple of candidates who bring fresh faces and familiar names.

They are Senate contender Michelle Nunn, an executive who is also the daughter of former senator Sam Nunn, and gubernatorial hopeful Jason Carter, a third-term state senator who is a grandson of former president Jimmy Carter.

Nunn and Carter face tough odds, given that Georgia has not elected a non-incumbent Democrat to any statewide office since the waning years of the last century. But recent demographic shifts suggest a new electoral equation could be forming — and probably more quickly than in much-talked-about Texas.

The face of the state is being changed by an influx of African Americans and Latinos. Although whites accounted for 71 percent of Georgians who voted in the 2004 elections, that share had dropped by nearly 10 percentage points in 2012.

Last year, President Obama’s reelection campaign pretty much ignored Georgia, but he still got more than 45 percent of the vote. Of the states that Obama lost to Republican Mitt Romney, Georgia had the second-narrowest margin, behind battleground North Carolina.

Democrats say all they need now is more money, better organization and the right names on the ballot — the last of which they believe they have found in Nunn and Carter, who present themselves as affable consensus-builders willing to reach across party lines.

“Everybody said it could happen by 2018, but because of these two candidates and the excitement they bring, we’re going to do it in 2014,” said DuBose Porter, who took over in August as chairman of the troubled and underfunded Georgia Democratic Party.

Republicans see the same tectonic shifts at work, though they say the timeline is longer.

“In five or six or seven years, this will be a swing state, a real battleground. It will probably be the next Virginia or North Carolina,” GOP strategist Paul Bennecke said. “Our party, for longevity purposes, has to figure out a way to reach out.”

At a minimum, the prospect of Nunn and Carter on the ticket — both are expected to win nomination easily — has given Georgia Democrats a jolt of energy, enthusiasm and fundraising potential they have lacked in recent years. The state party raised $150,000 at a Nov. 20 luncheon in downtown Atlanta, at which Nunn and Carter were featured speakers.

Nunn collected an attention-getting $1.7 million in the first 10 weeks after announcing her candidacy in July. The money came from more than 6,700 individual donors, including some prominent contributors who normally give to Republicans.

Last month, former senator John W. Warner (R-Va.) attended a fundraiser for Nunn; his political action committee contributed $500 to her campaign.

Georgia is one of only two states where, at this point, Democrats have even plausible hopes of taking a Senate seat from Republicans in 2014. The other place where they are playing offense is Kentucky, against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

A centrist approach

Thus far, Nunn has taken a cautious, centrist approach. She says, for example, that she supports the Affordable Care Act but that she also agrees with Georgia’s junior Republican senator, Johnny Isakson, that penalties against individuals who fail to buy insurance should be delayed until the law is working smoothly.

“People are ready for some new leadership and new perspectives and qualities of leadership that are in short supply in Washington,” Nunn said in an interview. “That includes somebody who is a problem-solver and who brings civility and a spirit of collaboration and who is focused on getting things done. Georgia’s state motto is ‘wisdom, justice, moderation.’ ”

Of course, dynastic appeals such as Nunn and Carter represent, are nothing new in politics. The current U.S. Senate roster, for example, includes such political brand names as Begich, Casey, Landrieu, Murkowski, Paul, Pryor, Rockefeller and Udall (twice).

A famous political name means that “there will be some people who will be closed to us, and there will be a great number of people who will give us a second look because of it,” Carter said in an interview. “But at the end of the day, all you get is a second look.”

Although Nunn’s father is fondly remembered as a brainy and independent-minded senator, his name has not been on the ballot in Georgia since 1990. Michelle Nunn is running as a sort of anti-politician with a story of her own to tell as a founder and now the head of the nation’s largest organization devoted to volunteer service.

Among Georgia voters, however, she is still largely unknown.

Carl Fambro, 57, a Macon restaurant owner, recalls voting for Sam Nunn because the senator was a strong supporter of the military. “I didn’t know his daughter was interested in politics. I didn’t even know he had a daughter,” Fambro said.

Fambro and about a half-dozen other local busi­ness­peo­ple met with Michelle Nunn on Thursday morning around a table at his Francar’s Buffalo Wings restaurant. It was a low-key event, and Nunn mostly listened, jotting down their concerns and observations — about taxes, health care, burdensome regulations, difficulties obtaining loans — in a three-ring notebook.

Nunn didn’t even mention her Senate race until the session was almost over.

“I kind of like her. She seems energetic, friendly, really interested in what we had to say,” Fambro said afterward. “I’m sold.”

At least as important as anything Nunn brings to the race, she also stands to benefit from the disarray on the other side of the ballot. There are currently more than a half-dozen Republicans vying to replace retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a situation that promises a bruising, expensive primary and almost certainly a runoff.

Establishment Republicans worry that Nunn could have an opening, should the party nominate one of the more-far-right contenders, such as Rep. Paul Broun, who has described evolution, embryology and the big-bang theory as “lies straight from the pit of Hell.”

“If she could get to run against him, he could be the Todd Akin of 2014,” said University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock, referring to the Missouri 2012 Senate nominee, who lost what Republicans considered a likely pickup seat after he suggested that women could not get pregnant from “legitimate rape.”

Speaking of which, another GOP Senate contender in Georgia — Rep. Phil Gingrey, an obstetrician-gynecologist— revived that controversy this year when he said Akin had been “partly right” about rape.

A steeper climb

Jason Carter’s route to victory is even steeper than Nunn’s, given that he is challenging an incumbent, Gov. Nathan Deal. Carter announced that he is running on Nov. 7. An early test of his viability will be the fundraising numbers he produces at the end of December.

The state senator, 38, portrays himself as pragmatic, even on the ideologically fraught question of whether the state should accept federal funds to expand its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act.

“The current governor has decided to import all that Washington politics into our health-care system,” Carter said in an interview. “Our federal tax dollars are going to expand and improve health care in New Jersey and Florida and other places with Republican governors, and Georgia is not getting those benefits. And that’s because the governor is just consumed by the Washington politics of Obamacare.”

Given his grandfather’ continued activism, Carter acknowledges that the former president’s name is likely to have little crossover appeal to staunch Republicans.

Just last month, the state senator emphasized his differences with his grandfather when Jimmy Carter called for an end to capital punishment. The younger Carter said he supports the death penalty in cases of “heinous crimes, and that won’t change when I’m governor.”

Jason Carter also noted that he has an A-rating from the National Rifle Association, an organization that the former president has criticized.

“Some super-partisan people will never vote for me, because I’m Jimmy Carter’s grandson, and that will be a barrier,” Carter said. “The vast majority of people think of him as I do, as a good person who has lived his life based on his faith.”

But Carter also insisted that the time is right, for himself and Nunn.

“This was the state that is sort of next in line as a national battleground, so we’ve got that to build on from a Democratic base standpoint,” he said. “It is a path that is going to require both me and Michelle to do what we’ve done in our lives, to reach out to independents and Republicans of all kinds and demonstrate that we can provide the kind of leadership the state needs.”"

Seelye'],Scott Brown Hints at Another Senate Race — in New Hampshire,"If the special Senate election in Massachusetts has put the political cognoscenti to sleep, a possible race in neighboring New Hampshire may wake them up.

Scott P. Brown, who just turned down a chance to run again for the Senate in Massachusetts, is hinting that he might hop over the state line and challenge Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who is up for re-election in 2014.

Asked Thursday if he might consider such a race, Mr. Brown said, “I don’t think I’m done with politics, but I’m not going to rule out anything right now because I really haven’t thought a heck of a lot about it.” He spoke to reporters after delivering a speech in Nashua, N.H., on the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination.

“New Hampshire’s like a second home,” Mr. Brown added. “I was born at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. My mom and sister and family live here. Spent summers here growing up. Have a house here. Been a taxpayer for 20 years.”"

He Previously Served As Head Of The Washington Post S Afghanistan-Pakistan Bureau', 'Based In Islamabad', 'Kabul. He Has Also Reported Iraq', 'The District']",Brown’s departure makes for a fluid D.C. Council race featuring six candidates,"Michael A. Brown’s abrupt departure from the coming D.C. Council election has upended what was already a fluid contest.

Brown cited “very important personal and family matters” last week when he ended his campaign to return to the council. He has declined to elaborate. The former at-large independent lost his reelection bid in November.

The candidates in the April 23 election — an off-year race to fill a seat vacated when Phil Mendelson (D) became council chairman — are entering the final scramble for votes in what could be a close and potentially polarizing contest.

In December, the D.C. Democratic State Committee selected Anita Bonds — the committee’s chairwoman — to temporarily fill the seat pending the special election.

But she has struggled to gain traction on the campaign trail, and some Democrats fear the seat could fall to Republican Patrick Mara, a Ward 1 school board member making his third attempt at a council seat.

The race also includes Democrats Elissa Silverman, Matthew Frumin and Paul Zukerberg — all of whom see paths to victory in a race that could draw fewer than 50,000 votes. Perry Redd, a member of the Statehood Green Party, also is running.

Bonds and Mara appear to have the broadest support, based on past city voting patterns and the crowded field.

Mara is banking on strong turnout among the city’s 31,000 registered Republicans, many of whom have been mailed instructions from the D.C. GOP about voting by absentee ballot. With Brown out of the race, Bonds, the only black Democrat in the race, is expected to do well both in her home base of Northeast and majority African American neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River.

George T. Johnson, head of Local 20 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which endorsed Bonds hours after Brown withdrew from the race, said there is a strong desire within the black community to ensure the seat is held by an African American.

There are seven white and six black council members, including Bonds.

“People have perceptions about what this city is becoming . . . and they want this council to remain black, and if they don’t get out there and put black folks in there, there will be a white city council,” Johnson said. “That is a rough thing to say, but that is the truth.”

Bonds, an aide to several former mayors in the 1980s and 1990s, has the support of Democratic council members Jack Evans (Ward 2), Muriel Bowser (Ward 4), Vincent B. Orange (At Large) and Marion Barry (Ward 8). A mailing sent Friday shows Bonds with President Obama and says that she will “fight for anyone who has been pushed aside.”

Mara, who, if elected, would be the first Republican to win a council seat since 2008, is pushing to unite the “reform vote” behind his candidacy.

“I can be that fiscal and ethical watchdog,” Mara said.

At a forum Thursday night in the Chevy Chase neighborhood, Mara urged about 100 people in the audience to vote as a bloc. “Please don’t split the vote,” said Mara, who promises to improve schools while also controlling spending and taxes.

But Mara is battling considerable head winds: Local pollsters say surveys shows city voters hold deeply negative views about the GOP, even in wealthy neighborhoods such as Chevy Chase. That leaves an opening for the other Democrats in the race.

Silverman, a former reporter on leave from the liberal Fiscal Policy Institute, is targeting voters who agree with her message of building a progressive tax code, improving city services and strengthening government ethics.

“I don’t think D.C. voters mind paying taxes,” said Silverman, a Ward 6 resident who said she will campaign hard for African American votes. “What they mind are bad services, and I think D.C. voters want an honest, transparent approach to taxation.”

Frumin, a lawyer and Ward 3 advisory neighborhood commissioner, was relatively unknown when he started the race . But he has raised more than $100,000 to fund a mail campaign promoting his vision of improved neighborhood schools and better-managed growth.

“The geometry of this race is tricky and in many ways unpredictable,” said Frumin, who has a base of support in Upper Northwest. “It’s all about this final two weeks and reaching as many voters as possible, and I think we have reached as many voters as anyone.”

Zukerberg, a lawyer who has made the legalization of marijuana the centerpiece of his campaign, also remains confident. His message appears to resonate at candidate forums and debates.

“My position cuts across all wards, all demographics,” said Zukerberg, who lives in Adams Morgan. “The message I am hearing is, ‘Keep going, don’t give up.’ ”

Redd is an author and activist who is pushing for more progressive tax policies. The Green Party, though, has been unsuccessful in recent elections.

Political strategist Tom Lindenfeld said the race will remain fluid.

“The real questions in this race are: Will the independent expenditures for Anita be able to promote her into the election?” he said. “And will Mara be an acceptable candidate for white voters? And if not, is there a place for anyone else in the race, and who would that be?”

The candidates will debate at noon Monday on “The Kojo Nnamdi Show” on WAMU (88.5 FM)."

(CNN) - If Republicans suffer losses in next year's mid-term elections because of the recent partial government shutdown, Sen. Ted Cruz said Senate Republicans–not Democrats–will be responsible.

""The single-most damaging thing that has happened to Republicans for 2014 is all of the Senate Republicans coming out, attacking the House Republicans, attacking those pushing the effort to defund Obamacare and lining themselves up opposite of the American people,"" Cruz told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash in an interview in San Antonio.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

His comments, which aired Monday on ""New Day,"" come as a new CNN/ORC International survey indicates that more than half of the country is displeased with Republicans holding majority power in the House.

According to the poll, 54% say it's a bad thing that the GOP controls the House, up 11 points from last December, soon after the 2012 elections when the Republicans kept control of the chamber. Only 38% say it's a good thing the GOP controls the House, a 13-point dive from the end of last year.



Cruz to CNN: ‘I don’t work for the party bosses in Washington’

This is the first time since Republicans won back the House in the 2010 elections that a majority of people say GOP control of the chamber is bad for the country.

Cruz helped lead the conservative Republican strategy to attach anti-Obamacare provisions to must-pass spending legislation this fall. With the support of the White House, the Democratic-controlled Senate refused to take up anything that tried to dismantle the president's signature health care law.

Ultimately the disagreement led to the 16-day partial government shutdown, which removed $24 billion from the economy, according to an initial analysis from Standard & Poor's.

Republican shutdown pain may boost Dems in 2014

Many Senate Republicans rebuked the effort led by Cruz, a first-year senator who was elected in 2012, and they privately and publicly discouraged the senator from pursuing the tactic.

""It was a fool's errand to start with. It was never going to succeed,"" Sen. John McCain said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

McCain didn't single out Cruz but blamed ""the whole effort"" instead.

""Keep up the fight against Obamacare. But don't shut down the government and have so much collateral damage,"" the Arizona Republican added.

Some argue Cruz's strategy was taken in part to raise money for conservative groups that back primary challengers. One group, the Senate Conservatives Fund, which supported Cruz last year, raised $2.1 million in September–a large amount for a nonelection year.

McCain: Obamacare website rollout a 'fiasco'

Asked if his effort was a money-making enterprise, Cruz said: ""Not remotely.""

The Texas Republican said he's ""hopeful"" Senate Republicans will change.

""I am hopeful there will be some time, some reflection, and that Senate Republicans will come back. Come back to the principles they believe and they campaigned on. I'm hopeful we'll actually put action behind the campaign promises,"" he said.

In the Senate, Democrats hold 55 seats, including two independents who caucus with the Democrats, while Republicans hold 45. Democrats are defending 21 of the 35 seats up for grabs next year, with Republican defending 14.

Mr. Obama’s campaign apparatus has transformed itself into a nonprofit political group, though it said it would disclose the names of its donors (and it is not getting involved in the Hagel fight).

After Mr. Obama won re-election in November and Democrats kept their majority in the Senate and made inroads in the House, Republican Party officials and senior strategists with conservative outside groups predicted that some of the big financiers of the larger outside efforts would pull back and reassess their involvement and whether their millions were wasted. But while the donors have said they will insist that the groups they finance find lessons in last year’s losses, their interest and stakes in what happens in Washington have certainly not waned.

For instance, the biggest individual financier of the so-called super PACs that sought to defeat Mr. Obama, Sheldon Adelson, is so invested in the fight over Mr. Hagel that he has reached out directly to Republican Senators to urge them to hold the line against his confirmation, which would be almost impossible to stop against six Republican “yes” votes and a unified Democratic caucus.

Given the more than $100 million he donated to the anti-Obama effort last year, no lawmakers need to be reminded of his importance to their future endeavors. People briefed on his involvement said Mr. Adelson, chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation and a longtime supporter of Israel, was calling in conjunction with the Republican Jewish Coalition, a group he has financed for several years.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in December, Mr. Adelson said he was prepared to “double” his investment in politics in the coming year.

But it is unclear whether he is directly financing any of the anti-Hagel advertising. An associate of his, speaking about Mr. Adelson’s thinking on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe that expensive television campaigns are the answer to every political push given that Mr. Obama’s re-election team accomplished so much of its success through online and volunteer efforts.

Image The last major cabinet skirmish, over President George W. Bush's nomination of John R. Bolton as the United States ambassador to the United Nations, had no comparable outside media campaign.

Citing similar reasons, another major Republican donor, Foster Friess, said in an interview that he had developed his own skepticism over “the whole idea of these multimedia ads from 45,000 feet.” After last year’s losses he said he was devoting most of his resources to an effort he called “Left-Right, Left-Right Forward March,” which finds projects liberals and conservatives can support together, like water purification in developing countries."

The former president has kept a low profile since leaving office but will be on hand for the dedication of his presidential library this week, an event likely to trigger fresh debate about his eight years in office. A look back at his tenure as chief executive.

George W. Bush will return to the spotlight this week for the dedication of his presidential library, an event likely to trigger fresh public debate about his eight fateful years in office. But he reemerges with a better public image than when he left Washington more than four years ago.

Since then, Bush has absented himself from both policy disputes and political battles. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that the passage of time and Bush’s relative invisibility have been beneficial to a chief executive who left office surrounded by controversy.

Days before his second term ended in 2009, Bush’s approval rating among all adults was 33 percent positive and 66 percent negative. The new poll found 47 percent saying they approve and 50 percent saying they disapprove. Among registered voters, his approval rating today is equal to President Obama’s, at 47 percent, according to the latest Post-ABC surveys.

Majorities said they still dis­approve of Bush’s performance on the Iraq war and the economy, but his economic approval numbers nearly doubled between December 2008 and today, from 24 percent to 43 percent, with 53 percent disapproving. Iraq remains the most troublesome part of his legacy. Today, 57 percent say they disapprove of his decision to invade, though that is down from 65 percent in the spring of 2008, the last time the question was asked.

Historians say it will take years, even decades, for any substantial revision of his presidency to take place. Bush has said he is content to let history judge him and told the designers of his presidential museum to present the facts and let visitors decide whether he was right. But some allies see Thursday’s official opening of the library in Dallas as an opportunity to begin to set his presidency into broader perspective.

View Graphic Public warms to George W. Bush's presidential legacy

“Obviously, it’s a big moment for him,” former British prime minister Tony Blair said in a telephone interview from London. “It’s a chance for him to explain that his political philosophy encompasses much more than the decisions he had to take after 9/11. We forget this sometimes. . . . This is a much more rounded person with many more dimensions to him than the caricature often portrays.”

Contemporary judgments of Bush’s presidency have been harsh. The war in Iraq, which he launched on the basis of faulty intelligence in the aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, left this country deeply divided. His final months in office brought a collapse of the financial system that led to the worst recession since the Great Depression. In between, his administration’s wobbly response to Hurricane Katrina damaged his image.

But Bush will return to public view at a moment when some parts of his record are being viewed more charitably. His advocacy for immigration reform and his relative success at attracting Hispanic votes, for example, are now seen as a model for a Republican Party that has awakened to its glaring deficit in the Latino community.

Thursday’s events are likely to be shorn of partisanship, though commentary around them may not be. The guest list will be topped by Obama and all living former presidents, including Bush’s father, George H.W. Bush. Blair, who stood steadfastly with Bush after the 2001 attacks and his decision to invade Iraq 18 months later, will be among the many dignitaries and Bush administration alumni who will gather on the campus of Southern Methodist University.

Karen Hughes, who served as counselor to Bush, said the former president told her that he considers the day “a joyful opportunity to give thanks” — to the other presidents for being there, to those who served in his administration, to the workers who built the architecturally handsome Bush Center.

Former advisers say no one should expect the opening of the library and museum to bring a notable change in Bush’s generally low-profile post-presidency. “It’s a little too simplistic to say this is some big coming out or that some definitive change will happen that will mark a new approach to things by Bush or his people,” said Karl Rove, who served as Bush’s chief political adviser and White House deputy chief of staff.

Still, members of Bush’s team recognize the significance of the moment and are prepared to take on some of his critics, if necessary, amid the glare of media attention this week. “Clearly some pretty significant distortions have been fostered by the current president and others,” Hughes said. “Those of us who worked for him see it [the dedication ceremony] as an opportunity to set the record straight in some cases.”

Bush advisers believe that over time, more attention will focus on aspects of his presidency that were overshadowed by the controversies of his national security and economic records. They point to his initiative to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa, which has helped save hundreds of thousands of lives; his efforts to bring accountability and higher standards to public education; and his advocacy for comprehensive immigration reform, which was rejected by his party.

Bush’s decision to stay out of the public arena in recent years reflects his humility and his belief that he owed his successor “a decent interval of silence,” as Rove called it. He played no role in the 2012 campaign, neither attending the Republican National Convention last summer nor campaigning for Mitt Romney last fall. But there was no clamor among the Republican candidates for his participation.

Instead, Bush has quietly pursued activities that grew out of his presidential agenda. Much of that work, focusing on global health, the role of women in the Middle East, education and the economy, is carried out through the Bush Institute, which was founded in 2009 and shares the 23-acre site at SMU with the presidential library and museum.

The institute and the new museum are designed to highlight the values and principles that guided Bush in office. “Freedom is really the one central axis around which everything revolves,” said Mark Langdale, president of the George W. Bush Foundation.

Bush and former first lady Laura Bush have spent time in Africa on projects related to the AIDS initiative and other health issues. The former president also spends considerable time with wounded veterans and has participated with them in vigorous mountain-biking expeditions. He has taken up painting. He and his wife recently became grandparents for the first time.

He gave 70 speeches last year and plans 60 or so this year, according to Dan Bartlett, who was counselor to Bush in the White House. The paid speeches are all off the record, but one adviser said Bush is extremely candid in the question-and-answer sessions. He and former president Bill Clinton have done a series of joint appearances.

Last week’s Boston Marathon bombing was a tragic reminder of the episode that changed Bush’s presidency. After 9/11, Bush ­implemented aggressive ­anti-

terrorism policies, many of which were embraced by the Obama administration, though not the controversial interrogation measures authorized under Bush. A recent report by the Constitution Project concluded that those policies resulted in torture of some detainees.

Some Bush allies say Obama has gone out of his way to be critical of his predecessor and often has not acknowledged what they contend were key policies that have been helpful to him. They highlight two decisions by the former president that have proved beneficial to Obama in office: One was the troop surge in Iraq, which was highly controversial at the time but which, they contend, made it possible for Obama to end the war as quickly as he did.

The other was Bush’s decision in the fall of 2008 to press Congress to pass the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) to bail out financial institutions. That was equally controversial, especially among Bush’s fellow Republicans, but his advisers argue that it helped stabilize the financial system before Obama took office.

“Both reflected strong presidential leadership and, as we now see in retrospect, excellent judgment,” said Joshua Bolten, who served as Bush’s White House chief of staff.

Bolten also noted that spending during most years of Bush’s presidency was below 20 percent of gross domestic product, the target now established by House Republicans in their budget blueprint. No president since Richard M. Nixon, other than Clinton, can make such a claim, he said.

But on fiscal issues, Bush draws criticism from both left and right. Tea party Republicans regard him as a reckless spender. Democrats say his tax cuts and two wars that were not paid for helped create larger deficits, though Obama accepted making the bulk of those cuts permanent last December.

Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the country would be happy to have the deficit levels of Bush’s presidency, but she declined to praise his overall record. She said that his record on neither tax cuts nor spending “was particularly fiscally responsible.”

Bush has continued to bear much of the culpability for the condition of the economy. On Election Day last November, 53 percent of voters said they blamed Bush for the current economic problems, while 38 percent blamed Obama, according to exit polls.

Iraq looms larger than perhaps any other issue over Bush’s legacy, but Blair said the former president’s attitude toward his decisions has not changed. “There was never any doubt while he was in office, and there’s not any doubt now,” he said.

Blair said Bush continues to believe that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein in power and added: “When you see what is happening in Syria today, the sense of that argument is evident. . . . What it does is just make clear that these decisions are very difficult. If you intervene, it can be very tough. If you don’t intervene, it can also be very tough.”

One section of the Bush museum, known as the Decision Points Theater, focuses on four key decisions: the invasion of Iraq, the troop surge, the financial crisis and the response to Hurricane Katrina. Visitors will hear the information available to the president at the time and then choose what they would do in each case. Bush, on video, will explain his decisions.

Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University recently toured the Bush museum; he called it “beautifully designed” but predicted that it would spark controversy. “It’s going to be mocked and trashed by liberal Democrats, and conservative Republicans are going to say what a marvelous place it is,” he said. As for Bush’s potential place in history, he said, “It’s going to be hard for him to rehabilitate fully.”

Stanford University’s David Kennedy predicted that judgments about Bush are not likely to change unless perceptions of Iraq and what triggered the financial crisis change first. Presidents are judged on foreign policy and economic policy, he said, adding: “In neither one of those areas do I see anything on the horizon that will change people’s opinion.”

But H.W. Brands, a professor of history at the University of Texas, said it’s quite possible that Bush’s legacy could undergo a genuine reworking as time passes. “The worse a president’s reputation when he leaves office, the better chance there is for revision,” he said. “Every so often there’s a new generation of historians, and they have to come along and challenge the conventional wisdom.”

(CNN) – The Internal Revenue Service is playing defense on a new front: excess spending on conferences.

The IRS spent close to $50 million on 225 conferences between 2010 and 2012, according to briefings given to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

TIGTA will release an audit Tuesday that details surplus spending at a conference in 2010 for 2,700 people in the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed division.

At a House oversight committee hearing on the issue next week, lawmakers will focus on the August 2010 conference held in Anaheim, California, at a cost of $4 million. Several IRS employees stayed in presidential suites at hotels, the committee learned. Such suites currently cost between $1,500 to $3,500 per night.

""The culture of the federal workforce is one where I don't think you can underestimate that if you don't keep reminding the voters - but also the federal workers - that we're watching, this will happen again,"" Rep. Darrell Issa said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Last year, the General Services Administration drew fierce congressional criticism and scrutiny for spending nearly $1 million on a conference in Las Vegas, also in 2010. It featured a controversial video and ultimately resulted in the resignation of the GSA administrator. The administration implemented efforts to clamp down on such spending.

""It doesn't stay fixed,"" Issa said. ""One example in Anaheim, when they bought their tickets they said, 'Well, we'll pay the per diem rate for these hotel rooms.' They didn't negotiate, they didn't bid it. And this was 2,700 folks. So they could have gotten a considerable reduction. Instead what they said is, 'We'll pay full boat, but we want some perks.' So they ended up with free drinks, they ended up with tickets to games, basically kickbacks.""

Fifteen outside speakers were hired to give presentations at the conference, totaling $135,000, the oversight committee was told. One of the speakers, who was paid $17,000, led a session called ""Leadership Through Art.""

The IRS spent $50,000 to produce two videos that were shown at the event. One had a ""Star Trek"" theme and was reported on earlier this year, while the other video – in which employees learned the Cupid shuffle dance – was released this weekend.

The purpose of the conference was listed as continuing professional education, but credits were not given to attendees, the committee learned. Also, no sign-in sheets were posted outside training sessions, making it difficult for TIGTA to determine if attendees actually went to the sessions.

The IRS has not taken disciplinary action over the conference, TIGTA told the oversight committee, adding that planners were given cash awards for their efforts.

The report comes as the IRS is already under investigation for its admitted targeting of conservative groups that were seeking tax-exempt status in 2010 and 2011.

Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel released a statement Friday about the upcoming audit release, saying such spending is ""inappropriate.""

""This conference is an unfortunate vestige from a prior era. While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting, many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred,"" he said, adding that such a conference would not take place today.

""Sweeping new spending restrictions have been put in place at the IRS, and travel and training expenses have dropped more than 80 percent since 2010 and similar large-scale meetings did not take place in 2011, 2012 or 2013.""

(CNN) – Mitt Romney has had some time to reflect on what went wrong last November. His main conclusion: the Hispanic community didn’t understand his immigration stance well enough.

""The largest strategic error was not investing sufficiently, particularly in Hispanic TV and Hispanic outreach to help Hispanic voters understand that ours is the party of opportunity,"" Romney told CNN’s Jake Tapper of the lesson to be learned for GOP presidential campaigns of the future.



Romney lost the Hispanic vote by 40%, a loss seen to be in large part spurred by the perception of the Republican Party as antithetical to immigration reform.

""I think my position and the position of our party is not well understood at the Hispanic community,"" said Romney. ""I want to see immigration reform. I said that during the campaign. I want to make sure we have a legal immigration system that brings, in my view, more people legally to our country. I'd like to do that.""



Exclusive: Romney disagrees with House GOP ‘tactics’ on Obamacare

Romney’s comments offer some of the most revealing insight into his thoughts on immigration and its role in his 2012 defeat to President Barack Obama.

Debates on how the GOP should adapt itself in the years to come have found a split between elements who think Republicans need to reach out better to Hispanic voters and those who view any immigration reform or pathway to citizenship as amnesty for lawbreakers.

The GOP has a long way to go if it wants to attract Hispanic voters, according to a new poll released Friday.

Half of Hispanics identify with the Democratic Party, according to the Public Religion Research Institute poll, compared to the 15% who identify with the GOP.

But the problem is more than just party identification, says the survey. Forty-three percent of Hispanics identified that the phrase ""cares about people like you"" more appropriately describes the Democratic Party, while 12% say the same for the GOP.

* With Healthcare.gov on its legs, the next big question is whether the administration can sell recalcitrant Republican states on Medicaid expansion. They’ve even got a conservative-compromise, in the form of letting very poor buy private insurance on the exchanges rather than folding them into Medicaid proper.

* Paul Krugman suggests what must never be suggested: Republicans could be badly overestimating the strength of their anti-Obamacare political strategy going into 2014.

In 1969-70, my first year in Washington, George McGovern memorably took to the Senate floor to reflect on his colleagues' culpability in the Vietnam War. He said, ""The walls of this chamber reek with blood,"" drawing a collective gasp from those on the floor and in the galleries. You weren't supposed to talk that way in the Senate. A week or so later, Bob Dole, then a freshman senator, took to the floor and ripped the bark off of McGovern for his apostasy.

But sometime later in the year, I saw McGovern and Dole walking arm in arm in the Old Senate Office Building. They forged a relationship that blossomed into a 40-year-plus friendship, based on their common interest in dealing with food issues. Dole, representing his Kansas farmers, embraced the food-stamp program on their behalf, a way to deal with farm surpluses. McGovern, with a deep passion to alleviate hunger in America, embraced a system of price supports that gave money to agribusinesses for not planting crops as a way to fund the food-stamp program.

Their alliance reflected a more than five-decade relationship between rural and urban lawmakers that made farm bills possible, a kind of model for how Congress, through compromises and trade-offs, can find majorities for legislation that primarily benefits minorities or narrower interests."

No, the most pressing issue for the president was the fact that real estate mogul Donald Trump had been challenging him over his birth certificate, according to the new book Double Down: Game Change 2012.

“[T]he most persistent distraction Obama was facing personified by Donald Trump, the real estate billionaire and reality show ringmaster who was flirting with making a presidential run under the banner of birtherism–the crackpot conspiracy theory claiming that Obama was born in Kenya and thus was constitutionally ineligible to preside as commander in chief,” authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann note in the opening chapter of the book.

While Obama–who was born in Hawaii–thought of the theory as “lunacy” and “simply mental,” in 2008 his campaign posted his short-form birth certificate online. But as 2011 rolled around, the theory, the authors note, “wouldn’t go away.”

“A recent New York Times poll had found that 45 percent of Republicans and 25 percent of voters overall believed he was foreign born,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote. “And with Trump serving as a human bullhorn, the faux controversy had escaped the confines of Fox News and conservative talk radio, reverberating in the mainstream media.”

George Stephanopoulos asked Obama about Trump’s crusade for his birth certificate twice in an interview the morning of April 14, 2011. “We’re not really worrying about conspiracy theories,” Obama said in response.

But that is not what this new book found; Halperin and Heilemann claim Obama literally spent that night in his Chicago home digging through old records to try to find some kind of proof he was born in Hawaii amid the belongings of his late mother, Ann Dunham.

After Obama made the fundraising rounds throughout Chicago, “he avoided mentioning Trump,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote, “yet the issue remained much on his mind.”

“What confounded him about the problem, beyond its absurdity, was that there was no ready solution,” they wrote. “Although Trump was braying for his original long-form birth certificate, officials in Obama’s home state were legally prohibited from releasing it on their own, and the president had no earthly idea where his family’s copy was.”

What Obama did try to do was “joke about the topic,” as he did during his final fundraiser that night at Chicago’s Navy Pier. “I grew up here in Chicago,” he said. “I wasn’t born here–I just want to be clear. I was born in Hawaii.”

Halperin and Heilemann note that Obama spent the night in the Chicago home that he, Michelle, Sasha, and Malia left behind for the White House in early 2009. When Obama walked through the door after 10 PM, he “stayed up even later” the authors noted, “intrigued by some old boxes that had belonged to his late mother, Ann Dunham.”

While Obama’s mother died seven years earlier, Obama still had not dug through and “sorted” all of her things. “Now, alone in his old house for just the third night since he’d become president, he started rummaging through the boxes, digging, digging, until suddenly he found it: a small, four-paneled paper booklet the world had never seen before,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote. “On the front was an ink drawing of Kapi’olani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital, in Honolulu. On the back was a picture of a Hawaiian queen. On one inside were his name, his mother’s name, and his date of birth; on the other were his infant footprints.”

Obama was so pleased that he found it, he bragged about the discovery to his friend Marty Nesbitt who visited him the next day. Nesbitt, one of Obama’s best friends who bonded with the president over sports over the years, came over for breakfast the next morning. “After chatting for a while at the kitchen table, Obama went upstairs and came back down, wearing a cat-who-ate-a-whole-flock-of-canaries grin, waving the booklet in the air, and then placing it in front of Nesbitt,” the authors wrote.

“Now that’s some funny shit,” Nesbitt said before he “burst out laughing.”

Obama was so proud he found the booklet that on the way to a scheduled interview with the Associated Press, he “pulled aside” adviser David Plouffe and press secretary Jay Carney “and eagerly showed them his discovery.”

Both Plouffe and Carney were unsure if that was, in fact, Obama’s long form birth certificate, but were hopeful that it could help them in fighting the birther conspiracy theories. As for Obama, Halperin and Heilemann noted, he “didn’t know what to think, but he flew back to Washington hoping that maybe, just maybe, he now had a stake to drive through the heart of birtherism, killing it once and for all–and slaying Trump in the bargain.”

Obama hoped this was his saving grace, as Trump’s charges had gotten so far under his skin it started consuming him. “Striding into a meeting with his senior advisers in the Oval Office the next Monday morning, he reached into his suit pocket and whipped out the booklet, infinitely pleased with himself,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote."

(My organization has not endorsed a candidate in that race.) Doing so gives him some nifty talking points that align with most conservative groups, but it is little more than parliamentary sleight of hand.

Consider how he handled the vote on the bill. To defeat a filibuster, its supporters needed 60 senators to win cloture and move to a final vote. Instead of rallying his troops against the vote, Mr. McConnell allowed a handful of Republicans in battleground states — who needed to be seen as supporting the bill — to vote for cloture, while he and the rest railed against it, casting themselves in the role of budget hawks.

With cloture accomplished, a dozen Republicans were then free to vote against final passage if they need wiggle room when they’re confronted on the campaign trail next fall by voters demanding action on government spending. Mr. McConnell and many Senate Republicans used the vote to manipulate the system, allowing them to cast themselves as deal makers or principled conservatives, depending on their audience.

This is not principled policy making; what we’re seeing is simple gamesmanship that raises legitimate questions about which values Republicans truly hold and which are merely interchangeable with those of Democrats.

The job of Tea Party groups and other conservatives is pretty simple: to inform Americans about the need for restraint in spending, tax relief, pro-growth economic policies and individual liberty — and to support the men and women who pledge to promote these positions. To the extent that the speaker of the House and Senate Republicans are attacking such groups, it looks as if we’re doing our job.

But after this budget vote, our job expands to include informing Americans about who keeps their word in Congress and who does not.

When establishment Republicans call spending increases spending cuts, deny that raising taxes is a hike, and champion deficit reduction that doesn’t scratch the surface of our nation’s debt, it suggests a detachment from the facts. But when those who voted for them criticize their elected officials for not keeping their promises, and are then attacked for doing so, it suggests that Kurt Vonnegut was right in observing, “A sane person to an insane society must appear insane.”"

The worse news is that in terms of admiration for our national leaders, these may come to be seen as the good old days.

I’m an optimist by nature, a glass-half-full kind of guy. But try as I might, I can’t convince myself that Republicans in Congress are likely to respond any better to President Obama’s latest proposals on the economy than to the previous umpteen. I’m also pretty gloomy at the moment about the prospects for meaningful immigration reform — unless House Speaker John Boehner decides that passing a bill is more important than keeping his job.

“We should not be judged on how many new laws we create,” Boehner said Sunday. “We ought to be judged on how many laws that we repeal.” So much for faint hope.

My fear is that stasis has become a structural feature of our politics. Nothing lasts forever, but this depressing state of affairs could be with us for quite a while — and could get worse.

The public is not amused. Three out of four Americans disapprove of the job Congress is doing, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, while an NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey measured disapproval of Congress at a stunning 83 percent. Obama’s approval rating has slid to 49 percent, the Post-ABC poll found — better than the president’s political opponents are faring but hardly anything to cheer about.

Here’s the basic problem: The Democratic Party seems likely to grow ever stronger nationally while the GOP remains firmly entrenched locally. This means the stubborn, maddening, unproductive standoff between a Democratic president and a Republican majority in the House may be the new normal.

Demographic trends clearly favor the Democrats in presidential elections. Hispanics and Asian Americans, the nation’s biggest and fastest-growing minorities, respectively, both voted for Obama over Mitt Romney by more than 70 percent . This is not just a function of the GOP’s hostility to immigration reform, although that certainly doesn’t help. Republicans are also out of step with these voters on other issues, such as health care. And all too often they transmit a breathtaking level of hostility.

A case in point is the recent allegation by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) that for every young undocumented immigrant who becomes a valedictorian, “there’s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds — and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.”

Criticized by his colleagues — ixnay on the igotrybay — King insisted his comments were “factually correct.” And the GOP’s outreach to Latino voters returned to square one.

None of this eliminates the possibility that Democrats will nominate flawed presidential candidates or that Republicans will nominate attractive ones. But all things being equal, the Democratic Party likely will go into presidential elections with a structural advantage. Eventually the GOP will be at pains to defend even Texas, the party’s only reliable mega-state.

Yet the Republican majority in the House, ensconced by clever redistricting, will be hard to dislodge. Perhaps Democratic registration and get-out-the-vote efforts can reshape the midterm electorate enough next year to recapture the majority. I wouldn’t bet the mortgage on it.

It may be, then, that we’re in for a much longer period of divided government in which the principal way that Republicans can affect federal policy is through obstruction. The whole “party of no” thing is more than a meme; it’s a logical — if somewhat nihilistic — plan of action. Or inaction.

Republicans know they cannot repeal the Affordable Care Act, for example, but they can hamper its implementation. They cannot impose their vision of immigration reform — all fence and no citizenship, basically — but they can ensure that no reforms are approved. They cannot choose their own nominees for federal judgeships, but they can block Obama’s.

Commentators who criticize the president for not hosting enough cocktail parties or golf outings for Republicans are ignoring political reality. He has tried being nice, he has tried being tough, he has tried offering to compromise, he has tried driving a hard bargain. Nothing works if Republicans are committed to blocking every single thing he seeks to do.

No wonder Obama chose to unveil his economic program while making what looks like a campaign swing. It will be the voters who eventually get us out of this hole. Unfortunately, that may take some time.

TRENTON, N.J. — A lopsided race for governor in New Jersey will be decided Tuesday when voters choose between Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who could leave before a second term ends to run for president, and Barbara Buono, a little-known state senator who was the only Democrat willing to challenge the popular incumbent.

Polls opened at 6 a.m. and will close at 8 p.m.

Christie has been barnstorming the state by bus since Wednesday to drive up turnout. Polls leading up to Election Day showed him with a 20-plus point advantage as he pushes for a landslide to burnish his bipartisan credentials and show how well a reach-across-the-aisle Republican can do in a Democratic-leaning state. Christie is looking to become the first Republican running statewide to break 50 percent since George H.W. Bush in 1988.

Buono campaigned without the aid of big-name Democrats. She also was spurned early on by Democratic leaders who control party politics in the state. They have a good working relationship with Christie and didn't believe the progressive from Metuchen, on the fringes of the New York City metropolitan area, could win.

Christie, 51, was already popular when Superstorm Sandy slammed into the coast a year ago, damaging 360,000 homes and businesses, plunging 5.5 million people into darkness and disrupting gasoline supplies for days. His popularity skyrocketed as he donned a blue fleece pullover and led the state through its worst natural disaster, whether he was embracing President Barack Obama during a visit to the battered coast or consoling a tearful 9-year-old who had lost her house.

Christie underwent weight-loss surgery in February and has been shedding pounds steadily since, addressing a health issue that could affect his political plans in the future. He was disqualified as a 2012 vice presidential candidate after refusing to answer questions about his health and other matters, according to a new book on last year's presidential campaign.

Christie has refused to rule out a presidential run, which may mean he could resign before his second term ended.

Nearly half of New Jersey residents think he'll run, according to a recent poll.

Buono, 60, has portrayed Christie's ambitions as a negative. In an interview on MSNBC on Monday, she said the governor is putting his personal ambitions ahead of the needs of the state.

Buono has also challenged Christie on gay marriage, which she supported and he opposed before it became legal in New Jersey last month. She criticized Christie's budget priorities — refusing to reinstate a surcharge on millionaires while trimming a property tax credit for the working poor, for example — and his veto of legislation raising the minimum-wage.

Though a majority of New Jersey residents agree with Buono on social issues, she has been unable to get out from a campaign Catch-22: She couldn't get her message out because she hadn't raised a lot of money for advertising, and she had trouble raising money because voters didn't know her.

Democrats, including Buono, rejected Christie's minimum-wage compromise of scaling back an increase and phasing it in over three years, and instead decided to put the question to voters.

So voters are being asked in ballot question No. 2 to increase the minimum wage by $1, to $8.25 per hour, and to allow annual cost-of-living increases based on inflation. They'll also be asked to allow veterans' groups to use proceeds from games of chance to run their organizations.

Voters will also choose their legislative representatives. Democrats now control both the Senate and Assembly with all 120 seats up for election."

He Left The Post In April']",Republican Party could learn a lot from the Democrats of 1989,"The Republicans of 2013 look a lot like the Democrats of 1989 — shut out of the presidency, beholden to a shrinking base and on the wrong side of major demographic shifts in the country.

That’s the argument two longtime Democratic strategists — Bill Galston and Elaine Kamarck — make in an essay titled “The New Politics of Evasion” in the fall edition of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas. For any Republican hoping to win back the White House in 2016, it’s an absolute must-read.

What Galston and Kamarck set out to do is revisit a famed essay they wrote in 1989 about their own side’s political and policy failing, titled “The Politics of Evasion: Democrats and the Presidency.”

In that first essay, Galston and Kamarck write, “we debunked the views of our Democratic colleagues who hoped, as do so many Republicans today, that their fortunes would start looking up when a popular two-term President passed from the scene, and we laid out the kinds of changes the party would have to embrace if it wished to regain its competitiveness in presidential elections.”

The diagnoses and proposed prescriptions the duo outlined for Democrats almost a quarter-century ago also apply to Republicans today.

First, what’s wrong. Galston and Kamarck broke the Democrats’ problems into three basic “myths”: the myth of “liberal fundamentalism,” the myth of “mobilization” and the myth of “the congressional bastion.”

The first myth centered on the idea that Democrats had come up short at the presidential level in 1980, 1984 and 1988 because the candidates they had nominated — Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis — were insufficient adherents to liberal orthodoxy. If only the party had nominated a “true liberal,” the argument went, they would have won. Sound familiar? The critique from many within the GOP over the past two elections is that neither John McCain nor Mitt Romney were dyed-in-the-wool conservatives, and that had the party nominated someone like, say, Rick Santorum, it might have won.

The second myth — of mobilization — is all about demographics. In the 1980s, Democrats insisted that if only blacks and Hispanics would vote in numbers commensurate with their share of the population, the party’s nominee would win. They didn’t, and Democrats didn’t win. Fast-forward to today and some within the Republican Party are making that same losing argument about consolidating the white vote. “[T]he Republicans’ demographic problem is the mirror image of the one that Democrats faced a quarter-century ago,” Galston and Kamarck write. “Back then there weren’t enough minorities to make the Democrats’ electoral strategy work; today, there aren’t enough whites to make the Republican strategy viable. The same long-cycle trends that gradually helped Democrats are now hurting Republicans.”

This demographic myth is perhaps the most dangerous for Republicans as they seek a way back to the White House in 2016. Remember that the white vote as a percentage of the overall electorate has declined in every presidential election since 1992. As GOP strategist Pete Wehner has noted, if Romney had carried the white vote by 20 points — as he did in 2012— with the demographic makeup of the country as it was in 2000, he would be president today. But, he’s not.

The final myth is that of the “congressional bastion,” the idea that if the party out of the White House still controls a chamber of Congress and/or a number of state and local offices then it’s evidence that all is well and major change isn’t required. This is the most prevalent argument you hear from Republicans today; yes, the party has lost two presidential elections in convincing fashion, but the fact that it retains control of the House and has a chance to retake the Senate majority in 2014 are a testament to the continued strength of the GOP’s messaging. But, holding a House majority in a deeply gerrymandered set of districts is not the same as winning a national presidential election. And the 2012 election proved that the massive gains the GOP made in the 2010 midterms are more the exception than the rule.

The diagnosis by Galston and Kamarck of what ails the Republican Party is not new; Wehner and former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson wrote a terrific piece for Commentary magazine this past spring entitled “How to Save the Republican Party” that makes many of the same arguments.

The problem for smart Republican strategists is not figuring out what’s wrong, but developing a real and pragmatic plan to fix it. Democrats fixed their problems of the 1980s with one man: Bill Clinton.

“There’s no substitute for a leader with the guts to break with outdated party orthodoxy, as Clinton did on trade, fiscal policy, welfare and crime among other issues,” Galston and Kamarck write. “And he did more than that: In that famous Sister Souljah episode, he spoke out against a tendency in the party’s base that crossed the line from protest to extremism.”

The obvious analog to Clinton in the modern Republican Party is former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Bush, like Clinton, spent much of his formative life as a governor and, on issues ranging from education to immigration, has shown a willingness to break from Republican orthodoxy and the party’s base.

Unlike Clinton, who long signaled his plan to run for president in advance of the 1992 race, Bush remains an elusive figure when it comes to his future plans. If Bush decides against a bid, there is no other obvious figure who fits the Clinton-circa-1992 mold, although Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) probably has the most chance to remake the Republican coalition among those candidates expected to run.

History has a way of repeating itself. Republicans would do well to realize that the Democratic Party of 1989 has many lessons to teach the GOP of today. And they would do well to realize it sooner rather than later."

Terry Branstad told Karl Rove to keep his new super PAC, which some conservatives believe was created to wage war on them, out of Iowa’s Republican primaries.

“I basically told Karl Rove that what he was doing is counter-productive and he needs to stay out of it,” Branstad told the Associated Press last Friday. “If some outside group that has no connection to Iowa attacks somebody from Iowa, that is not smart.”

After Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat, announced he would be retiring from the Senate in January, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) indicated he may be interested in pursuing the Senate seat, which has been held by a Democrat for 30 years, in 2014.

Rove’s group promptly decided to smear King a week later, indicating he would be a Republican against whom the group would try to obliterate with negative ads in a potential Iowa GOP Senate primary.

After Rove leaked the details of his super PAC to the New York Times, American Crossroads President Steven Law blistered King in the same publication, telling the Times the group was “concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem” and that “all of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.” These comments enraged King because they falsely implied King endorsed Akin’s views and comments about “legitimate rape,” which cost Akin Missouri’s Senate race in 2012.

“Nobody can bully me out of running,” King declared nearly a week ago, after learning of the comments.

And Branstad agrees, noting it would be a “mistake” if Rove’s super PAC went into Iowa and started running negative attacks to tear down King in favor of another candidate backed by the establishment Republican group.

Branstad’s comments are significant not only because he is the governor of the state that kicks off the presidential nomination process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses, but also because Branstad is a politician who has traditionally had good ties to the Republican establishment. Many outside groups, like Rove’s super PAC, are intending to use the 2014 elections as a test run for 2016.

Branstad was not alone in criticizing Rove’s intentions. Even a longtime Rove friend and former Iowa Republican Party chairman, Richard Schwarm, told the Associated Press he felt Rove’s super PAC was a mistake.

“I think that was a total backfire on Rove’s part,” the member of the Iowa Republican political establishment said."

Jeb Bush (R) said Sunday that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other tea party members of Congress need to ""show a little self-restraint"" with their political strategizing, arguing that the government shutdown has badly damaged Republican policymaking priorities.

Speaking with ABC's John Karl, Bush said that problems with the basic structure of Obamacare and the law's flawed rollout would have done more to undermine the program than a hard-nosed GOP threat to shut down the government if the health care law was not defunded. The websites where people are supposed to buy health insurance under Obamacare have been effectively nonfunctional for millions of people since Oct. 1.

Karl asked Bush if he had a message for Cruz.

""Have a little bit of self-restraint,"" Bush replied. ""It might actually be a politically better approach to see the massive dysfunction, but we don't even hear about that because we've stepped on that message ... show a little self-restraint and let this happen a little more organically.""

Bush said the shutdown had damaged America's reputation abroad.

""When we have these political conversations that are not grounded in reality, the rest of the world looks at us as untrustworthy,"" Bush said."

Dem Adv.","A Republican in California won a state Senate seat on Wednesday in a District in which Democrats have a 22-point advantage and that is 60% Hispanic.

Andy Vidak, the Republican farmer, won the special election runoff for the 16th District Senate seat when his opponent, Democrat Leticia Perez, a Kern County Supervisor, conceded on Wednesday, a day after voters cast their ballots. Vidak had 54% of the vote to Perez’s 46%.

Perez had initially conceded two months ago when the special election was held. But a recount put Vidak under the 50% threshold that was needed to avoid a runoff, and Perez took back her concession nearly a week after the initial election. The seat became vacant when the Democrat, who won the seat in 2010 by 21 points, resigned to work for Chevron. Democrats thought, especially with a Hispanic female candidate, the seat would be a shoo-in for them. The veto-proof supermajority Democrats have in the state Senate is now imperiled with Vidak’s victory.

As Breitbart News had previously reported, though, “Vidak, a working class candidate, resonated with working class Hispanics in the district who also saw how coastal California elites were not putting their bread-and-butter interests first.”

Vidak ran broadly on “the bifurcation of California: the coastal liberal elites versus the Valley folks.” On a more local level, Vidak’s theme of “fish versus farmer” resonated with Democrats in a District where the unemployment rate is 15% and as high as 30% in some communities in the District. Vidak reminded voters that liberal environmentalists, in order to protect fish, only allowed farmers to receive 20% of their water allocation, crippling the region’s economy. He also stressed that Perez supported the the state’s high-speed rail project that would have razed business, farms, and homes in the District. Because she supported the agenda of coastal elites and Democrat interest groups, Perez was able to raise twice as much money as Vidak, but 16th District voters ultimately rejected her liberal policies.

It is often said that California is a harbinger of things to come for the country. For Republicans looking at California, there has not been much of hope of late, but Vidak’s victory could be a sign that areas that have traditionally voted for Democrats may give the right kind of Republican a chance as they see unemployment rates increase and opportunities for upward mobility decrease in their communities.

Rand Paul feud could make Christie president,"The chart below is quite illuminating. Texas is the only red state that gets back less than it sends to Washington. Of course Texas' wealth of natural resources can hide a lot of its intrinsic dysfunction.

The above chart and many others have been circulating over the internet for years. They are modified as new data becomes available. One would think that every time a red state politician started grandstanding about smaller government, the mainstream media would ask them if they realized their stance was disproportionately harming their states. In fact, the chart demonstrates a particular pathology that is systemic mostly with red states. One must wonder why the mainstream media’s objective journalists do not feel compelled to investigate this reality with in depth reporting and specials.

Rand Paul inadvertently opened that door for debate. Most importantly, since the argument was made by a Republican to a Republican it runs the risk of being heard by Republicans. Had these facts been articulated by Democrats or liberals, no one on the right would be listening to them or be receptive of learning the fact that Kentucky, as well as all but one red state, are very dependent on the federal government.

Conventional wisdom by most in the mainstream media and other talking heads is that Chris Christie cannot make it out of a Republican primary because he is not conservative enough. Some believe his acceptance of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion was one of the nails in his presidential coffin.

Christie has already earned his conservative bona fides. He cancelled a much-needed tunnel project. He lambasted unions even as some unions endorsed him likely for political reasons. He has revived his tax cut proposal that gives most of its benefits to the top 1 percent. He attacked the Supreme Court decision for ruling that key parts of DOMA were unconstitutional.

If Christie decides to run for president, he will win the Republican primary. He is a conservative and made the minimal political moves in a Blue State to remain so. He is willing to defend his policies even if he has to destroy the false narratives of his red state rivals. He will make them the fake conservatives for preaching small government even as they are on the dole. He will spin his acceptance of Obamacare Medicaid expansion as a fiscally responsible move on a bill that had conservative origins. Christie will use the social-welfare red state reality and make any additional austerity proposed by the right-wingers an attack on the red state middle class. He will make himself the only adult in the room.

Republicans want the White House. They have lost the popular vote in five of the last six elections. 2016 is likely the last election they can win without revamping their party. While the far right claims that the party is not sufficiently to the Right, most Republicans know better. If they were willing to elect Mitt Romney, the governor that actually passed Massachusetts’ version of Obamacare, they surely would be willing to elect Christie who uses it to benefit his indigent (and make money for insurance companies, hospitals, and drug makers).

Ultimately the real question is, can Chris Christie beat Hillary Clinton? As a blue state conservative Republican who uses his brashness when questioned to deflect from the actual policies, as a mainstream media darling, and as a recipient of poor mainstream media scrutiny and in depth analysis, the answer is yes. If Hillary Clinton is tied to Bill Clinton and a narrative is constructed with his Glass Steagall sin, the answer is yes.

If, however, the country buys into two tenets Hillary will win. If the country believes the truth that governance by testosterone has been a failure to the middle class and that conservative policies by Republicans and Democrats alike decimated the middle class, then Hillary Clinton will win.

The exuberance of many that assume that because of demographic changes a Republican cannot win the presidency is false. A Republican like Gov. Chris Christie can."

Send Him Statements To Fact Check Emailing Him', 'Tweeting At Him', 'Or Sending Him A Message On Facebook.']",Sarah Palin’s misreading of polling data,"“You’ve just abandoned the Reagan Democrats with this amnesty bill. It was the loss of working class voters in swing states that cost us the 2012 election, not the Hispanic vote.... You disrespect Hispanics with your assumption that they desire ignoring the rule of law.”

— Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin (R) in a Facebook post titled “Great Job, GOP Establishment, June 28, 2013

Given how many variables can affect a national election, it is sometimes foolhardy to suggest one group or another swung the election. For instance, President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney split 49-49 percent among heterosexuals, while Obama overwhelmingly (76-22 percent) won the votes of gays. But just focusing on that fact would ignore the efforts made by Obama to reach out to other groups to build his winning coalition.

Palin’s comment, posted in response to bipartisan passage of a comprehensive immigration bill in the Senate, struck us as interesting because it assumed Romney lost the so-called Reagan Democrats and that Hispanic voters do not favor a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. What do the data show? (We were assisted by Scott Clement, analyst at The Washington Post’s Capital Insight, in finding some of these data.)

The Facts

First of all, there have been a whole series of polls asking Hispanics about their views on overhauling immigration laws. Excluding advocacy polls with loaded questions, there is a consensus that Hispanics overwhelmingly support a path to citizenship. Here are two key samples:

Voter exit poll, 2012: 77 percent of Hispanics believe illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status.

WSJ-NBC poll, April 2013: 82 percent of Hispanics either strongly favor or somewhat favor a pathway to citizenship.

The 2012 exit poll of voters also found that Americans, by a margin of 65 to 29 percent, believe illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. The WSJ-NBC poll found 64 percent of all Americans favor a pathway to citizenship.

Okay, so a core part of Palin’s assumption is just simply wrong. What about her notion that the loss of “working class voters” in swing states cost the GOP the election? That is a bit more fuzzy, in part because it depends on the definition of “working class” — Clement says there are a dozen different ways to define the term — but Palin’s reasoning is also debatable.

The most basic way to define a working-class voter is someone who lacks a college degree. In 2012, Obama won 51 percent of the national popular vote among non-college voters, 50 percent among college voters. The gap, in fact, has been fairly narrow over the last eight elections, with Democrats doing better among non-college voters than college graduates four times, Republicans four times.

But note that Palin referred to “Reagan Democrats.” This generally refers to white working-class Northern voters. Again, there are different ways to slice this. The National Journal has a handy interactive which allows you to examine the results of the elections between 1980 and 2008, slicing and dicing various categories.

You can see that Republicans already had an edge among white non-college voters — but not among white Democratic non-college voters. Even Reagan lost those voters by a margin of 68 to 27 percent, and the gap only increased in later elections. In fact, many of statistics showing how poorly Democrats do among white voters change substantially when Southern voters are removed; Democrats are competitive with Republicans in winning white voters, especially working-class voters, in New England, the Midwest and the West Coast.

Palin specifically mentioned the loss of Reagan Democrats in swing states. Let’s take a look at Ohio, the ultimate swing state, which Obama won 51 to 48 percent. Using an interactive that shows the difference between 2008 and 2012, you can see that Romney improved over John McCain’s share of white voters, by 5 percentage points, and among people with incomes of less than $30,000 a year; Obama slightly improved among voters with no college degree.

So why did Romney lose even after apparently improving his share of white working class voters? The reason is that white voters made up a smaller percentage of the overall vote in Ohio, falling four percentage points to 79 percent, while the African American vote increased four percentage points, to 15 percent.

A similar dynamic took place in Pennsylvania, where Obama experienced a six percentage point decline in the share of the white vote, but still won because Latinos and other voters of color increased their share of the vote — and went overwhelmingly for the president.

Another key swing state was Colorado, where again Obama lost ground among white voters but minority voters bolstered their share of the electorate and carried the president to victory. In Colorado, Obama’s share of the Hispanic vote was an astonishing 87 percent. (These figures come from an interesting analysis, “The Obama Coalition in the 2012 Election and Beyond,” by Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin.)

Overall, in fact, Obama lost ground among white working-class voters, garnering 36 percent in 2012, compared to 40 percent in 2008, according to a recent article in the New Republic by Teixeira and Andrew Levison. The article notes that even these results may have been distorted by unique events, giving Obama a greater share of such voters than might ordinarily be expected: “In 2008 the financial crisis and a desire to ‘clean house’ boosted white working class support for Obama. In 2012, the GOP fielded a uniquely aloof and unsympathetic Republican candidate.”

In a fascinating article titled “The Case of the Missing White Voters, Revisited,” for Real Clear Politics, Sean Trende concludes, based on population growth, that there were about 6 million white voters who failed to come to the polls. He identifies them as “H. Ross Perot voters” — largely downscale, Northern, rural whites. That may not be quite the same as “Reagan Democrats,” but close enough.

But Trende also concludes that these missing voters, by themselves, were not enough to cost Romney the election because he would have needed to win almost 90 percent of these votes; Trende estimated that Romney at best would have won 70 percent.

The Pinocchio Test

Even given the different ways one can slice poll data, we see little evidence for Palin’s assertions.

If anything, Obama did more poorly among white working-class voters in 2012 than in 2008, even in key swing states. Palin could be talking about the fact that not as many anticipated white voters showed up at the polls, but as Trende shows, even if those missing voters had cast ballots, it would not have made a difference in 2012 election result.

Meanwhile, her claim on Hispanic voters is not borne out by the data that show overwhelming support for policies that would provide a path to citizenship.

Rand Paul’s filibuster against the confirmation of CIA Director and “drone czar” John Brennan offers a “teachable moment” to the media and the left about the Tea Party. As they seethe in outrage and confusion that it took a Republican to question the constitutionality of drone attacks, it is important to remind our friends on the other side that it wasn’t just any Republican, but a–gasp!–Tea Party Republican who spoke “truth to power.”

Not only that, but the Senators who were first to offer their assistance were also Tea Party Republicans–the so-called McCarthyist Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco “Water Break” Rubio of Florida. All three of these Senators won their primary elections against candidates favored by the Republican establishment. All three have been attacked by the left and smeared as racist and extremist for belonging to the Tea Party. Yet without them, no one from either party would have questioned a policy that the left once saw as a dangerous abuse of executive power.

Only one Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, supported Paul. (Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois came to the floor very late in the game to offer a few challenging questions and formally end debate when Paul finally yielded.) Ryan Grim and Mollie Reilly of the Huffington Post observed: “…progressives who might have assumed to have been supportive were absent, leaving members of the GOP as the sole defenders of civil liberties. The White House was equally silent.” Some Democrats, notably Maxine Waters, even slammed Paul as “destructive.”

What many on the left and in the media have willfully failed to understand is that the Tea Party exists to defend the Constitution from unconstitutional encroachments on power and dangerous expansions in the size and cost of government. It did not merely arise in opposition to President Barack Obama; it had its roots in conservative outrage at the bailouts of the last months of George W. Bush’s presidency. At its core, the Tea Party is about American values, not Republican politics. It exists not to obstruct the Democrats but to restore the Constitution.

Rand Paul’s filibuster provided a useful contrast between the Tea Party and the GOP establishment. While Paul stood on the Senate floor, unable to leave the chamber to eat, a dozen other Republicans chose to dine with President Obama in a gesture of bipartisanship. (The contrast is not exact; a few Tea Party favorites attended the dinner, too, and joined Paul later in the Senate chamber.) It had already been hours since Wyden joined Paul’s protest, illustrating that true bipartisanship is forged on the basis of shared principles, not just political necessity.

Democrats and journalists like to describe the Tea Party as “hostage-takers,” holding Republican leaders and moderates in their thrall while they try to dismantle the government. But in reality it is the Washington elite that have taken the country hostage, forcing through expansions of government power and spending vast sums of money that the nation will struggle for generations to repay. The Tea Party represents the last chance to escape the zero-sum politics and economic stagnation that has plagued much of Europe for the last several years.

As Paul continued, liberals who once railed angrily against Bush were forced to confront the fecklessness of their own party. Hollywood’s John Cusack asked: “Where are the so-called progressive Democratic senators?” Meanwhile, the supposedly racist Tea Party Senator from Kentucky was leading the charge. It was not a political ploy for votes, or even an attempt to block one of President Obama’s nominees, which Paul acknowledged he would fail to do. It was just a stand on principle–which is what the Tea Party has been about all along."

In Carson, Measure M would have switched the mayor's seat from a directly elected post to one appointed by the council on a rotating basis.

The initiative appeared to be a bid to oust Mayor Jim Dear, who has been on the council for 12 years and mayor since 2004. He also fought off a challenge in the election from Councilwoman Lula Davis-Holmes.

With all precincts and vote-by-mail ballots counted, the measure was losing 83.2% to 16.8%.

Dear has drawn fire from residents and a rebuke from the Los Angeles County district attorney in recent years over his use of a mute button to silence unruly public speakers -- or, some said, to cut off his critics. He survived a recall election in 2008 launched by residents who said he was too cozy with developers.

What the hell were they thinking?,"Kaboom.

Kaboom.

True, today's deal preserved the existing filibuster rule, but it really didn't. Democrats established that they could bust through any filibuster with a simple majority anytime they wanted. Sure, it's still a process to do so, full of blustery threats and hyperbolic doomsaying, but it's a process [...] But if Republicans continue to prevent up-or-down votes on further administration officials, or perhaps more importantly, judicial ones, Democrats now have a tool to force action. And that means we've come a long way from a few years ago, when Senate Democrats simply shrugged at the inevitability of the GOP filibuster arguing they had no other option.

Republicans could relent on Obama’s right to fill vacancies and keep the filibuster in place. Obama would get some more judges, but he would not be able to fill all the outstanding vacancies by next year considering that he has only identified nominees for about half of those seats. But if Republicans provoke the end of the filibuster, then I suspect the White House can quickly find another 50 or so judges without much fuss.

Just four months ago, I wrote I must admit, I didn't expect Republicans to challenge this notion this quickly. And the reason is simple: Even with a truncated and compromised filibuster, Republicans were able to gum up the works to unprecedented levels. As Bill Sher at the Campaign for America's Future notes , the federal judiciary is now evenly balanced, withand. However, there areIn other words, surrendering on three judges would've allowed the GOP to continue obstructing the other 87. Provoking the Democrats into eliminating the filibuster, on the other hand, now allows Democrats to ram all 90 through with minimal trouble. And there's no longer any need to try and find judges that can pick up a handful of Republican votes, so they should prove better ideologically. This will also take the judiciary from a 50-50 partisan split to a 55-45 Democratic-appointed one. And we still have another three years of vacancies ahead of us before we choose our next president.

So why surrender their ability to gum up the works? Is it a bet that they'll take over the chamber in the 2014 elections? Not really. A presidential veto would negate the need for minority Democrats to filibuster.

So is it a bet that Republicans will take both the Senate next year, and the White House in 2016? Perhaps. But if so, why not give proper deference for three years, relent on a handful of judges, preserve the filibuster, and then ditch it when they theoretically took power in early 2017?

None of this makes sense. Republicans have been daring Democrats to go nuclear all week, and today things went ""boom!"". But that bomb detonated over Republicans while Democrats watched from a safe bunker miles away. So what were Republicans thinking?"

Vice President Thomas Jefferson challenged President John Adams for the top spot in the vicious campaign of 1800. President Andrew Jackson mused sardonically about executing Vice President John C. Calhoun. In the modern era, Lyndon Johnson seethed at slights real and perceived during John Kennedy’s thousand days, then turned around and humiliated his own vice president, Hubert Humphrey. Even Dick Cheney and George W. Bush fell out by the end of their tumultuous terms. But perhaps the most intriguing — and dysfunctional — political marriage in history was the one between the subjects of Jeffrey Frank’s meticulously researched “Ike and Dick.”

Franklin Roosevelt’s vice president memorably said that being No. 2 was in effect not worth a bucket of warm spit. Dwight D. Eisenhower’s vice president may have considered that assessment overly generous after spending eight years under the heel of a war hero whose sunny smile hid the soul of a cold, calculating politician. Frank, a former editor at both The New Yorker and The Washington Post, examines how Ike’s cool nature and detached management style left Richard Nixon insecure and embittered through the remainder of his political career.

“Ike and Dick” is a highly engrossing political narrative that skillfully takes the reader through the twisted development of a strange relationship that would help shape America’s foreign and domestic agenda for much of the 20th century. The two men’s political paths first crossed in 1952 after Eisenhower’s advisers listed Nixon as a potential running mate. (When later asked to explain the pick, Eisenhower would say dismissively, “He was on the list.”) But once his choice was made, Ike found himself tied to a political brawler whose aggressiveness on the campaign trail embarrassed him even when he benefited from those rough-and-tumble tactics."

Actually being a Republican governor of a Democratic state doesn't guarantee victory

As every good subscriber to conventional wisdom knows, when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won his overwhelming reelection victory over an underfunded and little-known opponent, he essentially became president-elect. Why? Because as everybody with at least a surface appreciation of politics knows, New Jersey hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1984 and Christie is a Republican governor in a blue state.

Of course, even on election day there was one little problem with that theory: According to exit polls, the same voters that gave Christie his enormous win would have voted for Hillary Clinton if they had been voting for president and the choice had been between Christie and Hillary.

And now a new NBC News poll shows that Christie has the same problem nationally as he does in New Jersey—and that even at the apex of his popularity, he faces considerable skepticism within the Republican Party.



The poll finds Clinton getting the support of 44 percent of all adults in a hypothetical match up against the New Jersey governor, who gets 34 percent.

The poll shows Hillary leading among African Americans, young people, and Latinos, while Christie leads among whites and upper-income voters, suggesting that for all the hype about Christie being a new kind of Republican, people still see him as a regular old member of the GOP.

But Chris Christie's problem isn't just that he trails Hillary, it's that he's not a lock to to win the GOP nomination.



According to the poll, 32% of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents say they would vote for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in a GOP presidential primary, while 31% prefer another Republican candidate (never mind the other third who are undecided, so together 68% of GOPers are not on board with Christie).

Hillary Clinton's situation is the opposite: Two-thirds of Democrats say they want her to be their party's nominee. Between that and the fact that she leads Christie by 10 points, please excuse the gag-reflex when pundits express the conventional view of Chris Christie's invincibility."

Tonight’s forecast calls for an aggressive Lhota.

With two weeks until Election Day, Joseph J. Lhota, the Republican, lags far behind his Democratic rival, Bill de Blasio.

The mayoral debate tonight, the second of three, will be one of Mr. Lhota’s last chances to reach a big audience and narrow the gap.

We asked Michael Paulson, the Metro political editor for The New York Times, what to expect from Mr. Lhota.

“A sharper edge,” Mr. Paulson predicted. “Gloves off.”

Look for Mr. Lhota to hit hard on crime, charter schools and what he deems Mr. de Blasio’s lack of experience.

Mr. Lhota is hoping to recover from his performance in last week’s debate, when he seemed blindsided by Mr. de Blasio’s sharp attacks.

For his part, Mr. de Blasio will probably just keep using the R-word.

“He seems to think the Republican brand is so damaged here in New York City that repeating that over and over is enough to prevent Lhota from picking up support,” Mr. Paulson said.

The debate, at the CUNY Graduate Center, will be on WCBS-TV, 1010-WINS and CBS-880 radio, from 7 to 8 p.m.

Here’s what else you need to know for Tuesday.

“It got struck by lightning, it was diseased, Sandy didn’t help,” she said.

Ms. Brantley, 33, left small white paper flags and a composition book in a clear bag beside the beech stump on Oct. 10.

Since then, people have posted nearly 50 of her flags on the tree’s roots. (See photo.)

“I miss this tree,” reads the inscription on them.

The composition book has filled with tributes.

“It had skin like an elephant and was wise,” one says.

Someone placed a chunky wooden sculpture on the stump.

It says, “I tried.”

The shrine is still there. You can stop by and pay your respects.

http://news.yahoo.com/no-guarantee-gop-senate-majority-220301758.html,,[],No Guarantee of a GOP Senate Majority,"Between the “sorting out” that took place in the past four elections and a redistricting process that maximized the number of safe seats for both parties—but especially for Republicans—the bulk of the 2014 congressional election action won’t be in the House, but in the Senate. The disproportionate exposure for Senate Democrats is very clear, giving Republicans the opportunity to gain a large number of seats, and potentially the six they need for control of the chamber. However, the same was true last year, when instead of gaining two to four seats, the GOP ended up with a net loss of two. A repeat of that looks extremely unlikely, but whether Republicans are in a position to capitalize on their opportunities remains to be seen.

Two seats will be dispensed with this year: Secretary of State John Kerry’s former seat in Massachusetts—which will be settled June 25—and the seat held by Democrat Frank Lautenberg before his death. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appointed Jeffrey Chiesa, a Republican caretaker, pending an Oct. 16 general election that will be mostly a formality. Republicans are now seen as having little chance of retaining the seat. Democrats are also expected to hold the Massachusetts seat, as Rep. Edward Markey seems to have stabilized his once-precarious advantage over his GOP opponent, former Navy SEAL and pilot Gabriel Gomez. Should Democrats win both of these races, the magic number for Republicans to win control of the chamber goes back up to a six, as it was before Lautenberg’s death.

The 2014 Senate math is quite clear. The last time this particular group of seats came up was in the banner Democratic year of 2008. Democrats have 20 seats up for grabs, to just 15 for the GOP, and six of the Democrats’ seats are in states that Mitt Romney won by double-digit margins. Republicans will have just one seat up in a state that President Obama carried: that of Susan Collins in Maine. Although Obama won there by 15 points, if Collins runs, as she is expected to do, she is extremely likely to win. Another metric to watch is last-election winning percentage. Democrats have seven incumbents up who won with 54.9 percent of the vote or less, Republicans just three. Finally, Democrats have five open seats—usually more difficult to defend—to the GOP’s two.

Story continues

Democrats have four seats up in states that Romney carried by 17 points or more—those of Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Mark Pryor in Arkansas, and open seats in South Dakota and West Virginia, both of which look very likely to go to Republicans. The two incumbents are also slated for extremely difficult challenges. Then, Democrats have two more seats in states that Romney won by 14 points—Mark Begich’s in Alaska and an open seat in Montana, where Max Baucus is retiring. It’s unclear whether Republicans will end up with a high-quality challenger in Alaska; Democrats have a pretty good shot of holding onto the Montana seat if popular former Gov. Brian Schweitzer runs, as he is expected to do. In the last remaining Democratic seat up in a Romney state, Kay Hagan faces a stiff challenge in North Carolina, where Obama lost by 2 points last year after having won narrowly in 2008. Two more Democratic elections to be watched, particularly if the GOP mounts strong challenges, are for the open Michigan seat and the race against Al Franken in Minnesota.

Because 2008 was such a bad year for Republicans, they have very few vulnerable seats left in this class. Democrats have a long shot at picking up Saxby Chambliss’s open seat in Georgia only if Michelle Nunn—daughter of longtime Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn—runs, and, more important, if Republicans nominate an exotic (read: self-destructive) nominee along the lines of then-Rep. Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, both of whom seized defeat from the jaws of victory. In other words, Democrats’ challenge in Georgia is the equivalent of pulling off a two- or three-cushion shot in pool.

After Georgia, the only remote chances Democrats have are in Kentucky, upsetting Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and in Maine, a Democratic-leaning state but with a very popular GOP incumbent. The odds of a Democratic gain in the state, as long as Collins is running, are about nil.

But all of these mathematical opportunities for Republicans are just theoretical unless the GOP recruits and nominates good candidates, a problem that plagued the party the 2010 and 2012 cycles, and begins to cut into its lack of support among minority, younger, female, and moderate voters. In 2010, a great Republican year, the GOP lost five of the seven Senate seats The Cook Political Report rated as Toss-Ups going into Election Day, and also lost eight of the 10 Toss-Ups in 2012—providing a sobering counterpoint to the argument of extensive Democratic exposure. The bottom line is, IF Republicans get their act together, they SHOULD have a good chance to win a majority in the Senate. But that is a big IF."

No governor in America is more like Reagan than Chris Christie

The winning combination starts with a willingness to work with people who disagree with you

With Christie at the helm%2C the New Jersey miracle could be repeated across the country

""Die-hard conservatives thought that if I couldn't get everything I asked for, I should jump off the cliff with the flag flying – go down in flames,"" a well-known Republican leader once said. ""If I can get 70 or 80 percent of what it is I'm trying to get, I'll take that and then continue to try to get the rest in the future.""

What would be considered heresy in today's GOP was uttered by Ronald Reagan. As a governor in cosmopolitan California, he balanced the budget by compromising on tax increases. Rather than eliminating welfare, as was his preference, he worked with California's Democrats to overhaul it. He signed into law the nation's first no-fault divorce legislation over conservative opposition.

Even more shocking than this heresy is another: No governor in America is more like Reagan than Chris Christie. This week, the New Jersey governor will offer a desperately needed lesson in political genius to a party currently going the way of the Whigs.

It is well past time for the rank-and-file GOP to forgive Chris Christie. The once GOP rising star rankled conservatives by daring to embrace Barack Obama during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Rush Limbaugh, for example, said Christie played ""the role of Greek column"" for Obama's campaign. But the truth is that Christie's actions were those of the smartest Republican leader America has seen in decades. Without sacrificing a single ideological principle, he brought relief to his state and established himself as a leader above the petty politics Americans deplore.

Compare Christie's model to the campaign of gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, a rigid ideologue who appeals only to his conservative base and who looks on track to lose in once reliably red Virginia to, of all things, a Clintonite.

Christie is not a perfect messenger, to be sure. Only a few years ago, he seemed almost certain to face a tough re-election fight due to his outspokenness, a sense of extremism and his girth. But while he has maintained a record as a rock-solid conservative, Christie has shown he knows how to govern in an arctic-blue state that Republican presidential candidates haven't won since 1988, and as he'll show next week when he is re-elected by a landslide, he also knows how to win.

The winning combination starts with a willingness to work with people who disagree with you. Reagan had a great relationship with the Democratic Speaker of the California Assembly, and as president with Speaker Tip O'Neill. Similarly, Christie's relationship with New Jersey's heavily Democratic legislature has made possible the passage of spending cuts, pension reform, public employee benefits reform, and teacher tenure reform. For Reagan, cooperation made possible his economic revolution. For Christie, it has saved a state budget that was spiraling toward catastrophe.

To win elections, you need to show people that you're for them, even if they're not (yet) for you. Reagan did this so effectively that a new term entered the political lexicon: Reagan Democrat. Likewise, Christie appealed to Hispanics by endorsing a ""clear path to citizenship"" and in-state college tuition for illegal aliens. He also appealed to moderates and law enforcement by telling a disappointed and combative Sean Hannity, ""I favor some of the gun-control measures we have in New Jersey."" And he appealed to the gay community and young voters who support gay rights by abandoning a hopeless legal challenge to defend traditional marriage.

The governor also appealed to voters beyond his base when he lambasted the Republican Congress for delaying a disaster-relief bill for victims of Hurricane Sandy. His message to New Jersey's residents was that they mattered more to him than politics or partisan loyalty. Christie sent the same message by spending countless hours touring the battered Jersey shore, hugging survivors, speaking emotionally about his state's loss, and – most controversially – praising Obama for his help just days before Obama's re-election.

If Republicans want to avoid becoming a regional party condemned to a minority status, our best and brightest should hop on a train to Trenton, get out their notepads, and ask Christie for help. After that, they should make him Chairman of the Republican National Committee. With Christie at the helm, the New Jersey miracle could be repeated across the country – just in time for what might otherwise be a surprisingly dismal 2014 midterm election.

The media giveth and the media taketh away. And so the consensus that she will be sworn in as president in January 2017 has begun to crumble.

All right, I’m exaggerating a bit. More than two years before the Iowa caucuses, normal people haven’t even tuned in. And many in the press undoubtedly believe that Clinton will be facing off against Chris Christie, who as expected won a huge reelection victory yesterday. (For junkies: a network exit poll had her beating Christie in New Jersey, 49 to 43 percent.)

I’ve always had problems with the whole Hillary inevitability scenario, having seen that evaporate in 2008. But the conventional wisdom in the press seemed set in cement, notwithstanding the fact that Clinton hasn’t said she’s running.

Now comes liberal New York Times columnist Frank Bruni to say that, gadzooks, she’s slipping in the polls. An NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found that Clinton’s favorability rating had slipped from 56 to 46 percent, while her unfavorable rose from 29 to 33 percent. Stop the presses!

“Here we go. The beginning of the end of her inevitability...

“Voters are souring on familiar political operators, especially those in, or associated with, Washington. That’s why Clinton has fallen. She’s lumped together with President Obama, with congressional leaders, with the whole reviled lot of them.”

That’s an excellent and underappreciated point.

“And some of the ways in which she stands out from the lot aren’t flattering. She comes with a more tangled political history of gifts bestowed, favors owed, ironclad allegiances and ancient feuds than almost any possible competitor does…

“And what would the argument for a Hillary presidency be? Something interesting happens when you ask Democrats why her in 2016. They say that it’s time for a woman, that she’ll raise oodles of dough, that other potentially strong candidates won’t dare take her on. The answers are about the process more than the person or any vision she has for the country. There’s no poetry in them. That’s not good.”

I wouldn’t dispute for a second that Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming Democratic front-runner, even if there’s a challenge from the left, and that the groundbreaking nature of her candidacy will be a major asset. But I’ve always felt the media bestowed the inevitability crown too quickly, and here’s why.

No one knows what the political climate will be in 2016, but I know this: After eight years of one party controlling the White House, voters are usually ready for a change. Only once since the advent of presidential term limits—when George H.W. Bush defeated the hapless Mike Dukakis to succeed Ronald Reagan—has the country given one party 12 straight years.

If the Obama administration is limping out of office at relatively low popularity, that will affect the woman who was the president’s secretary of State. If ObamaCare is judged by then to have been a disaster, that will affect the woman who first pushed universal health care when her husband was president.

And since Hillary has been a national figure since 1992, and Bill is such a force in the Democratic Party, it’s a bit harder for her to run as a fresh face if Washington seems like a mess.

She could overcome all of that, of course, with an inspiring campaign. But it’s a tad early to say that in November of 2013.

Meanwhile, Carla Marinucci of the San Francisco Chronicle is razzing her approach to the lecture circuit:

“Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hasn’t even started her 2016 presidential campaign yet — and she’s already shutting out the press.

Clinton’s much-anticipated speech at the Moscone Center on Saturday before the National Association of Realtors conference, a convention that is drawing 22,000 people to San Francisco this week, will be blacked out — closed to the media.

“So will her big fundraiser Saturday night with Chelsea Clinton at San Francisco’s Regency Ballroom, a ‘Millennial Network’ event to benefit the Clinton Foundation.

“The decision to bar reporters from the Clinton speech before thousands of Realtors is ‘per her team’s request,’ a National Association of Realtors spokeswoman told us in an e-mail Monday.

“Seriously? In San Francisco? The easiest Democratic audience in the country? The region that’s home to Twitter, Facebook and Google?”

And it’s her buckraking that draws fire from National Review’s Victor Davis Hanson:

“Hillary Clinton is no doubt a talented speaker. She recently went into what the left wing sees as the heart of darkness of the American 1 percent at Goldman Sachs, purportedly gave two brief chats, and walked away with a reported $400,000 in fees. Such compensation is almost as profitable as Hillary’s long-ago cattle-future trading, in which as a talented rookie speculator she beat one-in-several-million odds by parlaying an original $1,000 investment into a $100,000 profit.

“That Goldman’s shenanigans were central to the 2008 housing and financial meltdown — and were empowered, in part, by Bill Clinton’s own prior twofer of deregulating Wall Street and appointing to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae greedy, though liberal, incompetents of the likes of James Johnson, Franklin Raines, and Jamie Gorelick — apparently meant nothing to Hillary.”

You can expect to see much more of this if she runs.

Confrontational Christie

There was one speed bump on Chris Christie’s big reelection, and that was the image of his wagging a finger at a New Jersey teacher who challenged him.

His heated encounter with Melissa Tomlinson of the state’s largest teachers’ union is getting plenty of coverage. Here’s part of her interview with Salon:

Christie’s opponent has called him a “bully.” Do you think that’s fair? Is that how you saw him?

I’m going to be honest … I haven’t seen enough of him to say, “Yes, he’s a bully.” Did I feel bullied at the time? Yes I did. I left shaking.

Why shaking?

It was a kind of a scary confrontation. He shouted at me. The crowd shouted at me. The crowd cheered when he shouted at me. People told me I was in the wrong place to be doing this. People need to understand it has to be done — somebody has to do it.

The governor responded in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper:

TAPPER: The photograph of this big strong governor berating a poor little teacher as some might see it, could be counterproductive to what you want to achieve.

CHRISTIE: First is that whole incident as an incident was mischaracterized and overdramatized by the teacher who belongs to a portion of the teachers union.

Are there times I wish I would have said something? Sure. But what I think people see in me is that I’m genuine.

That’s sort of a microcosm of the debate over Chris Christie and his outsize personality.

Governments operate, to a degree, by force, but ultimately they depend on legitimacy. A government that a majority views as a threat, and that only a small minority sees as enjoying the consent of the governed, is a government with legitimacy problems.

I suspect that these issues also have something to do with the increasing bitterness and polarization of today's politics, but not the way you might think. As science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle wrote in 2008, ""We have always known that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom. It's worse now, because capture of government is so much more important than it once was. There was a time when there was enough freedom that it hardly mattered which brand of crooks ran government. That has not been true for a long time -- not during most of your lifetimes, and for much of mine -- and it will probably never be true again.""

That captures an important point. The more powerful the government becomes, the more people are willing to do in order to seize the prize, and the more afraid they become when someone else has control. So it was after the 2004 election when liberals talked revolution, and so again after 2012, when secession petitions flooded the White House.

There are two possible ways to address this problem. One is to elect people that everyone trusts. The problem with that is that there aren't any politicians that everyone trusts -- and, alas, if there were, the odds are good that such trust would turn out to be misplaced.

The other option is to place less power within the political sphere. The less power the government has, the less incentive for corruption, and the less that can go wrong when the government misbehaves. The problem with this approach is that the political class likes a powerful government -- it's one of the reasons that the Washington, DC, area, where much of the political class lives, is beginning to resemble the Capital City in The Hunger Games, prospering while the rest of the country suffers.

The political class usually gets its way, because it thinks about politics -- and its own position -- every waking moment, while the rest of America thinks about these things only in fits and starts, in between living everyday life. But if there's an upside to the increasing unhappiness that most Americans feel toward the political class, it's that maybe it means people are paying closer attention.

What's next? In my constitutional law class the other day, most of my students took the position that they would be unlikely to see a Constitutional Convention in their lifetimes. I'm not so sure. Last year I spoke at a Harvard Law School conference on holding a new Constitutional Convention, one which had participants from all sorts of ideological positions ranging from the Tea Party to the Occupy Wall Street movement. (People got along surprisingly well.)

In the American system, a Constitutional Convention -- which has never been held since the Constitution was adopted -- is the last stop before revolution. It was intended as a way for the people to end-run the political establishment; if enough states request a convention, Congress has no choice but to call it, and the resulting proposals go straight to the states for ratification, bypassing Congress. It's a way to make drastic changes when the political class has blocked smaller ones.

Are we there yet? I don't think so. But we're getting closer all the time. Political class, take note.

Shear']",White House Sharpens Focus on Path Forward After Troubles,"BALTIMORE — President Obama, struggling to find his footing after one of his most turbulent weeks in office, will try to push past the moment’s political furor with a focus on the few pieces of legislation he believes have a chance in Congress and on executive actions that do not require Republican approval.

The president’s aides, wary of what they say are Republican attempts to seize on woes as a way of thwarting Mr. Obama’s agenda, have ordered the White House staff not to be distracted by approaching hearings on Capitol Hill. Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, has told those in the West Wing that he expects them to spend no more than 10 percent of their time on the controversies.

In a meeting with Democratic strategists on Thursday morning, Mr. McDonough outlined a plan to intensify focus on revamping immigration laws, reaching a budget deal, and carrying out the health care law. The White House is also preparing a new push to keep student loan rates low when the current ones expire this summer, on the theory that the best way to get past the controversies is to emphasize policy proposals and contrast them with what the administration will portray as political gamesmanship by the Republicans.

“We’ve got to stay focused,” Mr. McDonough told the group of strategists, according to Mike McCurry, a former spokesman for President Bill Clinton, who was at the meeting. “Even if it’s not going to break through in the short run, we’ve got to keep hammering on,” Mr. McDonough added, according to the account."

In 2016%2C photo ID will be required to vote in North Carolina.

Early voting sites will now be open longer.

North Carolina has no-excuse absentee voting. New York does not.

Imagine if the Transportation Security Administration decided airline passengers no longer need a photo ID. Providing a name and destination would be good enough to board an airplane. No doubt, the public and our national elected representatives wouldn't stand for such lax protection.

Similar concern has been expressed by new residents of North Carolina when they discover a photo ID isn't required at the polls. They're amazed that providing a name and address is all it takes to get inside the voting booth.

Newcomers aren't the only ones concerned. The vast majority of North Carolinians believe that photo ID should be required to cast a vote.

In 2016, photo ID will be required to vote in North Carolina, just as it is today when citizens cash a check, apply for government benefits or even when buying cold remedies such as Sudafed.

The need for photo ID has been questioned by those who say voter fraud isn't a problem in North Carolina. However, assuming fraud isn't a threat when multimillion dollar campaigns are trying to win in a state where millions of votes are cast is like believing oversight isn't needed against Wall Street insider trading.

The changes we're making in early voting have been called restrictive by liberals and the news media. That's not true. While the early voting calendar has been shortened, the actual number of hours a voter has to cast an early ballot is unchanged.

Going forward, early voting sites will now be open longer, and uniform days of operation will guarantee every voter has an equal opportunity to cast an early ballot.

When our reforms are fully implemented, North Carolina will remain a national leader in ballot access, a fact you might find surprising given the hypocritical national reporting.

The New York Times characterized North Carolina as a leader in voter suppression. Yet, North Carolina has 10 days of early voting. New York offers none. North Carolina has no-excuse absentee voting. New York does not.

In reality, the legislation I signed into law keeps North Carolina in the mainstream of election law, not the fringes.

Photo ID has made flying safer and prevents fraud in government programs. Photo ID has become a part of everyday life in America, and our individual vote deserves the same protection.

Pat McCrory is the governor of North Carolina."

While it may be tempting to interpret these numbers as proof that a notable swath of Democratic voters are so passionate about Bill Thompson that they want him to be the nominee no matter what, that theory seems debunked by the fact that he has not been a frontrunner in polls that have included all of the primary candidates. Instead he miraculously vaults to the front of the pack when voters are forced to contemplate a Weiner or Quinn mayoralty.

http://news.yahoo.com/ashley-judd-making-kentucky-democrats-nervous-060006565--politics.html,,[],Ashley Judd Is Making Kentucky Democrats Nervous,"The honeymoon is over for Ashley Judd.

At a time when Democrats in Washington are having second thoughts about embracing Ashley Judd as their standard-bearer against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2014, Kentucky Democrats are waving red flags about the actress, arguing that her candidacy plays into the GOP’s strengths and tarnishes the party brand in the Bluegrass State.

“She’s gonna have a tough row to hoe,” said Jim Cauley, who ran Gov. Steve Beshear’s 2007 campaign and also worked on President Obama’s 2004 Senate campaign. “She doesn't fit the damn state. That's her problem. I don't think she fits the voters of the state of Kentucky.”

As she gets closer to an announcement of her intentions, Judd has garnered national media attention. Strategists predict that a Judd-McConnell faceoff would be one of the most expensive and closely watched Senate races in recent years. Judd's backers say she is the only Democrat who could raise enough money to not only attack McConnell's record, but also beat Kentucky’s longest-serving senator.

Other Democrats in the state, including a top donor in Northern Kentucky, disagree. They argue she has not been in the state enough to mount a credible attack on McConnell, who will be ready for the fight. Karl Rove’s super PAC American Crossroads attacked Judd with a Web video earlier this year for living in Tennessee.

""I'm in this to win it, and I don't believe Ashley Judd is in it to win it,"" said Nathan Smith, a leading Kentucky Democratic donor, who is also the head of the Manufactured Housing Institute. Smith helped raise money for Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Beshear. He’s hosted Hillary Rodham Clinton at his house. He said he called Judd about 10 days ago, prepared to give his advice to the actress, but hasn’t heard back.

""If she was to call me tonight, I would give her some advice and I doubt that she'd be excited to come back for round two of that conversation. I don't care how many movies she's made."" Smith said.

Story continues

To Bluegrass State Democrats who worry about winning back the state Senate and keeping the state House, national Democrats are more concerned with forcing Republicans to spend money in Kentucky and distract McConnell from his day job as Republican Senate leader. They see Judd as a political infatuation. The actress, they say, would have trouble winning a state Mitt Romney carried by nearly 23 points in 2012.

Asked if his reaction amounted to sour grapes because Judd hadn’t called him personally, Smith told a story about a recent high school basketball event that drew some 20,000 people. He said he talked to dozens who were skeptical about Judd.

“Maybe she can become a senator without talking to anybody from Kentucky,” Smith said.

Top Democrats who are cool to Judd’s candidacy say they’d like to see Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes get into the race. The daughter of a former state party chair, Grimes defeated her GOP challenger by a wide margin. State Democratic officials stop short of calling for a primary if Judd enters the race, but they give voice to a wider concern that McConnell will get whom he wants in Judd—an opponent who can be tied to the president.

“Electing Ashley Judd gets a Republican Legislature elected. That's what I see at stake here. Your perspective is different if you're in New York or Los Angeles. They don't live here. We do. Judd's candidacy makes it seamlessly easy to Obama-ize this election,” one Kentucky Democratic strategist said."

To be sure, while political observers and most other Americans are looking ahead at whether Republicans can retake the Senate in 2014 or if Hillary Clinton will become a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, the bare-knuckled Virginia race is attracting national attention.

Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe is relatively new to running for office -- with one unsuccessful attempt, a 2009 try to become Virginia governor.

However, he is well known in national political circles as a prolific fundraiser for former President Clinton and Hillary Clinton and as a former Democratic National Committee chairman.

His Republican opponent is Virginia Attorney General and social conservative Ken Cuccinelli, creating a race that has drawn more than one comparison to a potential 2016 presidential match up.

“It’s a prelude to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign,” David Bossie, president of the conservative nonprofit Citizens United, told Fox News on Sunday.

The non-partisan Cook Political Report this month called the contest “the marquee race on the ballot nationally in November” and predicted “much will be read into the results as the 2014 cycle moves into high gear.”

Both campaigns in the too-close-to-call race have attempted to ride this year’s scandal wave – linking the rival candidate to questionable activities by either him or members of his party.

The biggest so far appears to focus on the relationship major political donor Jonnie Williams has with Cuccinelli and outgoing Virginia Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell.

News reports this month revealed Williams gave more than $120,000 in loans to McDonnell’s wife and to a business the governor co-owned.

The revelations follow Cuccinelli amended four years' worth of reports in April to show gifts from Williams.

Among the unreported gifts were a $3,000 summer family retreat and a $1,500 family Thanksgiving dinner at Williams' lodge in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountain foothills.

Richmond's commonwealth's attorney, Democrat Mike Herring, recently said he found no evidence that Cuccinelli violated the state ethics law.

McDonnell has repaid the loans, but the money and thousands of dollars in gifts from Williams remain at the center of two investigations.

Meanwhile, McAuliffe is facing criticism about two associated, green-energy businesses that have yet to become the job-creating firms he touted them to be.

One company, GreenTech Automotive, is an energy-efficient car manufacturer with a plant in Mississippi, not Virginia, whose output remains unclear after roughly three years.

McAuliffe critics last week tried to bring GreenTech into a purported federal investigation involving the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Alejandro Mayorkas, who also is President Obama's choice to be the No. 2 official at the Homeland Security Department.

Mayorkas is purportedly being investigated for possibly helping a company that funded GreenTech also secure an international investor visa, even after the application was denied and an appeal was rejected.

McAuliffe resigned as GreenTech chairman before starting his gubernatorial campaign.

The second company is Franklin Pellets, which was started in Virginia in 2010 but appears yet to have become operational.

Citizens United is out with a video this week titled “Fast Terry,” a documentary about both companies.

Bossie argue the video doesn’t mention the gubernatorial race and is intended only to “educate Americans about Terry McAuliffe,"" considering he “hangs his hat on his business background.”

The McAuliffe campaign responded by saying it was not surprised by the video considering Citizens United has given the Cuccinelli campaign more than $100,000 through other groups.

Virginia has increasingly become a bellwether state, with its Washington suburbs voting largely Democrat and its rural southwestern region and Hampton Roads, with its many military bases, leaning Republican.

Though McDonnell is a Republican, the state's two previous governors, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, are Democrats and are now Virginia’s U.S. senators.

Cuccinelli and McAuliffe clashed hard in the first to what appears will be three debates.

McAuliffe attacked Cuccinelli over the Williams’ gifts and supporting socially conservative activism.

He also criticized Cuccinelli for what he described as deterring Virginia’s business growth.

“There are consequences to mean-spirited hatefulness,” McAuliffe said, citing Cuccinelli’s legal actions against a University of Virginia climate-change researcher; a 2010 letter telling state-supported colleges they couldn’t enact anti-discrimination policies protecting gays; and actions to restrict abortions.

Cuccinelli accused McAuliffe of stiff-arming some of Virginia’s most destitute regions by building the GreenTech plant in Mississippi.

“The only candidate in this race who has chased business out of Virginia is you,” Cuccinelli said. “You walked right over the people of Martinsville on your way to Mississippi.”

Even hardened cynics speak about the possibility of a brighter economic horizon and the prospective easing of international sanctions that have throttled growth, spurred inflation and fostered a general malaise.

“It’s not in my genes to vote,” Ismael, a tea hawker and chess devotee, said as he poured cups of steaming tea for bazaar denizens and tradesmen. “But I am confident of a better economic situation once sanctions are lifted.”

Ismael said he had become so discouraged by Islamic rule that a few years ago he took the radical step of converting to the ancient faith of Zoroastrianism, a switch that earned him a jail term.

Throughout Iran, enthusiasm appears robust for Rouhani, who swept to a surprising landslide victory in last month’s election with pledges of change and reform. The fact that he is a cleric and mainstay of the religious-political establishment not known for progressive views — and someone who isn’t considered an economic expert — doesn’t seem to have dimmed the fervor that erupted in street celebrations after his election was confirmed.

Many Iranians apparently are eager to get past the gloom and bluster that defined the eight-year administration of outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Anticipation of recovery and a shift in tone are evident from the warrens of Tehran’s central bazaar to the capital’s stylish coffee bars to the gardens and historical sites in the ancient city of Shiraz to the south.

Ahmadinejad seemed to revel in polemical salvos, targeting both the West and his political adversaries at home, but Rouhani has adopted moderation and change as his motto.

Advertisement

“Iranians chose a new path,” the centrist said in his first official comments after his election. “Iranians voted for moderation and logic.”

Rouhani also has said that compromise with the international community about difficult issues, notably Iran’s controversial nuclear program, would not amount to capitulation.

“Moderation in foreign policy is neither surrender nor conflict, neither passivity nor confrontation,” he said. “Moderation is effective and constructive interaction with the world.”

At an artsy cafe in Tehran, young people disenchanted with what they view as the grim dominion of the mullahs seemed eager for a more open era.

“Maybe now the police won’t hassle us so much,” said Siavash, a long-haired guitarist in his 20s, strumming tunes like “Hotel California” and “Oh! Susanna” with a makeshift band as admiring young women hummed along. Like many Iranians interviewed recently, he wanted only his first name used, fearing potential reprisal.

Siavash and his friends were jamming on a shaded patch of grass across the street from the former U.S. Embassy, now a Revolutionary Guard Corps compound where graffiti on the exterior walls proclaim “Stomp on America!” The student-led seizure of the site in 1979 resulted in a 444-day hostage drama that still colors U.S.-Iranian relations.

Noticeably absent in the capital after Rouhani’s election were the much-resented morality police, who look askance at freewheeling public gatherings of young men and women.

About 500 miles to the south in Shiraz, at the lush gardens of the tomb of the revered Persian poet Saadi, a waiter named Ali despaired at the plight of Iran’s many well-educated people unable to find good jobs.

“Many young in this country cannot afford to get married,” said Ali, 30, who voted for Rouhani. He said he was hopeful of progress but not delusional. “We have been living on hope for 34 years,” he said, referring to the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

At Tehran’s highly choreographed Friday prayers, chants of “Death to America!” remain a constant. But many Iranians not connected with the government indicated that for many people, economic well-being has trumped reflexive hostility toward the West.

Even many who favored more conservative candidates voiced hope that the new president will break the stranglehold of sanctions, restore the value of Iran’s currency, help create jobs and rein in inflation.

“I didn’t vote for Rouhani, but I do believe he can do something about these soaring prices,” said Hossian, 28, a laborer and father of a young child who was reclining on lush carpets in the sprawling, air-conditioned mausoleum of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the revolution, whose immense shrine in the southern reaches of the capital is a pilgrimage site for revolutionary die-hards.

“I have to work hard just to make ends meet,” said Hossian, who was visiting from the industrial town of Gorgan, near the Caspian Sea.

Back at the rambling bazaar, Sina, 30, said the dearth of employment opportunities had led him to find work in one sector that seems to be flourishing: sanctions-busting. He said he helps import smuggled aircraft parts, one of many items in short supply because of international bans.

“I think Rouhani was brought to the scene to get the sanctions lifted,” said Sina, a slim man who was among the people working their side deals outside the bazaar’s entrance. “Otherwise the survival of the ruling establishment is jeopardized.”

But with hopes so high, Rouhani’s allies have hastened to emphasize that a chief of state can do only so much. Some fear a crisis of dashed expectations, especially since Rouhani’s efforts will be subject to veto from Iran’s hard-line supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word on foreign policy and security issues, such as Iran’s nuclear program.

Former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, whose election in 1997 ushered in a similar period of hope for reform, has already advised Iranians not to look for a quick turnaround in the nation’s economic predicament.

“Be cautious, there is no rush, do not expect too much,” Khatami, who helped engineer Rouhani’s victory, said last week in one of a number of public statements designed to tamp down expectations.

There are, of course, pessimists, like Parviz, 68, a chain-smoking artisan encountered in the doorway of his Tehran apartment building along a once-notorious street called Lazar-e-Nou, home to cabarets, cafes and all-night bars before the revolution and now a drab strip that houses mostly shops selling fixtures for lamps. Some shuttered movie houses still bear scorch marks from the arson attacks that militants carried out after the revolution.

“The ones in charge now are so entrenched they will never give up power,” said Parviz, who recalled the days when men and women held hands in public after evenings spent in the bistros and cinemas. “Look at the faces of the people: No one is smiling today.”

Rouhani appears to have noticed too.

“I assure you that the ideals of the Islamic Republic of Iran did not include the suppression of joy and jubilation,” he told an Iranian youth magazine.

Advertisement

In his first major postelection speech, he seemed to acknowledge that the dour style of top-heavy leadership had gone too far.

“Happiness,” he said, “is our people’s right.”

But rather than serve as a fresh read on the feelings of an electorate tormented by the messy and combative budget mess in Washington, the closing days served up a bipartisan shoulder shrug.

Turnout was reported to be light, if steady, the former befitting a strangely-timed Wednesday election, just a few weeks before the regularly scheduled statewide elections. (The date was chosen by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican running for reelection next month; the Senate seat was held by Democrat Frank Lautenberg until his death in June.)

Democrat and Newark mayor Cory Booker was the Senate frontrunner throughout, helped by outside parties like New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s political organization, which aired ads on Booker’s behalf. Republican Steve Lonegan battled from behind, with tea party allies making verbal pitches for him but not tossing in the kind of cash that could have made the contest more competitive.

“New Jersey, the eyes of America are on you tomorrow,” former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said Tuesday, as she solicited volunteers nationwide to call in to New Jersey to persuade voters to cast ballots.

Lonegan’s chances seemed limited to the combination of strong tea party turnout and a flatlining for Booker among New Jersey’s dominant Democratic voters, a circumstance made easier by the selection of the Wednesday election day.

A poll released Monday showed Booker with a comfortable 10-point lead, though the Monmouth University pollsters cautioned that “turnout continues to be a big question in this unprecedented situation: a mid-October Wednesday election held just three weeks before the regularly scheduled November election for governor, state legislature, and a variety of local offices.”

The poll showed that, as can happen in contentious contests, voters had come to agree with the negative arguments made by both sides.

Almost half of likely voters — 48% — said Booker was seeking office to fashion a place on the national stage, to 37% who said he was interested in serving New Jersey. (That was a central argument by Lonegan, who made much of Booker’s Hollywood connections and frequent travel.)

But more likely voters than not also felt that Lonegan’s conservative views were out of step with the state, reflecting the thrust of Booker’s criticisms.

“Concerns about Cory Booker’s intentions to serve New Jersey continue to persist and his favorability ratings continue to drop. At the same time, voters clearly prefer Booker’s political views over Lonegan’s,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.

As election day neared, both candidates did what candidates do before special elections: try to maximize the turnout of their voters by any means possible.

“I am asking for your vote today in this pivotal race for #NJ & America,” Lonegan told supporters via Twitter. “The polls close at 8P. Thank you for your support.” @lonegan

Booker received a blizzard of tweets from supporters noting that they had cast ballots for him. “Thank you! Please encourage others to do so,” he said.

The “We the People Amendment” is being introduced by Representative Rick Nolan (DFL-Minnesota) and Representative Mark Pocan (D-Wisconsin). http://WeThePeopleAmendment.org How much different was our politics the day before Citizen’s United and the day after? How different would the outcome of the 2012 elections be absent Citizen’s United? It would not be very different. There are two reasons this is likely the case. The first is that each side uses the same rules to maximize their political dollars and diverging interests are currently relatively equal. The second is that there is a point of diminishing returns. After TV, Radio, print, and online ads are saturated in a relatively balanced manner from both sides, they become simply fog to the average American citizen, and no longer has influence. At that point ideology is the driving factor. For several elections, this country has been voting as a center left country and it continues to vote that way. What is the concern then? The concern is the same; the corrosive effect money has on our politics. Favors are owed to those big donors on both sides of the aisle. Moreover, big donors usually find a way to have their foot in every door and as such donate to each side. The Citizens United case in effect equates money and speech. Since we have freedom of speech, it effectively removed the government’s authority to regulate unlimited political contributions. There is only one solution to this corruption, a constitutional amendment that specifically decouples money from speech and removes corporate personhood. This will ensure that while free speech is maintained, the use of money in politics can be regulated. Moreover it will remove the ability of corporate entities of any kind (corporations, non-profits, unions, etc.) from claiming free speech rights and other rights of living breathing human beings. Many organizations are already working on constitutional amendments purported to solve the problem. Most solely concentrate on the overturning of ""Citizens United"" or codifying that money is not speech. Again the question must be asked, what is the difference pre and post Citizens United. The organization Move to Amend (http://movetoamend.org) is the only one currently working on an all-encompassing amendment that will solve the corruption, once and for all as it covers both the decoupling of money and speech, as well as removing corporate personhood. Move to Amend, by means of its over 160 affiliates have already gotten resolutions passed at the city, county, and state levels. Following the grassroots method of building awareness through the resolution process is likely the most effective way of generating popular support for real change in our electoral and political process. This is how the process of real change begins. It is the engagement of the grassroots and electoral politics."

On the eve of his second inaugural, President Obama appears smarter, tougher and bolder than ever before. But whether he is also wiser remains a key question for his new term.

It is clear that he is consciously changing his leadership style heading into the next four years. Weeks before the November elections, his top advisers were signaling that he intended to be a different kind of president in his second term.

“Just watch,” they said to me, in effect, “he will win re-election decisively and then he will throw down the gauntlet to the Republicans, insisting they raise taxes on the wealthy. Right on the edge of the fiscal cliff, he thinks Republicans will cave.”

What’s your Plan B, I asked. “We don’t need a Plan B,” they answered. “After the president hangs tough – no more Mr. Nice Guy – the other side will buckle.” Sure enough, Republicans caved on taxes. Encouraged, Obama has since made clear he won’t compromise with Republicans on the debt ceiling, either.

Foreman: My last letter to the president

Obama 2.0 stepped up this past week on yet another issue: gun control. No president in two decades has been as forceful or sweeping in challenging the nation’s gun culture. Once again, he portrayed the right as the enemy of progress and showed no interest in negotiating a package up front.

In his coming State of the Union address, and perhaps in his inaugural, the president will begin a hard push for a comprehensive reform of our tattered immigration system. Leading GOP leaders on the issue – Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, for example – would prefer a piecemeal approach that is bipartisan. Obama wants to go for broke in a single package, and on a central issue – providing a clear path to citizenship for undocumented residents – he is uncompromising.

After losing out on getting Susan Rice as his next secretary of state, Obama has also shown a tougher side on personnel appointments. Rice went down after Democratic as well as Republican senators indicated a preference for Sen. John Kerry. But when Republicans also tried to kill the nomination of Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense, Obama was unyielding – an “in-your-face appointment,” Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, called it, echoing sentiments held by some of his colleagues.

Will Obama’s second inauguration let America turn the page?

Republicans would have preferred someone other than Jack Lew at Treasury, but Obama brushed them off. Hagel and Lew – both substantial men – will be confirmed, absent an unexpected bombshell, and Obama will rack up two more victories over Republicans.

Strikingly, Obama has also been deft in the ways he has drawn upon Vice President Joe Biden. During much of the campaign, Biden appeared to be kept under wraps. But in the transition, he has been invaluable to Obama in negotiating a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on the fiscal cliff and in pulling together the gun package. Biden was also at his most eloquent at the ceremony announcing the gun measures.

His new style is paying off politically. But in the long run, will it also pay off in better governance? David Gergen

All of this has added up for Obama to one of the most effective transitions in modern times. And it is paying rich dividends: A CNN poll this past week pegged his approval rating at 55%, far above the doldrums he was in for much of the past two years. Many of his long-time supporters are rallying behind him. As the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to score back-to-back election victories with more than 50% of the vote, Obama is in the strongest position since early in his first year.

Smarter, tougher, bolder – his new style is paying off politically. But in the long run, will it also pay off in better governance? Perhaps – and for the country’s sake, let’s hope so. Yet, there are ample reasons to wonder, and worry.

Avlon: GOP’s surprising edge on diversity

Ultimately, to resolve major issues like deficits, immigration, guns and energy, the president and Congress need to find ways to work together much better than they did in the first term. Over the past two years, Republicans were clearly more recalcitrant than Democrats, practically declaring war on Obama, and the White House has been right to adopt a tougher approach after the elections.

But a growing number of Republicans concluded after they had their heads handed to them in November that they had to move away from extremism toward a more center-right position, more open to working out compromises with Obama. It’s not that they suddenly wanted Obama to succeed; they didn’t want their party to fail.

House Speaker John Boehner led the way, offering the day after the election to raise taxes on the wealthy and giving up two decades of GOP orthodoxy. In a similar spirit, Rubio has been developing a mainstream plan on immigration, moving away from a ruinous GOP stance.

One senses that the hope, small as it was, to take a brief timeout on hyperpartisanship in order to tackle the big issues is now slipping away.

Zelizer: Second-term Obama will play defense

While a majority of Americans now approve of Obama’s job performance, conservatives increasingly believe that in his new toughness, he is going overboard, trying to run over them. They don’t see a president who wants to roll up his sleeves and negotiate; they see a president who wants to barnstorm the country to beat them up. News that Obama is converting his campaign apparatus into a nonprofit to support his second term will only deepen that sense. And it frustrates them that he is winning: At their retreat, House Republicans learned that their disapproval has risen to 64%.

Conceivably, Obama’s tactics could pressure Republicans into capitulation on several fronts. More likely, they will be spoiling for more fights. Chances for a “grand bargain” appear to be hanging by a thread.

Two suspicions are starting to float among those with distaste for the president. The first is that he isn’t really all that committed to bringing deficits under control. If he were, he would be pushing a master plan by now. Instead, it is argued, he will tinker with the deficits but cares much more about leaving a progressive legacy – health care reform, a stronger safety net, green energy, and the like.

Politics: Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company

Second, the suspicion is taking hold that he is approaching the second term with a clear eye on elections ahead. What if he can drive Republicans out of control of the House in 2014? Then he could get his real agenda done. What if he could set the stage for another Democrat to win the presidency in 2016? Then he could leave behind a majority coalition that could run the country for years, just as FDR did. Democrats, of course, think the real point is that Obama is finally showing the toughness that is needed.

We are surely seeing a new Obama emerge on the eve of his second term. Where he will now lead the country is the central question that his inaugural address and the weeks ahead will begin to answer.

Washington (CNN) – Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. John McCain engaged in quiet negotiations over the weekend and got close to averting the so-called nuclear option over a dispute surrounding President Obama's nominees, but they failed to seal the deal, sources in both parties tell CNN.

“The door opened a crack,” according to a senior Democratic source.



McCain told Reid he found the six GOP senators needed to join Democrats in breaking filibusters of the nominations, giving Democrats a key part of what they want: approval of Richard Cordray to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

McCain told Reid that in exchange, the president would have to agree to withdraw two nominees for the National Labor Relations Board whom Mr. Obama had put in office by recess appointment, Sharon Block and Richard Griffin. Republicans disputed those appointments, and the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case.

The NLRB, which hears and rules on labor disputes, is one of the most politically polarized institutions in Washington.

According to sources in both parties, Reid told McCain he couldn’t go along with the idea because they could not find replacements willing to go through what will surely be a politically rough nomination for an NRLB term that would be up in 2014.

Still, sources in both parties say this could be the seeds of a deal to avert the nuclear option – a Democratic threat to get around GOP filibusters by changing the Senate rules for seven Obama nominees, and allow them to be approved by a simple majority.

Reid said the change he is proposing is ""very minimal,"" applying only to Cabinet and executive branch positions.

""This is not judges, this is not legislation - this has allowing the people of America to have a president who can have his team in place,"" Reid said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

A rare bipartisan meeting of all 100 senators is slated to take place late Monday in the Old Senate Chamber to discuss this idea.

Leading up to that, private talks continue.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was seen leaving Reid’s office."

At the time then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel, who headed the effort, infuriated many on the left by aggressively recruiting dozens of “blue dog democrats” to challenge GOP incumbents. The effort worked, but the Democrats soon forgot the lesson.

After Obama’s election, Democrat leaders believed they had a mandate for progressive policies. In the first two years of his term, Congress tacked far to the left, tackling cap-and-trade and ObamaCare. Corporate bailouts and billions in stimulus repelled independents. In 2010, House Democrats suffered the biggest electoral loss in history. Blue Dog Democrats, who had made up almost 25% of the Democrat caucus, were decimated.

Obama’s reelection has apparently again convinced national Democrats they have a mandate for their progressive ideas. Obama has all but ruled out serious spending cuts and is aggressively pushing for even more tax increases. Democrats across the country are pursuing gun control legislation with a zeal that hasn’t been seen in decades.

They are also vowing action on climate change, amnesty and a hike in the minimum wage. They are moving much further down the left-policy road than the rest of the country.

When Democrats lost the House in 2010, they also lost hundreds of seats in state Legislatures, giving Republicans a strong hand in redistricting. As a result, to win back the House, Democrats need to win more than a dozen seats that were won by Mitt Romney last year.

Obama’s hard tack to the left may be good for his base voters. The political fortunes’ of House Democrats are not built on his base voters, though. They need to appeal to independent, moderate voters who live in areas that lean GOP. They are building the wrong agenda for that task.

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",McManus: ‘Tea party’ tempest brewing,"The “tea party” is back and is brewing trouble for the Republican establishment.

After the GOP debacle in the 2012 election, when Republicans not only failed to win the presidency but blew a chance to take over the Senate, party leaders paused to consider what had gone wrong.

The Republican National Committee issued a scathing report warning that the party was in “an ideological cul-de-sac” and resolved to act friendlier toward women, minorities and low-income voters. Strategist Karl Rove said the lesson was to nominate more moderate candidates and set about raising money to do just that.

But tea party and other conservative leaders, undaunted, drew the opposite conclusion.

“It was not conservatives” who lost those Senate races, 19 of them wrote in a joint attack against Rove’s efforts. “Not one moderate challenger won.” The solution, they argued, was to swing further right, not toward the center.

The tea party is as fired up as ever, even though the movement is smaller now than in its heyday of 2010. In one recent poll, only 22% of American voters said they considered themselves tea party supporters, down from 30% three years ago.

But the grass-roots small-government movement has proved remarkably resilient. According to Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol, more than 350 tea party organizations are still operating; that’s roughly two-thirds of the number that sprang up in 2009 and 2010. And they have been recently reenergized by the outbreak of scandals and quasi-scandals in the Obama administration, including one that amounts to a political windfall: the discovery that the Internal Revenue Service targeted tea party groups’ applications for tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny.

The approach of congressional primary elections makes the tea party a major force too. The groups have a track record of turning out in force for low-participation primaries, and adherents are an essential source for donations and volunteers in Republican campaigns.

“Tea party supporters are responsible for almost all of the total campaign activity performed by party supporters on the Republican side,” a team of political scientists led by Ronald B. Rapoport of the College of William & Mary reported in a recent study. “Tea party supporters are not just a faction within the Republican Party; they are a majority faction.”

The problem, of course, is that this majority faction inside the party holds views often at odds not only with a majority of all voters but with the rest of the GOP.

According to polling that Rapoport and his colleagues oversaw, 63% of tea party Republicans want to limit immigration; only 48% of non-tea party Republicans agree. Among tea party adherents, 76% want to abolish the U.S. Department of Education; only 10% of non-tea party Republicans agree.

Most strikingly, when asked whether it was more important to cut the deficit or create jobs, 63% of tea party supporters opted to cut the deficit first. Among non-tea party Republicans, the priority was reversed, with 53% putting jobs first.

That polarization already spells trouble in the House, where tea party members recently balked at “reform conservative” proposals offered by their own majority leader, Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.), beginning with a bill to increase funding for high-risk health insurance pools as an alternative to Obamacare. (Spending was spending, the conservatives objected; they opted for another vote to repeal Obamacare instead.)

It spells trouble in the Senate, where the tea party’s newest star, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), has brought old-guard GOP leaders to the edge of rage by publicly criticizing them as “a bunch of squishes.” He and other tea party senators have succeeded in blocking House-Senate budget negotiations, charging that talks might lead to a deal to raise the federal debt ceiling, which they oppose.

“I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats,” Cruz said.

And he’s not wrong: Some Republicans do want to compromise with President Obama over the debt ceiling. In the short run, GOP leaders don’t want to be blamed by the White House for touching off a financial crisis that might interrupt the economy’s recovery. And in the long run, many in the GOP establishment — including House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) — worry about being branded the party of austerity.

“That’s the label President Obama is trying to put on us,” said David Winston, a pollster and political strategist who has advised Boehner. “But if we become the party of austerity, then President Obama and the Democrats become the party of economic growth.”

Instead of standing solely for spending cuts, Winston argued, the GOP needs to present a clearer plan for economic growth if it is to make headway in the 2014 elections. “Let’s have a real discussion of what you would get with a Senate Republican majority,” he told me last week. “We have to define a choice.”

But tea party members aren’t as worried about winning elections. According to another Rapoport survey, roughly three-fourths of tea party activists say they would prefer a strongly conservative candidate who’s likely to lose over a relatively moderate candidate who’s likely to win.

On paper, 2014 should be a good election for the GOP. It’s the sixth year of the Obama presidency, a time when opposition parties historically do well. Democrats face an uphill battle to hold on to their 55-seat majority in the Senate. Midterm voter turnout is usually lower, so they can’t count on the surge of young and minority voters who helped Obama win reelection.

But they have at least one asset: the civil war within the GOP. Once again, Democrats may prove lucky in their opponents.

Jason Chaffetz flew home from Washington last week, leaving behind a capital baffled by Republicans like him in Congress: those who stubbornly refuse to compromise with President Barack Obama, a tactic that some see as damaging the GOP brand and pushing the nation repeatedly to the brink of fiscal chaos.

Back in his Utah district, Chaffetz drove to the Dairy Keen and barely had bitten into a bacon cheeseburger before a diner begged him to stop Obama's health care overhaul.

""It's the stupidest plan in the world,"" said Phoebe Eason, 69, leaning over her booth to complain about a clause that forces her husband, a podiatrist, to pay more for medical devices.

""I'm doing everything I can to repeal it or take out these sections,"" Chaffetz reassured her. Minutes later, he headed to a town hall where some constituents asked why the president hadn't yet been impeached.

To understand why the nation may remain politically gridlocked for the next two years, talk to people in a place like Heber City, a conservative farming and ranching hub nestled beneath the imposing peaks of the Wasatch mountains. Many voters here, and in conservative communities across the country, still want to do whatever it takes to stop Obama, despite his solid re-election in November, and the politicians they elect are listening.

In his State of the Union address this week, Obama laid out an ambitious agenda that includes gun control, raising the minimum wage, allowing most of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country to become citizens and raising tax revenue to help cut the deficit.

But the president has acknowledged it will be difficult to get those proposals through a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

""The House Republican majority is made up mostly of members who are in sharply gerrymandered districts that are very safely Republican and may not feel compelled to pay attention to broad-based public opinion, because what they're really concerned about is the opinions of their specific Republican constituencies,"" Obama said in an interview with The New Republic magazine last month.

Story continues

Analysts differ on whether gerrymandering — the practice of drawing district lines so your party can pick up more seats — fully explains why Obama handily won re-election in November, even as Republicans lost only a handful of seats in the House. One thing is clear: Compromise is a dirty word for many of the Republicans remaining in the House.

A Pew poll last month found that 36 percent of GOP voters would look favorably on a politician who compromises, compared with 59 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of independent voters.

Virtually all House Republicans come from districts that voted against Obama in November. And in many states, primary voters have punished Republicans they see as too eager to cut deals with Democrats.

That's how Chaffetz, 45, won his seat in 2008. He challenged a 12-term Republican congressman who angered the party's base by backing an immigration overhaul that included granting citizenship to many illegal immigrants. Two years later, Utah Republican primary voters also pushed out Sen. Robert Bennett, replacing him with a tea party-supported candidate who is now the state's junior senator.

Though he has worked with Democrats on some bills, Chaffetz has refused to budge on some of the biggest issues in Washington. In 2011, he voted against raising the debt ceiling, arguing Congress and Obama weren't reining in entitlement spending. Most economists said that if the limit hadn't been raised it would have triggered a global depression. Last month, Chaffetz voted against the so-called fiscal cliff deal because it involved raising levies on those making more than $450,000 annually. Taxes would have risen on all income levels had the deal not passed.

Chaffetz also voted against aid for victims of Superstorm Sandy, saying the bill was larded with pork. He did vote to delay another debt ceiling confrontation until May, but said he won't budge on automatic spending cuts scheduled to kick in next month or on his opposition to citizenship for illegal immigrants.

""The perception inside the Beltway is dramatically different than in hometown America,"" Chaffetz said. ""Most people in my district believe we've compromised too much.""

Chaffetz's district stretches from the southern Salt Lake City suburbs and Provo, home to Brigham Young University, to the high valleys of Wasatch County. Nearly half of the county's 23,000 residents live in this town. Once an overlooked rural community far from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, it has recently seen an influx of more liberal-minded residents drawn by its proximity to storied ski resorts like nearby Park City. In Utah, this place is almost a swing county. Nonetheless, it voted 3-1 for Romney in November.

Here's how things look from Heber City: Obama hiked taxes while pushing through his health care reform. Then he got another round during the fiscal cliff negotiations. Now he's making a third attempt during the latest debt ceiling standoff. Meanwhile, the federal budget has been trimmed, but only slightly. The debt is still huge. Republicans are folding at every turn.

""I'm sick of Republicans not sticking to their principles,"" said Tina Peterson, 45, who works at a resort in nearby Park City. She recently moved her family here from Arizona after the recession destroyed their construction business. A new arrival in Utah — ""I'm a Christian but not LDS"" — she sees Obama as the unbending force in Washington, not her own party.

""His ideology is what it is and he can stick to it,"" Peterson said. ""We do the same and we get demonized.""

Not everyone here wants to just say no.

""There's no sense in falling on our sword and throwing a wrench just to destroy things,"" said Aaron Gabrielson, chairman of the Wasatch County Republican Party. Still, he added: ""It doesn't seem like compromise has gotten us very far.""

Jaren Davis, 53, a Republican Salt Lake City real estate developer who owns a second home here, sat in Chick's Cafe on Main Street and bemoaned polarization in politics.

""Both sides, right and left, with 24-hour news, they just need to get more fanatical to get on TV,"" said Davis, who unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the state Legislature. He noted that partisans have to cater to their extreme wing to win a primary — the same as winning the general election in this deeply red state.

Chaffetz held his town hall in a county education building. He began by giving a presentation on the weight of the federal debt. Voters asked about the value of the dollar, how to keep the federal government from converting more of the state's land to protected wilderness and the use of drones in the U.S. They also voiced their frustration about the president.

""Have you not found anything to impeach the president of the United States?"" asked Jeff Riddle, 34, an attorney. ""Losing a drone to Iran? Killing Americans with drones? Infringing on Second Amendment rights?""

Chaffetz asked for patience. He said the best course was to allow congressional investigations into possible administration wrongdoing, like the Fast and the Furious gun-running program, to continue.

""What is it going to take to make the change in Washington?"" asked retired commercial airline pilot Robert Wren, 74. ""Are we going to have to have a minor revolution of the people? Are we going to have to wait until the next election?""

Chaffetz said the problem is that Republicans haven't communicated well with voters. Later, asked if he ever felt pressure to back down, he acknowledged occasional disagreements with GOP leadership on whether to subpoena the White House.

""I don't know if we have stood up for ourselves as much as we should,"" he said.

Wren said he was pleased with his congressman's unflinching stance. ""He's representing his constituents.""

As they arrived at a candidate forum on Tuesday that was sponsored by AARP and devoted to issues affecting seniors, Anthony D. Weiner, a Democratic candidate, derisively referred to a long-shot Republican candidate, George T. McDonald, as “grandpa.”

The insult, which was caught on video by NY1, came after Mr. Weiner, 48, apparently patted Mr. McDonald on the chest as the candidates greeted each other on stage.

Mr. Weiner, not known for his equanimity, responded by telling Mr. McDonald that he had “anger issues.”

They came up with a scheme that any money-launderer would be proud of, funneling the cash through a convoluted series of independent spending groups that were allowed to collect unlimited dollars. By the time the donations had been used to buy advertising, the original money trail had been erased.

Or so they thought. California has one of the best laws in the country requiring disclosure of political donations, and officials at the state’s Fair Political Practices Commission suspected that the bulk contributions were obscuring the true donor groups. A yearlong investigation revealed the nature of the scheme, and the groups were accused of violating state law.

A few days ago, as part of a civil settlement, the state imposed $16 million in penalties and fines on the groups, a record in a campaign finance case. Though it’s not clear how much of those penalties will ever be collected, or even who many of the original donors were, the effort demonstrates the importance of state disclosure laws and aggressive enforcement, particularly since Congress has refused to pay attention to abuses on a national level.

The California commission, in fact, has done the political world a favor by exposing the secretive network of conservative groups that have aggressively taken advantage of the unlimited donations allowed by the Supreme Court, as well as the ability to hide donors that is permitted by the Federal Election Commission and lower courts. The network centers on groups with close ties to the Koch brothers, whose huge donations have played such a large role in electing Tea Party candidates around the country."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/28/in-first-black-voter-turnout-rate-passes-whites/,2013-04-28 00:00:00,[],Voter analysis shows Obama would have lost in 2012 if black turnout had mirrored 2008,"America's blacks voted at a higher rate than other minority groups in 2012 and by most measures surpassed the white turnout for the first time, reflecting a deeply polarized presidential election in which blacks strongly supported Barack Obama while many whites stayed home.

Had people voted last November at the same rates they did in 2004, when black turnout was below its current historic levels, Republican Mitt Romney would have won narrowly, according to an analysis conducted for The Associated Press.

Census data and exit polling show that whites and blacks will remain the two largest racial groups of eligible voters for the next decade. Last year's heavy black turnout came despite concerns about the effect of new voter-identification laws on minority voting, outweighed by the desire to re-elect the first black president.

William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, analyzed the 2012 elections for the AP using census data on eligible voters and turnout, along with November's exit polling. He estimated total votes for Obama and Romney under a scenario where 2012 turnout rates for all racial groups matched those in 2004. Overall, 2012 voter turnout was roughly 58 percent, down from 62 percent in 2008 and 60 percent in 2004.

The analysis also used population projections to estimate the shares of eligible voters by race group through 2030. The numbers are supplemented with material from the Pew Research Center and George Mason University associate professor Michael McDonald, a leader in the field of voter turnout who separately reviewed aggregate turnout levels across states, as well as AP interviews with the Census Bureau and other experts. The bureau is scheduled to release data on voter turnout in May.

Overall, the findings represent a tipping point for blacks, who for much of America's history were disenfranchised and then effectively barred from voting until passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

But the numbers also offer a cautionary note to both Democrats and Republicans after Obama won in November with a historically low percentage of white supporters. While Latinos are now the biggest driver of U.S. population growth, they still trail whites and blacks in turnout and electoral share, because many of the Hispanics in the country are children or noncitizens.

In recent weeks, Republican leaders have urged a ""year-round effort"" to engage black and other minority voters, describing a grim future if their party does not expand its core support beyond white males.

The 2012 data suggest Romney was a particularly weak GOP candidate, unable to motivate white voters let alone attract significant black or Latino support. Obama's personal appeal and the slowly improving economy helped overcome doubts and spur record levels of minority voters in a way that may not be easily replicated for Democrats soon.

Romney would have erased Obama's nearly 5 million-vote victory margin and narrowly won the popular vote if voters had turned out as they did in 2004, according to Frey's analysis. Then, white turnout was slightly higher and black voting lower.

More significantly, the battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida and Colorado would have tipped in favor of Romney, handing him the presidency if the outcome of other states remained the same.

""The 2012 turnout is a milestone for blacks and a huge potential turning point,"" said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who has written extensively on black politicians. ""What it suggests is that there is an `Obama effect' where people were motivated to support Barack Obama. But it also means that black turnout may not always be higher, if future races aren't as salient.""

Whit Ayres, a GOP consultant who is advising GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a possible 2016 presidential contender, says the last election reaffirmed that the Republican Party needs ""a new message, a new messenger and a new tone."" Change within the party need not be ""lock, stock and barrel,"" Ayres said, but policy shifts such as GOP support for broad immigration legislation will be important to woo minority voters over the longer term.

""It remains to be seen how successful Democrats are if you don't have Barack Obama at the top of the ticket,"" he said.

------

In Ohio, a battleground state where the share of eligible black voters is more than triple that of other minorities, 27-year-old Lauren Howie of Cleveland didn't start out thrilled with Obama in 2012. She felt he didn't deliver on promises to help students reduce college debt, promote women's rights and address climate change, she said. But she became determined to support Obama as she compared him with Romney.

""I got the feeling Mitt Romney couldn't care less about me and my fellow African-Americans,"" said Howie, an administrative assistant at Case Western Reserve University's medical school who is paying off college debt.

Howie said she saw some Romney comments as insensitive to the needs of the poor. ""A white Mormon swimming in money with offshore accounts buying up companies and laying off their employees just doesn't quite fit my idea of a president,"" she said. ""Bottom line, Romney was not someone I was willing to trust with my future.""

The numbers show how population growth will translate into changes in who votes over the coming decade:

-- The gap between non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black turnout in 2008 was the smallest on record, with voter turnout at 66.1 percent and 65.2 percent, respectively; turnout for Latinos and non-Hispanic Asians trailed at 50 percent and 47 percent. Rough calculations suggest that in 2012, 2 million to 5 million fewer whites voted compared with 2008, even though the pool of eligible white voters had increased.

-- Unlike other minority groups, the rise in voting for the slow-growing black population is due to higher turnout. While blacks make up 12 percent of the share of eligible voters, they represented 13 percent of total 2012 votes cast, according to exit polling. That was a repeat of 2008, when blacks ""outperformed"" their eligible voter share for the first time on record.

-- White voters also outperformed their eligible vote share, but not at the levels seen in years past. In 2012, whites represented 72 percent of total votes cast, compared to their 71.1 percent eligible vote share. As recently as 2004, whites typically outperformed their eligible vote share by at least 2 percentage points. McDonald notes that in 2012, states with significant black populations did not experience as much of a turnout decline as other states. That would indicate a lower turnout for whites last November since overall voter turnout declined.

-- Latinos now make up 17 percent of the population but 11 percent of eligible voters, due to a younger median age and lower rates of citizenship and voter registration. Because of lower turnout, they represented just 10 percent of total 2012 votes cast. Despite their fast growth, Latinos aren't projected to surpass the share of eligible black voters until 2024, when each group will be roughly 13 percent. By then, 1 in 3 eligible voters will be nonwhite.

-- In 2026, the total Latino share of voters could jump to as high as 16 percent, if nearly 11 million immigrants here illegally become eligible for U.S. citizenship. Under a proposed bill in the Senate, those immigrants would have a 13-year path to citizenship. The share of eligible white voters could shrink to less than 64 percent in that scenario. An estimated 80 percent of immigrants here illegally, or 8.8 million, are Latino, although not all will meet the additional requirements to become citizens.

""The 2008 election was the first year when the minority vote was important to electing a U.S. president. By 2024, their vote will be essential to victory,"" Frey said. ""Democrats will be looking at a landslide going into 2028 if the new Hispanic voters continue to favor Democrats.""

------

Even with demographics seeming to favor Democrats in the long term, it's unclear whether Obama's coalition will hold if blacks or younger voters become less motivated to vote or decide to switch parties.

Minority turnout tends to drop in midterm congressional elections, contributing to larger GOP victories as happened in 2010, when House control flipped to Republicans.

The economy and policy matter. Exit polling shows that even with Obama's re-election, voter support for a government that does more to solve problems declined from 51 percent in 2008 to 43 percent last year, bolstering the view among Republicans that their core principles of reducing government are sound.

The party's ""Growth and Opportunity Project"" report released last month by national leaders suggests that Latinos and Asians could become more receptive to GOP policies once comprehensive immigration legislation is passed.

Whether the economy continues its slow recovery also will shape voter opinion, including among blacks, who have the highest rate of unemployment.

Since the election, optimism among nonwhites about the direction of the country and the economy has waned, although support for Obama has held steady. In an October AP-GfK poll, 63 percent of nonwhites said the nation was heading in the right direction; that's dropped to 52 percent in a new AP-GfK poll. Among non-Hispanic whites, however, the numbers are about the same as in October, at 28 percent.

Democrats in Congress merit far lower approval ratings among nonwhites than does the president, with 49 percent approving of congressional Democrats and 74 percent approving of Obama.

William Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, says that in previous elections where an enduring majority of voters came to support one party, the president winning re-election -- William McKinley in 1900, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 and Ronald Reagan in 1984 -- attracted a larger turnout over his original election and also received a higher vote total and a higher share of the popular vote. None of those occurred for Obama in 2012.

Only once in the last 60 years has a political party been successful in holding the presidency more than eight years -- Republicans from 1980-1992.

""This doesn't prove that Obama's presidency won't turn out to be the harbinger of a new political order,"" Galston says. ""But it does warrant some analytical caution.""

Early polling suggests that Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton could come close in 2016 to generating the level of support among nonwhites as Obama did in November, when he won 80 percent of their vote. In a Fox News poll in February, 75 percent of nonwhites said they thought Clinton would make a good president, outpacing the 58 percent who said that about Vice President Joe Biden.

Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP, predicts closely fought elections in the near term and worries that GOP-controlled state legislatures will step up efforts to pass voter ID and other restrictions to deter blacks and other minorities from voting. In 2012, courts blocked or delayed several of those voter ID laws and African-Americans were able to turn out in large numbers only after a very determined get-out-the-vote effort by the Obama campaign and black groups, he said.

Jealous says the 2014 midterm election will be the real bellwether for black turnout. ""Black turnout set records this year despite record attempts to suppress the black vote,"" he said."

This is classic mainstream media tactical deflection. In order to take the spotlight off Hillary not reading the cables (which is why Paul criticized her) from our Libyan consulate requesting more security, Moran wants to make Paul the issue.

You see, Paul’s question and statement of fact doesn’t matter, because Paul’s resume is more important.

This is how the media turns an inconvenient narrative away from its own (a Democrat) and then trains its fire on whomever dares to politically damage one of its own. Libya has been a non-stop exercise in this kind of media behavior. Four Americans die under Obama’s watch, Romney dares say something, and the media makes him the story for 10 days; not the terrorist attack, the lack of security, or the subsequent administration cover up.

Remember all the hand-wringing we saw from the elite media when someone with no foreign policy experience ran for president in 2008?

Yeah, me neither.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']","Obama court pick withdraws, thwarted by Republicans in Senate","WASHINGTON—Former New York state attorney Caitlin Halligan, President Obama’s choice for the U.S. Court of Appeals here, withdrew her name Friday, defeated by the Republican minority in the Senate.

Halligan’s withdrawal is the latest example of how the GOP has employed the filibuster rule not only to block major legislation, but routine presidential appointments as well.

The D.C. Circuit decides significant challenges to federal regulations, including those on environmental protection and worker’s rights. Obama is the first president who has been unable to put a single judge on the court.

The Constitution says judges are to be nominated by the president and confirmed by a majority vote in the Senate. Halligan had the support of the Senate’s Democratic majority, but minority Republicans blocked a vote to confirm her. Under the Senate’s rules, it takes 60 votes to close debate and set a final vote.

Obama issued a statement saying he was “deeply disappointed that…a minority of senators continued to block a simple up-or-down vote on her nomination. The D.C. Circuit is considered the nation’s second- highest court, but it now has more vacancies than any other circuit court. This is unacceptable.”

Halligan, 46, is a graduate of Princeton and Georgetown Law School and clerked at the Supreme Court for Justice Stephen Breyer. She served as New York’s solicitor general from 2001 to 2007, and her office pursued a state lawsuit against gun manufacturers for causing a public nuisance. She also supported a New York Bar Assn. report that was highly critical of the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

The National Rifle Assn. opposed her nomination, and Republican senators cited the gun case as a reason for opposing her. Two years ago, 54 senators voted for her, but it was not enough to win her confirmation.

Earlier this month, Republicans stood firm in blocking her.

“Ms. Halligan has demonstrated an activist judicial philosophy,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo), chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee. “Her persistent activism against gun manufacturers” and her willingness to “use the courts to promote liberal ambitions” are grounds for blocking her confirmation, he said.

Liberal groups have been upset by the success of the GOP filibuster strategy. “The D.C. Circuit is far too important to be held hostage by Senate obstructionists,” said Caroline Frederickson, president of the American Constitution Society.

“Senate Democrats need to revisit the Senate rules reform and stand up to the tyranny of the minority,” said Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice.

In January, the D.C. Circuit Court dealt Obama another blow when it ruled unconstitutional his decision to fill two seats on the National Labor Relations Board through a “recess” appointment. The three judges, all Republican appointees, said the president needs to win Senate confirmation of those appointees.

Halligan was first nominated in 2010 to fill a seat on the D.C. Circuit that has been vacant since 2005 when then-Judge John Roberts became the chief justice of the United States.

President George W. Bush has two of his D.C. Circuit nominees blocked by Democratic filibusters, but he also succeeded in winning confirmation for four appointees to the appeals court.

Obama has one other nominee pending for the D.C. Circuit. He is Sri Srinivasin, who is the deputy U.S. solicitor general. He will be arguing before the Supreme Court in one of two gay-marriage cases scheduled for hearings next week.

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-win-without-hispanics-look-arizona-174605700--election.html,,[],Can GOP win without Hispanics? Look at Arizona,"PHOENIX (AP) — On the political map of the Southwest, Arizona stands out.

Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico are independent-minded states that once leaned Republican but are trending Democratic, partly because of increasing numbers of Hispanic voters alienated from the GOP by its tough stance on illegal immigration.

California, a GOP bastion for decades, is now solidly Democratic and the ultimate example of the dangers for Republicans on this issue.

Nowhere is a harder line on immigration taken than in Arizona, where Republicans have a lock on statewide offices and dominate the Legislature.

In November, Democrats picked up two congressional seats, but Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney easily won the state with a slightly better margin against President Barack Obama than Arizona Sen. John McCain posted in the 2008 White House contest.

That record has led advocates of tighter immigration restrictions to point to Arizona as a model for how Republicans can maintain their tough stance on the issue and still win elections.

""It's an example of a different way for things to play out than the conventional story,"" Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that favors tighter immigration policies, said of Arizona. ""What's happened there is the non-Hispanic vote has become increasingly Republican.""

National Republicans, aware of demographic trends, are pondering how to win over more Hispanic voters in order to be more competitive in presidential elections. It's unclear whether Arizona will remain a GOP stronghold.

Plenty of Arizona Republicans fear their state will go the way of its neighbors unless the GOP softens its immigration stance. That includes McCain, who in 2005 joined with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to sponsor legislation that included a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.

A staunch supporter of strict border enforcement in 2008 and 2010, McCain has swung back after last year's election to supporting an overhaul of the immigration system that includes citizenship for those in the U.S. without authorization. He says he was convinced the GOP could not survive with a hard-line stance in states like his.

Story continues

""If you have a large bloc of Americans who believe you're trying to keep their ... fellow Hispanics down and deprive them of an opportunity, obviously that's going to have an effect,"" McCain told reporters earlier this year.

During the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney called for ""self-deportation,"" or creating an environment so uncomfortable for immigrants here illegally that they would choose to return to their original countries. Romney also praised Arizona's approach to immigration.

Two years earlier, the state became well-known for restrictive immigration legislation with the passage of legislation requiring police officers, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. While that part of the statute survived, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down three other provisions of the law.

Arizona's stance has national implications as leading Republicans try to reorient their party following the 2012 election, when Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians went for Obama in overwhelming numbers.

A Republican National Committee panel recently released a report that advises more outreach to minorities and support for an immigration overhaul that eventually would legalize the status of most immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. That's an idea that's anathema to some Arizona Republicans.

A bipartisan group of eight senators, including McCain and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. — is drawing up a bill that includes such a provision.

Arizona was always one of the less-promising states for Democrats for reasons other than immigration, said Scott Smith, the Republican mayor of Mesa, a Phoenix suburb.

""You have a lot of retirees in Arizona — Midwestern, conservative Republicans,"" he said. ""Republicans far outnumber Democrats in registration, and the independents tend to be conservative more than liberal.""

President Bill Clinton helped make immigration a major issue in Arizona.

In an attempt to tamp down illegal immigration in California, his administration fortified the border with Mexico in the late 1990s.

The bolstered enforcement effectively pushed migrants east into the mostly empty desert that straddles Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora.

As crossing into the U.S. became harder, drug cartels and criminal syndicates expanded into human trafficking, with Phoenix becoming a major hub. The federal government warned Arizonans to stay out of various parks and swaths of public land for fear they could stumble across armed smugglers. There was widespread fear.

""That entire impact just changed the way undocumented immigrants were seen in Arizona,"" said Alfredo Gutierrez, a former Democratic president of the state Senate and an immigrant rights activist. ""It raised all kinds of opportunities for people to exploit this.""

Since the passage of SB 1070, the battles over immigration have torn the state's Republican Party.

Business leaders successfully stopped the passage of more aggressive measures in 2011. The law's architect, former State Senate President Russell Pearce, was recalled from office and last year lost a Republican primary trying to return to office.

""Republicans in Arizona have shifted pretty dramatically in how they look at this issue,"" said Glenn Hamer, president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, which spearheaded the push to block more stringent immigration legislation and supports the federal immigration overhaul.

""If the current voting patterns hold, it's impossible to see in 10-20 years the same sort of results for Republicans"" as they enjoy here now, he said.

From Hamer's perspective, the math is basic.

Arizona has stayed Republican because in exit polls over the past decade whites, currently 74 percent of the state's voters, have backed GOP presidential candidates by roughly 3-to-2 margins, even while Hispanics vote Democratic by 3-to-1. By contrast, whites only narrowly supported Republican presidential candidates in neighboring swing states.

Hispanics are 30 percent of Arizona's population but made up only 18 percent of its voters in November. One-third of them are not citizens and cannot vote, while 18 percent of the Hispanics are here illegally.

But Arizona's Hispanic population is unusually young, with a median age of 24, while its white population is significantly older, with a median age of 44. Political analysts say that makes it inevitable that at some point in the next decade or two Hispanic voters will overwhelm white voters.

Nonetheless, plenty of Arizona politicians are holding their strict stance in the immigration debate.

Recently, Attorney General Tom Horne, who came to prominence by banning a Mexican-American studies class in Tucson schools, argued for the constitutionality of a 2005 referendum that requires all voters to prove citizenship before casting a ballot.

The Legislature is considering tightening voting procedures in a way that Latino activists contend will lead to a disproportionate number of their voters being dropped from the rolls.

Gov. Jan Brewer became a heroine to those who favor immigration restrictions after signing SB1070. She has lashed out at the suggestion by the Obama administration and immigrant rights groups that the border is secure enough to legalize the status of many immigrants.

""A lot of the legislation we passed is in concert with what the people demanded of us,"" said state Rep. Steve Smith, a Republican who is author of a bill allowing the state to collect donations to build a border fence.

""We have a front row seat to it. People see the direct, detrimental effect of the drugs, the gangs, the smuggling and what they are doing to our state.""

Smith said he thinks Republicans should not abandon their forthright stance on immigration because it has won them support in Arizona and beyond. ""Don't sell your morals, beliefs and thoughts down the river,"" he said. ""When I, or other elected officials, or our governor, go to other states, people there say 'Thank God for Arizona.'""

He Began His Column With The Post In', 'He Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In His Latest Book', 'The Conservative Sensibility', 'Was Released In June']","George Will: Chris Christie, volcanic politics and Election 2016","Coyness is not part of Chris Christie’s repertoire, which does not stress subtlety, delicacy and intimation. New Jersey’s governor is more Mickey Spillane than Jane Austen, and his persona, which sometimes is that of a bulldog who got up on the wrong side of the bed, is so popular that he seems to be cruising toward reelection this November and does not deny that he might look beyond that.

His budget for 2013 calls for spending less than did the state’s 2008 budget. He has vetoed a tax on millionaires three times. He has scrapped, exuberantly, with public employee unions. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, 41,000 families are still homeless. Nevertheless, 61 percent of his constituents think the state is on the right track, more than twice the 27 percent who thought so when he entered office three years ago. His 74 percent job approval rating includes 56 percent among Democrats and 78 percent among independents. This in a state where only 29 percent view the Republican Party favorably. And New Jersey is one of just three states (with New York and Maryland) in which Barack Obama improved upon his 2008 margin of victory (18 points, up from 16).

When the House of Representatives pondered longer than he thought proper in considering the bill for aiding Sandy’s victims, Christie placed, in less than an hour, four unanswered late-evening calls to Speaker John Boehner, calls that were, Christie says mildly, “increasingly agitated.” At last, Christie did his best imitation of Mount Vesuvius, denouncing Boehner by name. The approval-disapproval numbers for his eruption were 79-15, including 70-22 among Republicans. People may not like government, but they enjoy one operatic governor.

Sen. Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, accused Christie of a “tantrum.” Christie’s pugnacity emerges: “I want to see the next time a hurricane comes to Kentucky.” Such Sturm und Drang earned Christie a place on Time magazine’s cover — a photo making him look very like New Jersey’s Tony Soprano. Beneath the photo were two words — “The Boss.” Time told him that the reference was to New Jersey’s Bruce Springsteen. Christie isn’t buying that, but neither does it bother him. “If my mother were alive,” he says, “she’d be hot. She’s the Sicilian.”

He is potentially the un-Romney of Republican presidential politics, the candidate who connects viscerally, sometimes perhaps too much so, with voters. Although he campaigned hard for Mitt Romney in 2012 and was one of the first governors to endorse him, Christie told Oprah in 2011 that Romney doesn’t connect with people. No one knows how the Republican nominating electorate of 2016 will feel about the idea of selecting a second consecutive Eastern governor from a blue state. “The presidency,” Christie says, “is the most personal vote people cast,” and he distills into two words the lesson of 2012: “Candidates matter.”

He calls the GOP’s decision, made in the run-up to 2012, to lengthen the nominating process “the stupidest thing the Republican Party ever did.” When the process is too protracted, “You wind up with a good candidate who’s damaged.” Although he understands the lacerating rigor of a nomination campaign, “I may not do it, but it won’t be for that reason.”

He heartily agrees with the axiom that the most “likable” candidate usually wins presidential elections, and he understands that combativeness that might serve a governor might be inappropriate for a president, whom people want cloaked in a particular dignity, and who is in everyone’s living room every night. Christie says, “The image of me nationally is a little skewed.” What he calls his “yelling and screaming” is very limited and always tactical. He thinks even voters choosing a president “want someone who has that club in his golf bag.”

Cory Booker, Newark’s Democratic mayor, supposedly has a bright future, but it will not be as New Jersey’s governor any time soon. He has challenged the renomination of an incumbent Democratic senator, 89-year-old Frank Lautenberg, rather than tangle with Christie, who already has $2.14 million in his campaign treasury and who will be given a Silicon Valley fundraiser at the home of Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg on Feb. 13.

By 2015, the Republican nominating electorate will have forgotten Christie’s effusive praise of Obama’s post-Sandy solicitousness toward New Jersey. And Christie will be the rambunctious fellow who before Sandy described Obama as “a man walking around in a dark room looking for the light switch of leadership.” Remember the name of Mickey Spillane’s famous protagonist: Mike Hammer.

He Previously Covered State', 'National Politics', 'Including The Presidential Campaign.']","Garcetti and Greuel vie for black Democrats, white Republicans","The day after Eric Garcetti won a spot in the May runoff for Los Angeles mayor, the city councilman turned his focus to African Americans in South Los Angeles, campaigning in Leimert Park with comedian D.L. Hughley.

“In too many of our communities, especially communities of color, we still have way too much crime,” Garcetti told the audience. “We still have too many gunshots, too few opportunities for our young people.”

A day later, Garcetti rival Wendy Greuel, the city controller, announced that one of the city’s premier black clergymen, Rev. Cecil “Chip” Murray, was backing her. “Chip Murray has redefined what it means to be a faith leader in Los Angeles,” she said of the former pastor of First African Methodist Episcopal Church.

So began the 11-week battle over the tens of thousands of Los Angeles voters who shunned both Garcetti and Greuel in last week’s primary. Many of them fall into two groups: black Democrats in South L.A. and white Republicans in the San Fernando Valley.

As Garcetti and Greuel each clamber to gain support among these dissimilar voters — concentrated on opposite sides of the city, focused on disparate needs — it is something close to an even match, at least for now.

For both, the math of building a winning coalition is difficult. In Tuesday’s primary, Greuel, who lives in Studio City, established her dominance in the Valley and Harbor areas but won few neighborhoods in the vast urban stretch in between. Garcetti, who lives in Silver Lake, swept the Eastside, central city and Westside. Garcetti finished first with 33%, followed by Greuel at 29%.

Greuel had hoped to win extra support citywide among women by stressing that she would be the city’s first female mayor. A poll last month by USC and The Times found no sign of success for that strategy, but Greuel’s campaign team is still counting on the potential barrier-breaching to motivate women to vote in the May 21 runoff.

“I think where the historic nature of Wendy’s candidacy will make a difference is in turnout,” Greuel campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski said.

Garcetti, whose paternal ancestry is Mexican, had tried — with mixed results — to win outsized support among Latinos, roughly a quarter of the vote in Los Angeles. He did win the city’s most heavily Latino neighborhoods but by narrower margins than he would probably need in the second round.

One of Garcetti’s main challenges now is to spur some of the potential supporters who declined to vote in the low-turnout primary — such as young Latinos — to cast ballots in the runoff. Lending a hand will be an independent committee that has hired operatives of President Obama’s reelection campaign to comb voter data to find those most amenable to backing Garcetti and prod them to the polls. Daniel Wagner, the Obama campaign’s “chief analytics officer,” is one of those hired.

“The only job we have is to produce more votes for Eric Garcetti than Eric Garcetti would,” said Rick Jacobs, a co-founder of the committee, the optimistically named Lots of People Who Support Eric Garcetti for Mayor.

In South L.A., the key for both Garcetti and Greuel is to capture the votes of African Americans who overwhelmingly favored City Councilwoman Jan Perry in last week’s election.

For months, Garcetti and Greuel have been making frequent visits to black churches — on one Sunday, the same churches.

Garcetti highlights his early support of Obama, reminding crowds he was California co-chair of Obama’s historic 2008 campaign. In Greuel’s case, a staple of her South L.A. speeches is a tribute to former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley and recollections of her work as one of his aides.

In the runoff, endorsements will be particularly valuable in South L.A., said Mike Shimpock, a veteran Democratic campaign consultant.

“South L.A. has a lot of needs that have historically been ignored — parks, public safety, economic development,” he said. “So I think one of the reasons you see third-party validators being more important is because people don’t necessarily trust government to do the right thing.”

Greuel and Garcetti are indeed competing for the support of black political leaders, including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas. “They both have very strong followings,” said Jewett Walker, a campaign strategist who has long worked for Democrats in the area.

Also in play is Perry’s support. On Friday, she sharply criticized Greuel, who had attacked Perry over her personal finances during the primary, but stopped short of endorsing Garcetti.

In the duel for Republicans, Garcetti and Greuel are looking to pick up support from those who backed former radio talk-show host Kevin James in the primary. The lone Republican in the race, James ran strongest in Porter Ranch, Chatsworth and other conservative parts of the West Valley but also picked up thousands of votes on the Westside.

From the start, Greuel has framed her candidacy with Republicans as a major target audience. She often calls herself a tough fiscal watchdog with a record of combating waste, fraud and abuse at City Hall.

“Fiscal watchdog: That’s an expression Republicans love,” said Garrett Biggs, a Republican campaign consultant in Woodland Hills.

But Garcetti, like Greuel a Democrat, is making a play for Republicans too, citing the economic rebound of Hollywood and other parts of his council district, his service in the Navy Reserve, his plan to abolish the city business tax, and his votes for layoffs and furloughs of city workers when cash was running short.

“We’re going to spend a lot of time talking to those voters,” Garcetti strategist Bill Carrick said.

Greuel’s alliance with public employee unions has complicated her positioning as a conservative. The unions spent more than $2 million on her behalf, drawing relentless attacks from Garcetti, Perry and James. All three have suggested that Greuel would sell out to the unions’ demands for raises and benefit protections when the city struggles with budget shortfalls on the next mayor’s watch.

“Her courting of the labor vote may make her look less appealing to those Valley conservatives,” said political scientist Tom Hogen-Esch of Cal State Northridge.

Greuel, a Republican until 1992, has denied she would show favoritism to the unions.

Greuel has also promoted her pro-business agenda. She too supports elimination of the business tax, and she often tells crowds about her experience with her family’s building supply company in North Hollywood.

The day after the primary, Greuel’s first stop was WET Design, a Sun Valley firm. When the company sought to expand in 2008, she said, she cut red tape. Greuel planned to spend Sunday morning at church on the opposite side of town, joining Baptist worshipers in Historic South Central.

Garcetti staged his own business event Thursday, promoting tech jobs at a start-up in Venice. By Saturday, he was back in South L.A., greeting guests at a block party in West Adams.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/29/Harvard-Prof-Tea-Party-Not-Going-Anywhere-More-Likely-to-Win,2013-12-29 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],"Harvard Prof: Tea Party Not Going Anywhere, More Likely to Win","A government and sociology professor at Harvard writes that the Tea Party is more likely than not to “win in the end” in an age when Americans are becoming more removed from Washington and distrusting the federal government and their elected officials.

“Tea Party forces will still win in the end,” Theda Skocpol writes, unless moderate Republicans can defeat them. Skocpol concedes that the Tea Party “will triumph just by hanging on long enough” as Americans are getting fed up by “our blatantly manipulated democracy and our permanently hobbled government.”

The article, “Why The Tea Party Isn’t Going Anywhere,” was first published in the journal Democracy, and later reprinted in The Atlantic.

Despite the fact that Democrats, the mainstream media, and the Republican establishment again were predicting the “demise of the Tea Party” immediately after the government shutdown ended, Skocpol doesn’t believe so.

“But we have heard all this before,” she writes. “The Tea Party’s hold on the GOP persists beyond each burial ceremony.”

Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson published a book in 2011 that “showed how bottom-up and top-down forces intersect to give the Tea Party both leverage over the Republican Party and the clout to push national politics sharply to the right.”

“At the grassroots, volunteer activists formed hundreds of local Tea Parties, meeting regularly to plot public protests against the Obama Administration and place steady pressure on GOP organizations and candidates at all levels,” they found. “At least half of all GOP voters sympathize with this Tea Party upsurge.”

Though Skokpol and Williamson have their typical biases and describe the Tea Party movement as a “radical” one that may not like minorities–without any evidence of that assertion–they acknowledge that “even though there is no one center of Tea Party authority–indeed, in some ways because there is no one organized center–the entire gaggle of grassroots” and outside groups that support the movement “wields money and primary votes to exert powerful pressure on Republican officeholders and candidates.”

Skocpol observes that the “Tea Party clout has grown in Washington and state capitals” because “Americans are also losing ever more faith in the federal government.” In addition, “most legislators and candidates are Nervous Nellies,” and they have seen the Tea Party defeat establishment Republicans like Charlie Crist in Florida in 2010 and David Dewhurst in Texas in 2012 in addition to knocking off incumbent Republican Sens. Bob Bennett (R-UT) and Richard Lugar (R-IN).

“That grabs legislators’ attention and results in either enthusiastic support for, or acquiescence to, obstructive tactics,” Skocpol writes.

She writes how powerfully someone like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) resonates with the Tea Party. She noted that he was able to direct House Republicans to pressure House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) to demand that President Barack Obama and Democrats fund the government except for Obamacare.

Skocpol notes that it will not be easy to defeat the Tea Party.

“For one, at least three successive national election defeats will be necessary to even begin to break the determination and leverage of Tea Party adherents,” Skocpol writes. She concedes that Tea Partiers will not “stand down easily or very soon.”

Skocpol notes “moderate Republicans” do not have as much power in Washington or in state capitals and points to Cruz as being “very well positioned to garner unified Tea Party support in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries.” The Chamber of Commerce will reportedly spend $50 million to wage war against the Tea Party, along with Karl Rove’s American Crossroads; Skocpol believes unless those groups defeat the Tea Party, it may well win many permanent victories.

“During the last election cycle, no far-right candidate ever consolidated sustained grassroots Tea Party support, as those voters hopped from Rick Perry to Herman Cain to Newt Gingrich to Rick Santorum,” Skocpol writes. “But this time, Cruz may very well enjoy unified and enthusiastic grassroots Tea Party support from the beginning of the primary election season.”

Skocpol also sends a warning to Democrats who think that the Tea Party will fade because of a few bad polls.

“Once the October 2013 shutdown ended in supposed total victory for President Obama and his party, many Democrats adopted a cocky swagger and started talking about ousting the House GOP in 2014,” Skocpol writes. However, she warns that “a clear-eyed look shows that Tea Party remains powerful and has achieved victories that continue to stymie” Democrats and their statist agenda."

Strickland announced Tuesday morning that he would not challenge Gov. John Kasich (R) next year, ending the possibility of a rematch between the two 2010 rivals. Strickland, a one-term governor, was a vocal surrogate during the 2012 election for President Barack Obama and Ohio Democrats, including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D).

He said in his statement Tuesday that he looked back ""fondly"" on his four years in the governor's mansion and that it was a ""very difficult decision."" Strickland used the statement, released by the Ohio Democratic Party, to highlight his administration's accomplishments, including the auto bailout, which was a top issue for Obama, Brown and Democrats during the 2012 election.

""Most significant for jobs, we were leaders in investments in alternatives sources of energy and went to bat for the automobile industry; working closely with President Obama on the rescue plan that has been so pivotal in Ohio’s economic recovery,"" Strickland said.

Strickland's decision shifts attention to Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald (D) as the leading Democratic challenger to Kasich. FitzGerald, the first county executive in his county, has been mentioned along with Strickland as one of two leading contenders to challenge Kasich. FitzGerald has taken steps to increase his visibility within Ohio, including highlighting his opposition to Kasich.

Kasich, a potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate, is considered a target for Democrats in 2014, stemming from his role in changing Ohio's collective bargaining system, which was overturned by voters in 2011. Within Ohio, Democrats are expected to push heavy challenges against Kasich, Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) and state Treasurer Josh Mandel (R) in the 2014 races."

We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.

What I will do as president is make sure it’s more attractive to come to America again. This is the way we’re going to create jobs in this country. It’s not by trickle-down government saying, we’re going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business to invest and grow in America.

Now, we’re going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations, that they play by the rules, and China hasn’t. One of the reasons — or one of the ways they don’t play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency, because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low. And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales, and manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can’t compete.

China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the president has a regular opportunity to — to label them as a — as a currency manipulator but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.

So we’re going to make sure the people we trade with around the world play by the rules.

But let me — let me not just stop there. Don’t forget: What’s key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish — and — and I’m going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they — they follow the law and play by the rules — but it’s also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. That’s why I want to bring down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canada’s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you’re starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we’re going to create more jobs here.

Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. I’ve talked to small businesses across the country. They say we feel like we’re under attack from our own government. I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business — not crushing it. And there’s no question but that “Obamacare” has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you’re going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules. Thanks.

MS. CROWLEY: Mr. President, two minutes here because we are then going to go to our last question.

Updated 10/31/2013 at 5:23 p.m. ET

(CNN) - Republicans blocked two high-profile presidential nominees on Thursday as the bitter fight over appointments escalated in the U.S. Senate, but Democrats held their fire and decided, for now, to forgo a change in rules to limit filibusters.

The GOP mounted filibusters against Judge Patricia Millett, who was appointed by President Barack Obama to the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia, and Rep. Melvin Watt, who was named to head the agency that oversees housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.



Democrats fell short in procedural votes called to move forward on the nominations, testing their patience and raising serious questions about how they might respond.

Although it was raised as a possibility, Democrats are not expected at this time to invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"" to change filibuster rules, two Senate Democratic leadership aides told CNN.

Many rank-and-file Democrats wanted the change, over objections from minority Republicans, to allow the Senate to approve appointments with a simple majority vote rather than the 60 now needed to proceed with a nomination.

But Democratic leaders are reluctant to engage a knock down fight with Republicans at the same time they need to move other legislative priorities through the Senate.

Next week, the Senate will take up a key piece of gay rights legislation, and Democrats believe they are just one vote shy getting it passed and don't want to jeopardize their prospects by angering Republicans with a rule change effort.

The Senate also will soon enough turn its attention back to the fiscal issues in desperate need of bipartisan cooperation.

Opposition to appointments

Republicans argued that Millett's appointment to the judicial post that has been a stepping stone for some to the U.S. Supreme Court was unnecessary.

They said the appeals panel now is evenly divided between judges appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents and doesn't have enough work to justify an additional member even though there are three vacancies.

Democrats said the filibuster was a transparent attempt to maintain conservative influence on the court.

Earlier in the day, Republicans also blocked Obama's nomination of Watt, a North Carolina Democrat, to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, an independent federal entity that has been in control of Fannie and Freddie since their taxpayer rescue last decade during the housing crisis.

Republicans argued Watt is not independent enough and lacks expertise to run the agency.

Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee more than half of all outstanding mortgages in the United States, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Opening from Biden

The push to change the rules appeared to get a boost when Vice President Joe Biden, who served in the Senate for decades, said it was ""worth considering.""

The opening from Biden reflects the thinking of many Democrats who want to push for the controversial change.

For instance, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, was frustrated with the Millett vote, especially.

""This is declaring war on the judicial branch. This is declaring war on the executive branch. It is inconsistent with the traditions of the Senate,"" he said. ""This type of blockade cannot stand.""

Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, complained the fight was ""all about ideology"" and said he thought support was ""growing for changing the rules when they play these games.""

But other veteran Senate Democrats who have seen the majority change hands between the parties over the years are opposed, saying they want to preserve the right to filibuster in the future.

""I've never favored using the nuclear option,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, who chairs the Armed Services Committee and who is retiring from the Senate after this term.

The second-ranking Senate Republican warned that Democrats need to ""think twice"" about changing the rules.

Or, he said, the ""next time there is a Republican president and Republicans hold a majority in the Senate then we could confirm another (Antonin) Scalia, another (Clarence) Thomas with 51 votes,"" Senator John Cornyn of Texas said, referring to the two conservative Supreme Court justices.

A Lincoln Town Car pulled up and Mr. Crist leaned in and shook hands, doing what he does best. “Hey bro, what’s happening?” the driver asked. “I’m good, man,” Mr. Crist replied. When a Duke Energy worker recognized Mr. Crist, the former governor gave him an earful about solar energy. “You got my vote, buddy,” the man said. “There’s our next governor right here.”

Whether Mr. Crist, a man who sprinted from Republican to independent to Democrat in three years, can wrest the governorship away from Rick Scott is anybody’s guess. But on Friday he filed his paperwork to run for governor. And on Monday, with the enthusiastic backing of most leading Democrats, Mr. Crist, 57, is expected to formally announce his intention to reclaim the governor’s office in 2014.

Mr. Crist’s announcement is all but certain to kick off one of next year’s most expensive, contentious and rancorous governor’s races, pitting betrayed Republicans out for revenge against hopeful Democrats out for redemption."

He’s also ambitious. A 2016 presidential bid may be in the offing, especially if Hillary Clinton doesn’t jump in.

How, then, are we supposed to read his romantic situation?

He’s unmarried, but has been living with the irrepressible food celebrity Sandra Lee for years now, most recently in her Westchester house. “Public concubinage” is what one Roman Catholic official once called their cohabitation, generating a flurry of articles that mentioned “living in sin.” The couple made no apologies. And they’ve never signaled any plans to wed.

That wasn’t a factor in Cuomo’s successful New York gubernatorial campaign, but whether it would be a liability in a national race is hard to say. Political strategists told me yes, no, maybe. I’m rooting for no, because that would be an affirmation that we, as a voting public, have wised up to the frequent lack of any correlation between a tableau of traditional family life and the values, character and skills it takes to govern effectively.

""I recognized that by virtue of the realities of my circumstances, there were some drawbacks to my candidacy for a lot of Republican voters,"" he told Balz in January. ""One, because I had a health care plan in Massachusetts that had been copied in some respects by the president, that I would be tainted by that feature. I also realized that being a person of wealth, I would be pilloried by the president as someone who, if you use the term of the day, was in the 1 percent.""

The book, titled ""Collision 2012: Obama vs. Romney and the Future of Elections in America,"" is due out Aug. 6. It details the 2012 White House race through Election Day and its aftermath.

Romney's exchange with his son wasn't the first time he expressed doubts about whether he would run. During a Christmas holiday trip to Hawaii in 2010, the Romney family held a vote. Should Romney, who lost in the 2008 primary, run for president once again? Ten of 12 family members voted no -- including the candidate. Only Tagg and Ann Romney voted yes.

Romney opened up to Balz about his conservative stance on immigration during the campaign, and his use of the term ""self-deportation,"" which Democrats slammed repeatedly. Romney said he did not anticipate the blowback he would face.

""I thought of it as being a term that is used in the community of those discussing immigration,"" Romney told Balz in January. ""I hadn't seen it as being a negative term."" He later added: ""You have two options of dealing with those that have come here illegally: deportation or self-deportation. The president has deported more I think in four years than President Bush did in eight years. So the president was using a deportation method. The view of others is, no, let people make their own choice. ... So I was looking for a more, if you will, compassionate approach, which is let people make their own choice, as opposed to deporting people.""

Romney also reflected on his ""47 percent"" comment, which he said he didn't initially think would become a major focus. He said the perception that his remarks suggested he didn't care about many Americans was incorrect.

""But I realized, look, perception is reality,"" Romney said. ""The perception is I'm saying I don't care about 47 percent of the people or something of that nature, and that's simply wrong.""

His campaign's biggest mistake in the primary, Romney told Balz, was not giving more attention to the Feb. 7 contests in Missouri, Minnesota and Colorado. He also worried during the campaign about the surge of Newt Gingrich, even as his advisers tried to assure him Gingrich would not win.

""I have to tell you that, in the discussions I had with my senior staff, people like Stuart Stevens and Russ Schriefer said, 'Look, Newt is not going to be the nominee. I don't care what the polls say, he's not going to be the nominee.' I was far less sanguine about that,"" Romney said."

Dealmaking comes down–alarmingly!–to Vice President Joe Biden’s intercessions.

Now there’s an additional reason to question President Obama’s leadership–and competence to hold office: he apparently thinks that he never tried to get media attention as a first-term U.S. Senator–not like that evil, self-interested Ted Cruz. He also, he says, never voted to shut down the government (never mind that vote against the debt ceiling, which even his spokespeople have admitted was a “political” gambit).

How utterly crazy is the president’s claim? He may have kept a low legislative profile in the Senate, where he barely showed up for work, but he was constantly the center of media attention–and made himself so. He led the left’s opposition to the Bush administration, for instance–and the centrist Clinton faction. He wrote The Audacity of Hope–a bestseller, and one that involved much media promotion, of course.

Then there was the whole running for president in his first term thing. Even before the campaign, Obama was making the media rounds, even appearing on a commercial during Monday Night Football in 2006 to tease the media’s appetite for his political ambitions. It doesn’t get much more self-promoting than this:

In fact, all Barack Obama was as a first-term U.S. Senator was a media sensation–the biggest ever. And it’s pretty much all he’s been since, judged by his lack of interest in doing his actual job. To insist otherwise, you’ve really got to be cracked. I never thought I’d say this, but maybe he should step down for Uncle Joe.

We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class. We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship. We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American, she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.

We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time. We must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher. But while the means will change, our purpose endures: a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American. That is what this moment requires. That is what will give real meaning to our creed.

We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future. For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty, and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other – through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security – these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.

We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries – we must claim its promise. That’s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure – our forests and waterways; our croplands and snowcapped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. That’s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared.

We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war. Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty. The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war, who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends, and we must carry those lessons into this time as well.

We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law. We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully – not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear. America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe; and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation. We will support democracy from Asia to Africa; from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom. And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice – not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity; human dignity and justice."

But, Republicans can’t follow his advice.","Unfortunately for Republicans, it's a near certainty that they will remain in this sort of political no man's land until they pick a presidential nominee and he or she provides the policy direction that the GOP so badly needs.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/04/Democrats-Struggle-as-National-Party,2013-02-04 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Democrats Struggle to Be National Party,"Last November, President Obama won a narrow reelection and the Democrats in the Senate added two seats to their caucus. A few high-profile Republicans lost their races. The outcome has prompted the usual round of hand-wringing from the media, pundits and national GOP Leaders about the future of the party. A deeper look at the election results, however, paints a more complicated picture. Democrats may want to conduct their own hand-wringing about the future of their party.

Although it lost the Presidency, the Republicans picked up a large number of victories in November. They gained a Governorship and solidified their gains from 2010 in the House and in the states. The GOP now has 30 Governors, a record in modern political history. They control all levers of state government in 25 states. One would have to go back to the 1920s to find the GOP so ascendant in the states. The Democrats have complete control in just 12 states, an historic low. (The rest of the states have split control.)

GOP strength in the states isn’t confined just to the South or the Plains. They control the Governor and Legislature in industrial heartland states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, as well. While Governor’s races in these states will always be competitive, redistricting should ensure that the GOP will dominate the legislatures in these states for the next decade.

This isn’t just a numbers game. The polarization in the states gives each party an opportunity to enact large parts of their respective agendas. Republicans in several states are embracing this chance. Several states are looking at comprehensive overhauls of their tax codes. Republicans are looking at reforms throughout state government, from the budget, education and business regulation.

Democrats, meanwhile, made strong gains in the states where they hold control. The party won a supermajority in the California and Illinois legislatures, for example. Progressives in these states will feel emboldened to pursue their agenda of higher taxes on the wealthy and business, and increased social spending. In many places, they will pursue stricter gun control and new environmental regulations.

The public is about to benefit from a real-time experiment in whose policies are better suited to encourage economic growth. The likely Democrat lurch to the left in several states could tarnish the party’s brand in large parts of the country. Successful Republican governance in the states, by contrast, could repair some of the damage done to the GOP’s brand in national politics.

The national GOP does face challenges. National party leaders are engaged in an existential crisis over the right amount of “conservative” or “moderate” positions. They seem largely disengaged from the party’s base supporters and activists.

That said, Democrats are on a path to disengage them from large segments of the public. Combining this with the national Dem push to raise taxes and enact gun control, among other issues, will make it difficult for Democrats to remain competitive in large parts of the country. This will create an enormous opportunity for the national GOP to fix its brand.

It shouldn’t look to machinations on Capitol Hill for salvation. It should look to the states.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/08/12/north-carolina-governor-signs-extensive-voter-id-law/,2013-08-12 00:00:00,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'Senior Reporter']",North Carolina governor signs extensive Voter ID law,"The measure requires voters to present government-issued photo identification at the polls and shortens the early voting period from 17 to 10 days. It will also end pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-old voters who will be 18 on Election Day and eliminates same-day voter registration.

Democrats and minority groups have been fighting against the changes, arguing that they represent an effort to suppress the minority vote and the youth vote, along with reducing Democrats' advantage in early voting. They point out that there is little documented evidence of voter fraud.

Republicans say that the efforts are necessary to combat such fraud and that shortening the window for early voting will save the state money. They also note that, while the North Carolina law makes many changes to how the state conducts its elections, most of its major proposals -- specifically, Voter ID and ending same-day registration -- bring it in line with many other states. More than three-fifths of states currently have some kind of Voter ID law, and even more have no same-day registration. Not all states allow in-person early voting.

“While some will try to make this seem to be controversial, the simple reality is that requiring voters to provide a photo ID when they vote is a common-sense idea,"" McCrory said in a statement. ""This new law brings our state in line with a healthy majority of other states throughout the country. This common-sense safeguard is commonplace.”

A spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association said McCrory's ""cynical"" move will come back to haunt him.

""When he ran for governor, Pat McCrory pretended to be a moderate pragmatist,"" the spokesman, Danny Kanner, said. ""Today, he proved that he's just another cynical, ultra-conservative ideologue intent on disenfranchising voters who might not be inclined to vote Republican.""

While there is significant resistance to Voter ID laws on the left, polls generally show the American people support them by large margins. Recent North Carolina polls and a Washington Post poll last year showed nearly three-quarters support requiring voters to show photo ID.

The Post poll also showed, though, that Americans are split when it comes to whether it's more important to fight voter suppression or to combat voter fraud. And while Voter ID polls popularly, the bill covers much more than that.

Several similar efforts have passed in recent years in other states with Republican-controlled state legislatures and GOP governors, but North Carolina's has drawn a particularly high degree of backlash from the left, given how far-reaching and all-inclusive the new law is.

The Justice Department has suggested it will fight the new law, which comes just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key portion of the Voting Rights Act. States like North Carolina are no longer required to obtain preclearance from the Justice Department for such changes after the Court struck down the formula used for determining which states and jurisdictions with a history of voter suppression require preclearance.

The Justice Department is also looking to challenge a new Voter ID law in Texas and has also fought against a new Voter ID law in Florida.

The other big change in the law -- a reduction in the number of early-voting days -- could diminish Democrats' historical advantage in early voting, which accounted for more than half of ballots cast in North Carolina last year.

But Republicans note that the law still requires the same number of hours of early voting -- just over a smaller period of time. County election officials can either extend hours on a given day or provide more early voting locations.

Other provisions in the new North Carolina law would prohibit paid voter registration drives, end straight-ticket voting (in which a voter can vote for all candidates of one party by voting just once -- another area in which Democrats benefit) and loosening restrictions on poll watchers who can challenge a voter's eligibility.

The state legislature gave the law final approval in late July.

The changes come as the state has fallen under Republican control for the first time in more than a century. North Carolina's state legislature went Republican for the first time since Reconstruction after the 2010 election. McCrory then won in 2012, becoming the state's first Republican governor since the early 1990s.

McCrory also recently signed an extensive new abortion restrictions law -- another move that has earned him significant opposition from the political left.

http://news.yahoo.com/ashley-judd-making-kentucky-democrats-nervous-060006565--politics.html,,[],Ashley Judd Is Making Kentucky Democrats Nervous,"The honeymoon is over for Ashley Judd.

At a time when Democrats in Washington are having second thoughts about embracing Ashley Judd as their standard-bearer against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2014, Kentucky Democrats are waving red flags about the actress, arguing that her candidacy plays into the GOP’s strengths and tarnishes the party brand in the Bluegrass State.

“She’s gonna have a tough row to hoe,” said Jim Cauley, who ran Gov. Steve Beshear’s 2007 campaign and also worked on President Obama’s 2004 Senate campaign. “She doesn't fit the damn state. That's her problem. I don't think she fits the voters of the state of Kentucky.”

As she gets closer to an announcement of her intentions, Judd has garnered national media attention. Strategists predict that a Judd-McConnell faceoff would be one of the most expensive and closely watched Senate races in recent years. Judd's backers say she is the only Democrat who could raise enough money to not only attack McConnell's record, but also beat Kentucky’s longest-serving senator.

Other Democrats in the state, including a top donor in Northern Kentucky, disagree. They argue she has not been in the state enough to mount a credible attack on McConnell, who will be ready for the fight. Karl Rove’s super PAC American Crossroads attacked Judd with a Web video earlier this year for living in Tennessee.

""I'm in this to win it, and I don't believe Ashley Judd is in it to win it,"" said Nathan Smith, a leading Kentucky Democratic donor, who is also the head of the Manufactured Housing Institute. Smith helped raise money for Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Beshear. He’s hosted Hillary Rodham Clinton at his house. He said he called Judd about 10 days ago, prepared to give his advice to the actress, but hasn’t heard back.

""If she was to call me tonight, I would give her some advice and I doubt that she'd be excited to come back for round two of that conversation. I don't care how many movies she's made."" Smith said.

Story continues

To Bluegrass State Democrats who worry about winning back the state Senate and keeping the state House, national Democrats are more concerned with forcing Republicans to spend money in Kentucky and distract McConnell from his day job as Republican Senate leader. They see Judd as a political infatuation. The actress, they say, would have trouble winning a state Mitt Romney carried by nearly 23 points in 2012.

Asked if his reaction amounted to sour grapes because Judd hadn’t called him personally, Smith told a story about a recent high school basketball event that drew some 20,000 people. He said he talked to dozens who were skeptical about Judd.

“Maybe she can become a senator without talking to anybody from Kentucky,” Smith said.

Top Democrats who are cool to Judd’s candidacy say they’d like to see Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes get into the race. The daughter of a former state party chair, Grimes defeated her GOP challenger by a wide margin. State Democratic officials stop short of calling for a primary if Judd enters the race, but they give voice to a wider concern that McConnell will get whom he wants in Judd—an opponent who can be tied to the president.

“Electing Ashley Judd gets a Republican Legislature elected. That's what I see at stake here. Your perspective is different if you're in New York or Los Angeles. They don't live here. We do. Judd's candidacy makes it seamlessly easy to Obama-ize this election,” one Kentucky Democratic strategist said."
http://news.yahoo.com/gop-win-without-hispanics-look-arizona-174605700--election.html,,[],Can GOP win without Hispanics? Look at Arizona,"PHOENIX (AP) — On the political map of the Southwest, Arizona stands out.

Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico are independent-minded states that once leaned Republican but are trending Democratic, partly because of increasing numbers of Hispanic voters alienated from the GOP by its tough stance on illegal immigration.

California, a GOP bastion for decades, is now solidly Democratic and the ultimate example of the dangers for Republicans on this issue.

Nowhere is a harder line on immigration taken than in Arizona, where Republicans have a lock on statewide offices and dominate the Legislature.

In November, Democrats picked up two congressional seats, but Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney easily won the state with a slightly better margin against President Barack Obama than Arizona Sen. John McCain posted in the 2008 White House contest.

That record has led advocates of tighter immigration restrictions to point to Arizona as a model for how Republicans can maintain their tough stance on the issue and still win elections.

""It's an example of a different way for things to play out than the conventional story,"" Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that favors tighter immigration policies, said of Arizona. ""What's happened there is the non-Hispanic vote has become increasingly Republican.""

National Republicans, aware of demographic trends, are pondering how to win over more Hispanic voters in order to be more competitive in presidential elections. It's unclear whether Arizona will remain a GOP stronghold.

Plenty of Arizona Republicans fear their state will go the way of its neighbors unless the GOP softens its immigration stance. That includes McCain, who in 2005 joined with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to sponsor legislation that included a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.

A staunch supporter of strict border enforcement in 2008 and 2010, McCain has swung back after last year's election to supporting an overhaul of the immigration system that includes citizenship for those in the U.S. without authorization. He says he was convinced the GOP could not survive with a hard-line stance in states like his.

Story continues

""If you have a large bloc of Americans who believe you're trying to keep their ... fellow Hispanics down and deprive them of an opportunity, obviously that's going to have an effect,"" McCain told reporters earlier this year.

During the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney called for ""self-deportation,"" or creating an environment so uncomfortable for immigrants here illegally that they would choose to return to their original countries. Romney also praised Arizona's approach to immigration.

Two years earlier, the state became well-known for restrictive immigration legislation with the passage of legislation requiring police officers, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. While that part of the statute survived, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down three other provisions of the law.

Arizona's stance has national implications as leading Republicans try to reorient their party following the 2012 election, when Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians went for Obama in overwhelming numbers.

A Republican National Committee panel recently released a report that advises more outreach to minorities and support for an immigration overhaul that eventually would legalize the status of most immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. That's an idea that's anathema to some Arizona Republicans.

A bipartisan group of eight senators, including McCain and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. — is drawing up a bill that includes such a provision.

Arizona was always one of the less-promising states for Democrats for reasons other than immigration, said Scott Smith, the Republican mayor of Mesa, a Phoenix suburb.

""You have a lot of retirees in Arizona — Midwestern, conservative Republicans,"" he said. ""Republicans far outnumber Democrats in registration, and the independents tend to be conservative more than liberal.""

President Bill Clinton helped make immigration a major issue in Arizona.

In an attempt to tamp down illegal immigration in California, his administration fortified the border with Mexico in the late 1990s.

The bolstered enforcement effectively pushed migrants east into the mostly empty desert that straddles Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora.

As crossing into the U.S. became harder, drug cartels and criminal syndicates expanded into human trafficking, with Phoenix becoming a major hub. The federal government warned Arizonans to stay out of various parks and swaths of public land for fear they could stumble across armed smugglers. There was widespread fear.

""That entire impact just changed the way undocumented immigrants were seen in Arizona,"" said Alfredo Gutierrez, a former Democratic president of the state Senate and an immigrant rights activist. ""It raised all kinds of opportunities for people to exploit this.""

Since the passage of SB 1070, the battles over immigration have torn the state's Republican Party.

Business leaders successfully stopped the passage of more aggressive measures in 2011. The law's architect, former State Senate President Russell Pearce, was recalled from office and last year lost a Republican primary trying to return to office.

""Republicans in Arizona have shifted pretty dramatically in how they look at this issue,"" said Glenn Hamer, president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, which spearheaded the push to block more stringent immigration legislation and supports the federal immigration overhaul.

""If the current voting patterns hold, it's impossible to see in 10-20 years the same sort of results for Republicans"" as they enjoy here now, he said.

From Hamer's perspective, the math is basic.

Arizona has stayed Republican because in exit polls over the past decade whites, currently 74 percent of the state's voters, have backed GOP presidential candidates by roughly 3-to-2 margins, even while Hispanics vote Democratic by 3-to-1. By contrast, whites only narrowly supported Republican presidential candidates in neighboring swing states.

Hispanics are 30 percent of Arizona's population but made up only 18 percent of its voters in November. One-third of them are not citizens and cannot vote, while 18 percent of the Hispanics are here illegally.

But Arizona's Hispanic population is unusually young, with a median age of 24, while its white population is significantly older, with a median age of 44. Political analysts say that makes it inevitable that at some point in the next decade or two Hispanic voters will overwhelm white voters.

Nonetheless, plenty of Arizona politicians are holding their strict stance in the immigration debate.

Recently, Attorney General Tom Horne, who came to prominence by banning a Mexican-American studies class in Tucson schools, argued for the constitutionality of a 2005 referendum that requires all voters to prove citizenship before casting a ballot.

The Legislature is considering tightening voting procedures in a way that Latino activists contend will lead to a disproportionate number of their voters being dropped from the rolls.

Gov. Jan Brewer became a heroine to those who favor immigration restrictions after signing SB1070. She has lashed out at the suggestion by the Obama administration and immigrant rights groups that the border is secure enough to legalize the status of many immigrants.

""A lot of the legislation we passed is in concert with what the people demanded of us,"" said state Rep. Steve Smith, a Republican who is author of a bill allowing the state to collect donations to build a border fence.

""We have a front row seat to it. People see the direct, detrimental effect of the drugs, the gangs, the smuggling and what they are doing to our state.""

Smith said he thinks Republicans should not abandon their forthright stance on immigration because it has won them support in Arizona and beyond. ""Don't sell your morals, beliefs and thoughts down the river,"" he said. ""When I, or other elected officials, or our governor, go to other states, people there say 'Thank God for Arizona.'""

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/michele-bachmann-departure-came-surprise-tea-party-organizers-171413266.html,,[],Bachmann’s departure came as a surprise to tea party organizers,"Earlier this month, while planning a press conference with other lawmakers and tea party leaders in response to the Internal Revenue Service's unfair targeting of conservatives, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann told Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Jenny Beth Martin that she longed to travel and speak to tea party groups more often than she had been able to recently.

At the time, Martin didn't think much of Bachmann's comment, which she said was just made in passing. As planned, Martin joined Bachmann and other tea-party-friendly lawmakers outside the U.S. Capitol building on May 16 to speak out against the federal tax collection agency's practices. The IRS controversy helped breathe some new life into the tea party movement by offering a fresh platform to rail against both its targeting of conservatives and its role in implementing the federal health care law.

Two weeks later, when Bachmann abruptly announced she would not seek re-election to her House seat, Martin suddenly remembered what Bachmann had told her. Perhaps she had been hinting at something?

""Maybe she couldn't engage in a full-blown campaign at home and also spread the message in the way she is able to around the country,"" Martin told Yahoo News in an interview. ""And also at the same time fight the battles on Capitol Hill. There's only so much a single person can do.""

From the onset of the movement, Bachmann was one of the tea party's most prominent champions in Washington. She co-founded the House Tea Party Caucus in July 2010, spoke at rallies for groups around the country, introduced a bill to repeal President Barack Obama's health insurance overhaul immediately after it passed and embraced the tea party label during her short-lived run for president in 2012.

When Obama gave his first State of the Union address in 2011, Bachmann made waves by giving a televised ""tea party response"" in coordination with Tea Party Express. To many, she was (and is) the face of the tea party in the capital city.

Story continues

Bachmann's decision to leave Congress came as an abrupt surprise to tea party coordinators, according to Martin and Tea Party Express Chairwoman Amy Kremer, two leaders of tea party groups that have worked closely with Bachmann since the movement's early days during Obama's first term. Bachmann was traveling in Russia and out of pocket when her video announcing the decision was posted online on Wednesday morning, leaving tea party leaders to draw their own conclusions about the reason for her departure.

Tea party organizers said they were disappointed by Bachmann's move, but they say they hope she will continue working with them when she leaves office. They also expressed hope that she will seek office again soon by running for Senate or launching another bid for the presidency.

""We have not heard the last of her,"" Kremer told Yahoo News. ""Just because she's not seeking re-election for her congressional seat doesn't mean she won't run for higher office at some point. I still think she has a platform.""

Kremer was quick to add that as a movement established to function without an identifiable leader, she does not anticipate that Bachmann's departure will mean the end of the tea party.

""She's been a strong and vocal voice for us, but the tea party movement is so diverse and there are so many people involved with different local groups, different national groups. The tea party movement is not focused on any one individual or any one organization,"" Kremer said. ""The tea party movement is what it is because of the people who are out there across the country, not because of any one leader, whether it is a leader of an organization or somebody in the halls of Congress."""
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/07/13/former-montana-governor-schweitzer-wont-run-for-senate/,2013-07-13 00:00:00,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'Senior Reporter']",Former Montana governor Schweitzer won’t run for Senate,"""I love Montana. I want to be here. There are all kinds of people that think I should be in the U.S. Senate,"" Schweitzer told AP. ""But I never wanted to be in the U.S. Senate. I kicked the tires. I walked to the edge and looked over.""

Schweitzer aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The popular former governor had been widely expected to run since Sen. Max Baucus (D) announced his retirement. And as recently as this week, people close to Schweitzer were under the impression that he was about to enter the race.

With his exit, Democrats must find a candidate capable of holding another open seat in a red state. They are still seeking standard-bearers in two other red states where they have retiring Democratic incumbents: South Dakota and West Virginia.

Those three seats would go a long way toward Republican efforts to reclaim the Senate majority in 2014 -- a goal that requires the GOP taking six Democratic seats.

Democrats also must defend three other red states where incumbents are seeking reelection -- Alaska, Arkansas and Louisiana -- along with swing states in Iowa and North Carolina. About the only GOP seats that could conceivably be in play at this point are red-tilting Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) faces Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D), and an open-seat race in Georgia that is still taking shape.

Schweitzer's decision is expected to open the door for other Republicans to run, most notably freshman Rep. Steve Daines. Currently running on the GOP side are former state senator Corey Stapleton and state Rep. Champ Edmunds.

Republicans immediately sought credit for pushing Schweitzer out of the race.

“Just two days ago, Senate Democrats were quoted promising Brian Schweitzer tremendous resources to get in the race,” said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""We did our homework and there was a lot of rust under Schweitzer's hood – a lot of rust.""

Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, insisted Democrats remain in position to hold their majority.

""We remain confident that Democrats can hold the Montana seat and the overall math still favors Democrats next year,"" Cecil said. ""Only three Democratic incumbents have lost reelection in the last decade. Our incumbents are positioned to win, we've already recruited a strong challenger to Mitch McConnell and Republicans have failed to expand the Senate map into blue and purple states.""

Among other potential Democratic recruits are state Supreme Court Justice Brian Morris, state Sen. Kendall Van Dyk, state schools superintendent Denise Juneau, state insurance commissioner Monica Lindeen and Stephanie Schriock, the president of the Democratic women's group Emily's List.

Schweitzer is thought to be interested in a potential run for president in 2016. He also recent accepted the chairmanship of a major mining company in Montana.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/07/barney-frank-wants-another-crack-at-congress/,2013-01-07 00:00:00,['Barnini Chakraborty'],Barney Frank crafts return to Congress -- days after retiring,"Barney Frank just can't seem to stay away from Congress.

One day after retiring as a 16-term Democratic representative from Massachusetts, Frank announced that he had asked Gov. Deval Patrick to send him back to D.C. – this time as in interim senator to fill the seat of Sen. John Kerry, who was nominated for secretary of state.

That doesn’t mean the colorful congressman will get the gig, though. Patrick says that while Frank would make a “great” interim senator, it’s not a done deal and that he hasn't made his final decision yet.

Asked by reporters if he would have preferred Frank keep his conversation with him private, the governor started laughing.

“Does it matter in the case of Congressman Frank what I would have preferred?” Patrick asked.

State law requires the governor appoint a temporary successor if and when Kerry is confirmed by the Senate. A special election would then be held between 145 to 160 days after the appointment. The interim senator would only serve a few months but that’s all the time Frank says he’ll need to get what he wants done.

“A few weeks ago, I said I wasn’t interested,” Frank said in a statement. “It was kind of like you’re about to graduate, and they said, ‘You gotta go to summer school.’ But (the fiscal cliff deal) now means that February, March and April are going to be among the most important months in American financial history.”

Frank helped lead a regulatory crackdown after the financial crisis and scored a huge legislative victory with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The law, which was passed in part to respond to the crisis with the markets, has reshaped the financial landscape of the country. Frank has also been an outspoken advocate for affordable housing and has championed for consumer rights.

In the next few months, Republicans and Democrats will be going head-to-head in a series of fiscal fights. The new Congress will face three major issues before late March: the debt ceiling debate in late February, massive across-the-board federal spending cuts known as sequestration by March 1 and the need to pass a budget bill by March 27. Frank’s presence could help the Obama administration during those negotiations.

Frank also has spoken out against former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel after it became clear he would be Obama's pick for defense secretary -- raising the question of whether Frank might want to log a vote against Hagel from the Senate. Frank, though, scaled back his opposition Monday. Frank told The Boston Globe he “was hoping the president wouldn’t nominate him” but said he would look past anti-gay comments Hagel made in the late ‘90s.

Frank was the first openly gay elected official to serve as a U.S. representative and has pushed hard to advance gay rights.

“As much as I regret what Hagel said, and resent what he said, the question now is going to be Afghanistan and scaling back the military. In terms of the policy stuff, if he would be rejected (by the Senate), it would be a setback for those things,” Frank said.

If Frank is tapped, he will be working on a tight timetable. Typically, interim senators aren’t remembered for their lasting contributions. Three recent short-term senators, Ted Kaufman of Delaware, Roland Burris of Illinois, and Paul Kirk of Massachusetts, stayed barely long enough to get their members pins. Kirk, though, had the politically important duty of voting for the Affordable Care Act for the Democrats.

Kaufman, 73, was picked to fill Vice President Biden's vacant Senate seat in 2009 and in an interview he said that at his age, the interim Senate appointment was more about serving out the term than effecting any great political change.

And then there was Burris. He was tapped by former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich for Obama's former seat, a decision that fueled allegations that the governor had tried to get favors in exchange for the appointment. Burris decided not to run for the seat.

(CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden will travel to Iowa next month to deliver the keynote speech at Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry, an aide to the vice president - and potential candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination - told CNN's Jim Acosta on Sunday.

An Iowa Democratic official also confirmed Biden's upcoming visit to Harkin's steak fry, which typically attracts a high-profile crowd of national Democrats. Its setting in the first-in-the-nation caucus state makes it a natural stop for potential White House hopefuls.



A Biden aide said the stop in Iowa has long been a commitment on the vice president's calendar after he was unable to attend last year's steak fry.

The vice president's trip was first reported by The New York Times.

Biden has not yet said whether he'll make a third bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, though his schedule this year has hinted at where his aspirations may lie.

In May, he spoke to a gathering of Democrats in South Carolina, site of the first-in-the-South primary contest in presidential nominating years. And later this month, he'll help raise money for New Hampshire's Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, though the event itself won't take place in the first-in-the-nation primary state, but rather in neighboring Maine.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, considered the Democrats' top pick for the presidential nomination in 2016 if she chooses to run, has not visited any early voting states since she left her post at the State Department in February. Like Biden, she has not said whether she'll make another bid for the White House.

And while Clinton hasn't yet traveled to Iowa in her new role as a private citizen, a group that works to elect Democratic women to public office held a ""Madam President"" event there this weekend with Clinton as the unspoken target.

Plenty of Republicans have visited Iowa, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania this weekend for an evangelical gathering.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana have also visited the Hawkeye State over the past several months.

by Justin Elliott ProPublica, July 1, 2013, 9:45 a.m.

Shortly before Election Day last year, mailers went out to Texas voters featuring pictures of a Democratic congressional candidate and a rare species of spider, whose discovery had forced stoppage of an important highway construction project.

""The same left-wing extremists who support Pete Gallego want more burdensome regulations that put the interests of spiders above our need to create more jobs,"" the flier declared, referring to discovery of the endangered Braken Bat Cave meshweaver. ""The best way to stop left-wing extremists from killing jobs is to vote against their hand-picked candidate Pete Gallego.""

The group that put out the mailer, A Better America Now, reported to the Federal Election Commission it had spent about $65,000 for the mailer and TV advertising in the hard-fought race to represent Texas' 23rd district.

But in a tax return recently filed with the IRS, the group claimed it did not spend any money at all on ""direct or indirect political campaign activities.""

The tax return is signed under the penalty of perjury by the group's president, Bob Portrie, and the accounting firm LBA Group. Neither responded to requests for comment.

We first reported on A Better America Now earlier this year, showing it had told the IRS in a 2011 application for nonprofit status that it did not plan to spend any money on elections. (That document was sent to ProPublica last year by the IRS, even though the application was still pending and thus not supposed to be released.)

""This type of inaccurate reporting by electioneering nonprofit groups has a long history,"" says Public Citizen's Craig Holman, when asked about the group's most recent filing. ""It is rooted in the fact that the IRS almost never holds these groups accountable for such false declarations.""

A Better America Now was a bit player in the elections. But it's also an example of the kind of increasingly common outside groups that inject anonymous money into political campaigns.

Such social welfare nonprofits are not supposed to have political campaign activity as their primary purpose 2014 but the ambiguities around how the IRS measures such activity and how it screens the groups are at the center of the recent investigations of the IRS's treatment of Tea Party groups.

ProPublica has documented how nonprofits that spent millions of dollars on ads in the 2010 elections failed to report or underreported that political spending to the IRS. The tax form that the groups are required to file with the IRS specifically asks for details on any campaign spending.

One of the curious things about A Better America Now is that, though the group spent money in a congressional and a state legislative race in southwest Texas, it is based a few miles off the beach near Jacksonville, Florida.

The president of A Better America Now, Portrie, is also the head of a consulting firm, the Fenwick Group. The two groups are listed at the same address. Fenwick's website says it works with ""organizations across the healthcare, financial services, insurance, retail and investment sectors.""

Portrie and Fenwick were also linked to ads run by another Florida-based social welfare nonprofit, America is Not Stupid, in last year's U.S. Senate race in Montana. Ads by America is Not Stupid featured a talking baby complaining about alleged cuts to Medicare by President Obama, and referring to the baby's stinking diaper.

In 2010, the New York Times reported on links between the Fenwick Group and yet another politically active nonprofit, the Coalition to Protect Seniors. Ads by that group featured the same talking baby ad.

In last year's race in Texas, which attracted a lot of outside spending on both sides, the Democrat, Gallego, prevailed over Republican incumbent Quico Canseco."

“Nobody was shocked more than me,” winner Dave Wilson told a local TV station after defeating a 24-year incumbent for a seat on the Houston Community College Board of Trustees.

Incumbent Bruce Austin is crying foul and says he wants a recount, after losing by 26 votes. But the reasons for his defeat appear to go beyond political hardball. The board -- whose members have been notorious for using their influence to steer government contracts to friends and family -- has shown signs of returning to its old ways.

And, Wilson says, he snatched away the election in part because Austin expected to win without campaigning.

But the electrician-turned-politician also used campaign flyers with images of black people that he says he found on the Internet and touted an endorsement from his Midwestern cousin Ron Wilson -- who happens to have the same name as a former black state representative from the Houston area. (Wilson made the distinction clear in the fine print of his campaign flyers.)

Wilson’s campaign website includes several photos of black people and his own biography -- which notes him having a son who served in Afghanistan, but does not appear to include a picture of Wilson.

Wilson also aired a radio ad featuring two ""neighborhood"" women discussing Wilson's political merits.

“That Bruce Austin voted against $6 million in scholarships or our children right here in our neighborhood,” one woman says. “Girl, please, I bet he has relatives that could have used some of that scholarship money he voted against. I’ve had about enough of him ... Dave Wilson is the man who is fighting for our neighborhoods.”"

Jane Orie was imprisoned on corruption charges

Orie family blames prosecution on county attorney

A letter to nuns revealed Orie employees were doing illegal campaign work

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The story has more irony than a Greek tragedy. Three sisters from a devout Catholic family have seen their personal and political careers ruined by a scandal that began with, of all things, a letter to some nuns.

Thursday's conviction of suspended Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Joan Orie Melvin along with her aide and sister, Janine Orie, on campaign corruption charges mean they might join a third sister — former state senator Jane Orie — in state prison. No sentencing date has been set.

The former senator was sentenced last year to 2½ to 10 years for using her state-paid staff to run her campaigns, though she was acquitted of having them campaign for Melvin, then a lower appellate court judge, who was running for the Supreme Court in 2003 and 2009. Joan Orie Melvin and Janine Orie were convicted in a spinoff investigation and found guilty of similarly misusing Melvin's former staff and the senator's.

Even before the convictions, their careers — and the family from which they sprang — were extraordinary.

Dr. John Orie, now 90, and his late wife, Jean, raised nine children including five attorneys, Joan and Jane among them; two cardiologists; a teacher; and a human resources manager, Janine, who worked for her sister Joan Orie Melvin in the lower Superior Court before moving up with her to the Supreme Court.

""It's all pretty unbelievable,"" said John Burkoff, a university of Pittsburgh law professor who has closely followed the cases. ""Whatever you thought about the Orie sisters, whether you liked or didn't like them, you have to look at all of this as tragic.""

Jim Roddey is a prominent businessman who heads the Republican Party in Allegheny County, where Republicans are outnumbered more than 2 to 1 by Democrats and where Pittsburgh, the county seat, hasn't elected a GOP mayor since the Great Depression.

Before 2010, when Republican Tom Corbett was elected governor, Jane Orie was the state Senate majority whip — the highest-ranking elected Republican politician not just in Pennsylvania, but also of several states in the Northeast, Roddey said. And Melvin, elected in November 2009, was one of seven members of the state's highest court.

And now? Jane Orie resigned her Senate seat in May, and Melvin's status on the state's highest court figures to change, one way or another.

State lawmakers have already asked her to resign or face articles of impeachment. If those are approved by the state House, Melvin would be tried by the Senate, which could remove her from office if she hasn't already been removed by the state's Court of Judicial Discipline.

Now that she has been convicted, Melvin has 30 days to respond to charges of misconduct filed with that court by the state's Judicial Conduct Board. If it is determined Melvin has violated professional conduct rules or the state Constitution, or brought disrepute to the judiciary, the court can remove her from office.

Melvin's criminal defense attorneys and her disciplinary court attorney didn't return calls Friday.

The Ories have argued the prosecution is the result of a political vendetta by Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala, a Democrat, who has repeatedly denied ulterior motives.

When the investigation first became public in late 2009, the sisters claimed they were being targeted because Zappala's family has interests in legalized gambling, which the Ories opposed expanding in Pennsylvania.

The allegations grew uglier, when Melvin — after it was known Sen. Orie was being investigated but before the justice was charged — called for an audit of two child care centers that paid kickbacks to two judges in northeastern Pennsylvania's Luzerne County who sent troubled youths to the facilities. The facilities were co-owned by Gregory Zappala, the prosecutor's brother, who was never charged in the scheme and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

To this day, some Orie supporters still believe those politics — not justice — drove the prosecution.

Roddey acknowledges the sisters' success in a politically hostile environment has something to do with that chatter.

""That's part of it,"" Roddey said. ""But the other half of the equation is that her prosecutor was Stephen Zappala, and Joan's biggest public battle was she chastised the Supreme Court for what happened in Luzerne County.""

Whatever the motivations, two juries have now found enough evidence to bring the overachieving siblings from triumph to tragedy despite a raft of supporters — Sen. Orie spent $420 on a chartered bus to bring 50 character witnesses to her trial — and, even, efforts to seek divine intervention.

During the investigation, which centered on the sisters' emails, prosecutors stumbled onto messages Sen. Orie and Melvin sent to the ""angel lady,"" a Philadelphia psychic who read her client's written questions aloud before claiming to receive a whispered answer from an angel.

The senator and justice sought assurances from the $85-an-hour medium that Zappala's investigation wouldn't result in criminal charges.

But rather than being touched by an angel, the sisters were undone by some nuns.

That happened in late October 2009 — days before Melvin won her Supreme Court seat — when a Senate intern complained to Zappala that Sen. Orie's staff was doing campaign work for Melvin.

The complaint centered on a letter Sen. Orie wrote on Melvin's campaign stationery asking Pittsburgh-area nuns to vote for Melvin.

When Orie and Melvin learned of the whistle-blowing intern, the senator had a staffer prepare another letter — a ""coverup"" letter, according to prosecutors. This time, Sen. Orie — on her own stationery — spoke about civic events of interest to nuns but didn't mention Melvin.

Prosecutors contend the letter was created to make it appear the intern was simply mistaken about what she saw and was never mailed. Eventually, Sen. Orie's and Melvin's staffs told a grand jury about other illegal campaign work done in Orie's Senate offices and Melvin's chambers.

""Frankly, it's a smart group of people. How could they put themselves in this kind of situation?"" Burkoff said. ""This is the kind of thing we'll be puzzling about for years."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-voting-20130804,0,1055547.story",2013-08-04 07:00:00,[],The voting rights disaster,"It has been less than six weeks since the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark law that for five decades has protected this country’s most basic democratic right. But it is already clear that the decision was a disaster.

FOR THE RECORD:

Voting rights: An Aug. 4 editorial said the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to address overt forms of racial discrimination such as literacy tests and grandfather clauses. Grandfather clauses, which exempted some white voters from literacy tests and poll taxes, were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court 50 years earlier.



Freed of the obligation to seek federal approval before making changes in their election practices, some states have moved to introduce or restore policies that will make it harder for racial minorities to vote or will dilute their political influence. Meanwhile, as any student of contemporary politics could have predicted, a divided Congress shows no sign of moving quickly to adopt a new formula for federal “pre-clearance” of state election changes that would meet the Supreme Court’s requirements.

Although the Voting Rights Act prohibits racial discrimination in voting nationwide, only some states, mostly in the South, had been required to obtain advance approval from the U.S. Department of Justice or a federal judge before they changed their election practices. The problem with that, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said, was that the formula for deciding which states had to “pre-clear” changes was rooted in data from the 1960s and ‘70s and didn’t reflect “current conditions,” notably dramatic increases in minority turnout in Southern states.

Roberts had a point. When Congress was considering an extension of the pre-clearance system in the early 2000s, it could have started from scratch, scrutinizing evidence of voting discrimination and minority turnout in all 50 states before devising a new formula. Instead, Congress focused on whether pre-clearance was still necessary in states that were guilty of egregious misconduct at the time the Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965. It concluded that pre-clearance had been highly successful in blocking or forestalling discriminatory actions.

Extending the old coverage formula made it easier for representatives and senators, including those from the South, to support reauthorization of pre-clearance. In that sense, the decision to retain the formula was a political one, but it was also well within Congress’ authority under the Constitution to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments, which guarantee equal protection of the laws and prohibit racial discrimination in voting. The court was wrong to substitute its judgment for that of Congress. And Roberts demonstrated naivete at best in blithely suggesting that Congress could easily revise the pre-clearance requirement to reflect “current conditions.”

To its credit, the Obama Justice Department is now pursuing an ingenious strategy in an effort to re-establish pre-clearance under an obscure section of the Voting Rights Act not affected by the court’s decision. That section allows federal judges to “bail in” a state for pre-clearance if it is found to have passed voting laws that are intentionally discriminatory. Invoking that section of the law, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. has joined in a challenge to a Texas redistricting map that critics say discriminates against Latino voters. If that strategy proves successful, Texas — and potentially other states — would have to seek advance federal approval of other changes, including requirements that voters produce photo IDs at polling places. (Only hours after the Supreme Court’s decision, Texas officials announced that they would enforce a strict photo ID requirement that been blocked by a court.) One problem with the “bail in” strategy is that while other parts of the Voting Rights Act prohibit practices that have a discriminatory effect, states can be bailed in to pre-clearance only if they have been guilty of racial discrimination by intent.

Even as he announced the new strategy, Holder acknowledged that it was “no substitute for legislation that will fill the void left by the Supreme Court’s decision.” It’s not clear that Congress could rise above partisan and regional divisions to approve a new formula for determining which states must seek pre-clearance of election changes. Republicans are likely to be averse to re-establishing pre-clearance for the same reason they have been enthusiastic about photo ID requirements: Minorities tend to vote Democratic. Indeed, GOP support for a variety of measures that reduce minority turnout may be motivated less by racism than by a quest for partisan advantage. But that doesn’t make them any less odious.

It might seem quixotic, but supporters of voting rights should continue to press both parties in Congress to revisit the Voting Rights Act in light of the high court’s decision. It is worth exploring whether the notion of “covered” states should give way to a nationwide system requiring pre-clearance whenever a court is convinced a state has adopted laws or procedures that have the effect of discriminating against minorities.

Finally, Congress might want to specifically address the issue of photo ID. There is ample evidence that such identification requirements disproportionately inconvenience not only racial minorities but poor, elderly and younger voters as well. On the other hand, photo ID requirements are popular not only in previously “covered” states but throughout the country, and the Supreme Court in 2008 upheld an Indiana photo ID law against a constitutional challenge. It would be consistent with Congress’ responsibility under the 14th and 15th Amendments to enact legislation requiring states that insist on photo IDs to make them free and easy to obtain.

Although it was originally enacted to address overt forms of racial discrimination such as literacy tests and grandfather clauses, the Voting Rights Act and its pre-clearance provisions also have prevented states from engaging in subtler forms of discrimination such as the drawing of district lines that prevent minority voters from electing representatives of their choice. The result has been the increase in minority political participation that (ironically) the Supreme Court cited in striking down the law’s coverage formula. Congress must not allow that progress to be reversed."

Special election for remainder of Frank Lautenberg%27s term is Oct. 16

Chiesa%2C currently New Jersey%27s attorney general%2C says he will not run

Nominating petitions for special election due Monday%2C June 10

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appointed state Attorney General Jeff Chiesa to be the interim U.S. senator Thursday.

Chiesa, a Republican and former chief counsel to Christie, said he will not be a candidate in the special election Oct. 16 for the remainder of Frank Lautenberg's term.

Lautenberg, 89, died Monday of complications from viral pneumonia. The U.S. Senate is paying a final tribute to Lautenberg, whose body is lying in repose this afternoon in the chamber.

Chiesa, 47, attorney general of New Jersey since January 2012, is a longtime Christie ally. They've known each other for more than 20 years, since Christie interviewed him for a clerkship at his law firm. Chiesa would later serve as a federal prosecutor for nine years at the U.S. attorney's office.

""I'll use my best judgment,"" Chiesa, a self-described conservative, said at a news conference with Christie.

""I don't kid myself that I'm going to go down there with a bunch of bills,"" he said. ""I want to understand the process, I want to understand the people that I'll be working with and develop relationships with them and do the best I can.""

Chiesa will join the U.S. Senate on Monday — the same day special election candidates must submit petitions with 1,000 signatures to New Jersey's election division. Primaries will be held Aug. 13.

Because of the compressed election schedule, New Jersey moved quickly into a political frenzy — even before Lautenberg's casket arrived at the U.S. Capitol. Lautenberg, the last World War II veteran in the Senate, will be buried Friday at Arlington National Cemetery.

Christie, who is running for a second term in November, is taking heat from Democrats for the timing and costs of the special election. State law on filling vacancies conflicted, and some Republicans wanted Christie to delay the special election until November 2014.

Democrats wanted a special election this November to help boost turnout for state Sen. Barbara Buono, who lags Christie in all statewide public opinion polls.

The primary and the general election will cost New Jersey about $12 million each, which Christie said the state will pay. Christie said he would have faced a lawsuit if he scheduled the special election for next year.

""I was confronted with a set of imperfect choices,"" Christie said, ""but I don't believe that ... letting people select their senator as soon as possible and sending him to Washington as soon as possible is"" wrong.

Hours before Christie announced his appointment, Democratic Rep. Rush Holt declared his candidacy. Holt, an eight-term congressman and a physicist, said he is the best person ""to continue the passionate advocacy for progressive values that Sen. Lautenberg exemplified.""

Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who had declared his intention to run for the Senate in 2014, is gathering signatures for his nominating petition, according to The Star-Ledger.

Booker, a popular Democrat with a national following, has raised nearly $2 million for the 2014 Senate race and would be able to use those funds for the special election.

Rep. Frank Pallone, a 14-term Democratic congressman, is also likely to run for the vacant Senate seat. Pallone can transfer funds from his House account — about $3.4 million — into another account for a Senate race.

Steve Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota, is running for the GOP Senate nomination.

If the situation were a movie, one donor said, it would be titled: “He’s Just Not That Into You.”

Now, with political givers viewing the McAuliffe campaign as a way to curry favor should Hillary Rodham Clinton decide to run for president in 2016, the chatter among the donor class is about the striking contrast between the Obama and Clinton approaches.

“It’s a whole different shtick,” said Arthur L. Schechter, a Houston-based lawyer whose support for Mr. Clinton led to an ambassadorship in the Bahamas and who has also raised money for Mr. Obama. ""The Clintons have a way of making people feel like they’re part of something and important to what’s going on, and I found that lacking in the Obama team,"" he added.

Several donors declined to speak for attribution because they did not want to anger the president. One called Mr. Obama’s White House holiday events “cuckoo clock parties,” because “he comes down, gives a speech, poses for some photos and pops back inside.”

David Plouffe, who served as Mr. Obama’s campaign manager in 2008, said the ethos of fund-raising started with Mr. Obama’s earliest donors in 2007. “It was about the campaign and the mission, not what they would get out of it,” he said. “That may be unusual, but it was a privilege to witness and it was successful.”"

Mitch McConnell on a crash course to crisis.

What we're talking about here is a shrinking Senate minority pursuing a nullification strategy -- they want to nullify federal law by abusing procedural tactics in a way that's literally never been done in the United States. If Senate Republicans want changes to the CFPB, there's already a mechanism in place that allows them to pursue reforms: it's called the existing legislative process. Senators can write a bill, send it to committee, try to persuade their colleagues of the proposal's merit, debate it on the floor, vote for it, etc. But that takes time and effort, and it might not work, especially since the changes the GOP wants are absurd. So, instead, Republicans intend to block existing federal law from taking effect unless Democrats accept changes demanded by financial industry lobbyists.

Republicans in the Senate have vowed to destroy the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by continuing to block confirmation of the agency's director, any director. It's not opposition to the individual, Richard Cordray, that is driving them. It's fealty to Wall Street and utter disregard for constitutional, governmental norms. Steve Benen talks about just how radical what the Senate Republicans are doing is.As Benen says, it's nullification through extortion. They're demanding that federal law be ignored, unenforced, unless the changes to the CFPB they and their puppet-masters want are made. They are not doing this through the normal, regular,legislative process, but through an unprecedented filibuster. Just days after ostensibly agreeing with their votes for reform that the filibuster was being abused and, boy, they sure weren't going to do that anymore.

By systematically refusing to confirm President Obama's nominees, eschewing their constitutional advise and consent mandate, and by trying to force changes to existing law through extortion and exploiting Senate procedure, what the Senate Republicans are doing could indeed prompt a constitutional crisis. One alternative, and one that gets more attractive by the moment, is that Harry Reid goes ""nuclear,"" changing filibuster rules with a simple majority vote mid-session. In the face of such extreme Republican behavior, it might be the only rational response.

Please sign our petition urging Harry Reid to re-open the process of filibuster reform in the Senate."

At least five other states also sell the specialty plates: Arizona, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. But in Virginia, the tag ranks No. 2 among such plates approved in the past five years and ninth among more than 200 total.

The tag was issued to roughly 21,800 Virginia-registered vehicles in just the first 20 months of sales, according to state figures reported by The Virginian-Pilot newspaper.

“It is a symbol of frustration … a symbol of disgust with the government,” David Dwyer, a former Hampton Roads Tea Party chairman, told the newspaper.

The sales figures for the “Don’t Tread on Me” plates indicate more than just Tea Party members are buying them, which Dwyer suggests is an indication the movement’s mantra of less-government and no new taxes resonates with many Americans.

“I’m seeing [the tags] everywhere now,” added Hampton Roads Tea Party chairman Keith Freeman.

The state approved the logo, which resembles the rattlesnake-emblazoned historic Gadsden Flag, in 2011, after the movement helped Republicans win back the House a year earlier in the landslide, mid-term elections.

However, this was a tough year for conservative voters in Virginia. Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe in November in a race many political strategists called a test case for the 2016 elections.

Several other Virginia specialty plates with political themes are less popular, compared to the one with the Revolutionary-era “Don’t Tread on Me” flag.

Roughly 1,600 vehicles have the abortion-rights “Trust Women/Respect Choice” plate while about 5,400 have the anti-abortion “Choose Life” message, according to the paper.

The state’s specialty plates cost an additional $10, though some revenue-sharing tags cost more."

I bet that Paul Ryan is not typically serenaded by mariachis.

But then, this week was anything but typical for the Republican congressman from Wisconsin.

Ryan traveled to Chicago–and across the aisle–to appear alongside Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, perhaps Congress’ most vocal proponent of immigration reform.

Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.

The two men gave a joint presentation at the City Club of Chicago, where – even in that bluest of blue cities – the business friendly audience probably favors many of Ryan’s economic policies.

Before that, the two lawmakers went into a Hispanic neighborhood to meet with activists, members of the clergy and immigrant advocates. It was there that the mariachis greeted them. In the crowd, a man appreciatively held up a banner with Ryan’s photo on it and the words: “Gracias, Ryan.”

For immigration reform advocates, there is a lot for which to be thankful these days. At a time when more and more Republicans in Congress are expressing skepticism about a Senate bill that combines border security with a guest worker program and legal status for the undocumented, Ryan is doubling down on his support. He thinks the current system is failing us. He told the crowd that what we’re doing now is bad for national security, bad for business, bad for communities and bad for families.

Right you are, congressman. On all counts.

During the visit, Ryan told reporters: “I would say for the sake of our national security, we want to modernize our immigration laws. We do not even know how to track people who overstay their visas. We need a modern immigration system that helps us not only protect our border but protects national security in all of its aspects. So if anything, I would say this is an argument for modernizing our immigration laws. We need it for national security, we need it for our economy.”

And when Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, talks about the economy, he is on familiar terrain.

“If you take a look at contributions that immigrants make to society … it produces faster economic growth, which brings in more revenue to the federal government,” he said. “So if you look at this issue in its totality, immigration is a net positive contributor to the economy.”

The congressman also knows his way around the immigration issue. In 2005, as Gutierrez reminded the crowd, Ryan co-sponsored an immigration reform bill in the House that was ultimately voted down. He has said he is especially concerned that employers, including the kinds of farmers and ranchers who populate his home state, have access to the labor they need to stay in business.

In fact, over the last decade, Ryan has supported or co-sponsored what the anti-immigrant group, NUMBERS USA, disdainfully called “various amnesties to give illegal aliens a path to citizenship.” It’s one reason that the group – which advocates both an end to illegal immigration and a dramatic reduction in legal immigration, to pre-1965 levels – gave Ryan’s career in Congress a “C.” That grade puts him in the bottom 10% of all current Republican members of Congress, according to the group’s executive director, Roy Beck. And, conversely, it puts him in the top 10%, as far as many Latinos are concerned. You see, it only helps build Ryan’s “street cred” that he’s not popular with groups that attract so many anti-Latino nativists.

The 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee is almost certain to run for the top job in 2016 as part of what could turn out to be a crowded field. Other contenders for the Republican presidential nomination could include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

With that kind of lineup, you can expect immigration to be a top issue in the GOP primary. Rubio is the de facto spokesman for the 844-page comprehensive immigration reform bill cobbled together by the Senate’s “gang of eight.” Cruz is a vocal critic of the plan. Lately, Jeb Bush seems to have cornered the market on just about every position imaginable on a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.

Ryan needs to get his ducks in a row. Was this week’s trip to Chicago the kick-off of his 2016 Hispanic outreach efforts? If so, will it work?

It could, if it is followed up by other visits and more speeches and continued attention to Latino concerns. It’s a start. If Ryan talks less, and listens more, he’ll stand out from other politicians and could impress Latino voters as someone whose interests, on some issues, align with theirs.

The GOP is doing a lot of soul-searching these days trying to figure out how to get Latinos to show them some love. There are strategy sessions and focus groups and smarty-pants consultants with their pie charts and bar graphs. But folks make this stuff harder than it really is.

In the world of Latino outreach, sometimes, it’s the little things that count for a lot. Like a Republican congressman from Wisconsin taking an unexpected detour to say his piece and pay his respects to a constituency poorly served by both parties, despite the likelihood that he’ll be hammered by some in his own party.

Like the man said – Gracias, Ryan.

Pelosi currently represents 12th Congressional District of California, which includes the northeastern three-quarters of the City and County of San Francisco, California. (here's a PDF map of CA-12)

In 2012, Pelosi was lucky to draw a Republican general election challenger, John Dennis. Since the 12th Congressional District of California is overwhelmingly Democratic to the point that simply being a Republican means that someone is unelectable, Pelosi won re-election easily. If that happens again in 2014, Pelosi will win re-election easily.

However, if Nancy Pelosi draws a Democratic general election challenger, which is possible because of the way congressional elections are conducted in California, Pelosi could be in big trouble.

Since the 2010 Republican wave that saw Democrats lose the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Pelosi's relationship with progressives has become heavily strained.

First, in a 2011 report by the newsmagazine 60 Minutes, Pelosi was revealed to have participated in the initial public offering (IPO) of shares of Visa stock in 2008 at the same time that the House was considering whether or not to bring proposed regulations on credit cards to the House floor, which it never did:



...former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband have participated in at least eight IPOs. One of those came in 2008, from Visa, just as a troublesome piece of legislation that would have hurt credit card companies, began making its way through the House. Undisturbed by a potential conflict of interest the Pelosis purchased 5,000 shares of Visa at the initial price of $44 dollars. Two days later it was trading at $64. The credit card legislation never made it to the floor of the House.

A coalition of progressive outside groups is threatening to recruit primary challengers against Democrats who vote for a bill with “chained CPI,” and the groups have been directing thousands of activists to call Democratic members, including leaders. But when asked about “chained CPI” Wednesday, Pelosi backed Obama, saying she considers it “a strengthening of Social Security.”

Writer, blogger and sometime TV pundit, Zerlina Maxwell, who was given the unenviable challenge of interviewing Ms. Pelosi, Saturday afternoon, eventually got to a question about Edward Snowden's release of documents related to the government's snooping operations. Boos and heckles cascaded across the convention hall, as the minority leader defended the legality of the NSA's data mining operation, and its intrusions into the world's email and internet activity, while decrying any comparison to similar activities under Bush and Cheney. She even brought charts explaining the differences, which she tweeted. ""No more secret courts! No more secret laws,"" shouted attendee Marc Perkel, a 57 year-old Californian. As the crowd applauded and cheered his audaciousness, some joining in the chants, security personnel were summoned and he was removed from the hall. ""It was wrong when Cheney did it, and it's wrong now,"" he yelled, as they marched him out. The shouting inside did not stop, however. When Leader Pelosi was asked for her response to the news that Snowden had been charged with three felonies, under the Espionage Act, she defended the Department of Justice's criminal complaint. ""In terms of Snowden,"" she said, ""I may be in disagreement with you. He did violate the law, in terms of releasing those documents."" At that point, Pelosi was assailed with another rolling chorus of boos.

Second, Pelosi has supported President Obama's War on Social Security , including making the absurd claim that Chained CPI would actually strengthen Social Security:Finally, Pelosi publicly defended the National Security Agency's PRISM elecronic surveillance program at the 2013 Netroots Nation conference, and she was booed by progressive activists Trust me, the LAST thing Nancy Pelosi wants is to have to run against a progressive Democrat in the general election in her home district, as she'll have to defend her non-progressive positions on a few very important issues in a district that has a storied history of progressive activism. If Pelosi has to run against a true progressive Democrat, she could lose re-election despite Pelosi having a massive campaign war chest at her disposal."

Will', 'Columnist Covering Politics', 'Domestic', 'Foreign Affairs', 'October', 'George F. Will Writes A Twice-Weekly Column On Politics', 'Foreign Affairs. He Began His Column With The Post In', 'He Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In His Latest Book', 'The Conservative Sensibility', 'Was Released In June']","George F. Will: Robert Sarvis, Virginia’s other choice for governor","When William F. Buckley, running as the Conservative Party’s candidate for mayor of New York in 1965, was asked what he would do if he won, he replied: “Demand a recount.” Robert Sarvis, Libertarian Party candidate for governor of Virginia, will not need to do this.

Hours before Gallup reported record nationwide support — 60 percent — for a third party to leaven politics, Sarvis was declared ineligible for the final debate for gubernatorial candidates because he fell a tad short of a 10 percent average in recent polls. None of this disturbed his leisurely enjoyment of a tuna-burger lunch before sauntering off in search of free media, about the only kind he can afford.

Equanimity is his default position and almost his political platform: WhyF be agitated when your frenzied adversaries are splendidly making your case about the poverty of standard political choices? The Democratic and Republican candidates, Terry McAuliffe and Ken Cuccinelli, each say that no good can come from electing the other fellow; Sarvis amiably agrees with both.

In Sarvis, the man and the moment have met. He is running at a time of maximum distrust of established institutions, including the two major parties. He has little money, but McAuliffe and Cuccinelli have spent millions of dollars on broadcast ads making each other repulsive to many Virginians, who surely feel as Will Rogers did: “You got to admit that each party is worse than the other.” Furthermore, the partial shutdown of the government especially annoyed Sarvis’s state, which has the nation’s second highest per-capita federal spending (Alaska is first) — Northern Virginia is a dormitory for federal workers and southern Virginia’s military installations include the world’s largest naval complex.

At the national level, the most potent third-party candidates have had vivid personalities and burning issues: Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, taming corporations; Strom Thurmond in 1948, asserting regional grievances relating to race; George Wallace in 1968, venting class and cultural resentments; Ross Perot in 1992, shrinking the federal deficit. Sarvis is more bemused than burning.

The heated race for Virginia governor pits Republican Ken Cuccinelli against Democrat Terry McAuliffe. But there is another guy: Libertarian Robert Sarvis. The Post’s Lee Powell is on the campaign trail with Sarvis, who is pushing what he calls more “rational policy.” (The Washington Post)

During an intermission in the telecast of a notably disagreeable McAuliffe-Cuccinelli debate, viewers heard from their television sets a woman’s voice asking, “Can’t vote for these guys?” Then Sarvis’s voice:

“Like you, I can’t vote for Ken Cuccinelli’s narrow-minded social agenda. I want a Virginia that’s open-minded and welcoming to all. And like you, I don’t want Terry McAuliffe’s cronyism either, where government picks winners and losers. Join me, and together we can build a Virginia that’s open-minded and open for business.”

McAuliffe is an enthusiast for, and has prospered from, government “investments” in preferred industries, which is a recipe for crony capitalism. Cuccinelli is a stern social conservative, an opponent of, among other things, gay marriage. Marriage equality interests Sarvis (whose mother is Chinese) because his wife is African American, so his marriage would have been illegal in Virginia before the exquisitely titled 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia .

Sarvis, who is 37 and may look that old in a decade or so, graduated from Harvard with a mathematics degree, earned a law degree from New York University and clerked in Mississippi for a judge on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. After a spell as a mathematics graduate student at Berkeley, Sarvis worked for a San Francisco tech startup, then earned a master’s degree in economics at George Mason University. In 2011, he ran as a Republican against the state Senate majority leader, a 31-year incumbent. Outspent 72-to-1, Sarvis got 36 percent of the vote.

He must scrounge for media attention because he fares poorly in polls that reinforce the judgment that he is not newsworthy. But he is.

William Buckley won only 13.4 percent of the 1965 mayoralty vote, but he energized a growing constituency and legitimized the practice of voting outside the confines of traditional political choices. Five years later, the New York Conservative Party’s U.S. Senate candidate — Buckley’s brother Jim — was elected with 38.8 percent of the vote in a three-way race.

Third-party candidacies are said to be like bees — they sting, then die. Still, Sarvis is enabling voters to register dissatisfaction with the prevailing political duopoly. Markets are information-generating mechanisms, and Virginia’s political market is sending, through Sarvis, signals to the two durable parties.

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/21/1210663/-Yes-Obama-can-win-a-third-term,2013-05-21 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']","Yes, Obama can win a third term","This is an RWNJ fantasy/nightmare scenario, but one worth flogging for exactly that reason. Amidst the Republicans calling for Obama's resignation, there is a certain obliviousness to the constitutional implications of it. The Twenty-Second Amendment says: ""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once."" Now, this might seem to settle it for Obama, having been ""elected to the office of the President"" twice.

Except, what if he wasn't? Republicans already believe that the 2012 election was stolen in half a dozen states. If that were the case, then it would theoretically be possible for Obama to resign from office on January 19, 2015 -- just shy of the two year mark of his second term -- and concede that he was not really 'elected' to that term, and therefore had really only served one full term, and half of ""a term to which some other person was elected."" In the meantime, Joe Biden would finish out Obama's lame duck term, and Obama would be lauded as the hero of the ongoing economic recovery, and would coast to the presidency in 2016.

Obama could even resign in secret, conveying this resignation to Joe Biden, who would legally become the President, but under his executive authority could allow Obama to continue serving as a figurehead, living in the White House and giving press conferences and such. The Republicans would not know what hit them until the primary filing deadlines. Obama could even skip the early deadlines for Iowa and New Hampshire, assured as he would be of winning the primaries, if the Republican focus on certain other Democratic candidates weakens their political standing or dissuades them from running.

But for any actual RWNJs reading this, you can relax. Barack Obama is too honest, too honorable, and too great a man to try and bend or break the Constitution to hold onto the Presidency."
http://news.yahoo.com/scs-graham-shows-limits-tea-party-intimidation-185606487--election.html,,[],SC's Graham shows limits of tea party intimidation,"WASHINGTON (AP) — To gauge the limits of the tea party's ability to frighten re-election-seeking Republicans into a rightward panic, spend time with Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

One day he's blasting tea party hero Rand Paul on the Senate floor, calling the Kentucky senator's 13-hour filibuster — which criticized U.S. drone policy — wrong-headed and ""ill-informed.""

Another day Graham is at a groundbreaking ceremony in Greer, S.C., mixing jokes and politics in a fashion even his enemies have to admire. Citing a January CBS News poll showing Congress' approval rating at 12 percent, he asked: ""Who are the 12 percent, and what do they like?""

Three years ago, South Carolina Republican clubs were condemning Graham, calling him too moderate and too willing to cooperate with President Barack Obama and other Democrats. Nikki Haley, now the state's governor, supported the censures. Graham seemed a prime candidate for the type of tea-party-backed insurrections that ousted GOP senators in Utah and Indiana, and prompted other senators to steer hard right to save their jobs.

Today, even his critics say Graham is on track to win a third Senate term next year.

""His approval numbers are pretty high,"" said Lin Bennett, executive director of the Charleston County Republican Party, one of two major groups that censured Graham three years ago for supporting a bank bailout and for being too accommodating on immigration.

""He offers great constituent services,"" Bennett said. ""One unhappy county isn't enough.""

Graham calls himself a proud conservative. But he makes no apologies for sometimes seeking compromise with Democrats, which some tea partyers consider villainy.

""How do we get out of this mess?"" Graham asked the Greer crowd, referring to the nation's economic troubles. ""The same way the country has survived and thrived for the last 200 years: find common ground. Try to find a way to make everybody a winner instead of everybody a loser.""

Story continues

Graham's bipartisan talk contrasts with the recent tones of Senate Republican leaders Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Cornyn. Both men face possible GOP primary challenges from the right next year, and they have sharpened their criticisms of Democrats.

Graham didn't pass judgment on fellow Republicans. But he said politicians needn't kowtow to ideological groups if they visit their home districts regularly and explain their positions forthrightly.

""I've been fortunate enough to be judged by the body of my work,"" he said in an interview in his Senate office. ""I don't worry obsessively about my political re-election. And I've become a very good senator. If you don't overly worry about losing, you become hard to beat.""

All politicians and states are different, so Graham's lessons and luck may not apply elsewhere. But by any measure he's folksier and friendlier than the standoffish McConnell. He's far more visible in his home state than was Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, defeated in last year's GOP primary. And he seems unlikely to be caught off guard by hard-right insurgencies, as were Republican senators in recent years in Utah and Alaska.

Graham ""is a ferocious campaigner, especially when he gets back home,"" said Katon Dawson, a former South Carolina Republican Party chairman and a major Graham fundraiser. ""Lindsey doesn't have a lot of hobbies."" The Senate and politics are ""a lifestyle, and he works hard,"" Dawson said.

Some South Carolina tea partyers still hope to challenge Graham in next year's primary. But they lost perhaps their best prospect when state Sen. Tom Davis — a libertarian-leaning former top aide to Gov. Mark Sanford — declined to run.

Another state senator, Lee Bright of Spartanburg, might try. Graham's criticisms of Paul's filibuster ""kind of pushed me over the edge,"" Bright said.

But some South Carolinians see Bright as a fringe candidate.

Meanwhile, Graham has a formidable campaign fund of more than $4 million and rising. Assuming Graham survives the GOP primary, as expected, he is ""completely bullet proof"" in a general election against a Democrat, Dawson said.

Non-South Carolinians might be amused to hear Republicans debate whether Graham is conservative enough. Four years before being elected to the Senate he was one of 13 House managers for President Bill Clinton's impeachment. He sharply criticizes Obama at times, calling presidential budget plans ""a road map to disaster.""

Like his pal and mentor Arizona Sen. John McCain, however, Graham often carves an independent path. Despite conservative attacks on Republican senators who have voted to confirm Obama's judicial nominees, Graham says presidents should get their choices barring something that's clearly disqualifying.

""I don't know how to construct a world where we get all of our judges, and they never get any of theirs,"" he said.

Graham says he would consider higher tax revenues in exchange for serious changes to Medicare and Social Security. He says immigration reform must include a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Both stands are anathema to many conservative activists.

Graham most recently drew their fire for joining McCain in denouncing Paul's highly publicized filibuster. Paul — a libertarian Republican weighing a presidential bid — demanded White House assurances that unmanned aircraft will not be used to kill American citizens on U.S. soil and not engaged in combat.

Graham called the question groundless and defended Obama's use of deadly drones against terrorist suspects overseas. He shrugged off the resulting torrent of angry tweets and e-mails, saying he and Paul get along fine.

""Rand and I play golf together,"" Graham said. They differ on surveillance and other anti-terrorism policies, he said, ""but these differences have been around forever in the Republican Party.""

Graham supports a ""big-tent"" GOP, which is disdained by those conservatives who say Republicans have become too wishy-washy and too willing to compromise.

""Partisan ideas, on big issues, never fare well over time,"" he said. He cited Obama's embattled overhaul of health care as an example.

As for the nation's economic challenges, he said, ""the path off the road to becoming Greece is a shared path.""

If the Republican Party is to thrive, Graham said, it must have ""tea party libertarians, tea party conservatives, married up with traditional Republicans. That's the coalition of the future.""

So far, most South Carolina Republicans seem disinclined to punish him for that vision.

""I'm not going to worry about how Chris was doing what he thought was best for the people of his state,"" Romney said. ""I lost my election because of my campaign, not because of what anyone else did.""

Romney, meanwhile, called his ""47 percent"" comment, in which he said at a private fundraiser that nearly half the country was reliant on government services and thus wouldn't vote for him, ""very harmful.""

""What I said is not what I believe,"" he said. ""Obviously, my whole campaign -- my whole life has been devoted to helping people, all of the people. I care about all the people of the country. But that hurt. There's no question that hurt and did real damage to my campaign.""

Romney and his wife, Ann, both said that they nonetheless thought they were going to win on Election Day.

“We were convinced that we would win,"" he said. ""We saw that the polls were close. But we knew that the energy and passion was with out voters, and my heart said we were going to win.”

Romney said his opinion changed when exit polls in Florida showed a close race -- his campaign expected to win there easily -- and that he knew he had lost by 8 or 9 o'clock that evening.

Ann Romney confirmed reports that she cried when they realized they had lost: ""I did, of course. Yeah. Very disappointed.”

She said she's not completely over the loss, but that she's ""mostly"" over it. But it was also clear that she harbors hard feelings over the campaign. When host Chris Wallace asked whether President Obama ran a fair campaign, she didn't hesitate.

""No,"" she said. ""Portrayal of my husband... He is an exceptional, wonderful person.”

She added: “I’m like a she-lion when it comes to defending Mitt. … And I mourn the fact that he’s not (president).”

Romney said it ""kills"" him to not be president -- especially given the failure by Obama to reach a deal on the sequester.

""It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done,"" he said. ""The president is the leader of the nation. The president brings people together, does the deals, does the trades, knocks the heads together; the president leads. And I don't see that kind of leadership happening right now."""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/24/Club-for-Growth-Interview,2013-02-24 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],"Exclusive–Club for Growth: Culture of Senate Beginning to Change; Cruz, Lee, Paul Will 'Stand and Fight'","Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, told Breitbart News this weekend that establishment Republicans who have no qualms about growing the size of government and benefit from it find the fiscally conservative group to be a nuisance because the Club aggressively identifies conservatives and backs them in Republican primaries.

And when candidates the Club for Growth supports come to Washington, they often do not just “go along to get along,” especially when it comes to matters regarding taxes and spending.

Case in point: Ted Cruz.

In 2012, establishment Republicans like Karl Rove and American Crossroads preferred Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst over Ted Cruz in the Texas Republican Senate primary, with their donors backing Dewhurst against Cruz. It was the Club for Growth that helped Cruz counter the Rove-approved establishment money that was going to Dewhurst’s campaign in addition to Dewhurst’s considerable wealth, which he used to self-fund his failed Senate run. The Club for Growth spent $5.5 million in independent expenditure ads to support Cruz in his fight against Dewhurst. The group accounted for 83% of all pro-Cruz outside spending.

While Sarah Palin’s endorsement of Cruz ultimately got the attention of and galvanized Tea Partiers and conservatives to ensure Cruz got into the runoff against Dewhurst, the Club for Growth’s money ensured Cruz could stay on the air against Dewhurst in Texas’s huge and expensive media markets.

Rove, in stark contrast, said on Fox News’ “Hannity” after Cruz won the primary that Texas had “three good candidates” in that race, meaning Rove, unlike the Club for Growth, would have been perfectly content with the more moderate candidates like Dewhurst who would not fight in Washington, D.C.

Last year, the group emphasized that it committed “to do everything within our power to ensure Cruz won the primary” and “went all in and it did so because it is absolutely critical to the future of our nation that we have a true fiscal conservative representing the state of Texas in the United States Senate.”

And that’s exactly what Cruz has done since arriving in Washington, D.C., voting against John Kerry to be the next Secretary of State and fiercely questioning President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel to the point where liberals have resorted to calling him a “McCarthyite.”

Chocola noted the Republican establishment often views the types of candidates the Club for Growth supports as “threats to the big-government status quo” that Republicans often help enable.

Chocola added that in part because of the group’s efforts, those in Congress are talking about “spending less money, not simply slowing the rate of growth of spending.”

The full interview with Chocola is below.

Breitbart News: Given the success of Club for Growth in supporting free market principles, policies and candidates, what do you make of the attacks–often behind closed doors–by establishment figures like Karl Rove and Haley Barbour regarding your involvement in Republican primaries?

Chris Chocola: We’re not surprised at all. The Republican establishment has always viewed the types of candidates supported by our PAC as threats to the big-government status quo that the GOP often helps enable. We’ll continue to support candidates like Ted Cruz, Pat Toomey and Marco Rubio. They’ll continue to support candidates like David Dewhurst, Arlen Specter, and Charlie Crist. It’s that simple.

Breitbart News: What are Club for Growth’s key objectives for 2013?

Chris Chocola: We want to continue to grow the pro-growth caucus by supporting strong, fiscally conservative candidates through our PAC. We are hoping that the candidates the PAC has helped elect are helping to drive the agenda within the Republican Party. We’ll be watching closely to see if Republicans stand strong on sequestration and the continuing resolution. We’ll be urging them to cut spending and put us on a path to a balanced budget within 10 years. The whole purpose of the Club for Growth is to encourage policies that lead to a high-growth economy, and we’re very concerned that our growing debt burden and uncertainty about our economic future is holding us back. All we’ve ever wanted from Congress is responsible behavior, and we think that message is beginning to percolate throughout capitol hill. For the first time in a long time, members of Congress are talking about spending less money, not simply slowing the rate of growth of spending. That’s a sea-change, and we’re looking to build on that momentum.

Breitbart News: When you look at specific policy proposals–such as those dealing with the debt ceiling, the deficit, the fiscal cliff, and federal spending in general–do you think the Club is winning the war of war of ideas among the Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Chris Chocola: We take pride in our ability to advocate for free markets and limited government, but it’s really the new members we’ve helped elect through our PAC that are driving policy. It’s because of members of Congress like Jeff Flake and Pat Toomey that earmarks are banned. It’s because of members like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Mike Lee that the culture of the Senate is beginning to change. We supported those members and others because of what they believe, and they will stand and fight for their principles. Our goal is to get a majority of the majority. We’re not there yet, but the changes that have happened within the Republican Party on policy over the past decade because of the Club for Growth and its members is undeniably positive."

President Barack Obama had several pages of cohesive one-liners during his White House Correspondents' Dinner Speech Saturday night. He took aim at Rush Limbaugh and Republicans, as is his habit, but he (and many others) also singled out CNN and MSNBC.

Swaggering up to the podium to the sound of rap music, he began: ""Rush Limbaugh warned you about this -- second term baby, we're changing things around here a little bit...""

He touched on how the second term, though, is somewhat more tiring. ""I'm not the strapping young Muslim socialist that I used to be..."" he joked.

The president said at one point he was so desperate to quell the never-ending controversy he decided to use one of ""Michelle's tricks."" At that point, a number of images of President Obama flashed on the screen, all with prominent bangs PhotoShopped onto the forehead.

Switching gears, Obama turned to the media. Of CNN, he said: ""I admire their commitment to cover all sides of the story -- just in case one of them happens to be accurate!""

He continued: ""David Axelrod now works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod. The History channel is not here, I guess they were embarrassed about that whole, 'Obama is a devil thing,' of course that didn't keep Fox News from showing up...""

After joking about how Buzzfeed used to be ""something I did in college around 2 a.m,"" Obama recognized the press' preference for him over his competitors.

""My job is to be president, your job is to keep me humble -- frankly I think I'm doing my job better,"" he said.

After joking about the election and how Sheldon Adelson would've been better off offering him $100 million to drop out than spending it on attack ads, the president said he's already planning his legacy.

Story continues

In lieu of a library, he's going to build another ""edifice"" next to the George W. Bush presidential library. A giant billboard pointing to it saying, ""His Fault.""

President Obama closed on a more somber note, saying ""these have been some very hard days for too many of our citizens...[but] even when the days seem darkest, we have seen humanity shine at its brightest. We have seen first respondents and national guardsmen who dashed into danger, law enforcement officers who served their oath to serve and protect, Americans opening their homes and their hearts to perfect strangers...""

He urged everyone in the room to do more for ""all those folks who are counting on us.""

(CNN) —

If you listen to the groupthink echo-chamber know-it-alls in Washington, the Republican Party has been decimated, destroyed, discombobulated and utterly distressed to the point of putting a “going out of business” sign out front and closing up shop for good.

Reality says that’s ridiculous.

On the national level, the GOP controls the U.S. House of Representatives while Democrats control the U.S. Senate and the Oval Office.

CNN Roland Martin

But the real power for the Republicans is on the state level, and there they are dominating Democrats.

Republicans control the governor’s mansion in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

Folks, that’s 30 out of the 50 states in the nation. The Democrats have governors in 19 states. (Rhode Island’s governor is an independent.)

What about both chambers on the state level? The GOP controls the legislature in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

Count ‘em up and that’s 26. The Democrats control 18 legislatures. Five of the remaining six are split between the two chambers and one has a nonpartisan, one-chamber legislature.

So much of the national media attention is always focused on what’s happening in Washington, but that is a common mistake that the political bosses keep making. Every Sunday show on broadcast and cable parades the usual suspects from the U.S. Senate and sometimes a few influential U.S. House members, but it would make far more sense to be talking to governors, key state officials and mayors for a real understanding of what’s happening in America.

The GOP has been doing a lot of soul-searching and head-scratching since Mitt Romney was pummeled by President Barack Obama in November. Republican Party leaders are being told that they must soften their stance on gay and lesbian issues, flip the script on immigration reform, stop dissing women at every turn, and become more “compassionate” – like George W. Bush when he was selling his candidacy in 2000.

On Monday, the Republican National Committee announced its 2012 election postmortem, which called for, among other things, an aggressive new push to reach minorities in the states.

Meanwhile, Democrats are giddy, believing they have found a winning formula for the next generation by turning out young folks, gay and lesbian folks, black voters, Latino voters and lots of women. Sure, that coalition worked well for Obama, but there is no guarantee it will be the key to success for the next Democratic presidential candidate.

So while Democrats salivate at the prospect of winning the White House in 2016, Republicans continue to lay the groundwork for taking over the state houses and gubernatorial mansions, and building a formidable team of next-generation politicians to dominate there and in the White House.

In fact, many Republicans have told me they couldn’t care less about Washington, because legislation with real impact is being proposed and passed in the states. That’s why you’ve seen groups quietly backing initiatives on the state level and bypassing the hot lights and screaming media in Washington.

The real battles on same-sex marriage, abortion, education, spending, labor unions, and, yes, the Affordable Care Act are happening state by state. And Democrats are being caught flat-footed because they ignored the admonition of former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean to create a 50-state party, and instead, created a party that cared more about Congress and the White House.

Think about it: Obama won Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Nevada, all states with GOP governors. So clearly voters in those states chose the Republican alternative in statewide elections, but when it came to the presidency, said “No thanks.”

I’m not buying for a second this silly notion that the GOP will have a Damascus Road experience and drastically change. It’s not going to happen. There will be some movement on the national level, but Republican grass-roots organizers are very well aware that the message the GOP is selling statewide is a winning formula.

Trust me, Republicans are concocting other pieces of legislation to bring change on the state level, regardless of what’s happening in Washington.

The political adage “All politics is local” has not changed.

Maybe more of my brothers and sisters in Washington need to get outside the Beltway, hit the road and discover the far more expansive America that is happening outside Washington, Maryland, Virginia, New York and New Jersey. If they do, they’ll find out that the conventional wisdom is pretty much worthless."
http://news.yahoo.com/top-talent-lined-obamas-inaugural-events-110217473--politics.html,,[],Top talent lined up for Obama's inaugural events,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is drawing an A-list of performers for his inaugural festivities, including a massive ball expected to draw more than 35,000 revelers.

Katy Perry, Smokey Robinson, Usher, Alicia Keys and Brad Paisley are among the stars announced Friday to sing at Obama's inaugural balls Jan. 21 and a children's concert on Jan. 19. Also signed up are Marc Anthony, Stevie Wonder, John Legend and the cast of ""Glee.""

The concert and the two official inaugural balls are being held at the Washington Convention Center over the Martin Luther King holiday weekend when Obama begins his second term. The performers join Beyonce, Kelly Clarkson and James Taylor, already announced for Obama's signing ceremony Jan. 21 on the West Front of the Capitol.

Other event performers include pop-rap foursome Far East Movement, Grammy-nominated pop-rock trio fun., R&B boy band Mindless Behavior, rapper Nick Cannon and youth gospel choir Soul Children of Chicago. Inaugural organizers aren't saying yet which performances will be at which convention center event.

Robinson told The Associated Press he'll be at The Inaugural Ball with his own band, but he isn't sure yet which songs he'll sing. Robinson said he's always happy to perform when the president asks because he's so proud of the first family.

""I've been in the White House many, many, many times for many presidents and this is the first time for me that it's really felt like when I go to the White House or something like that, it feels like you're going to your family's,"" Robinson said. ""It feels like you're going home because that's how they treat me and that's how they treat my wife.""

While Obama has cut the number of inaugural balls lower than any president since Dwight Eisenhower was first sworn into office in 1953, the two celebrations will be elaborate. The larger of the events, simply called The Inaugural Ball, is expected to draw more than 35,000 in a reflection of the quadrennial demand in Washington to toast the president in person on such a historic day.

Story continues

The Inaugural Ball is being held across all 700,000 square feet of the Washington Convention Center's five exhibit halls, which four years ago held six separate balls.

The second gala is the Commander In Chief's Ball, a tradition started by President George W. Bush to honor the military. Doubling in size from four years ago to about 4,000, it's being held on the third-floor ballroom of the convention hall a mile from the White House. Tickets are free for invitees, including active-duty and reserve troops, Medal of Honor recipients and wounded warriors.

Demand has been high for entry to the two official affairs. Inaugural planners offered a limited number of tickets to The Inaugural Ball for sale at $60, and they sold out quickly Sunday night when Ticketmaster accidentally sent out an email ahead of time announcing they were available. Inaugural organizers are trying to stop a swift scalping business for the tickets, which have been cropping up for sale online.

That's even though city officials are predicting a drop in attendance to 600,000 to 800,000 for the inauguration this year compared with 2009, when a record 1.8 million crowded onto the National Mall to see the first black president sworn into office.

Those who can't get into the convention hall with the Obamas can still carouse into the night at several unofficial balls across Washington, including some drawing their own celebrity entertainment. Charity group Musicians On Call, when sends performers to play bedside for hospitalized patients, is being headlined by chart-topping singer Ke$ha.

Those who work for Obama will get their own chance to celebrate with the president, with a staff ball planned for the day after the inauguration. That celebration is kept private, but last year was reportedly quite a bash, according to one attendee, with rap star Jay-Z singing a riff on one of his hit songs, ""99 problems but George Bush ain't one,"" to the delight of the throngs of young staffers who worked so hard to turn the White House Democratic.

More tickets to The Inaugural Ball will be on sale, but not to the general public. They will go to campaign volunteers, community leaders, elected officials and other invitees, as well as donors being asked to contribute up to $250,000 individually or $1 million from corporations to pay for the festivities. Invitees will be sent an email in the next few days with personalized Ticketmaster account information they can use to purchase up to two tickets.

The Inaugural Ball's halls extend across two floors, so the president and first lady plan to spin on the dance floor of each level. At the Commander In Chief's Ball, the president and first lady plan to continue the tradition of dancing with members of the military.

Inaugural planners said the cut in the number of balls was to reflect tough economic times and minimize the burden on law enforcement, other security personnel and Washington residents. But could it also be an effort to give the president some relief from having to dance to the same song over and over again all across town on an already exhausting day?

President George W. Bush didn't hide his annoyance after his second inaugural at having to repeatedly sashay around to a musical medley that included ""I Could Have Danced All Night."" Could have, but did not: He and first lady Laura Bush danced for a cumulative total of just 8 minutes, 54 seconds across 10 galas.

(CNN) – Another member of the Bush family is making a bid for office in Texas.

George P. Bush, the eldest son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, filed paperwork in the Lone Star State to run for land commissioner, a post that's seen as a jumping-off point for more prominent statewide office.



""If you believe, as I do, that Texas is truly an exceptional place with a rich heritage and a future of unbound potential, then I ask for your support as I run for Texas Land commissioner in 2014,"" Bush said in the two minute, forty-five second spot.

In the video, he discusses traveling all over Texas in the last few months, weighing a decision about running for office. He said there was one person in particular who truly inspired him.

""You probably know her as former first lady Barbara Bush, but to me she's just Ganny. The lesson Ganny taught me? The importance of public service, and I have tried to live up to those values,"" he said.

He mentions his time teaching at a public high school, helping organizations like Big Brothers and Big Sisters in North Texas and serving in the naval reserve.

""I am again constantly reminded that as Texans, we are exceptional people,"" he said.

As land commissioner, he vowed to address issues involving veterans affairs, education funding, energy policy, natural resources, coastline problems, and historical archives.

The land commissioner in Texas is responsible for state-owned land and mineral rights, and is regarded as a stepping stone for higher statewide office. The current lieutenant governor of Texas, David Dewhurst, previously served as land commissioner.

""Texas Land Commissioner is a great fit for George P. Bush,"" Austin-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak said, pointing to Bush's experience in education and his military service, which included a deployment to Afghanistan.

""He will likely escape a serious primary, while raising significant money, helping down ballot candidates, growing the Republican Party and building his own statewide organization. His future in Texas is very bright,"" Mackowiak said.

Bush, who first filed documents with the Texas Ethics Commission to run for office in November, co-founded the group Hispanic Republicans of Texas, billed as the first Texas-based political action committee that recruits Hispanic candidates for political office. His mother hails from Mexico.

Bush has deep ties to Texas - his uncle George W. Bush served as governor before being elected president, and the younger Bush attended Rice University and the University of Texas School of Law.

He hit the trail as a top surrogate for George W. Bush during both of his presidential campaigns, though earlier this year said he had ""no specific plans"" to run for office.

A Texas conservative activist, who asked to remain anonymous so as to speak candidly, said the land commission post was a ""slam dunk"" for Bush.

""Remember, he supported [Conservative senator] Ted Cruz early and took a risk there. He's considered to be more conservative than his grandpa and uncle W. I doubt anyone will even pose a real challenge,"" the activist said.

Christine Quinn, the current Speaker of the House in New York, runs first with 26 percent of the vote; Weiner follows with 15 percent. While Nate Silver of the New York Times suggests that this number is actually limp for Weiner, given his 100 percent name recognition, it still gives him a leg up on the rest of the crowd.

It’s no coincidence that Weiner is now preparing to get on his hands and knees before the public in New York. As USA Today reports, Weiner says “I think I’ll be spending a lot of time, here on out, saying I’m sorry.”

Weiner and his wife Huma are plastered on the new cover of the New York Times Magazine. He still refuses to answer questions about his tweet scandal. But it’s clear he understands he’s got to get the monkey of the story off his back, or he’ll take a spanking at the ballot box. He says, “I have been excruciatingly honest, in letter by letter, detail by detail, with my wife. An embarrassing amount is in the public domain … But out of respect for the idea that I’ve laid it all out for her and out of some respect for the privacy of the people who were at the other end of these correspondences, who had their lives turned upside down, I am not going to go into the details of every bit of it.”

Respect for his own possible mayoral run is more like it. He’s relying on his new book, Keys to the City, to carry him to victory. According to Weiner, the penis apparently mightier than the rhetorical sword.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']","Charlotte, N.C., mayor expected to be nominated for Cabinet","WASHINGTON -- President Obama will nominate Charlotte, N.C., Mayor Anthony Foxx as the new secretary of Transportation on Monday, a White House official said.

If confirmed, Foxx would take charge of a department that has been in the spotlight of late because of flight delays associated with furloughs of air traffic controllers. Last week, under pressure from inconvenienced travelers, Congress passed legislation allowing the Federal Aviation Administration – part of the Transportation Department -- to halt the furloughs, which are related to $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts.

Foxx would become the third African American in Obama’s Cabinet, joining Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice.

The current Transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, had announced his resignation in January, effective upon his replacement’s confirmation.

Foxx, a 41-year-old lawyer, was in the national spotlight last summer as the host of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte.

During his tenure as Charlotte mayor, the White House official said, Foxx improved transit infrastructure, including the groundbreaking of an electric streetcar project. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity ahead of the administration’s official announcement.

Foxx served in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division during the latter part of the Clinton administration, and he later served on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee. He was first elected mayor in 2009.

He was seen as having aspirations for higher office, but earlier this month, Foxx surprised much of his city when he announced he would not run for reelection. He said then that he wanted to spend more time with his wife and two young children.

“I never intended to be mayor for life,” he told the Charlotte Observer.

The Charlotte mayor’s post is part-time; Foxx also works as a lawyer for the DesignLine Corp, a Charlotte-based maker of hybrid buses.

Among those reportedly considered for Transportation secretary was Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who announced in February that he would serve out his full mayoral term, which ends June 30.

Repeated national surveys have shown public support for the Republican Party tanking since GOP lawmakers banded together to shut down the federal government and bring the U.S. to the brink of financial default.

On a more personal level, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, one of the highest-profile supporters of the impasse, has seen his appproval ratings plunge at home—a conservative stronghold that delivered President Obama a mere 25% of the vote in 2012.

Now, in a rare statement of second thoughts, the hometown newspaper of Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has expressed its regrets for endorsing him a year ago. Cruz was one of the chief architects of the impasse.

“Does anyone else miss Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison?” asked the Houston Chronicle editorial board, citing the three-term U.S. senator whom Cruz replaced. “We’re not sure how much difference one person could make in the toxic, chaotic, hyperpartisan atmosphere in Washington, but if we could choose just one it would be Hutchison, whose years of service in the Senate were marked by two things sorely lacking in her successor, Ted Cruz.”

FULL COVERAGE: The U.S. government shutdown

Those, the editorial said were a focus on Texas’ interests in Washington and a willingness to reach across the aisle and work with Democrats.

“When we endorsed Ted Cruz in last November’s general election, we did so with many reservations and at least one specific recommendation - that he follow Hutchison’s example in his conduct as a senator,” the editorial board stated. “Obviously, he has not done so. Cruz has been part of the problem in specific situations where Hutchison would have been part of the solution.”

Cruz upset Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the favorite of the GOP establishment, in last year’s Republican primary. Dewhurst was backed by the Chronicle in that race, which may somewhat soften the blow of its recantation(Cruz may point out he was, after all, the paper’s second choice).

Then there’s this: Cruz, like Lee, is not up for reelection for several years.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/20/State-Rep-Joe-Carr-Will-Challenge-Lamar-Alexander-in-TN-GOP-Senate-Primary,2013-08-20 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],State Rep Joe Carr Will Challenge Lamar Alexander in TN GOP Senate Primary,"State Representative Joe Carr announced on Ralph Bristol’s Nashville talk radio program on Tuesday that he is a candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. Carr will compete against incumbent Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) in the party’s August 2014 primary. Bristol had promised his listeners on Monday that someone would make a “major announcement” that will “alter the Tennessee political landscape,” and at 7:10 in the morning Joe Carr delivered on that promise.

“I am announcing as a candidate for the United State Senate,” Carr told Bristol.

Carr left no doubt with whom he will stand in the Senate. “Conservatives deserve a clear voice in this election, and conservative champions like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul need a strong ally from Tennessee in the US Senate.” Carr told Bristol.

In a statement released by the campaign as he announced on Bristol’s program, Carr said, “I will advance the conservative movement in Washington. I will fight for the Constitution and the first principles that made our country great: personal responsibility, individual liberty, and limited government. I will stand firm in defense of the 2nd amendment and insure that life of the unborn have a strong and vocal advocate.”

Carr blasted incumbent Republican Senator Lamar Alexander’s voting record. “Lamar Alexander has failed to advance the conservative movement and change Washington,” he charged, then hit the 73 year old Alexander on three main issues. “He voted for amnesty for 11 million illegals, supported funding Obamacare and rubber stamped Obama’s appointments to cabinet level positions and the Supreme Court. Voting with President Obama 62% of the time is unacceptable.”

A Triton Poll released on Sunday in an exclusive Breitbart story showed that Senator Alexander trails a generic “credible conservative” challenger by 5 points, 49% to 44%. Carr’s announcement on Tuesday puts an established name and face to that challenger for the first time. Bristol asked Carr if the results of that poll influenced his decision to challenge Alexander. “It confirmed what we knew. Lamar is popular, but there is a disconnect between the way he votes and what Tennesseans want.”

“If Lamar Alexander is voting with Barack Hussein Obama 62% of the time, he’s voting against Tennesseans 62% of the time,” Carr told Bristol.

As a state representative, where he is the co-founder of the Tenth Amendment Caucus, Carr has gained a reputation as a conservative firebrand. He is expected to join announced candidate Brenda Lenard and potential candidate Kevin Kookogey at an August 31 BEAT LAMAR Forum in Nashville.

Well respected conservative businessman Lee Beaman, who owns several large automobile dealerships in Middle Tennessee, will be Carr’s state campaign chairman. In a statement released by the campaign as Carr announced, Beaman said that “from the beginning, several of us . . . urged Rep. Carr to run for the US Senate. He led the fight to curb illegal immigration, abolish the death tax and protect the 2nd amendment, and we know he’ll lead from the front and change Washington.”

Before announcing for the Senate, Carr withdrew from the Fourth Congressional District race. With Carr’s departure from that race, incumbent Republican Congressman Scott Desjarlais, first elected in 2010 but beset by personal issues and weak fundraising, now faces only one major challenger, State Senator Jim Tracy. Carr currently represents a Rutherford County district in the Tennessee General Assembly.

Carr noted that his move to the Senate race is in response to widespread support for his own challenge to Senator Alexander. “Since I first announced my congressional exploratory committee eight months ago I have received literally hundreds and hundreds of requests from Tennesseans asking me to run for the US Senate instead of the US House. Tennesseans are hungry for strong, principled, conservative leadership, so I am answering the call.”

Carr sounded like a man prepared for a long and tough political battle. “I have no illusions. This is David versus Goliath. But I have extraordinary faith in my fellow Tennesseans. They will see through the spin and the rhetoric and recognize they have a clear choice to elect a conservative fighter. I will work tirelessly, and I will give my all for Tennessee.”

Carr enters the Senate race able to use the $275,000 he has in his Congressional campaign committee. With Beaman and other conservative Tennessee donors backing him, Carr is positioned to raise enough money to mount a serious challenge to the well financed Alexander.

Carr’s in-studio announcement on Bristol’s program was the first time in Tennessee political history that a major politician announced their candidacy for the United States Senate on a talk radio program.

Rep. Carr, a 1981 graduate of Middle Tennessee State University, is a business consultant who helps companies become more energy efficient. Additionally, he and his wife Ginny own and operate Cedar Snag Farms in Lascassas.?He was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 2008 and currently serves as Chairman of the Local Government subcommittee. He is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, a member of the National Federation of Independent Business, Tennessee Right to Life, Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce and the MTSU Blue Raider Athletic Association. He is also an accomplished private pilot and member of the Aircraft Owners & Pilot Association."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-and-bush-poll-numbers-nearly-identical-five-years-into-presidency-214919924.html,,[],"Five years in, Obama and Bush poll numbers nearly identical","When President Obama first ran for the White House in 2008, it was with the promise to turn the page on the presidency of George W. Bush. But for all their political differences, it turns out the American public pretty much view the two men in the same light, according to new polling data.



In the first week of November in the fifth year of their presidencies, Obama and Bush have nearly identical approval numbers, according to the latest Gallup polling.

In fact, Bush comes out one point ahead, 40 percent to 39 percent, respectively.

The Gallup daily tracking poll for November 5th 2013 puts Obama’s approval at 39 percent, with 53 percent disapproving of his job performance.

By comparison, polling for the first week of November in 2005 had Bush’s approval at 40 percent, with 55 percent disapproving of his job performance.

And the negative comparison to Bush’s numbers is potentially worse for Obama than just a tough headline.

As former Bush adviser Matthew Dowd said on ABC’s “This Week,” the real damage lies in the fact that historically low approval numbers often constrain a president’s ability to rebound with the public.

“I think what you have right now is you talked about the floor of the president's approval numbers, which are almost exactly where President Bush's were. Every time you establish a new floor, you establish a new ceiling,” Dowd said.

Noting that Bush’s approval free fall “wasn’t all about Katrina,” Dowd said Obama faces a similar assault from multiple fronts.

""The president's problems have been brewing for a while,” Dowd said. “What the Republican circus did was cover up a lot of the president's problems. That circus that went on with the Republicans for a while. And then once that was over, it revealed a deeper problem with the presidency.""

Of course, the most recent numbers don't guarantee that Obama's second term will end up mirroring Bush's, whose approval continued to fall to a low of 25 percent on three separate occasions before he left office. Still, they do place Obama in an interesting historical context when compared to how some other presidents have fared in the fifth year of their presidencies.

Story continues

Pulling back the curtain further to look at Obama’s approval rating during the 19th quarter of his presidency, Obama places 5th out of the last 8 presidents who served for the same length of time.



His quarterly Gallup approval rating of 44.5 percent places him ahead of Bush (43.9), Lyndon Johnson (41.8%) and Richard Nixon (31.8%). But Obama falls behind Bill Clinton (58.8%), Ronald Reagan (61.3%) Dwight Eisenhower (59.5%) and even Harry Truman (45%).

What might be most striking to Obama supporters is to compare the various challenges faced by Bush and Obama at this point in their respective presidencies. In the fall of 2005, Bush was reeling from fallout of Hurricane Katrina and arguably the low-point of the Iraq War. And while he had successfully won re-election against John Kerry, his approval rating had dropped 13 points from 53 percent since the November 2004 election.

In contrast, Obama has dealt with the continuing drag of a sluggish economy, partisan divisions, which led to a government shutdown, criticism over National Security Administration spying accusations and the recent fallout over problems associated with the launch of the Affordable Care Act.

And as a result of those challenges, Obama has experienced a nearly identical polling drop as Bush, falling a statistically identical 13 points from his approval ratings of 52 percent on election day in November, 2012 .

Of course, nothing is set in stone. Unforeseen events could restore Obama’s approval ratings: The economy could improve, the 2014 midterm elections could boost Obama’s standing and early setbacks of the Affordable Care Act could recede.

But if recent history is any indicator, Obama is likely to find himself in some unexpected and unwanted company – that of an unpopular president he was elected to replace."

He Also Reported The White House']",From the Archives: How the 2003 gubernatorial recall changed California,"SACRAMENTO — Ten years ago, California erupted in an anti-government, anti-establishment convulsion unlike any ever seen.

Disgruntled voters seized the chance for a rare do-over, recalling their staid and serious governor, Gray Davis, and replacing him less than a year after his reelection with one of the most famous and exuberant personalities on the planet. It was only the second time in U.S. history a sitting governor was booted from office.

The spectacle — a snap election featuring a color wheel of 135 candidates, including a former child actor, a porn star and a handful of professional politicians — shook California from its usual political slumber and captivated an audience that watched from around the world.

A decade on, the effects are still being felt, albeit subtly, and not the way proponents imagined, or the way actor-turned-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the chief beneficiary, so grandly promised.

Fundamental changes in the way California elects its leaders — a top-two primary system aimed at pushing candidates to the ideological center and an impartial redrawing of the state’s political boundaries — will almost certainly change how Sacramento operates for years to come. Neither would likely have passed without Schwarzenegger sitting in the governor’s office.

The upheaval helped deliver the state its current governor, Jerry Brown, a decades-long officeholder and scion of California’s great political dynasty, whose worn-shoe familiarity appealed to voters in part because he was so unlike the upstart Schwarzenegger.

Less tangible, but also important, many say the historic election heightened awareness of state government and gave Californians a greater sense of empowerment, even if it failed to extinguish the flickering animosity toward Sacramento. For good or ill, the recall served notice on California’s political class, and still looms as a threat over all those holding elective office.

“There’s been a lot of momentum around fiscal and governance reform, particularly in the past five years,” said Mark Baldassare, head of the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank. “The desire to make changes started with the recall but didn’t end with the recall.”

Still, in many ways the special election proved a failure, especially measured against supporters’ exceedingly high hopes.

The October 2003 ouster of Davis, a Democrat, was a primal response to the gridlock, partisan warfare, overweening special interests and mushrooming budget deficits that made the state capital a slough of dysfunction. “It was about changing the entire political climate of our state,” as Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said in his first inaugural address.

When he left office more than seven years later — after sinking to the same abysmal poll ratings as Davis — the special interests were just as firmly entrenched in Sacramento, the partisan rancor was unabated and the budget deficit had more than doubled.

Among the most bitterly disappointed were those who had the greatest hand in forcing Davis from office and paving the path for Schwarzenegger’s election, which was sealed in a separate vote on the same ballot.

“There was no substantive nuts-and-bolts change to California government, which was one of the main goals,” said Ted Costa, the anti-tax crusader who launched the main petition drive that qualified the recall, sparking the brief, intense and sometimes zany campaign. Costa has largely retired from politics, owing partly to his frustration over the outcome of the recall.

That view overlooks Schwarzenegger’s significant achievements, including an overhaul of the worker’s compensation system, savings in welfare and healthcare programs, and meaningful pension and retirement concessions wrung from public employee unions.

He signed landmark legislation to fight global warming. Working with Democrats, Schwarzenegger also ushered the state into its most ambitious rebuilding program since the era of Brown’s father, who oversaw the infrastructure development that still serves California half a century later.

Those accomplishments pale, however, when laid against the extravagant promises made during the recall. Schwarzenegger vowed to slash the size of government, stop deficit spending and end the pay-to-play culture of Sacramento, which he captured with stark simplicity in a TV spot: “Money goes in. Favors go out. The people lose.”

None of those changes occurred, as Democratic, Republican and nonpartisan observers point out.

“In the larger sense of dramatically changing the direction of the state, we didn’t accomplish what we’d hoped and expected,” said Rob Stutzman, a GOP strategist who served as a Schwarzenegger spokesman during the recall.

Even the former governor has said he could and should have done more to address the structural problems — a boom-and-bust tax system, a crazy-quilt budgeting process — that continue to plague the state.

“It was a mistake,” Schwarzenegger said in an interview before leaving office in January 2011. Instead of borrowing to paper over the deficit and add to the state’s mountain of debt, he said, “I should’ve gone the other direction to early on solve the budget problem and use the political muscle I had that first year in office.”

Still, even some let down by Schwarzenegger consider the recall a good and healthy thing.

“Once they’re elected, politicians become so isolated,” said Dave Gilliard, whose political group, Rescue California, helped orchestrate the signature-gathering with a $2-million contribution from Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), who hoped to replace Davis but quit the race after Schwarzenegger got in. “Being mindful of their accountability to voters — that they can make changes — there’s nothing more American than that.”

It is highly unlikely anyone voted in October 2003 believing the result would be a top-two primary system aimed at weeding out extremists from the two major parties, or thinking Davis’ exit would mean an end to the self-interested drawing of political lines by sitting lawmakers. But those important structural reforms were enacted in good measure because Schwarzenegger, alone in the Capitol, was beholden to neither the Democratic nor Republican establishments (both of which opposed the ballot measures).

“He blew up the most important boxes of all,” suggested Susan Kennedy, a former Davis aide who served as chief of staff in Schwarzenegger’s second term, borrowing a line he used in the swaggering days after the recall. “That is changing the election system.”

Those changes, which have yet to be fully felt, may be the most important legacy of Schwarzenegger and the recall: If they work as proponents hope, Sacramento and Washington will eventually be populated with a breed of lawmaker less yoked to partisan interests and more amenable to compromise. That could be a big step toward solving the problems that sent angry Californians storming to the polls a decade ago.

Wisconsin was there once too.,"So I am overjoyed about what happened in Texas, not the least because it was so unexpected, and so....freaking great. I loved every minute of it, and can't tell you how happy I am to have a new Democratic hero in Wendy Davis.

I want to make this very clear, so people will understand what is in my heart as I write this diary. I watched the breathless news tonight on MSNBC, and I saw Kos's effort to draft MS. Davis to run for governor, and I'm all over it all.

But there was a part of me that felt SO sad too. I remember when Wisconsin's capitol was filled w/that kind of crowd for WEEKS ON END. I remember when Democrats and progressives in Wisconsin filled not only the rotunda of their capitol, but all the real estate they could in every direction OUTSIDE the capitol, for WEEKS ON END.

And most here at the DK, supported the effort, and it was thrilling. Then came the recall, and we lost. I could say why I think this happened, but it doesn't matter. It just did. And since then, despite all those thrilling hopeful days, things have only gotten worse in Wisconsin.

And one of the biggest ways that has happened, is the Wisconsin republican answer to seeing THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN, as long as they're in power. They have made endless laws to make sure of that. And now, what happened in Texas last night, will be very difficult for Wisconsin to match. It's crazy. Possible in Texas, almost impossible in Wisconsin.

Those of us caught up on the new laws and restrictions regarding what is allowable in the state house, and who can be there, and under what conditions, know how fast after the loss of the recall the GOP clamped down on seeing to it that nothing like the anti Walker uprising would happen again on their watch. I could go on for many paragraphs here telling you how specific and restrictive those new laws are. I could roll your socks back as to the totalitarian and successful cap the Wisconsin GOP has put on anything like what happened in Texas yesterday, and what happened in Wisconsin, week after week, at one time not so long ago.

Recently, the Republican Wisconsin legislature voted to pass a law similar to what was at stake in Texas. The ""gallery"" was highly restricted. Women w/tape over their mouths---to signify protest to the new rules of their being there---were told to remove the tape or be arrested. They removed the tape and covered their mouths w/their hands. Some Democrats in the chamber tried to shout their way into their right to be heard.

But in the end, Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling everyone to shut the fuck up, they would NOT be heard. This disgraceful behavior was shown here a bit on video, and God bless her, on Rachel Maddow's show. Other than that, crickets. The nation has left the story of Wisconsin behind. We tried, we lost, and journalism is not about losers.

I CHEER what happened in Texas yesterday with all my heart. BUT, beware of the media story on your side today. Because it can be gone tomorrow. And don't underestimate the response of republicans when they have been so challenged. I'll bet you the little money I have in the bank, that Texas too will soon have a bunch of laws that make it impossible for what happened yesterday to happen again. The only reason they aren't there now in Texas, is because what happened surprised the hell out of them. Don't doubt for a minute that they're gathered in back rooms as I write this, figuring out to make sure it never happens to them again.

I cheer every minute of attention Texas gets w/this, and I cheer Wendy Davis. I don't want it to go away. But I know it will. My message here is not about cynicism, or about ""don't bother."" IT. IS. NOT.

My message is that we are on the brink of so much in this country, and we have to find a way to stop letting them get away with this. And that means in Wisconsin too, no matter how gerrymandered it is. I frankly don't know how to do this. But I do know the answer is NOT to bow out from the fight in a heap of disappointment and anger. And I don't for a minute suggest that's what Wisconsin Democrats are doing. BUT, everything is so much harder for them now.

Wisconsin must find a way to rise again, and Texas must find a way to hold on to this win. And part of that is seeing what's coming. And I'm telling you what's coming in Texas. Somehow, some way, we must stop this. And that means we have to decide our priorities as Democrats. And there in lies the rub. And I have no answer for it."

""This just smells and I hope this committee gets to the bottom of it,"" John Eastman, chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, said at a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee.

Eastman testified Tuesday alongside several Tea Party activists who all claim they were targeted by the IRS. The Tea Party groups offered a first-hand account of how the IRS singled them out when they applied for tax-exempt status, asking them onerous questions and dragging out their application process.

But Eastman shed light on another potential controversy involving the IRS -- the unauthorized disclosure of tax document information. He recalled how information on their donors was leaked last year and published on the website of the Human Rights Campaign, which Eastman described as their ""principal political opponent"" on the marriage issue. The documents showed Mitt Romney's political committee as a donor.

Asked by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., if he had ""proof"" that the IRS leaked that material, Eastman said that he did.

More On This...

Eastman explained that while some information was redacted in the posted version, his group's ""forensic"" specialists were able to strip layers from the document and found ""the original document that was posted there had originated from within the IRS.""

He said the version had ""internal IRS stamps,"" which ""only exist within the IRS.""

Eastman added: ""You can imagine our shock and disgust over this. ... We jealously guard our donors.""

He later alleged the information was ""deliberately"" provided to their opponents.

""If that's inadvertent, the word no longer means anything,"" he said, claiming his group has been ""stonewalled"" in its request for an investigation.

After a series of hearings on Capitol Hill where current and former IRS officials testified on the agency's actions, this is the first to feature alleged victims.

Karen Kinney, with the San Fernando Valley Patriots, described how she got a form from the IRS with 35 items divided into 80 ""sub-points of inquiry,"" and was given just 20 days to comply.

The leader of a small South Carolina Tea Party group said her organization first applied for tax-exempt status in 2010 -- and is still waiting for the application to be processed.

Dianne Belsom, president of the Laurens County Tea Party, said her group in rural South Carolina has about 60 members.

For more than 18 months during the 2010 and 2012 election campaigns, IRS agents in a Cincinnati office singled out Tea Party and other conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they sought tax-exempt status, according to a report by J. Russell George, the Treasury Department inspector general for tax administration.

The report said Tea Party groups were asked inappropriate questions about their donors, their political affiliations and their positions on political issues. The additional scrutiny delayed applications for an average of nearly two years, making it difficult for many of the groups to raise money.

There was no way, this theory ran, that core Democratic constituencies would turn out at the same rates as in 2008, when Obamamania was at its peak. Instead, 2012 was set up to be what the conservative writer Ben Domenech called an “undertow election,” in which reduced turnout among young voters and minorities would drag the incumbent down to defeat.

This expectation turned out to be wrong on two counts. First, Republicans faced an unexpected (though in hindsight, predictable) undertow of their own, as many conservative-leaning, working-class white voters looked at what Mitt Romney had to offer and simply stayed home.

Second, instead of declining as expected after the history-making election of 2008, African-American turnout may have actually risen again in 2012. When the Census Bureau released its turnout analysis last month, it showed blacks voting at higher rates than whites for the first time in the history of the survey.

If you believe Chief Justice John Roberts Jr.’s more overheated liberal critics, last week’s Supreme Court decision invalidating a portion of the Voting Rights Act is designed to make sure African-American turnout never hits these highs again. The ruling will allow a number of (mostly Southern) states to change voting laws without the Justice Department’s pre-approval, which has liberals predicting a wave of Republican-led efforts to “suppress” minority votes — through voter ID laws, restrictions on early voting and other measures."

City Council a hot destination for former state legislators,"The Los Angeles City Council experienced its biggest transformation since 2001 this week, with six new members taking their seats — all but two after serving in the state Legislature.

With seven out of 15 members coming from Sacramento, the hand-over has solidified the council’s reputation as a destination for professional politicians. By the end of the month, an eighth former state lawmaker could take office, depending on the outcome of a special election.

Advertisement

The arrival of so many former state lawmakers can be attributed in large part to term limits, said Councilman Paul Koretz, a state assemblyman from 2000 to 2006. Term limits, in place at both the city and state level, were “sold as a way to get citizen politicians” into public office, Koretz said.

“What it’s done in reality is almost eliminate them” at City Hall, he added.

Koretz, who won his council seat in 2009, said that when he started following politics in Los Angeles, the great local leaders were John Ferraro, Joel Wachs, Marvin Braude and Zev Yaroslavsky. None had held elected office before winning seats on the City Council, he said.

By 2003, term limits had swept out Ruth Galanter, Rudy Svorinich, Mike Hernandez and Hal Bernson, four others who had not served in public office until they joined the council.

Advertisement

These days, council members typically come to the job from one of three places: the Legislature, the Police Department or the staff of another City Council office. Key exceptions are Jose Huizar, who won his seat after serving on the school board, and Tom LaBonge, who came from the Department of Water and Power. But LaBonge had also spent 17 years as a council aide and four in the mayor’s office.

Galanter, who served from 1987 to 2003, expressed dismay about the changes, saying the arrival of so many state politicians, combined with the leadership style of Council President Herb Wesson — a former Assembly speaker — is already making council members behave like their counterparts in Sacramento.

Advertisement

Two decades ago, council members weren’t shy about disagreeing with one another — and often did so publicly, Galanter said. These days, council members much more frequently fall in line with Wesson, as lawmakers do with the party leadership in Sacramento, she said.

The council “now has the imperial speaker,” Galanter said, “and the obedient troops who know about rewards and punishments.”

On Tuesday, after winning another two years as council president, Wesson defended the council’s string of unanimous votes, saying there’s “nothing wrong” with building consensus. He also said he had been wrongly portrayed by critics as a dictator. “I don’t tell you how to vote,” he told his colleagues. “We build coalitions here.”

Wesson has already endorsed former Assemblywoman Cindy Montañez, who currently works at the DWP, to fill a vacant seat in a July 23 special election. He argued that the arrivals from the Legislature would bring talent to the lawmaking body. “Sacramento gets a bad rap,” he said. “They’re honest, hard-working people and very operational.”

Yaroslavsky, a county supervisor who served on the council for 19 years, said he fears that as the council takes on a greater number of professional politicians, it loses a diversity of viewpoints. That change, he said, can be traced not just to term limits, but to the huge sums spent by “independent expenditure” campaign groups — labor unions and others that have put $800,000 or more behind their chosen candidates.

Those groups “have made it very daunting and intimidating for community-based candidates to run,” he said.

“The pool of potential candidates who are community-based has shrunk. And because the pool has shrunk, the odds of a community-based candidate getting elected has also shrunk,” said Yaroslavsky, who was elected to the council in 1975 while running an advocacy group focused on the plight of Soviet Jews.

For veteran politicians, the attraction of a council seat is clear. Council members earn almost $180,000 per year, nearly double the money provided to members of the state Assembly. With roughly a quarter-million people in each district, council members wield enormous power. And, unlike state legislators, they will be eligible for pensions — something wiped out for Sacramento lawmakers in 1990.

The Sacramento arrivals should help the council by bringing experience with the legislative process, said Jaime Regalado, professor emeritus of political science at Cal State L.A. Those who are bothered by the presence of career politicians at City Hall won’t be nearly as excited, he said.

“For those who like term limits and don’t like their politicians to be around very long, this is probably the worst-case scenario,” he said.

The Sacramento transplants will face a steep learning curve, said Rick Taylor, a City Hall lobbyist who worked as a council staffer in the 1980s. They will go from dealing with “broad, global kinds of issues” to angry phone calls about graffiti, unfilled potholes, cracked sidewalks and weed-filled lots.

“Local government is about making sure communities are protected and services are delivered, and that’s a very different type of government,” he said. “It’s more hands-on. It’s more people-oriented. It’s definitely more time-consuming.”

Councilman Gil Cedillo, who served in both the Assembly and Senate and took office Monday, acknowledged that council members deal much more in details than their Sacramento counterparts. But he said his years as a top official with the Service Employees International Union prepared him to deal in specifics.

“I negotiated 22 collective bargaining agreements for 40,000 people — that’s detail,” he said.

In addition to Cedillo, the council has been joined by former Assemblyman Bob Blumenfield in the west San Fernando Valley, former Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes in the east Valley and former State Sen. Curren Price in South Los Angeles. Two other newcomers, Mike Bonin and Mitch O’Farrell, worked a decade or more for sitting council members.

Svorinich, who left the council 2001, said he thinks the bigger story is not the addition of lawmakers from Sacramento but the loss of council members who come from the business community. When Svorinich was elected in 1993, he was running a paint store in Wilmington.

“Anytime you lose a certain perspective in regards to how government is run, that’s unfortunate,” said Svorinich, now working as a lobbyist.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that the Republican Party as a whole has abandoned its opposition to allowing a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Graham, a member of the group of senators negotiating immigration reform, known as the ""gang of eight,"" guessed there was a 70-30 chance legislation would be enacted.

""The politics of self-deportation are behind us,"" Graham said on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" referring to a proposal advanced by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney during the 2012 campaign.

""Mitt Romney's a good man. He ran in many ways a good campaign,"" Graham said. ""But it was an impractical solution. Quite frankly, it was offensive. Every corner of the Republican Party -- from libertarians to the RNC, House Republicans and the rank-and-file Republican Party member -- is now understanding there has to be an earned pathway to citizenship. That gives us leverage on immigration with our Democratic friends.""

On CBS' ""Face The Nation,"" two leading members of the ""gang of eight,"" Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), also expressed optimism about a deal. Schumer said that legislative language is on track to be completed at the end of this week, and McCain said that the bill could go through committee and land on the Senate floor by May.

Graham, however, continued to press forward with a key issue of his, calling for a ""merit-based"" guest worker program. The proposal has been a stumbling block in negotiations, according to people involved, and the outlines of the deal currently tilt more toward family reunification as the central way of handling the future flow of immigrants.

Graham also said that the pathway to citizenship must be tied to certified border security. The nature of that certification could end up being central to the final agreement. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson (D), also speaking on ""Meet The Press,"" said that it was inhumane to tie a person's pathway to citizenship to uncertain and unrelated border security evaluations, but Graham insisted there would be ""no deal"" without a direct connection."

Perez was confirmed by a vote of 54-46.

Below, more from the Associated Press:

WASHINGTON — A divided Senate confirmed Thomas Perez on Thursday to become secretary of labor, elevating the son of Dominican immigrants who as a top Justice Department official won praise from Democrats for aggressively enforcing civil rights laws and criticism from Republicans for being a liberal ideologue.

Thursday's party-line, 54-46 vote marked the third major vacancy in President Barack Obama's second-term leadership team that the Senate has filled in three days. The sudden movement followed this week's bipartisan deal in which Republicans agreed to end blockades against votes on seven nominations and Democrats shelved efforts to change Senate rules to weaken the minority GOP's powers.

Perez, 51, is a Buffalo, N.Y., native who once worked as a trash collector. Since earning a Harvard University law degree, his career has included stints as a Justice Department civil rights prosecutor and an aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., before taking over Justice's civil rights division in 2009.

At Justice, he has challenged Texas and South Carolina laws requiring voters to show photo identification and sued the office of outspoken Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, alleging that Latinos were racially profiled during a crackdown on immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

""He has spent his career fighting for working families, protecting our important civil rights laws and turning around troubled agencies,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

Republicans say Perez has selectively enforced laws according to his political views. GOP senators have suggested that politics has guided his decisions about enforcing voting rights laws and accused him of supporting efforts to sidestep federal immigration laws when he was a local government official in Maryland.

""Tom Perez is more than just some left-wing ideologue – he's a left-wing ideologue who appears perfectly willing to bend the rules to achieve his ends,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

After the vote, the Senate began debating Gina McCarthy's nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency.

On Wednesday, the Senate voted narrowly to end a filibuster against Perez. All but six Republicans voted against Perez – the exact number of GOP senators that majority Democrats needed to muster the 60 votes required to end the delaying tactic against Perez's nomination.

That 60-40 vote was the closest senators have come to unwinding this week's deal between the two parties that has averted all-out partisan warfare over nominations and Senate rules. That roll call seemed to signal that while GOP leaders would deliver the votes needed to honor the bipartisan agreement, numerous Republicans were rankled by the pact and unhappy with Perez.

McCarthy, who currently heads the EPA's air pollution office, has helped craft rules aimed at reducing pollutants from power plants and other sources. Republicans have long criticized the agency for championing overly restrictive regulations that they say kill jobs.

Last week, Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, top Republican on the Senate environment committee, said he was dropping efforts to delay McCarthy's nomination after the EPA agreed to release more information about how it makes decisions. McCarthy has also faced opposition from Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., because of delays to a flood control project.

The other five nominees involved in the deal include Richard Cordray, whom the Senate confirmed Tuesday as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Fred Hochberg, whom the Senate approved Wednesday to continue leading the Export-Import Bank.

Still to be considered are labor lawyers Nancy Schiffer and Kent Hirozawa to join the National Labor Relations Board and NLRB Chairman Mark Pearce, whom Obama wants to keep in the role.

UPDATE (2:10 p.m. ET) -- President Barack Obama issued a statement Thursday afternoon on Perez's confirmation:

I welcome today’s confirmation of Tom Perez to serve as Secretary of Labor. Tom has lived the American dream himself, and has dedicated his career to keeping it within reach for hardworking families across the country. At the Department of Labor, Tom will help us continue to grow our economy, help businesses create jobs, make sure workers have the skills those jobs require, and ensure safe workplaces and economic opportunity for all. I want to thank the Senate once again for agreeing to move forward on Tom and the other nominees who have waited far too long for the yes-or-no votes they deserve.

After a presidency, what comes next? Not just for the president but also for the members of the administration, the president’s allies in Congress, his or her political party?

In the eight years of the George W. Bush administration, no hearty saplings were ever able to take root in the shade of that big tree. No one expected Vice President Dick Cheney to ever be a contender for the presidency — part of his effectiveness was his willingness to say and do very unpopular things. When he snapped at ABC’s Martha Raddatz, “So?” as she questioned him about public disapproval of the Iraq war, he wrote the perfect epitaph for his vice presidency.

But by the time the Bush era was winding down, the whole administration, including the president, was stewed in terrible, Cheney-level disapproval ratings. And now, almost no one who played a significant role in that administration is anywhere to be found in electoral politics, beyond the tertiary orbits of Punch-and-Judy cable news and the remains of what used to be the conservative “think tank” circuit.

That’s true even for former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who had no formal role in his brother’s administration but will probably always find the familial association an insurmountable obstacle to his own presidential hopes.

Though she insists she is not running for president in 2016 , many liberals hope she will provide a more progressive alternative to Hillary Clinton. Joshua Roberts/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue.

Unlike the Reagan administration, the first Bush administration and the Clinton administration, the George W. Bush presidency elevated precisely no one to the ranks of national leadership who wasn’t there before. The 2008 Republican presidential primaries were like some odd eight-year cicada hatch in which the candidates went underground in 2000 and then birthed themselves after Bush and Cheney were gone, as if the intervening years had never happened.

The 2000 second-place finisher, Sen. John McCain? You’re next in line for 2008! And four years later: second-place Mitt Romney? You’re next in line for 2012!

The unpopular presidency of George W. Bush has proved to be a blackball on the résumés of a generation of Republican leaders. Maybe Cheney’s daughter Liz will break the pattern next year with a successful Senate bid in Wyoming, but if you made it through that sentence without spitting coffee out your nose, you’re in rare company.

The fascinating turmoil in the Republican Party since 2008 is not just a personnel problem — it’s also ideological. If you were putting together a legacy to inspire the next generation of conservatives, you wouldn’t pick the Bush administration’s trailing ends of land wars, budget deficits, torture, a crusade against gay rights and a financial collapse to rival the Great Depression. The isolationism and libertarian iconography of the Ron Paul wing of the party really does appeal to young people more than Bush-Cheney Republicanism. Social conservatives really do feel backed into a corner and ready to fight against a country that is turning against them faster than most pollsters can keep up. There really is something ripe for renewal in Republicans’ self-conception as fiscal conservatives, when the clear pattern is that budget deficits grow under Republicans and shrink under Democrats. The Republican Party is a churning swirl of conflicting ideological currents, and that’s going to take some time to work out.

But part of the reason it may be taking so long already is those lost years: the period from 2000 to 2008 that effectively obviated the authority and the leadership potential of all of Washington’s Republican elites. The George W. Bush administration didn’t just cast too much shade on the next generation of leadership — it also apparently poisoned the ground.

The Obama administration’s ability to nurture and support the next round of national leadership in the Democratic Party is going to be a big part of its long-term legacy. Unless Vice President Biden’s presidential hinting suddenly takes a turn for the serious, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is the obvious inheritor of the party’s mantle. But, as in 2008, the Beltway may be overstating her inevitability. The grass roots aren’t all with her, frankly, and it’s yet to be seen if she’s interested in trying to win them over. Mainstream press may buy big-dollar donors (and more mainstream press), but it can’t buy the passionate volunteers and activists and excitement that are the oxygen for a winning campaign and sustained, effective leadership.

The collapse of national leadership prospects for the Republican Party is one of the greatest political failures and most important legacies of George W. Bush. Barack Obama looks less likely to repeat that fate, but it depends on a strong grove of nationally viable Democrats starting to grow now. The crescendo of attention to Elizabeth Warren is a healthy part of that process, as is the growing national interest in such diverse Democrats as Sherrod Brown, Claire McCaskill, Cory Booker, Wendy Davis, Martin O’Malley, Deval Patrick, Andrew Cuomo and Amy Klobuchar.

Inside the White House, the task of growing one’s own successors must seem like one of the less pressing items on the president’s long daily to-do list. But the previous administration’s trail of scorched earth and exiles has curtailed the prospects for the Republican Party and governing conservatism more profoundly than almost anything that administration pursued in terms of policy. It is a cautionary tale that Democrats and the Obama White House should heed sooner rather than later. Grow your successors, nurture your legacy.

http://news.yahoo.com/irans-presidential-race-gets-underway-123818635.html,,[],Iran's presidential race gets underway,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's presidential race got underway Tuesday as authorities officially opened the registration process for candidates in next month's election that will pick a successor to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and offer a critical test for reformists battered after years of crackdowns.

The campaign is also taking shape as open season on Ahmadinejad's legacy and his combative style that bolstered his stature among supporters but brought increasing alarm from critics. Ahmadinejad is barred by law from seeking a third term due to term limits under Iran's constitution.

Many of the expected front-runners have promised to seek more measured diplomacy with the West and work to end Iran's nuclear standoff with world powers — although such major policies are ultimately decided by the country's ruling clerics.

In his first comments after filing his candidacy, former nuclear negotiator Hasan Rowhani, pledged ""constructive interaction with the world"" to try to address concerns that Iran could move toward an atomic weapon — a charge Tehran denies.

Meanwhile, the leaders of the reform movement four years ago are now under house arrests and liberal groups have faced relentless pressures since major unrest to protest Ahmadinejad's disputed re-election in 2009.

Prominent pro-reform figures, such as former President Mohammad Khatami, will not seek spots on the June 14 ballot. The news website nasimonline.ir quoted Khatami on Tuesday as saying he won't run, which fits with his previous hints of staying out.

That leaves opposition and liberal groups the option of boycotting the election or falling behind one of the candidates cleared by the ruling clerics, who will vet all hopefuls who submit their names during the five-day registration period. Only a handful of candidates are expected to be approved when the final list is unveiled later this month by the Guardian Council, the group that supervises the election.

The slate is almost certainly to be heavily stacked with candidates considered loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been angered by challenges to his authority by Ahmadinejad and the president's allies. Among the presumed front-runners is senior Khamenei adviser Ali Akbar Velayati, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Rowhani, who registered his candidacy in the first hours as the process got underway Tuesday.

Story continues

Rowhani also said he wants a ""government of prudence and hope"" that will seek ""reconciliation"" with the West and ease sanctions that targeted Iran's vital oil exports.

He added that he wants to put Iran's nuclear ""case on the right track"" through more active contacts with the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency to bolster Tehran's claims that it only has peaceful objectives.

""Therefore, it shouldn't remain in the Security Council, and the continuation of sanctions doesn't make sense,"" he said.

Inside Iran, the ruling clerics seek an end to the political battles opened by Ahmadinejad and more coordination with the presidency in strategies on nuclear talks and efforts to confront international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.

All key policies are made by the theocracy and its inner circle, including the powerful Revolutionary Guard. But the president is the international face of the country and is responsible for increasingly important sectors, such as the nation's stumbling economy.

Most of the main candidates have vowed to shun Ahmadinejad's bombastic style and seek to reduce tensions with the West and its allies. But all strongly support Iran's ability to maintain a full-scale nuclear program, including uranium enrichment. The U.S. and others fear Iran could eventually develop nuclear weapons, but Iran insists it only seeks reactors for energy and medical research.

Another major subplot in the election is the fate of Ahmadinejad's top political protege, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who is expected to seek a spot on the ballot. Ahmadinejad has endorsed Mashaei as his personally groomed heir. But Mashaei's reputation has faced severe blows in the backlash over Ahmadinejad's failed attempts to encroach on the Khamenei's powers.

Mashaei has been denounced as part of a ""deviant current"" opposing Islamic rule and some critics even claimed he used magic spells to cloud Ahmadinejad's mind. It's possible Mashaei would be rejected for the ballot and force Ahmadinejad — who still has considerable support around the country — to align himself with another candidate.

In a live TV broadcast, Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar urged presidential hopefuls to register quickly and not wait until the last moment. Leading candidates usually wait until the last days of the registration period, which ends Saturday evening.

Some presidential hopefuls, mostly little known, rushed to register Tuesday morning. Among them were former housing minister Mohammad Saeedikia, former health minister Kamran Bagheri Lankarani and former Vice President Sadegh Vaezadeh.

Reformists in Iran remain in disarray after the relentless crackdowns in the wake of the 2009 protests over claims their victory was stolen by vote rigging. In recent weeks, controls and blocks on Internet traffic appeared to be boosted in possible attempts to limit opposition voices during the election period.

Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi have been under house arrest since early 2011. Along with Khatami, another former president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, is not expected to seek comeback bids.

The main liberal-leaning candidate considered by the Guardian Council could be former Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref, who served in Khatami's administration.

Another pro-reform hopeful, former parliament member Mostafa Kavakebian, said he picked his campaign color as green in a clear link to the now-crushed Green Movement of Mousavi."

In a statement emailed to the Tribune shortly before midnight Wednesday, Heidelmeier apologized for the ""private pictures of me that are personally embarrassing"" but vowed to remain in the highly charged contest.

""I want to assure my opponent and supporters that I will stay steadfast in the race and let the voters take a careful look at the real issues facing Villa Park on April 9th,"" he said in the statement.

On Thursday, some of those supporters were withdrawing or reconsidering their endorsements of his candidacy after learning that two photos of Heidelmeier were posted on a website that touts itself as offering ""your most diverse phone sex experience.""

One picture is of Heidelmeier wearing a blue shirt, staring into the webcam, while the other shows an exposed genital underneath a blue shirt. Both pictures were dated from February, and in his statement, Heidelmeier acknowledged that the pictures were of him.

A 23-year-veteran of the village's Police Department, Heidelmeier was ousted as chief last year in a decision that divided residents. Now he's running against one of his harshest critics on the Village Board who pushed him to retire.

The race already had generated a stew of political drama before the pictures began circulating this week.

Trustee John Davis, a frequent critic of Heidelmeier, said he discovered Tuesday that someone had anonymously put a printout of the website and pictures in his mailbox. On Wednesday, he said, he went to Heidelmeier's house and gave him the printouts.

""I said, 'I run an honest campaign, and I want nothing to do with this.' And I handed it to him,"" Davis said. ""He was surprised.""

Davis said the pictures were ""spreading through town like wildfire.""

Heidelmeier's opponent, Trustee Deborah Bullwinkel, said she heard about them Tuesday from Davis. She said her campaign had nothing to do with finding the pictures or circulating them.

""I really feel bad for John (Heidelmeier) and his family,"" she said. ""I really do.""

DuPage County Board member Elizabeth Chaplin, who had previously endorsed Heidelmeier, dropped her support, calling the news ""unfortunate.""

""I have three kids, and I think the whole thing is just troubling, so I can't endorse him,"" Chaplin said Thursday. ""Everyone makes mistakes … and talking to him, he's a nice man, but with this coming out, I just can't support him.""

Tom Cullerton, a Democratic state senator and former Villa Park president; former DuPage County Board Chairman Bob Schillerstrom; Oakbrook Terrace Mayor Tony Ragucci; and Villa Park trustees Don Kase and Chris Aiello all were listed as endorsing Heidelmeier.

None but Aiello returned messages this week seeking comment on whether they still support his candidacy.

Aiello said he still supports Heidelmeier despite the “stupidity of his conduct” that led to the online posting. That’s because, Aiello said, the ex-chief has the unique ability to recruit people to work at solving problems.



“This ability to bring good people together is a quality of character that is the basis for my continuing to support Mr. Heidelmeier, the underdog,” Aiello said in a statement.

International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399 President Brian Hickey said union leaders would re-evaluate whether they should continue to support Heidelmeier.

Heidelmeier did not return requests seeking additional comment Thursday on his decision to remain in the race.

In his statement, Heidelmeier said he regretted that ""this private situation became public"" and said the revelations were ""unquestionably not fair"" to his family. But he said what happened does not hinder his ability to lead the village.

""I did nothing unlawful,"" he said, ""or anything that diminishes my ability to serve the people of Villa Park.""

The Court heard arguments on Mar. 18 in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona.

In earlier years people had to go to their county seat of government–typically the county courthouse–to register to vote in a system that made it very difficult to commit voter registration fraud. A federal commission is authorized by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA, or “Motor Voter”), which was pushed and signed by Bill Clinton, to develop a federal form for mail-in registration.

Arizona passed a law requiring people registering to vote by mail to include proof of citizenship. It was designed as a modest attempt to prevent illegal voting by foreigners that could undermine the legitimacy of the election returns in the democratic process.

The record in this case includes over 200 people who had submitted fraudulent voter registrations, who later swore under oath to a commission investigating this matter that they were not even U.S. citizens. They say workers from groups like the now-defunct ACORN–who were getting paid for each registration form they turned in–talked them into signing it, and that these individuals did not know it was a crime for them to do so.

NVRA requires states to “accept and use” the federal form. Arizona argues it accepts and uses the form, and that adding the requirement for someone to attach proof of citizenship is allowed. The plaintiffs and the Obama administration argue that if you add anything to the federal requirements, you are not accepting and using the federal form. This case will turn in part on which side the justices take on that issue.

Usually when federal law conflicts with state law, it is resolved under the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution, whereby federal law trumps state law under certain circumstances. Instead of the Supremacy Clause, this case will be decided under the Elections Clause in Article I of the Constitution. That provision says that states are primarily in charge of voting and elections, but “Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations …”

There is a large body of Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Supremacy Clause. This case may turn on whether the Elections Clause works by the same rules, or instead if there is a different framework that determines when federal election law trumps state election law.

It is unclear which way this case will go, with some justices sending signals one way or the other.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, “Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled. And it was to be [signing the form where you declare you are a citizen, under] penalty of perjury.” She added she understands NVRA as saying, “each state must accept and use the federal form, period. That’s the end of it.”

Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to fault Arizona for not making certain claims earlier in the litigation. But Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne explained that this lawsuit began under his predecessor Terry Goddard, who is a Democrat, and that Horne did not know why Goddard did not think to use a different strategy.

Scalia also seemed sympathetic to Arizona’s argument. For example, he remarked that the federal form requires nothing to show the individual is a citizen except, “check off, ‘I am a citizen,’ right? So it’s under oath. Big deal. If you’re willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose you’re willing to violate the perjury laws.”

Going into yesterday’s argument it was possible that two justices, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, were swing votes in this case. We should find out by late June which side prevailed.

A special election will be held June 25 for the rest of John Kerry%27s term

Brown won a 2010 election to succeed Democrat Edward Kennedy

The moderate Republican criticized partisanship in Congress

Former senator Scott Brown will not run for the Senate seat vacated by John Kerry in Massachusetts, saying Friday he was unsure ""of returning to a Congress even more partisan than the one I left.""

The decision by Brown, a moderate Republican, means Democrats now have a better chance of keeping the Massachusetts seat.

Brown was defeated in November by Democrat Elizabeth Warren, in the nation's most expensive Senate race. Democrats had made Brown a top target since he was the surprise winner of a 2010 race to replace Democrat Edward Kennedy, who died the previous summer.

Kerry officially stepped down Friday afternoon and was sworn in as secretary of State, replacing Hillary Rodham Clinton as the nation's top diplomat.

Brown said he gave ""serious thought"" to running, but it would have been his third Senate race in four years. If he won the June 25 special election, Brown would have to run again in 2014 for his own term.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has already appointed William ""Mo"" Cowan, a lawyer and his former chief of staff, to be the interim senator until voters pick a new senator. Primaries will be held April 30.

Democratic Reps. Ed Markey and Stephen Lynch have already declared their Senate candidacies.

The Senate GOP campaign committee vowed Republicans will be competitive. ""As the Democratic primary ... turns uglier and nastier each day, the Massachusetts special election provides a real pickup opportunity for Republicans, and we intend on defeating whichever career politician limps through,"" said Rob Collins, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Brown was a little-known state senator when he ran for the U.S. Senate after Kennedy's death. He defeated Democrat Martha Coakley, the state's attorney general, who ran what many people believed was a lackluster campaign in 2010.

In his statement, Brown suggested he will continue in public service — but made no mention of whether he will run for governor next year. Serving in Congress, he said, is ""not the only way for me to advance the ideals and causes that matter most to me.""

Although Massachusetts consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections, it doesn't always do the same in governor's races. Three Republicans — William Weld, Paul Cellucci and Mitt Romney — were elected governors from 1990 to 2006.

http://news.yahoo.com/carl-demaio-running-for-congress-in-california--220037721.html,,[],"How a young, gay congressional candidate could shake up the GOP","SAN DIEGO — It’s January 2015, and a newly elected House member from California walks side by side with his male partner to be sworn into office in Washington. The young lawmaker is a supporter of same-sex marriage. He believes the government should keep abortion legal. He considers himself an environmentalist.

He's also a Republican.

This could be the future for one Carl DeMaio, a former San Diego city councilman and recent mayoral candidate who is expected to challenge freshman Democratic Rep. Scott Peters in the state's 52nd congressional district. DeMaio has announced his plan to challenge Peters, but the unfolding sexual harassment scandal surrounding San Diego Mayor Bob Filner could also draw DeMaio into a special election for the mayor's office if Filner is recalled.

DeMaio, 38, doesn’t fit the mold of a traditional Republican. His election could make him the only openly gay GOP member of Congress. (Just two openly gay Republicans have ever served in the House.) DeMaio's views on same-sex marriage and abortion are also at odds with the party platform.

But DeMaio says he’s not interested in making social issues central to his campaign. While open about his beliefs, his run is focused on government accountability and pocketbook-issue reform instead of relitigating the culture wars.

“We ought to take those divisive issues, particularly the social issues, and set them off to the side,” DeMaio told Yahoo News in an interview. “It’s not appropriate for the government to be making decisions for people in their private lives. Instead, we should demand that we look beyond labels to embrace common sense ideas on financial reform and holding these government programs accountable.”

DeMaio's policy views — economically conservative and socially liberal — place him in a libertarian wing of the Republican Party, one that seems to be growing in popularity among young voters. But he's reluctant to put himself in any category.

Story continues

“I warmly embrace the libertarian label, but I also want to point out that one of my biggest frustrations in politics is that people want to shove one or two big labels on some people that sums who they are and what they believe and what their record has been. I think that’s limiting,” DeMaio said.

Despite his potential of being a maverick if he makes it to Congress, DeMaio is not a fringe candidate. He has early support from the party establishment — the National Republican Congressional Committee, the official party group responsible for electing Republicans to the House, is backing him full force. In July, California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the third-ranking House Republican, hosted a fundraiser for him in Washington. The invitation branded DeMaio as a “New Generation Republican.”

Given his background, DeMaio seems like just the type of candidate that the soul-searching Republican Party is looking for.



“I actually think that we are going to make headway in the Republican Party on these issues in the coming years,” DeMaio told Yahoo News. “It is going to be a totally different thrust for the Republican Party.”

DeMaio was born in Iowa, and his family moved to Southern California when he was a child. DeMaio’s father left the family and his mother died while he was still in high school. Young DeMaio was sent to boarding school at Georgetown Preparatory School near Washington, and he went on to graduate from Georgetown University.



As a young man in the nation’s capital during Newt Gingrich’s Republican Revolution in 1994, DeMaio plugged into the city’s conservative scene, developing his skills as a policy researcher. He took a job with the Congressional Institute, a think tank that hosts conferences for lawmakers on policymaking.



He went on to found his own group, The Performance Institute, which does similar work and emphasizes transparency reforms and efficiency in government. Through the 1990s and early 2000s, DeMaio established himself as a policy wonk, publishing position papers on government reform for various groups, including the libertarian Reason Foundation based in California.

DeMaio won a seat on the San Diego City Council in 2008, where he focused on several city-based reforms, including a successful push to overhaul the costly pension program for city workers by placing new employees into private, 401(k)-style retirement accounts.

He ran a robust campaign for mayor of San Diego in 2012, losing to Democrat Bob Filner by just 3 percentage points despite a surge in Democratic turnout across the state supporting President Barack Obama's re-election.

DeMaio announced his candidacy to challenge Peters in May.



A DeMaio victory would give a boost to Republicans in California, where the party has been steadily losing ground for two decades. There are currently just 15 Republicans among the state's 55-member congressional delegation, the nation's largest.

According to early poll numbers, DeMaio could be a viable challenger. His mayoral campaign provided him with strong name-ID in the district, a crucial leg up for any candidate challenging an incumbent. A Survey USA poll conducted in June, 17 months before next year’s election, showed DeMaio leading Peters in a hypothetical matchup by 11 percentage points.

As with any political campaign, DeMaio has also made enemies. His support of the pension overhaul enraged organized labor interests, and he won few friends within the gay community when he accepted campaign donations from supporters of the movement to ban same-sex marriage in California. Last year, when DeMaio and his partner, Jonathan Hale, walked together in the San Diego LGBT Pride Parade, some in the crowd booed him along the way.

Publicly, national Democrats dismiss DeMaio as a grandstander. But privately, some express concern that he could be a strong challenger to Peters, particularly since there is little daylight between the two candidates on some of the social issues that have tripped up other Republican candidates in previous races around the country. The election will also occur midway through Obama's second term, an election cycle that historically isn't as hospitable to the president's party.

But since DeMaio's former political foe, Filner, is almost sure to face a well-organized recall campaign in the coming weeks, DeMaio is considered a prime candidate to run in a special election to replace him. Filner has conceded behaving inappropriately but is refusing to resign.

DeMaio told Yahoo News that he would “absolutely” sign a petition to recall Filner, but was coy when asked if he would seek the mayor’s office.

“There are benefits and liability in weighing into that question right now,” DeMaio told Yahoo News. “I’m going to continue to focus on how we can rid our city of the cancer that is Bob Filner. Until he departs that office, our city will be held hostage and our people’s business will not get done.”

In San Diego, the accusations against Filner, (which DeMaio warned about during the campaign against him last year), have dominated the news cycle for weeks. Filner on Tuesday challenged the recall in a written statement, but the campaign is likely to begin as early as this month, forcing DeMaio to make what will surely be a difficult choice."

So the state will spend $12 million to provide the crystal clarity of a special Senate election on Oct. 16.

Not so GOP's. If cuts happen, voters will blame GOP

Editor’s Note: Maria Cardona is a Democratic strategist, a principal at the Dewey Square Group, a former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton and former communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

Earlier this month, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, rolled out to much fanfare a new “branding effort” for the Republican Party, focused on broadening its appeal and helping the middle class.

It seemed hopeful at the time. Sadly, today it is laughable. We are days away from severe forced spending cuts that will do nothing but hurt the very people the GOP is trying to win over. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana recently declared that Republicans had to stop being “the stupid party” if they were ever going to put together the long-term winning coalition they needs to reach the White House in 2016. Sorry, governor: your party didn’t listen.

If the forced cuts, known as the sequester, go through, 14,000 teachers could get laid off – affecting thousands of middle-class families, including many African-American and Latino families. Construction jobs, manufacturing jobs, first-responder jobs – all well-paying middle-class jobs, will get cut.

Castellanos: On cuts, Washington throws a tantrum

Domestic violence programs will be slashed as $20 million gets cut from the Violence Against Women Act. Public safety in many ways will suffer. Food inspectors will get laid off. Up to 5,000 Border Patrol agents will be called from the border – the mother of ironies for the Republicans who complain that the administration isn’t doing enough on border security.

This is not what was supposed to happen. Sequestration was designed to be a bipartisan stink bomb so noxious to both parties that neither would allow it to happen. It was a release valve that allowed the parties to reach a deal on the debt limit in the summer of 2011 to avoid sending the nation into default, with the understanding that a broader agreement on the debt and deficit would be reached. If it wasn’t, off went the bomb.

What happened between then and now? President Barack Obama won reelection by voters who support his idea of dealing with the debt and deficit – by asking everyone to put some skin in the game. He was seen as the protector of the middle class, and importantly, as the one who understood that government is not the enemy. That in fact, a lean, efficient, smart government, can help level the playing field and help all Americans and businesses get ahead.

Opinion: Cuts too deep? No, not deep enough

This argument was overwhelmingly supported by Latinos, African-Americans, women and young people and helped propel the president to a second term. Then came the fiscal-cliff debacle, where again, majorities of Americans sided with the president on how to fix it. Republicans acquiesced, and it seemed they knew they had to change their tune.

In his GOP rebranding speech, Cantor said: “We will advance proposals aimed at producing results in areas like education, health care, innovation and job growth.” That sounded smart enough. But in this current showdown du jour, Republicans have proven they are unserious. The party cannot see beyond its insistence on protecting the rich from paying even a single penny more, while welcoming draconian cuts to programs that hurt the middle class and the most vulnerable, especially in the areas of education, health care, innovation and job growth.

Zelizer: If spending is cut, GOP will get the blame

Instead of trying to find a way to avoid these steep cuts, and to keep faith with their newfound concern for the middle class, Republicans are doubling down on the “my way or the highway” mentality that put them in an electoral hole to begin with.

The party’s deficit among these key voting groups will only get bigger if the GOP allows the spending cuts to go through. The risk to their standing among the American people is quite real. They are making a choice to protect loopholes for millionaires and their corporate jets while kicking 70,000 kids off critical Head Start programs – and many of these kids come from low-income African American and Latino families. Thousands of middle-class American jobs are on the chopping block because the Republican Party did not learn the lesson of the election.

While there is political risk for everyone, including Obama, if these cuts happen, he enjoys something the GOP does not: the trust of the American people. Recent polling suggests up to half of Americans would blame Republicans. Less than a third would blame President Obama. Polls also show that an overwhelming 76% of voters, and 56% of Republicans, agree with the president that the solution to our fiscal woes should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.

Obama’s approval rating is at 55%, a three-year high. He is at 73% of support with Latinos, up 2 points from his 71% election victory – not a promising trend for Republicans.

When you are in a hole, the best advice is to stop digging. The GOP seems to prefer to grab a bigger shovel.

Tom Cotton announces campaign for Arkansas Senate seat,"First-term Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton announced Tuesday he's challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, setting up what's expected to be one of the most expensive and heated U.S. Senate races in the country next year.

Cotton, 36, made his run official in front of supporters in his hometown of Dardanelle. He's the first Republican to announce a bid to unseat Pryor, who has served two terms and is widely viewed by the GOP as the most vulnerable Senate incumbent on the ballot next year.

The former management consultant, who served in the Army in Iraq and Afghanistan, was elected in November to represent Arkansas' 4th Congressional District, which stretches across the western and southern parts of the state. Pryor was first elected to the Senate in 2002.

""I'm running because I think Arkansas deserves a senator who stands with them and not with Barack Obama,"" Cotton told The Associated Press before his announcement speech. ""Mark Pryor, by his voting record over the last four and a half years, has proven that he now stands with Barack Obama, not with Arkansas.""

The campaign to unseat Pryor has already been well under way in Arkansas, with groups on the right and the left blitzing the state with television ads targeting the incumbent lawmaker. The groups airing ads against Pryor include the Club for Growth, which backed Cotton's congressional bid last year and has indicated it's prepared to assist him in the Senate campaign as well.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group founded by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has aired TV spots criticizing Pryor for voting against expanded background checks for firearms purchases. Pryor used his television ad of the campaign to respond to the group's criticism.

The ad blitz in Arkansas also focused on Cotton as he mulled a Senate run, with two Democratic political action committees running a spot accusing the congressman of seeking the national limelight at the expense of his constituents.

Pryor moved quickly to criticize Cotton after word of his expected run emerged last week, accusing the Republican lawmaker of alienating students, farmers and women since joining Congress in January. Pryor also launched a 60-second TV ad on Tuesday blasting Cotton's votes, while the state Democratic Party has created a website calling the congressman ""reckless.""

Pryor continued going after Cotton ahead of his announcement and said the Republican's votes showed he ""lost touch"" with Arkansas.

""The bottom line is he's not voting for us,"" Pryor told the AP on Tuesday. ""I don't know who he's voting for, but it's not the people of Arkansas.""

Pryor and Democrats have criticized Cotton for voting against the farm bill over objections to funding for the food stamp program. Cotton, who was the only Arkansas House member to vote against the farm bill, later voted for a revised version of the legislation that didn't include funding for food stamps.

Cotton dismissed the criticism, saying that Pryor had ignored the state's voters by supporting the federal health care overhaul.

""That's a sad and desperate attempt by a panicked politician to cling to power,"" Cotton said. ""If anyone has alienated the people of Arkansas, it's Mark Pryor.""

Cotton has also come under fire for voting against a student loan bill that was given final approval by the House last week.

Pryor is the only Democrat in the state's Washington delegation after Republicans made major gains in the state over the past two elections. The GOP won control of the state Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction in the November election, and swept all four of the state's U.S. House seats."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/us/politics/obamas-second-inaugural-speech.html,2013-01-21 00:00:00,[],Obama’s Second Inaugural Speech,"This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. America’s possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention. My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it – so long as we seize it together.

For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class. We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship. We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American, she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.

We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time. We must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher. But while the means will change, our purpose endures: a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American. That is what this moment requires. That is what will give real meaning to our creed.

We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future. For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty, and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other – through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security – these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.

We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries – we must claim its promise. That’s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure – our forests and waterways; our croplands and snowcapped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. That’s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared.

We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war. Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty. The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war, who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends, and we must carry those lessons into this time as well.

We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law. We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully – not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear. America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe; and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation. We will support democracy from Asia to Africa; from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom. And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice – not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity; human dignity and justice."

If the Republican Party were a profit-seeking corporation, the current management would be tossed.

A post-election study conducted Dec. 12 by Resurgent Republic, a conservative think tank, concluded that the market for right-wing ideologues is just not there anymore:

Republicans have run out of persuadable white voters. For the fifth time in the past six presidential elections, Republicans lost the popular vote. Trying to win a national election by gaining a larger and larger share of a smaller and smaller portion of the electorate is a losing political proposition.

Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, released findings on Jan. 16 from a Democracy Corp survey that echoed that conclusion:



The Republican Party brand has steeply eroded since Election Day. Half of all voters (51 percent) now give the Party a negative rating and a third rate the party very negatively (under 25 on our 100-point scale).

Even more threatening to conservatives, according to Greenberg, “Strong majorities of voters view the Republican Party’s positions on critical economic and social issues as extreme.”

If you’re a Republican, the evidence on the party’s near-term prospects is pretty grim:

On a host of issues, the Republican Party is perceived as out of the mainstream:

Republicans traditionally defer to rank, but in 2016 the party will need a presidential candidate who understands his (or her) party’s ideological and demographic liabilities and can pull it out of a nosedive — no small task. The last candidate to manage this feat? Bill Clinton.

An item that should go on the top of the priority list: dump the party’s super PACs and the men and women who run them, including Karl Rove.

The monied wing of the Republican Party suffers from what political scientists call a “resource curse” — the same “paradox of plenty” that blocks the advancement of oil-rich countries in the Middle East and elsewhere. Too much cash flowing from big donors to super PACs and tax-exempt organizations is the Republican curse.

In the 2012 election, major Republican-leaning independent expenditure committees, including Restore Our Future and American Crossroads, spent $579 million, more than three times the $168 million spent by pro-Democratic groups like Priorities USA and the Service Employees International Union.

Despite losing, a network of favored Republican consultants and contractors emerged from the election richer than before: Mentzer Media Services, Inc. collected fees of $141 million; Crossroads Media LLC, $90.8 million; Target Enterprises, $15.2 million; Arena Communications, $12.8 million. For the Republican operatives running these companies, 2012 was hardly a defeat. It was a business bonanza.

William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, wasn’t happy after last year’s presidential election and not just because of the results:

Reading about some conservative organizations and Republican campaigns these days, one is reminded of Eric Hoffer’s remark, “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.” It may be that major parts of American conservatism have become such a racket that a kind of refounding of the movement as a cause is necessary. A reinvigoration of the Republican Party also seems desirable, based on a new generation of leaders, perhaps coming ​— ​as did Ike and Reagan​ — ​from outside the normal channels.

Three presidential campaigns earlier, Kristol and David Brooks (who was then a senior editor for The Weekly Standard) were convinced that the McCain 2000 campaign for president offered a “refounding.” Kristol and Brooks wrote:

The two great Republican general-election victories of the recent past grew out of intraparty insurrections. In 1980, Ronald Reagan, fresh from challenging a sitting Republican president in 1976, ran against a party establishment represented in various ways by Howard Baker, George Bush, and John Connally. A decade later, Newt Gingrich led an insurrection, first against the Bush budget deal and then against Bob Michel and the Republican congressional establishment, which culminated in the Republican landslide of 1994. Now we are witnessing a third insurrection. John McCain is taking on the Republican establishment. In New Hampshire, he crushed it.

In practice, the McCain insurgency in 2000 was short-lived, posing a serious threat to George W. Bush for less than three weeks — from the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1, 2000, to the South Carolina contest on Feb. 19. The brief life of the McCain campaign suggests that future reform efforts will face intense hostility.

I asked Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia how parties can change direction after defeat. Sabato responded by e-mail:

The hardest thing for a party to do is to make painful choices that require a break-up within the old coalition in order to create a new, more competitive coalition. Usually, only repeated losses —being hit over the head with a two-by-four — will motivate a party to try something truly different.

After the disastrous 1964 presidential bid of Barry Goldwater, Sabato pointed out, Richard Nixon and others

grasped that the old moderate-liberal Republican establishment was history. J.F.K. and L.B.J. had converted African-Americans almost wholly, and white liberals too, with the New Frontier-Great Society and civil rights. What was left? Homeless Southern conservatives, who gravitated toward the G.O.P. and pushed out of power the congressional and gubernatorial moderates. The liberal G.O.P. wing had to die to make way for a much larger trove of conservative Southern votes.

At the moment, reactionary forces have a death grip on the Republican Party, and their power has been cemented by the party’s institutionalization of closed primaries and caucuses (neither independents nor Democrats can participate) in more than half the states.

Republican opponents of change also hold on to the hope that the American economy will be mired in a period of slow growth, damaging to whichever party is in power. The premise of this strategy is that hard-pressed voters will turn on the Democrats.

The rate of growth since the 2007-8 collapse has been about half the average rate in past post-recession periods. Take a look at this chart from the Congressional Budget Office:

Still, for Republicans to gamble on a listless economy is inherently risky. Jan Hatzius, chief economist for global investment research at Goldman Sachs, argues that in economic terms, “2013 might feel a little friendlier than 2012,” picking up steam after the Obama administration and Congress resolve their fiscal and budgetary disputes.

Favorable reports on housing and employment last week boosted the stock market as well as Obama’s approval ratings, which on Jan. 17 stood at 52 percent, among his highest since early 2009.

The major factor encouraging Republican inertia is that the party’s setbacks have not reached the crisis stage; it still controls the House 233 to 200 (there are two current vacancies).

That majority rests on the weak reed of gerrymandering, however, and on the high concentration of Democratic voters in urban areas. Democratic House candidates actually won the popular vote by one million more votes than Republicans, 56 million to 55 million.

In North Carolina, Bloomberg news found that Democrats won 2.22 million votes to 2.14 million cast for Republican candidates, but Republicans won 9 of the state’s 13 House seats. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, Democrats won 2.7 million votes to the Republicans’ 2.6 million, but Democrats ended up with only 5 of the state’s 18 districts.

The fast-approaching budget and sequestration fights have created a dilemma for Republican House leaders. If the party backs its conservative wing and allows the country to go into default later this year or submits to the draconian cuts mandated by sequestration, Republicans in swing districts could turn the House over to Democrats in 2014. If Republicans go in the opposite direction and compromise, significant numbers of House members will face primary challenges from the right.

With more and more Republicans aware that their party is on the ropes, how will its core constituencies respond, especially the Christian right and the Tea Party, which appear likely to lose power in an intra-party realignment? Will they passively accept diminished influence or will they lash out against their fellow Republicans?

If the conservative movement continues on its downward trajectory, the American business community, which has the most to lose from Republican failure, will be the key force arguing for moderation.

The problem that faces business leaders pressing for reform is not just the normal reluctance of a political party to change. Instead, it is the fact that much of the Republican electorate, as presently constructed, is profoundly committed — morally and ideologically — to “traditional values.” You’re asking groups of people to change who were brought together by their resistance to change. Their opposition to change is why they are Republicans.

The right coalition includes a subset of conservatives determined to preserve white hegemony. Add to that social conservatives who oppose both the women’s rights and gay rights movements, and the religiously observant who are dead set against burgeoning secularism and what they see as the erosion of faith in public life.

These voters see the breakneck speed with which big business alters familiar patterns of life — innovation, but also joblessness, foreclosure and broken communities — as laying waste to much they hold dear. Business — that is, capitalism — drives a “perennial gale of creative destruction,” as the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously put it. This gale, by definition, is anti-conservative.

Survey data reveals the profound resistance on the right to cultural disruption. Poll after poll shows that Republicans believe politicians should stand firmly against compromising core principles, by much higher margins than either Democrats or independents.

An indirect but important reflection of partisan attitudes to change is visible in the higher percentage of Republicans, 58 percent, who believe in creationism – defined in this survey as the belief that God created human beings in their present form within the last 10,000 years – than Democrats, 41 percent, and independents, 39 percent.

In effect, for many cultural and social conservatives, being a Republican is not just an allegiance to one of two major political parties but a deeply held belief system, an ideology with a strong religious core.

The Tea Party and the Christian Coalition exist in an inevitably fraught alliance with high finance, the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable.

The center-right coalition, in fact, needs more than new management. Over time, its leadership and candidates face the task of breaking up irreconcilable factions and merging the most viable parts with new constituencies, including suburbanites angry over rising tax burdens and increasingly affluent Hispanic and Asian voters.

Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at M.I.T. who studies the evolution of American parties, responded by email to my query about partisan restructuring. Republicans, he said,

need to figure out what the settled parts of American politics are these days — settled matters that they, in their heart of hearts would like to change, but which they agree not to change. That probably includes a much more tolerant society and a dedication to a certain level of social insurance as an obligation embraced by the federal government. The Tea Party leaders won’t be able to do that, unless they change their spots thoroughly.

The success of the Republican Party in rural areas, exurbs and in the South has come at a cost. Socially conservative voters will resist changing their spots. When, and if, Republican leaders determine that the demands of these voters for “massive resistance” to abortion, contraception and immigration are futile, they will have to decide whether to cut them loose. No matter what happens, social conservatives are unlikely to become Democrats. It may not be too long before they find themselves with a choice of their own: withdraw from party politics or hold their noses and stick with the Republicans."

The ugly, clunky Drudge Report site still harvests record numbers of eyeballs because it serves up a hearty meal at a good price: free. The content rule is true across mediums. How many graphic makeovers and relaunches has CNN attempted to arrest its slow slide? The simple truth is that most people feel there is no reason to watch CNN, and they are happy not to. Meanwhile, “Storage Wars” racks up viewers and “Dog,” the bounty hunter, has a new series.

So it is in politics. A Republican renaissance will inevitably be driven by policy.

Today, social media fulfill much of the need for community and togetherness that were once provided by bowling leagues, church suppers and, yes, political parties. Like interests are drawn together through the invisible connectivity of virtual communities.

For 2016, the Democrats seem headed toward a fight between Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Both launched their careers in the 1970s; what will their slogan be, “Another Century of Service”? On our side, we have Paul Ryan, Nikki Haley, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Susana Martinez and more. Who has the best opportunity to win that generational battle?

So whatever ""content"" is, it consists of publishing faked or misleading news stories peddled by GOP insiders and the cheap sensationalism of mid-tier reality shows, and that's still better than whatever CNN is dishing out on any given day. Noted.Policy like ""Drudge"" and ""Storage Wars,"" or like Drudge? I have no idea where Stevens is going with this one. Neither does he, since he then goes on to praise Michael Gerson and Alex Castellanos for their contributions to noting the overpowering stench of decay coming from the party, which is a bit like praising your child for recognizing that maybe stapling their thumb to their forehead wasn't such a great idea after all. I mean it's fine, but the standards have gotten a little low.Facebook is actually a hell of a lot like church suppers, at least as I remember them. The bitter recriminations, the snide comments that seem to be insults but you're never quite sure, the people who are way too proud of their current food product; ah, brings me back. All right, so we've learned that Republicans don't have a technology problem, and that technology is good, and that Republicans can win by adopting good, sensible policies like those featured on the Drudge Report and Honey Boo Boo. But what about the young people? How will Republicans compete with the likes of Obamacare and gay marriage for the hearts of the young people?Ah. As the GOP plan for wooing Hispanic Americans consists of the phrase ""Hey look, here's Marco Rubio,"" the GOP plan for wooing young people will be to say, ""Hey, look! We've got Chris Christie and Jeb Bush! They're pretty young, right? I mean, they've at least still got their original hips.""

Well, you can't argue with that logic. Republicans are going to win the next generation by turning Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie and Jeb Bush into a boy band, which will then appeal to the young folks because content, where content means calling Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton old farts. This column really demonstrates how deep-thinking Republican strategy sessions must be. Really, I can't imagine why they lost.

Mike Johanns won’t seek reelection,"Johanns is the fifth senator to announce his retirement since the 2012 election, joining Sens. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).

While the races for some of those seats will be competitive, Nebraska is a tough state for Democrats. They had a top recruit in the state last year in former senator Bob Kerrey, but he wound up losing by 16 points to now-freshman Sen. Deb Fischer (R).

""The Cornhusker state will look to continue its strong conservative tradition by electing an equally dedicated Republican leader in 2014,"" said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Potential GOP candidates for the seat include the two runners-up to Fischer in the 2012 primary -- state Attorney General Jon Bruning and state Treasurer Don Stenberg. But the heavy favorite, if he ran, would by Gov. Dave Heineman, who is term-limited in his current job in 2014.

Heineman was Johanns's lieutenant governor before ascending to the state's top job in January 2005, when Johanns was appointed agriculture secretary. Heineman's approval rating his been in the 60s and even the 70s for much of his tenure.

If he ran for Senate, it seems logical that other ambitious politicians would likely focus on the governor's race rather than the Senate race.

Still, Democrats immediately set about trying to define Heineman as an arch conservative, labeling his budget an ""his ill-conceived tax plan to hurt Nebraska’s middle class.""

""With Johanns’ retirement, the Nebraska Republican Party continues to define their future by skewing even more to the right..."" state Democratic Party chairman Vince Powers said.

On the Democratic side, potential recruits could include Kerrey and 2008 nominee Scott Kleeb. But the Democratic bench in the state is thin, with Democrats holding no congressional seats or statewide offices.

Johanns last week was one of four Republicans to vote to bring former senator Chuck Hagel's (R-Neb.) nomination as defense secretary to a vote. Johanns occupies the seat once held by Hagel.

Following is Johanns' full e-mail to his supporters."
