http://news.yahoo.com/more-rutgers-faculty-seek-firings-coach-case-171625311--spt.html,,[],More Rutgers faculty seek firings in coach case,"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) — The call from faculty members and politicians to oust top Rutgers University administrators grew louder, a day after men's basketball coach Mike Rice was fired for mistreating players, shoving them and berating them with gay slurs.

More than 50 faculty members signed a letter Thursday calling for the dismissal of Athletic Director Tim Pernetti and an explanation from President Robert Barchi for why he didn't fire Rice last year when he learned of a video showing Rice's behavior during practices.

State Senate President Stephen Sweeney also called for Pernetti to step down or be fired. He said Pernetti deserves credit for getting Rutgers into the Big Ten conference but mishandled this situation.

""This incident will continue to hang over Rutgers like a dark cloud for weeks, months and perhaps years to come,"" the Democrat said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the number of faculty members calling for Barchi to step down more than doubled Thursday to 28.

The letter calling for Barchi's resignation was sent to the university's governing boards on Wednesday. In it, the faculty members cite Barchi's ""inexcusable handling of coach Mike Rice's homophobic and misogynist abuse"" of players, his ""pattern of insensitivity and arrogance toward issues of diversity"" and the ""lack of transparency that he has exhibited in his relations"" with faculty, staff and students.

It's unclear what effect the calls might have on the president or the athletic director. Neither was willing to be interviewed by The Associated Press. Barchi also skipped a town hall meeting he'd been scheduled to attend Thursday at Rutgers' Newark campus and declined to comment when he left his office. Members of the university's two governing boards have been mum.

Barchi, a neuroscience researcher before he became a university administrator, was hired a year ago and took office Sept. 1 to lead the university, which has 58,000 students and 13,000 faculty members on three campuses. He had been president of Thomas Jefferson University, a Philadelphia health sciences university, and before that was an administrator at the University of Pennsylvania.

Story continues

He was brought to Rutgers as the university takes over two medical schools that are part of the separate University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The ongoing reconfiguration of the state's higher education system is intended to expand Rutgers' life-science research prowess, and Barchi was chosen largely to oversee that.

He had never been an administrator, though, at a school with athletic scholarships.

Over the past decade, Rutgers' athletic program has grown increasingly ambitious and expensive, largely as the university's football team transformed from an also-ran to a power in the Big East conference. The school's teams are set next year to join the more prestigious Big Ten, a move engineered largely by Pernetti, a former TV sports executive.

Shortly after Barchi took office, he told reporters that high-profile sports teams are an important way to increase the university's visibility but that he wanted to gradually reduce the university's operating subsidy for sports, currently about $8 million per year, while continuing to pay for scholarships for athletes at a cost of about $10 million annually.

Barchi said in a statement Wednesday that Pernetti told him last year about the video of Rice made by a former basketball program employee, but he said he did not watch the video until Tuesday, the day it was made public. A university spokesman declined to comment on why Barchi didn't watch the video last year.

In December, after the university consulted lawyers and commissioned an independent report on Rice's actions, Barchi said he agreed to suspend the coach for three games, fine him and order him to anger management counseling.

He said that when he saw the video, he realized that Rice needed to be removed.

The faculty members calling for Barchi to step down said in their letter that he knew enough to remove the coach months ago.

""Although President Barchi is now suggesting otherwise, he has known about Coach Rice's homophobic, misogynist and abusive behavior for several months now,"" the letter said.

Ron Becker, head of special collections and university archives at Rutgers, said he believes the handling of the situation needs to be reviewed.

""The value of sports and the Division I atmosphere often trumps some of the basic needs of the university,"" he said. ""The pressure to win and succeed at athletics seems to trump (academics) around here.""

The university's student government association also released a statement saying that Rice deserved to be fired. It said it intended to work with Barchi and Pernetti ""to ensure that incidents like this never happen again.""

While practically everyone who has spoken publicly about the case says it was right to fire Rice, two players in interviews with The Associated Press on Thursday defended the coach, saying the snippets of video were taken out of context.

""I feel if people had a chance to see the other portions of practice, or had been at practice, their judgment would not be as severe,"" sophomore forward Austin Johnson said. ""I am not saying what he did wasn't wrong, because I do believe it was wrong. But it is also tough because it was a highlight reel of his worst moments.""

Junior Wally Judge said Rice, who apologized Wednesday, has treated him well and helped him grow as a person and a basketball player.

There also was a defense of Pernetti. According to Newark's The Star-Ledger, an athletic department fundraiser emailed Rutgers boosters asking them to contact Barchi and the head of the university's board of governors to voice support of him. University spokesman Greg Trevor would not comment on whether the email was sanctioned by the author's superiors.

A Rutgers assistant coach has resigned amid the scandal. According to The Star-Ledger, the assistant, Jimmy Martelli, could be seen on the video shoving a player.

Martelli said in a statement he was ""sickened that as an assistant coach I contributed in any way to an unacceptable culture,"" and he apologized to the players ""from the bottom of my heart.""

The Associated Press also obtained a letter Thursday from a lawyer for Eric Murdock, the former basketball program employee who gave the video to university officials and later ESPN. The letter to a lawyer for Rutgers, dated Dec. 27, said Murdock was fired for telling school officials about Rice's behavior and would accept $950,000 not to file a lawsuit against the school. The letter also complained that the university did not seem to investigate when Murdock first complained about Rice in July, when an interim president was in office.

Democratic state lawmakers, particularly Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, have been calling for legislative hearings on why Rice was not fired sooner, but none had been scheduled.

Keeping the coach on through the season cost the university a portion of his salary — he was paid $622,500 in 2012 — and a $100,000 bonus for coaching the final game of the year. Athletic department spokesman Jason Baum said the university is contractually obligated to pay the bonus, due this month.

It is not the increased drumbeat emanating from the Beltway press corps critical of her political operation.

It is not the obsessive focus by Washington Republicans on the events in Benghazi, who, due to their almost demented political obsession with taking Hillary Clinton down, have actually done a disservice to those seeking real answers about what happened in Libya.

[pullquote]

Instead, the biggest issue facing Hillary Clinton is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a woman who has signed a letter urging Hillary to run and who has made repeated Shermanesque statements about her own presidential ambitions in 2016.

The allure of Warren to the Democratic base is simple: she draws the starkest contrast possible between politicians who carefully calibrate their language so as not to offend any particular constituency and those who speak clearly and directly to the frustrations Americans of all stripes, from the Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street, feel about the special interests who hold our government hostage.

Last September, Warren addressed the AFL-CIO using the kind of stark, populist language that Americans on both sides of the aisle have been hungering for.

She spoke of a rigged system that benefits Wall Street to the detriment of Main Street.

She spoke of a Supreme Court held in thrall by corporate interests.

She spoke of legislation to limit the ability of big banks to gamble with depositor’s money.

This type of rhetoric should be commonplace in Washington but it is not.

The ever-increasing quest for campaign cash has prevented high-ranking elected officials from speaking out this way – and has certainly prevented them from acting on it.

Warren’s own legislation to curb Wall Street’s excesses will likely not see the light of day, even when her own party controls the Senate agenda and even though it is written jointly with Republican Senator John McCain.

Neither party in Washington today wants any part of populism.

What the Beltway punditocracy fails to understand is that many politically engaged Americans on both sides of the aisle hunger for this kind of populist agenda.

It is the same kind of longing that produced a brash challenge to the Clinton brand in 2008. Then, Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic primary to a newcomer from Illinois, who became an avatar for the frustration Democrats outside the Beltway felt towards the cautious approach Washington politicians have taken towards the entrenched, special interest establishment.

In 2016, Hillary Clinton may finally become the Democratic nominee – but not before the base forces her to throw some caution to the wind and pay attention to the Elizabeth Warrens of the party."

Associated Press

Regulators on Tuesday approved a temporary price hike of 3 cents for a first-class stamp

The higher rate will last no more than two years

Forever stamps can be purchased at the lower price until the new rate is effective Jan. 26

WASHINGTON (AP) — Mailing a letter is about to get a little more expensive.

Regulators on Tuesday approved a temporary price hike of 3 cents for a first-class stamp, bringing the charge to 49 cents a letter in an effort to help the Postal Service recover from severe mail decreases brought on by the 2008 economic downturn.

Many consumers won't feel the price increase immediately. Forever stamps, good for first-class postage whatever the future rate, can be purchased at the lower price until the new rate is effective Jan. 26.

The higher rate will last no more than two years, allowing the Postal Service to recoup $2.8 billion in losses. By a 2-1 vote, the independent Postal Regulatory Commission rejected a request to make the price hike permanent, though inflation over the next 24 months may make it so.

The surcharge ""will last just long enough to recover the loss,"" Commission Chairman Ruth Y. Goldway said.

Bulk mail, periodicals and package service rates will rise 6 percent, a decision that drew immediate consternation from the mail industry. Its groups have opposed any price increase beyond the current 1.7 percent rate of inflation, saying charities using mass mailings and bookstores competing with online retailer Amazon would be among those who suffer. Greeting card companies also have criticized the plans.

""This is a counterproductive decision,"" said Mary G. Berner, president of the Association of Magazine Media. ""It will drive more customers away from using the Postal Service and will have ripple effects through our economy — hurting consumers, forcing layoffs and impacting businesses.""

Berner said her organization will consider appealing the decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals.

For consumers who have cut back on their use of mail for correspondence, the rate increase may have little impact on their pocketbooks.

""I don't know a whole lot of people who truly, with the exception of packages, really use snail mail anymore,"" said Kristin Johnson, a Green Bay, Wis., resident who was shopping in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, while visiting relatives and friends. ""It's just so rare that I actually mail anything at this point.""

The Postal Service is an independent agency that does not depend on tax money for its operations but is subject to congressional control. Under federal law, it can't raise prices more than the rate of inflation without approval from the commission.

The service says it lost $5 billion in the last fiscal year and has been trying to get Congress to pass legislation to help with its financial woes, including an end to Saturday mail delivery and reduced payments on retiree health benefits.

The figures through Sept. 30 were actually an improvement for the agency from a $15.9 billion loss in 2012.

The post office has struggled for years with declining mail volume as a result of growing Internet use and a 2006 congressional requirement that it make annual $5.6 billion payments to cover expected health care costs for future retirees. It has defaulted on three of those payments.

The regulators Tuesday stopped short of making the price increases permanent, saying the Postal Service had conflated losses it suffered as a result of Internet competition with business lost because of the Great Recession. They ordered the agency to develop a plan to phase out the higher rates once the lost revenue is recouped.

It's unclear where that would take rates for first-class postage in 2016. The regular, inflation-adjusted price would have been 47 cents next year. If inflation rates average 2 percent over the next two years, regulators could deem 49 cents an acceptable price going forward.

The Postal Service has only twice lowered the price of a stamp: in the mid-19th century from 3 cents to 2 cents, and again after the end of World War I. In neither case was the higher price the result of a temporary authorization.

The new price of a postcard stamp, raised by a penny to 34 cents in November, also is effective next month.

The last price increase for stamps was in January, when the cost of sending a letter rose by a penny to 46 cents. A post card also increased by one cent to 33 cents."

The president, who has spent the first four years navigating Washington as much as shaping it, used his platform on Monday to announce that his next four years will be marked by a more assertive approach. The speech wasn't devoid of the classic, Obama-esque ideal that the country itself, and the two political parties in particular, must come together for the common good. But the appeal he made wasn’t so much to the good nature of each individual lawmaker as it was to the need to confront the severity of the issues at hand.

The president talked about protecting entitlement programs upon which the elderly and the most vulnerable in society depend.

“They do not make us a nation of takers,” he declared, in a clear rebuke to the conservative House Republicans that have been his bête noire. “They free us to take the risks that make this country great.

But Obama also gave a nod to items further down on the conventional list of top priorities: climate change and election reform included.

The underlying theme was altogether consistent: it is time for the country's reasonable majority to wrest back the agenda.

For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial, and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years, and forty years, and four hundred years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall.

What the administration now confronts is the issue of legacy. The accomplishments of the first term have given Obama an already exalted status among his base. But inside the White House, there is a tangible sense of hope (and, perhaps, a bit of trepidation) about what’s to come. Immigration reform, the ending of the war in Afghanistan, the protection of gay rights, the passage of gun laws, the execution of health care and banking reform, and the revamping of the tax code and social safety net are all on the docket. The means of addressing them is the great unknown.

What Monday’s speech did, more than anything else, is provide a window into those means. This isn’t the same Obama who, upon coming into office amid an economic crisis, called for an end to the politics of division. It was a more jaded, ostensibly realistic Obama, demanding that divided politics no longer be used as an excuse for inaction and promising to not accept such a cynical status quo.

What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:



“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”



Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing.

The president’s supporters and even casual defenders will, undoubtedly, cheer this second inaugural address in a way that they never fully did the first -- a lofty, historic but somewhat unmemorable speech. His critics will take it as affirmation of a liberal agenda that they’ve often warned is coming once the burdens of reelection are gone.

Those reactions are predictable and, ultimately, disposable. What matters more is the extent to which the president acts upon the vision he outlined. The second inaugural address showcased an unapologetic president. Time will tell if Monday was just a few lines in a speech or a new, dedicated mindset for the nation's leader."

Here are the 19 victims: Andrew Ashcraft, 29.

Story highlights NEW: Granite Mountain Hotshot team fully qualified, staffed and trained, report says NEW: Radio communications were challenging Not since 9/11 had the nation lost so many firefighters in one day. Arizona State Forestry Division commissioned the interagency report.

(CNN) —

Though an in-depth report released Saturday assigned no blame in the death of 19 elite Arizona firefighters, it did raise some key issues about the day the men died.

The firefighters, known as the Granite Mountain Hotshots, died on June 30 fighting wildfires in Arizona. The fire was started by a lightning strike, rapidly spread from one-half acre to several hundred and destroyed more than 100 structures. It took the lives of the 19 hotshots before it was contained.

The interagency report, commissioned by the state, detailed what went wrong in the Yarnell Hill Fire and made recommendations to improve the future safety and efficiency of fire crews, both in Arizona and nationwide.

Who were the firefighters?

The report found the crew was fully qualified, staffed and trained.

But it said fire personnel dealt with radio communications issues throughout that day.

The report also detailed that during a critical part of the day, there was a 30-minute communication gap between the hotshot team and the command center. The communications issues throughout the day resulted in confusion about the hotshot crew’s intentions, movements and location, officials said.

Earlier in the day, the crew had been in one area, but later moved from that point, and officials said they may never know why.

“We have no indication that Operations or anyone else asked the Granite Mountain IHC to move to a new location but we assume they decided this on their own, believing they could reengage and help defend Yarnell,” officials said in the report.

Lookout warned team before fire killed 19

The Yarnell Hill fire was discovered on the evening of June 28. Due to the dangerous terrain and the small amount of fire seen at that point, officials said the decision was made not to put fire personnel in the area at that time. The next morning, the fire had grown to several hundred acres, was moving toward the town of Yarnell.

Fire retardant was dropped on the area and some firefighters were dispatched, according to the report.

The hotshot team was deployed the morning of June 30. The day started with some radios not being programmed with the correct fire tones, which the firefighters were able to work around, officials said. The team then had about a 45-minute hike into the anchor point, which is the spot where they began their efforts.

According to the report, the hotshot team received several weather reports from the National Weather Service during the day; the reports warned of approaching storms and changing wind speeds and directions.

Opinion: When heroes face down fire – and fate

What we now know, from the report, is that the hotshot crew was on top of a ridge and making its way to a designated safety zone when the winds changed erratically again, causing the fire to split and accelerate dramatically, trapping all 19.

The officials who spent more than three months compiling the 116-page report personally delivered it to the families of the hotshot team before releasing it to the media and the public Saturday.

Not since September 11, 2001, had the nation lost so many firefighters in one day.

Gov. Jan Brewer said the deaths represented “as dark a day as I can remember.” A 100-mile procession brought their bodies from the state Capitol, through the community where they perished and back to their hometown of Prescott. Their loss felt especially acutely there as the 19 represented 20% of the city’s fire department.

Vice President Joe Biden spoke at a memorial service attended by thousands. The Granite Mountain Hotshots realized, Biden said that integrity “is measured by whether you respond to the needs of your neighbors.”

And that’s just this week alone.

“Lost in the back and forth this week regarding whether or not to shut down the government over ObamaCare was a real debate about all the other things that this bill will fund,” Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said in a statement Friday.

Coburn, a fiscal hawk who publishes an annual “Wastebook” report, says the funding bill Congress is currently considering is chock full of head-scratching, taxpayer money-wasting government grants. They include: 35 wine projects, including 10 grants to support wine tasting, radio ads about New Jersey blueberries and funding for Organizing Maple Weekend in Massachusetts, with festivities that include a recipe contest.

Coburn also took a swipe at fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who spent 21 hours on a non-filibuster filibuster earlier this week when he spoke against funding ObamaCare.

“When some senators were using flawed and pretend ‘filibuster’ tactics to defund ObamaCare that were destined to fail, they should have instead been focusing on how the CR wastes scarce taxpayer dollars by funding, for example, studies about how Americans view the filibuster,” Coburn said.

Calls to Cruz’s office for comment were not returned.

Elsewhere,"" Coburn continued, ""just this week the government celebrated Christmas in September by funding numerous Christmas tree projects across the country plus a number of other stupid projects like junkets for Chinese wine connoisseurs and a maple syrup recipe contest.”

In the past, Coburn has come down hard on Congress for agreeing to fund grants from the National Science Foundation that included $516,000 for scientists to develop an eco-ATM that will give out cash in exchange for old cell phones and other electronics as well as another $349,862 for a study that checks out of the effects of meditation and self-reflection for math, science and engineers majors.

NSF spokeswoman Dana Topousis has defended the grants to FoxNews.com in the past, and says Coburn shouldn’t get caught up quirky names of projects but instead try to see beyond it.

She pointed to one project in 1996 called “BackRub,” a search engine research project by Stanford University students Larry Page and Sergey Brin that eventually would go on to become Google."

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is consulting with top leaders over the scope of the look-see, reports ABC News. The news network also revealed that Navy Secretary Ray Mabus had already ordered two reviews of Navy and Marine Corps installations after Monday's bloodbath at the Navy Yard in Washington.

The new action came after the Pentagon inspector general questioned cost-cutting measures that a report in Time magazine said could tie in to the attack.

The Navy “did not effectively mitigate access-control risks associated with contractor-installation access” at Navy Yard and other Navy installations, the report by the Department of Defense Inspector General’s office says. Parts of the audit were read to TIME by a federal official with access to the document.



The risks were the result of Navy officials' desires “to reduce access-control costs,"" Time said, and the audit found a ""history of those with criminal records managing to bypass the Navy’s security."" It asserts that 52 ""convicted felons received routine unauthorized installation access, placing military personnel, attendants, civilians in installations at an increased security risk.”



The gunman, Aaron Alexis, was shot dead by police on Monday, but not before at least 12 victims were killed.



Alexis is reported to have had a history of trouble with the law as well as mental health issues. Law enforcement officials told the AP that Alexis, who held a valid pass to access the Navy Yard, suffered from a sleep disorder and paranoia — and hearing voices in his head. His family said he had received treatment, according to the AP.



Officials are questioning how Alexis still had access to the military facility despite his troubles and a history of misconduct.



On CNN, Washington Mayor Vincent Gray remarked, ""It really is hard to believe that someone with a record as checkered as this man could conceivably get, you know, clearance to get ... credentials to be able to get on the base.""



Gray said budget cuts associated with the government sequestration might have led to a poor vetting process for access and security.



""We'll continue with this investigation, but certainly as I look at for example sequestration, which is about saving money in the federal government being spent, that we somehow skimped on what would be available for projects like this and then we put people at risk,"" Gray told CNN.



A blog from Foreign Policy highlights many of the security gaps that face the Navy Yard and other military facilities."

The announcement comes less than a week before Obama is scheduled to hold talks at the White House with President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi of Yemen to discuss repatriation of detainees from his country.

“As the president has said, the United States remains determined to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. He added that the decision to repatriate the two Algerians was being carried out “in consultation with the Congress, and in a responsible manner that protects our national security.”

The move leaves Obama far short of his goal of closing the prison, which now holds 166 inmates, but it was hailed by human rights advocates as a sign that the administration was making a new push after letting closure plans languish since early in his first term.

The move was “the sign we’ve been waiting for,” said Andrea Prasow, senior counter-terrorism counsel for Human Rights Watch.

The decision to send two Algerians home came after “a very senior interagency team conducted an intensive review of this matter” and recommended to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that he approve the transfer, according to Pentagon Press Secretary George Little.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she supported the decision. “This is an important step toward closing the prison once and for all,” she said. “At a cost of $454 million annually — or $2.7 million per detainee — it is in the national security interests of the United States to transfer these detainees to their home countries.”

The two men are among five Algerians still held at Guantanamo. White House aides declined to describe what agreement, if any, had been reached with the Algerian government on the treatment of the detainees. Algeria’s security services have long been known for harsh treatment of Islamic fighters.

But when prisoners have been sent to Algeria in the past, they have been taken into custody by the government, questioned and in many cases quickly released, Prasow said.

“The crucial questions are whether the detainees want to be transferred to Algeria and whether they will face human rights violations there. Closing the detention facility must not mean transferring people to torture, indefinite detention or unfair trials,” said Zeke Johnson, director of Amnesty International’s Security with Human Rights campaign.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said transfer decisions were made after “detailed, specific conversations” about how the receiving country will handle the prisoners.

“The assurances must be tailored to mitigate the specific threat that a detainee may pose, and we must be convinced that the transfer is consistent with our humane treatment standards,” she said. “If we do

not receive credible assurances, the transfer does not occur.”

Transfers take about a month to process after the Pentagon signs off and Congress is notified, administration officials said. They would not say when the prisoners would be sent to Algeria.

A highly visible remnant of President George W. Bush’s counter-terrorism policies, the prison at the U.S. naval base in Cuba has frustrated the Obama White House. Obama pledged during his 2008 campaign to close it, saying the detention center was a “sad chapter” in U.S. history. He failed after fierce opposition in Congress to moving detainees not chosen for repatriation to a prison in the U.S.

But as dozens of Guantanamo’s detainees participated in hunger strikes to protest their indefinite confinement, as well as conditions at the prison, Obama renewed his call for Congress to close it and said he would pursue transfers and other steps to shrink the population.

Eighty-six prisoners, most of them from Yemen, were cleared for conditional transfer out of the prison in 2010. An additional 46 have been classified as impossible to put on trial.

But transfers largely ground to a halt in 2012, when the administration announced a moratorium

on sending detainees back to Yemen after determining that a plan to attack a U.S. airliner was plotted there.

Congress also required the administration to certify that transfers did not pose

a threat to U.S. security. Some lawmakers are moving to eliminate that requirement.

Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) called Friday for Congress to remove the “unnecessary and counterproductive statutory impediments that, for too long,” had impeded prisoner transfers.

Or...rather, any such debates will not be sanctioned. Any GOP candidate who appears on any such debates will be...well, I don't know what will happen to them.

This ultimatum is the ""news-making"" portion of the resolution the RNC has just passed, in which it makes its displeasure over these Clinton projects known. Or rather, more earnestly known -- obviously these complaints have been in the news for weeks. Deep within the resolution, however, is the acknowledgement that the 2012 primary debates were not beneficial to the GOP, and an outline of a sensible plan to improve the way the party handles its primary season debates in 2016.

The ""news-making"" part of the resolution really complicates the ""sensible plan"" part of the resolution, for reasons that I am at a loss to understand.

Here is the resolution that was passed:

The RNC's paramount complaint is that any sort of Hillary Clinton biopic or documentary amounts to a tacit political endorsement. This has been Reince Priebus' argument from the outset.

As I've previously discussed, there is a reality that Priebus is probably missing. One of the proposed ""Hillary Clinton movies"" is actually a documentary that's being created by Charles Ferguson, who helmed the documentary ""Inside Job"" about the financial crisis. It's very likely to be highly critical of Clinton and her husband's administration. As Frank Rich notes: ""It’s impossible to imagine that Ferguson would do a hagiography of Hillary, whose husband’s administration empowered many of the villains in 'Inside Job.'""

Obviously, Rich is making an assumption, but it's not a big leap. The irony I'm imagining, actually, is the CNN documentary providing a lot of fodder for future RNC attack ads. I'm going to go ahead and make plans to write the piece titled, ""RNC Attack Ad Cites CNN Documentary It Tried To Derail.""

Now, as for NBC's proposed Clinton project -- it's a biopic, in which Diane Lane will portray Clinton. This sounds to me like it's going to fit more squarely in the parameters of ""hagiography,"" though I'd prefer to call it ""soft focus melodramatic made-for-teevee cheese."" Now, I doubt that this movie will ultimately conclude anything other than the fact that Clinton is an amazing, historical figure. I'd suggest to Priebus, however, that there will nevertheless be a saving grace here: This Clinton movie is likely to be really, really stupid.

And as I've previously written, I think Peggy Noonan has sort of grokked what it's going to be like, in the end:

It will be a drama about Hillary’s wonderfulness and when it’s done they’ll privately screen it and an executive will say, “We’re going to be accused of liberal bias, we’d better balance it a little.” So they’ll reshoot some scenes and insert things that might make Hillary look bad, but they’ll choose the wrong things, stupid things, and it will make the whole effort look cheesy.

So, this is not something that I'd particularly worry about if I were Priebus. In the end, I think we're looking at one project that will, if anything, hurt Clinton and another project that will, if anything, simply prove to be unhelpful to Clinton.

What I would worry about, if I were in the RNC, is the way Priebus portrays his party as helpless in the face of a few teevee shows. Whatever happened to ""never let them see you sweat""? This whole ""trembling in the face of some movies about Hillary Clinton"" thing is not a good look. Moreover, while I understand that much of this is simply a bit of ""working the refs"" kabuki, Priebus is actually helping to amplify Clinton's whole phenomenon, when he should be trying to promote what his party and its future candidates are all about.

Priebus, however, does have a debate problem, which is addressed in the last part of the RNC resolution. Bringing an ""order to the primary debates"" and ""[ensuring] a reasonable number"" of them? That's a solid plan. Let's definitely never have 20 debates in a primary season again! On this matter, I consider Priebus to be an American hero. (As I'll have to watch all debates that happen, I think of Priebus as being on a mission of mercy, tailored to me, and I really cannot thank him enough.)

I also think that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the RNC angling to put its candidates in debates with moderators who are on the same side of the ideological spectrum. Why not? The singular purpose of the party's primary debates is to help its base make determinations between candidates of a similar ideological strain. Even if this means that Fox News' Chris Wallace serves as moderator for all of them, believe me, Wallace will take that task very seriously.

Over at the Washington Examiner, Byron York agrees that it's the final part of this resolution that really illuminates what's going on in the back of Priebus' mind:

That is what top party officials have wanted to do ever since it became clear that the GOP’s grueling series of twenty-plus debates in 2011 and 2012 created more bloodletting, division, and sometimes embarrassment for the party than enlightenment of voters. Ever since that moment — RNC officials realized it as it was happening but were powerless to stop it — the party has wanted to limit the number of debates and exert more control over who moderated them. That was going to happen even if NBC and CNN had never announced plans for Hillary Clinton programs. And that is what today’s resolution is really all about.

The real question, then, is why did this solid plan for improving the primary debates get inextricably tied to this hysterical garment-rending session over a couple of movies? I don't have a good answer to this question. Maybe the RNC is in this place right now where it can't even move forward without some foil at which to take aim. Maybe it thinks that a decision to limit the number of debates will be met with derision and criticism, and so it's putting forth the Clinton movies as a way of insulating itself from criticism.

The simplest explanation is probably just that any resolution about debates and debate moderators is going to ""make news,"" and the RNC would rather the headline be, ""RNC Takes Stand Against Clinton Movies,"" as opposed to, ""RNC Admits That Its Last Set Of Primary Debates Was Embarrassing.""

Ultimately, however, the RNC is probably not going to get NBC or CNN to bend to its ultimatum. It is not going to be able to stop NBC or CNN (or Telemundo and CNN Espanol) from staging debates. It is not even going to be able to stop Republicans from participating in those debates, if they really want to do so. That's a lot of battles that it can't really win, so why fight them?

Last week, state prison officials refused a request from the compounding pharmacy that created and sold Texas the pentobarbital -- a single-dose drug used in executions -- to return the drug.

Jasper Lovoi, owner of The Woodlands Compounding Pharmacy, claims Texas authorities put him “in the middle of a firestorm” of protesters, hate calls and press requests after letting it leak that he sold eight 2.5-gram doses of pentobarbital to the state for upcoming executions.

Lovoi says he had been promised anonymity by the state.

But Jason Clark, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said the department bought the drug vials legally and won’t return them.

Clark said the state has enough vials to carry out scheduled executions for the remainder of the year.

Death penalty states like Texas, which has executed 505 people since 1981, have been turning to compounding pharmacies to purchase lethal doses of barbiturates used in executions.

The switch comes after the drugs’ primary makers shut off supplies to states following pressure from anti-death penalty advocates.

Compounding pharmacies allow certified specialists to mix ingredients for medicine themselves and sell them. For example, if there is only an adult-dose of a particular drug available, compounding pharmacists can manipulate the active ingredients and change the dosage or strength.

However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not vouch for the validity, safety or effectiveness of drugs made in compounding pharmacies.

Earlier this year, these new go-to drug dens came under scrutiny following a deadly meningitis outbreak that was linked to contaminated injections made at a Massachusetts compounding pharmacy.

In Texas, attorneys for Michael Yowell, 43, had hoped to get a last-minute stay for their client. But minutes before he was taken to the death chamber, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit he and two other condemned prisoners had brought seeking execution delays on grounds the pentobarbital could cause unconstitutional pain and suffering.

He was pronounced dead at 7:11pm CDT (8:11 ET) in Huntsville, Texas.

Yowell was convicted of killing his parents, Johnny and Carol Yowell, in 1998 and setting fire to their home in Lubbock, Texas. According to court records, Yowell told authorities he shot his father and then beat, strangled and killed his mother. He then blew up the house.

Yowell’s grandmother, who lived with them, was killed though Yowell was not convicted in her death.

Last month, the House passed legislation aimed at regulating compounding pharmacies. The bill, which is now in the Senate, would create a national set of standards to track the distribution chain of pharmaceuticals. Proponents say the bill closes a pretty wide gap between state and federal oversight of compounding pharmacies. In the Massachusetts meningitis outbreak, 64 people died and more than 700 people got sick across 20 states from a bad batch of steroids produced at the New England Compounding Center.

Other states like South Dakota and Georgia have had similar problems with purchasing drugs directly through manufacturers.

Georgia's first use of an execution drug obtained through a compounding pharmacy was put on hold in July after the condemned inmate challenged a new state law that bars the release of information about where Georgia obtains its execution drug.

Separately, on Tuesday, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a motion made by Yowell’s attorneys who asked to supervise “every step of the execution process.”

Washington (CNN) – Vice President Joe Biden honored firefighters and public safety officers Thursday evening, telling them “you are always, always there.”

Biden, who formerly served as chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus while in the Senate, also took a moment to tease the friendly crowd about his presidential ambitions, joking that the press “likes to point out that I ran for president twice but I never made it.”

“I want you to know that in 2004, I made it,” Biden said. “I’m a president emeritus of the Delaware Volunteer Fire Association. So I have made it to the presidency.”

The vice president also touted a forthcoming initiative from the Obama administration aimed at improving access to federal funding for families of fallen public safety officers.

“Families of fallen public safety officers have had to wait much, much, much too long for federal benefits that all of us at that table and me have fought so hard to make sure existed,” Biden said.

“That’s why I’m proud to tell you that on Monday – I don’t want to steal his thunder – but a guy’s been working around the clock to fix this. The Attorney General of the United States will have an announcement to make fixing that problem, finally,” Biden said.

Among the many groups of public safety officers to whom Biden gave personalized shout outs were the first responders who battled the deadly blaze caused by a fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas.

“When the call went out, volunteers went out. ... They suited up and they headed out, put on their equipment and they jumped. They jumped into the fray,” Biden said.

“Even then, some of the fire trucks ablaze, even then in the midst of the chaos, they held their ground. They contained the blaze within three hours. They never quit. They never quit. They never quit.”

Nine of those volunteer first responders were killed by the blast."

It tends to confirm findings by political scientists that ideological voting is less common on federal appeals courts than on the Supreme Court. And it illustrates the breadth and importance of the District of Columbia Circuit’s docket.

It may also undercut the Republican critique that the court is underworked. As a matter of raw numbers, there is some support for the charge. But it fails to take account of the court’s distinctive docket.

“Comparing the number of cases it hears to other courts just doesn’t work,” said Eric M. Fraser, an author, with three colleagues, of a new study of the court’s work to be published in the Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy. Mr. Fraser is a former law clerk to Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, who was appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit by Reagan.

On the one hand, the study found, “a typical federal appellate judge may expect to participate in nearly three times the number of merits cases per year than a judge on the D.C. Circuit” — 168 versus 495 in a recent year, by one measure.

On the other hand, Mr. Fraser said, “the types of cases and the types of opinions the court issues are very different.”

Tracey E. George, an expert on the federal appeals courts who teaches law and political science at Vanderbilt University, said assessing judicial productivity was hard.

“It’s obviously not as simple as counting cases,” she said. “If it were all about a court’s cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has no work at all.” The Supreme Court issues perhaps 75 signed decisions in argued cases each term, or about eight per justice."

The poll also found that 49 percent of respondents believe that the president's proposals to increase government spending in key areas are more likely to spur job creation than GOP-backed efforts to cut both spending and taxes.

Additionally, the Bloomberg poll found Republican popularity at a record low. Just 35 percent of respondents said they have a favorable view of the GOP, marking the lowest ratings for the party since the poll began three years ago. The Republican rating also marked a six point drop over the last six months.

The poll surveyed 1,003 adults between February 15 and February 18, with a three percent margin of error.

Obama's popularity has been on an upward trend in the months since his reelection.

In December, a CBS poll showed Obama's strongest numbers since the death of Osama Bin Laden in May 2011.

(CNN) – President Barack Obama has directed Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to hold accountable those who made mistakes in the Internal Revenue Service's scrutiny of conservative groups.

The president released a statement Tuesday night firmly condemning the IRS' action after a report from the agency's inspector general found that the IRS used ""inappropriate criteria"" to identify potential political applications and then forwarded those applications to a team of specialists for review.



The report found that the criteria resulted in substantial delays in processing of applications and the request of unnecessary information about the groups.

Saying he's ""now had the opportunity"" to look at the report, Obama said the findings are ""intolerable and inexcusable.""

""The federal government must conduct itself in a way that's worthy of the public's trust, and that's especially true for the IRS. The IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity,"" he said. ""This report shows that some of its employees failed that test.""

Obama has ordered Lew to ensure that each of the inspector general's recommendations are implemented soon, ""so that such conduct never happens again.""

""But regardless of how this conduct was allowed to take place, the bottom line is, it was wrong. Public service is a solemn privilege,"" the president said. ""I expect everyone who serves in the federal government to hold themselves to the highest ethical and moral standards. So do the American people. And as president, I intend to make sure our public servants live up to those standards every day.""

His statement goes further than his comments on Monday about the issue, in which he said ""if"" personnel ""in fact"" did what the IRS admitted it had done, then their mistakes would be considered ""outrageous.""

The Associated Press

Members of the Ogala Sioux Tribe are voting Tues. to decide whether to permit alcohol on their reservation

Critics of the legalization say it would only exacerbate the reservation%27s problems

Proponents argue that profits would be used for education and treatment centers

PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) — Jobs and confidence are in short supply on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where the rugged beauty of South Dakota's Badlands contrasts sharply with dilapidated houses, rusted-out vehicles and trash in the streets — symbols of troubles blamed largely on bootlegged alcohol from a tiny Nebraska town.

Members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe are voting all day Tuesday on whether to give up the fight against bootlegging by allowing alcohol to be sold on the reservation — the last place in the state's American Indian territory where it's not allowed. Profits would be used for education, detoxification and treatment centers, for which there is currently little to no funding.

""Alcohol is here. They're kidding themselves if they think we're a dry reservation,"" said Larry Eagle Bull, a recovering alcoholic and one of nine council members who supported the vote. ""Prohibition is not working. Alcohol is going to stay. We need to get our people educated about it.""

Critics say legalization would only exacerbate the reservation's troubles. Alcohol is blamed for some of the highest rates of domestic abuse, suicide, infant mortality, unemployment and violent crime in Indian Country.

Both sides in the debate agree something must be done to limit the scourge of alcohol on the Lakota people. They also share a goal of putting out of business the current main suppliers of booze for tribal members — four stores in Whiteclay, Neb., two miles south of Pine Ridge, that sell millions of cans of beer a year.

There are 43,000 tribal members, and 26,000 — including a large number of children — live on the reservation. The tribe has distributed 4,000 ballots, and that would represent a good turnout compared to past elections.

Many tribal members live on Whiteclay's barren streets to avoid arrest on the reservation for being drunk. Some people try to barter vegetables, electronics and other things for alcohol. One man recently had a store clerk repeatedly try to run through a sale for a couple of bottles on his debit card, but the transaction was rejected due to insufficient funds.

The stores have posted fliers urging customers to contact their tribal council representative if they don't want the businesses to close.

Owners didn't want to comment on Tuesday's vote, though Stuart Kozal, co-owner of the Jumping Eagle, said tribal members seem to be evenly divided.

""I think the vote, one way or the other, is going to be close,"" he said.

Aloysius White Dress, one of Whiteclay's homeless, said even though he drinks alcohol, he opposes legalization because of the damage it has done.

""There's too much drunks on the reservation,"" he said. ""People are miserable on the reservation.""

Federal law bans the sale of alcohol on Native American reservations unless the tribal council allows it. Pine Ridge, the only dry reservation in South Dakota, legalized alcohol for two months in 1970s, but the ban was quickly restored. An attempt to lift prohibition in 2004 also failed.

Opponents of the latest effort, including tribal president Bryan Brewer, believe a vote in favor of legal sales is a vote for alcoholism and the problem only will get worse.

""It's destroying our families and children,"" he said. ""It's affected every family on the reservation. If it's legal, I anticipate the use will go up. Abuse of women and children will go up. A lot of people are saying we'll have all this money for treatment, and that's not true.""

Most profits from alcohol sales would go to the distributors, Brewer said. The tribe, ultimately, would have very little left to fund meaningful treatment and education, he said.

A 14-page tribal council draft of the law offers no specifics about funding or required qualifications for the people who would run the operation. The proposed law calls for a new department and a full-time director to administer and enforce the law. A new commission comprised of nine members, one from each reservation district, also would be created to guide the director, buy the alcohol, open and operate the liquor stores, hire employees and investigate violations.

Brewer said there are problems with the document that need to be resolved if Tuesday's vote succeeds. Eagle Bull acknowledged it would be amended and a hearty debate would follow legalization before any law takes effect.

The council's plan calls for two detoxification facilities, one in the eastern part of the reservation and one in the west, and treatment and counseling programs for adults, youth and families.

Tribal members would lead the effort, Eagle Bull said.

""They'd rather hear it from one of their own who has dealt with the effects of alcohol,"" he said."

Congressional Republicans seem hell-bent on denying the most disadvantaged among us healthcare, unemployment benefits and, perhaps worst of all, food stamps, from which the House of Representatives slashed $40 billion last month. Elizabeth Drew, writing in Rolling Stone, calls it “The Republicans’ War on the Poor.”

You can attribute these benefit cuts to plain meanness with a dose of political calculation thrown in, as Drew does. But there may be another explanation than congenital cruelty: Republicans believe they are adhering to a principle that they place above every other value, including compassion. That principle is the need to punish individuals whom they view as undeserving.

Though we Americans love to brag about our decency and concern for others, the punitive gene runs deep in our national DNA. It goes back to the Puritans, who, while professing charitableness and community, had a hard vision of life. They subscribed to the Protestant idea that, since you couldn’t know if you were one of the “elect,” predestined for salvation, you had to look for signs. A major one is a productive life.

The sociologist Max Weber fastened on this Protestant work ethic as the basis of Western civilization’s material success. As he saw it, capitalism was a by-product of the desire for grace. For the Protestants, hard work was not only a potential sign of personal salvation. It became a sign of national salvation.

The United States was particularly fertile ground for this. It was not only a Protestant nation, it took pride in being a classless society, a meritocracy — in which the secular elect would become just as important as the religious. The country’s governing principle was, and still is, that anyone can make it here if he or she is just willing to put in the necessary elbow grease.

This may be why no country seems to worship success as much as the United States. Our success is always perceived to be earned. This is American bedrock — our primary myth remains the social mobility of the Horatio Alger stories.

But if the work ethic was secularized and popularized, it was also politicized. If every individual was responsible for his or her own destiny — short of natural disasters, which some conservatives see as divine punishment for various cultural transgressions — there was no need for government interventions to redress inequalities.

In a world where everyone is on their own, help is not just wasteful; it is ungodly and un-American. If we are responsible for our success, we are also responsible for our failure.

It is impossible to know whether the modern Republican Party exploited self-reliance to destroy big government or sought to destroy big government as a principle of self-reliance. Whichever, this is now deeply embedded in modern conservatism.

When U.S. conservatives cut unemployment benefits, it is because giving the unemployed money allegedly discourages them from working. When they cut food stamps, it is because they claim recipients are gaming the system, though there is virtually no evidence to support this. Representative Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), a Senate candidate, proposed last week that any child receiving lunches through the federal school lunch program be required to work to earn the food.

But Republicans wouldn’t be proposing these hardships if there weren’t a sizable contingent of Americans supporting them. Presumably on the basis that the disadvantaged aren’t really disadvantaged. They are unworthy.

Slashing benefits is only cruel if you are hurting the deserving. But in the conservatives’ view, the poor are never deserving. So you can hack away with a sense of righteousness. Poverty, they insist, is a choice.

This may help explain the conservatives’ anger at anyone who purports to help the poor. Doing so violates the sense of justice for many on the right. It isn’t just that conservatives hate government for taking taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars. They hate it because it rewards indolence — where politics conjoins with sinfulness.

This has a powerful appeal. And it goes a long way toward answering the liberal quandary of why so many Americans who could benefit from government programs oppose them and work against their own self-interest.

The answer goes back to those Puritan roots. We are a nation of scolds and scourges. We hate the idea that someone can get something he or she didn’t earn. So what’s the matter with Kansas may just be that many Americans believe in something more important than self-interest, more important than compassion. Punishment.

Many Americans, certainly many Republicans, are more interested in making sure that the “undeserving” are not being rewarded than making sure the deserving are rewarded.

Sure it is punitive. Meting out punishment, however, is something we love to do. Which is why one of our major political parties can subsist on it. The Republican Party is the punishment party.

All this is worth remembering at this time of year. We may say we like giving. But a whole lot of us resent the taking. Or put another way, it is better to give so long as no one needs to receive.

Open-air spaces like the World War II Memorial have been barricaded since the federal government shut down last week, but an organizer for the rally told the Washington Examiner that the National Park Service will allow the rally and march.

As Breitbart News reported, immigration activists have called for volunteers to get themselves arrested at the rally in acts of civil disobedience.

The event will be a culmination of rallies across the country over the weekend in which immigration activists demonstrated in 41 states demanding amnesty.

A variety of immigration activist organizations, along with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the AFL-CIO, are organizing the event, which they claim will attract 10,000 people.

Lawmakers in Congress like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R-CA) and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) are expected to be at the event. Members of the House are trying to pass immigration reform bills that will allow them to go to conference with the Senate, which passed its comprehensive immigration bill in June that provided a pathway to citizenship for all of the country’s illegal immigrants.

The Congressional Budget Office determined that bill would reduce the wages of working class Americans while not solving the country’s illegal immigration problem.

House Republicans have been reportedly working under the radar on immigration reform, and Pelosi has said Democrats are willing to do “whatever it takes” to get to conference with the Senate. House Republican leaders have also expressed support in moving immigration reform legislation forward. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is the chairwoman of the House Republican conference, told Univision’s Al Punto on Sunday that “there’s still time” for immigration reform and that it is a “priority” for Republicans.

“We must pass immigration reform,” McMorris Rodgers said.

A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) indicated that immigration reform will be next on the House’s agenda after the shutdown and the debt ceiling debates are resolved."
http://news.yahoo.com/safety-fears-spur-regulations-trampoline-gyms-071921972.html,,[],Safety fears spur regulations for trampoline gyms,"PROVO, Utah (AP) — Stephen Merrill was finishing his freshman year of college two years ago when he and a group of friends went to an indoor trampoline park in Utah for a day of flipping, jumping and bouncing.

At one point, Merrill leaped from a platform into a pit full of foam blocks, and he shot right through them and landed on his head. He broke a vertebra in his neck, and was left paralyzed from the neck down.

Merrill's injury underscores recent warnings from doctors and government officials about the dangers of the jump gyms amid a heightened effort to regulate the indoor trampoline parks as they have become a popular rain-or-shine suburban entertainment for birthday parties and summer camps.

""Anything where something like that can happen, I mean, it's such a devastating injury,"" the 22-year-old Merrill said of his mishap in Provo. ""It doesn't seem like things are properly regulated if something like that is possible.""

Citing broken necks, shattered leg bones and one death, some doctors say the parks are dangerous and can lead to serious injuries that eclipse any benefits. Governments are starting to take notice, with proposed regulations in Utah and California among the first attempts in the country to address concerns about safety in the burgeoning industry.

Operators of the trampoline gyms say severe injuries are rare and safety fears are overblown.

They claim an injury rate lower than organized sports such as baseball or soccer and point out the gyms offer a place for adults and kids to have fun and get much-needed exercise.

The parks are typically giant warehouses filled with a series of trampolines that allow customers to bounce every which direction, slam-dunk basketballs and do gymnastics moves. Some parks feature angled trampolines sloping up the sides and pits filled with brick-size foam blocks. The industry has grown rapidly, from a handful of centers in the Western U.S. in 2007 to about 160 throughout the world, according to ASTM International, a standards-development organization.

Story continues

For safety, many of the gyms post staffers around trampolines like lifeguards to enforce rules and require jumpers to first sign a waiver.

Emergency room doctors in one Utah county say that's not enough, and they've asked the health board to step in.

""You'll see a lot of these very severe, open wounds that you don't see unless you're in a high-velocity type of injury,"" Dr. Craig Cook, trauma director at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center. ""This is like a war type of injury or a motor vehicle crash.""

Trauma staff at the hospital say they saw 52 injuries requiring multiple doctor visits from area jump gyms from May 2011 to November 2012, according to their emergency room records. Most of the patients are young men around 19 years old, they say, and have had injuries such as dislocated feet, brain hemorrhaging and paralysis.

Misty Uribe, who manages Lowes Extreme Air Sports in nearby Provo, said her gym already follows many of the health board proposals, but she's concerned the industry has been unfairly targeted.

Uribe said her center sees few injuries compared to the number of people that participate, citing one major injury for every 20,000 visitors. That was Merrill, and she said his jump violated the facility's rules but that the location still took steps to make the pits safer.

""My concern is, once they start with this, where is it going to end?"" she said of the proposed regulations.

The Utah County Health Board is considering proposals that stipulate gyms must supervise the activities, report their injury rates to the county and warn jumpers about the risks beyond having them sign a waiver. The board will have a public discussion on the proposals this fall.

""We do feel like we have an obligation to inform the public about safety risks out there, especially when it's just open to general public,"" said Dr. Joseph Miner, executive director of the Utah County Health Department.

The Utah proposals are partly modeled after legislation pending in California that would create an inspection program for the parks akin to regulations for amusement park rides, in addition to requirements about insurance, employee training and injury reporting. The bill has been promoted by a Coronado woman whose 30-year-old son died days after breaking his neck at an Arizona trampoline park in 2012.

In Orem, the jump gym Get Air Hang Time has posted signs warning of rules and risks of ""serious catastrophic injury or death"" from the activity. In addition to requiring participants to sign a waiver, the gym requires jumpers to watch a safety video.

""We try to make sure that people understand what this activity is all about and that the risks are there just like any other recreational activities,"" owner Aaron Cobabe said.

Cobabe said his gym saw more than 150,000 visitors from July 2012 to July 2013, but during that time had about 11 major injuries that required multiple doctor visits.

""The vast majority of people that come in our facility,"" he said, ""enjoy the activity and leave without any injuries.""

Before Becoming An Editor', 'She Was A Reporter Covering U.S. Economic Policy']",Congressional Republicans rush to develop plan to reopen government,"Congressional Republicans rushed late Friday to develop a new plan for reopening the government and avoiding a first-ever default in hopes of crafting a strategy that can win the support of the White House before financial markets open Monday.

Talks on Capitol Hill advanced with a new urgency after President Obama rejected House Speaker John A. Boehner’s (R) offer to raise the debt limit through late November to give the parties time to negotiate a broader budget deal.

Briefing reporters after financial markets closed for the week, White House press secretary Jay Carney praised a “new willingness” among Republicans to end the government shutdown — now in its 12th day — and to acknowledge that default on the national debt “would be catastrophically damaging.”

But with the Treasury Department due to exhaust its borrowing authority in just six days, Carney said the president would not agree to go through another round of economy-rattling talks in six weeks, just before the Christmas shopping season.

“It at least looks as if there’s a possibility of making some progress here,” Carney said. But, “we have to remove these demands for leverage essentially using the American people and the American economy.”

Where U.S. is feeling the shutdown

Read about people's experiences with the shutdown across the nation.

Before Carney spoke, Obama telephoned Boehner and the two men agreed to keep talking, aides said. Afterward, GOP senators marched into Boehner’s office and counseled him to adopt an approach they had presented to Obama earlier in the day, during their own meeting at the White House.

With Republicans getting battered in public opinion polls over the shutdown, Senate GOP leaders urged Boehner to join them in supporting a single, big-bang measure that would open the government and raise the debt limit in one fell swoop.

“I laid out some of those ideas, and the question is, can the House find a center of gravity to open the government up around those ideas,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said after exiting the speaker’s office with Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.). The two men, former House members, have been close friends with Boehner for almost 20 years.

Details were still fluid late Friday, but the latest 23-page draft of the emerging measure would immediately end the shutdown and fund federal agencies for six months at current spending levels. It would maintain deep automatic cuts known as the sequester, but give agency officials flexibility to decide where the cuts should fall.

In addition, the proposal would also raise the debt limit through Jan. 31, 2014. Lawmakers were considering whether to include a provision that would direct the House and Senate Budget committees to immediately enter negotiations over broader budget issues and to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2014. If an agreement could be reached, it would clear a path for another increase in the debt limit later that month, without additional drama.

In exchange, Republicans were seeking what they called a few “fig leafs” — minor adjustments to Obama’s new health-care initiative. The first would delay for two years a 2.3-percent tax on medical devices that is unpopular in both parties. The second would require internal auditors to ensure that people who get tax subsidies to buy health insurance are in fact eligible.

Another option under consideration but not included in the latest draft would reduce the number of workers required to receive health coverage from an employer, by changing the definition of a full-time worker from 30 hours a week to 40 hours a week.

In an interview with a Kentucky newspaper Friday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signaled that he was helping to shepherd the effort to reach a compromise with Democrats.

“We’re in one of those situations right now where it’s going to require some sort of coming together here to get past the current impasse. And I’m going to continue to work on that,” McConnell told the Herald-Leader of Lexington.

By late Friday, talks over the measure were proceeding on multiple tracks. In the Senate, negotiations had advanced far enough that Senate Republicans — led by Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — sent draft language to their Democratic counterparts, including Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), a trusted ally of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

Meanwhile, Boehner was huddled with his top lieutenants in a hideaway on the first floor of the Capitol, reviewing his options over Chinese carryout and cigarettes.

The Senate proposal differs in critical ways from the approach Boehner sold earlier this week to his rank and file, who had insisted on using the threat of the shutdown to try to undermine the Affordable Care Act.

Given those demands, Boehner had offered to lift the debt limit for six weeks to clear space for negotiations over overhauling the tax code, trimming federal entitlement spending and reforming the health care law. The government would remain shuttered unless Obama agreed to those talks.

House Republicans also proposed to roll back a portion of the sequester cuts, a top Democratic priority. But those cuts would have to be replaced with equal reductions to Medicare spending, such as Obama’s proposal to make well-off seniors pay more for coverage.

It was unclear how long the House offer would have kept the government open without further negotiations. But House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) quickly blasted the Senate plan to extend temporary funding for six months, calling it “disastrous.”

“It is a punt to the executive branch for the Congress not to exercise judgement about where money is spent,” Rogers said in a statement.

Boehner has scheduled a meeting of the entire GOP conference for 9 a.m. Saturday, but it was unclear whether he would present details of the proposal emerging in the Senate. Senate Republicans were hopeful that Boehner could build support for the plan and push it through the House first.

That could not only help get it to Obama’s desk faster, but also preserve Boehner’s political standing by avoiding a repeat of the New Year’s Day deal over the so-called “fiscal cliff.”

Then, a Senate-passed measure to stop scheduled tax hikes for the vast majority of Americans won the support of only 85 Republicans in the House. More than 150 GOP lawmakers opposed the bill, including some of Boehner’s top deputies, and the humiliating loss emboldened conservatives to vote against his re-election as speaker.

Senate Republicans cautioned, however, that Boehner doesn’t have much time to work things out. GOP senators are eager not only to get the government back to work but to raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit before Thursday, when the Treasury Department has said it would exhaust its ability to conserve cash. Without an increase in the debt limit, independent analysts say the Treasury would begin missing payments by Nov. 1.

GOP senators and aides said Boehner has been told that Senate Republicans will negotiate their own pact with Senate Democrats if he fails to act.

“From my point of view, it’d be better for the country if the House led,” Graham said. “It’s important that we continue to talk among ourselves as senators,” he added, but “if it came out of the House, it would be better.”

Even as negotiations progressed rapidly in the Senate, the uncertainty over procedure cast a shadow of doubt over their ultimate success.

“It’s encouraging to me that the president is now negotiating with both the House and the Senate, after saying that he wouldn’t,” Collins said. “But it is very uncertain to me what the outcome is going to be.”

(CNN) —

In a tent on the lawn just in front of the United States Capitol, immigration reform advocates are entering their second week without food to protest congressional inaction on legislation that would create a road to citizenship for 11 million aspiring Americans.

The core group at the “Fast for Families” has gone 13 days surviving only on water — including Eliseo Medina of the Service Employees International Union, Dae Joong Yoon of the National Korean American Service and Education Consortium and Cristian Avila with the group Mi Familia Vota. They have pledged to continue their fast until immigration reform is enacted by Congress or until doctors tell them their lives are at risk.

Sally Kohn

Last week, Vice President Joe Biden and Cecilia Muñoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council in the White House, visited the fasters. This week, during a speech in San Francisco about the urgent need for immigration reform, President Obama gave a shout-out to those fasting. The president said, “We hear you. The whole country is with you.”

Which is, of course, partially true. The fact is that a strong majority of Americans do indeed support the goals of those fasting and want a comprehensive immigration law that includes a road to citizenship. According to a recent poll from the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute, at least 73% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans support such a measure. Not only that, but about three-in-four voters in key Republican-represented swing Congressional districts also support immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship.

Win McNamee/Getty Image Eliseo Medina, who is fasting, says he has ""a hunger for an end to a system that creates such misery.""

So who, exactly, isn’t with the fasters? Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. If the immigration reform bill already passed by the Senate were brought for a vote in the House, it would likely pass — because 29 House Republicans have indicated their support, including many from those swing districts and districts with growing Latino communities. Yet Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner refuses to give the bill a vote.

Yeah, you read that correctly — a bill that would bring relief to millions of undocumented immigrant families just in time for the holidays, a bill that a strong majority of voters in both parties support, a bill that everyone from community groups to business groups resoundingly supports, a bill that would actually pass both Houses of Congress and become law despite our historic levels of gridlock — that bill isn’t even being brought up for a vote because John Boehner just doesn’t want to do it. Such is the sad state of so-called leadership in the Republican Party today.

If you haven’t seen the video in which teen activists confront Boehner while he’s eating his breakfast at a diner and tell him their stories of how immigrant families are being ripped apart every day in America, it’s worth a watch. Boehner says he’ll “try to find a way to move a bill forward.” But in fact, he has been the one singlehandedly blocking a vote.

So the brave souls in the tent in front of the Capitol continue not to eat. Are they hungry? Sure. But, as Eliseo Medina, a son of Mexican migrant farmworkers, told the Washington Post, “(T)here is a deeper hunger within me, a hunger for an end to a system that creates such misery among those who come here to escape poverty and violence in search of the American dream.”

The juxtaposition is powerful. At a diner near the Capitol, you have Boehner casually dumping salt on his plate of food while seeming completely uninterested in the plight of the two teens who are telling him how their families have been torn apart by America’s broken immigration policies. In a tent near the Capitol, advocates are literally starving themselves to protest Boehner’s callous inaction.

This Thanksgiving, may we remember the story of our nation’s founding — not always a simple story for all involved, and certainly not since, but at it essence, a story of people coming to a new land seeking new opportunity.

And when we sit down to eat our turkey and fixings, may we remember those who are going without food to support the millions of aspiring Americans whose families cannot be together this holiday season because of our broken laws.

And may we pray that John Boehner, sitting with his own family and saying grace, can find it in his heart and political calculus to bestow grace on others — and finally let immigration reform have a vote.

The name-calling continues in the U.S. Senate.

Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, a Republican, lashed out Monday at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid via Twitter and called the Democrat ""an idiot"" for his comments comparing Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy last week.

""The people of New Orleans and that area, they were hurt but nothing in comparison to what happened to people in New York and New Jersey,"" Reid said Friday, according to his remarks in the Congressional Record.

The comments came during debate on an initial $9.7 billion emergency relief package to pay for Sandy flood insurance claims.

Vitter tweeted Reid ""gravely insulted"" residents of the Gulf Coast, who were devastated by Katrina's wrath in 2005.

""Katrina and Sandy caused real human misery,"" Vitter tweeted. ""By most measures, Katrina was the worst natural disaster in history.""

A few hours after Vitter's tweet, Reid issued a statement about his comments on disaster relief.

""In my recent comments criticizing House Republicans for threatening to betray Congress' tradition of providing aid to disaster victims in a timely fashion regardless of region, I simply misspoke,"" Reid said. ""I am proud to have been an advocate for disaster victims in the face of Republican foot-dragging, from Hurricane Katrina to Hurricane Sandy, from fires in the West to tornadoes in the Midwest.""

Reid went on to note in his statement that he's worked with Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., on helping people along the Gulf Coast after Katrina and vowed to ""advocate on their behalf until the region is fully recovered.""

Some numbers about Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy:

There were 1,833 deaths in Katrina vs. at least 125 in Sandy. Damage from Sandy in the United States, concentrated largely in New York and New Jersey, is estimated to cost $62 billion. Katrina caused $128 billion in damage, when adjusted for inflation. These numbers come from a combination of government reports and the Associated Press.

The House is expected to consider a second installment of Sandy aid on Jan. 15, with this measure providing about $50 billion."

Then the group moved to their seats for the invocation and pledge of allegiance. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice introduced dignitaries including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

“Welcome everyone,” former First Lady Laura Bush greeted the crowd in the bright Texas sunshine. “Welcome to all of our friends and family who joined us today.”

Laura Bush greeted President Obama and his wife, Michelle, and the former presidents, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and their spouses, and her father-in-law and mother-in-law.

For George W. Bush, now 66, the dedication of the 23-acre complex, housing the presidential library, museum and policy institute, is a coming-out party of sorts as the former chief executive has stayed in the background in recent years.

Also in attendance will be NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and former heads of state including former Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain, Ehud Olmert of Israel and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy as well as Spanish President Jose Maria Aznar.

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who leads the advisory board of the George W. Bush Institute, is also expected to speak.

Former Bush chiefs of staff Andrew Card and Joshua Bolten arrived in the predawn hours after spending the night at a gathering of former White House staff at the Katy Trail Ice House.

Card called the celebration “a phenomenal reunion” that “generates a flood of fantastic memories.”

The president and First Lady Michelle Obama arrived in Dallas on Wednesday.

“I have a terrific relationship with a number of our successors,” Bolten said. “While we have different ideologies, we’ve been in their shoes and we wish them well.”

Card added, “We are truly empathetic for the burden they carry. Too many people look at the presidency as a partisan seat, and it’s not. It’s a burden, and we know from seeing it up close what a lonely and highly personal burden it can be, making a decision and carrying the consequences.”

Card and Bolten called Bush a “courageous leader” who stood by his decisions and said they hoped that, through the museum, the public would get a better understanding of the challenges he faced.

“I hope people come away with a recognition that this wasn’t a president who chased popularity,” Bolten said, although Bush has fared better in the polls of late.

More than 8,000 are expected to attend the dedication of the $250-million facility, the 13th presidential library operated by the National Archives. The building houses 43,000 artifacts, 70 million pages of paper records and 200 million emails, the largest digital archive of any presidential library.

Tickets will be $16 when it opens to the public May 1.

Connie and Alan Herbert, who also attended the library groundbreaking, traveled to Dallas from Chicago to attend the event.

“I am a huge George W. Bush fan,” said Connie Herbert, adding that the library “is not about him, it’s about his presidency.”

Alan Herbert, who retired from running a medical device company, said the event may increase Bush’s popularity.

“Polls show it already has increased. I think most people admire the fact that he hasn’t criticized Obama -- he’s taking the high road,” Herbert said.

The couple said they were also excited to see other dignitaries.

“It’s not often you get to see all five presidents,” he said, noting the event highlights the civility of American politics in which “there’s a higher calling -- they come together at times like this.”

Protesters were expected on the periphery of the dedication Thursday, but were not visible from the library. Many of those filing onto campus were longtime Bush fans, including Texans sporting gold “W” lapel pins.

“He served the people of Texas well,” said Rick Witherspoon of Dallas, who works in the food industry and brought his wife, Evelyn, to honor both George and former First Lady Laura Bush.

“His whole family is dedicated to public service,” Witherspoon said, “The United States is very lucky to have people of their caliber.”

Tribune Purchase,"The recent plunge in ratings, readership, revenue, and credibility doesn’t frighten the media — but the idea of diversity-of-thought sure does. With the news breaking Monday that the Koch Brothers might be interested in purchasing the Tribune Co., the media campaign to stop that potential sale has already begun.

Media writer Jim Romenesko is currently offering anonymity to Tribune Co. “journalists” willing to comment on the news. As expected, in-between a bunch of nonsense about how important objectivity is in media, they’re obviously seething over the idea of working for the dreaded Brothers Koch:

To survive so much (and to have done some pretty damn amazing work in the process) it’s extremely disheartening to know serious bids are being entertained to sell to the Kochs.

Murdoch, for all his flaws, is a newspaper man. The Kochs are not. I have no faith in their belief in the importance of a free and robust watchdog press. Frankly, such a press seems antithetical to their goals and harmful to their influence in the political process.

Another:

The news is a bit terrifying given the idea that the Koch bros. pitched “media” as the third prong of a strategy to push their political and social ideals onto a wider audience.

It is pretty obvious that this will be The Narrative the media-collective as a whole will start to spin (Politico’s Dylan Byers is already tweeting it out) in the hopes of quashing any potential sale. What we’re talking about is a campaign of peer pressure within the provincial media to pressure the Tribune Co. to reject the Kochs’ offer (if there is one).

Naturally, this campaign will be disguised in the lofty ideal of “objective journalism,” which has been the media’s Big Lie for decades. But the real goal will be to bully one of their own into protecting the media’s ideological purity.

The most laughable concern is that of non-newspaper men purchasing newspapers. In today’s multi-national world, people without a background in media are going to end up as owners or part owners of media outlets. Furthermore, the Kochs probably own all kinds of successful businesses they lack a personal background in. But they are billionaires because they have hired the right people to run them.

This happens every day in business at this level. And shouldn’t “journalists” have at least a basic understanding of this reality?

Sheriff’s spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said the department’s investigation was ongoing and declined to comment on the specifics of the search warrants released this week.

But she reiterated previous comments from Sheriff Bill Gore, who said Hannah “was not a willing participant.”

“As Sheriff Gore said earlier in the week, Hannah is a victim in every sense of the word,” Caldwell said in an email. “Our follow-up investigation has not changed that sentence.”

The multistate search for the Lakeside teen began Aug. 4, when the bodies of her mother and 8-year-old brother were found in James DiMaggio’s burning home in eastern San Diego County. Hannah and DiMaggio were found six days later, in a remote stretch of Idaho backcountry about 75 miles north of Boise.

Hannah was rescued; authorities said DiMaggio was shot and killed by FBI agents.

The search warrants provided some insight into the investigation, including the communication between Hannah and DiMaggio. Letters from Hannah were among the items seized from his home, the documents showed, and investigators said the teen and DiMaggio “called each other approximately 13 times” before their cellphones were shut off about 4 p.m. Aug. 4.

The documents did not specify during what time period the calls occurred. They also did not detail what the letters -- along with a handwritten note that was seized from DiMaggio’s property -- said.

Investigators also collected duct tape and handcuff boxes from DiMaggio’s home, along with a Yosemite camping printout, cut electrical cords, model rocket containers and two used condoms, the documents said.

Computers, papers, photos and a journal were among the items seized from the Andersons’ Lakeside apartment, additional warrants showed.

Authorities allege DiMaggio set up a trap by asking the family to come to his home so he could say goodbye before he moved to Texas.

Christina Anderson’s body was found in a standalone garage, with blood near her head and a crowbar nearby, the warrants said. Her son’s body was later found burned in the home. Both had been “tortured and killed,” the documents noted.

The family’s “medium brown dog” was also found shot to death under a sleeping bag, the warrants said.

Investigators believe the fires were set separately, possibly with timing devices and accelerant, arson specialists said in seeking one of the search warrants. The one fire could not have migrated to the other location, they said.

Investigators later found incendiary devices and “arson wire” on the property, the documents revealed.

DiMaggio was so close a friend to the Anderson family that the children called him “Uncle Jim,” authorities said. One of the warrants noted he and Hannah had been on “multiple day trips,” most recently visiting Malibu and Hollywood.

Hannah, who was reunited with her father after her rescue, attended a fundraiser held on her behalf Thursday at a Lakeside restaurant. She did not speak to reporters as she walked inside, but her father said she “sends her love” and was “doing good day by day.”

THE PRESIDENT: This is a season for millions of Americans to be together with family, to continue long-held holiday traditions, and to show our gratitude to those we love. And along the way, some of us might even watch a little basketball or eat some Christmas cookies, too.

THE FIRST LADY: Here at the White House, over the past few weeks, we’ve had about 70,000 people from all across the country come visit us and look at our holiday decorations.

This year’s theme was “Gather Around: Stories of the Season.”

And in every room of the house, we tried to tell a story about who we are as Americans and how we celebrate the holidays together.

And we made certain to highlight some of the most powerful stories we know – the stories of our outstanding troops, veterans, and military families and their service and sacrifice for our country.

THE PRESIDENT: Our extraordinary men and women in uniform are serving so that the rest of us can enjoy the blessings we cherish during the holidays. But that means many of our troops are far from home and far from family. They’re spending some extra time on the phone with their loved ones back home. Or they’re setting up video chats so they can watch as the presents are opened. So today, we want all of our troops to know that you’re in our thoughts and prayers this holiday season.

And here’s the good news: For many of our troops and newest veterans, this might be the first time in years that they’ve been with their families on Christmas. In fact, with the Iraq war over and the transition in Afghanistan, fewer of our men and women in uniform are deployed in harm’s way than at any time in the last decade.

THE FIRST LADY: And that’s something we all can be thankful for.

And with more and more of our troops back here at home, now it’s our turn to serve – it’s our turn to step up and show our gratitude for the military families who have given us so much.

And that’s why Jill Biden and I started our Joining Forces initiative – to rally all Americans to support our military families in ways large and small.

And again and again, we have been overwhelmed by the response we’ve gotten as folks from across the country have found new ways to give back to these families through their schools, businesses, and houses of worship.

THE PRESIDENT: That’s the same spirit of giving that connects all of us during the holidays. So many people all across the country are helping out at soup kitchens, buying gifts for children in need, or organizing food or clothing drives for their neighbors. For families like ours, that service is a chance to celebrate the birth of Christ and live out what He taught us – to love our neighbors as we would ourselves; to feed the hungry and look after the sick; to be our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper. And for all of us as Americans, regardless of our faith, those are values that can drive us to be better parents and friends, better neighbors and better citizens.

THE FIRST LADY: So as we look to the New Year, let’s pledge ourselves to living out those values by reaching out and lifting up those in our communities who could use a hand up.

THE PRESIDENT: So Merry Christmas, everyone. And from the two of us, as well as Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo…

THE FIRST LADY: And Sunny, the newest Obama.

THE PRESIDENT: We wish you all a blessed and safe holiday season.

THE FIRST LADY: Happy holidays everybody, and God bless."

Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a member of the Senate’s Gang of Eight, told CNN on Wednesday that he thinks the House GOP’s plan to approach immigration reform through piecemeal legislation is acceptable since the bills will simply be combined in conference.

“We would much prefer a big comprehensive bill but any way that the House can get there is okay by us,” Schumer said. “I actually am optimistic that we will get this done. I’ve had a lot of discussions with members of both parties in the House. Things are moving in the right direction.”

Schumer said House Republicans now appear more open than ever to granting amnesty to illegal aliens, and are going to use the strategy of passing a large group of bills addressing specific immigration issues to get to a conference with the Senate bill. “My initial reaction was the House wasn’t going to take up any bill,” Schumer said. “That would have been very bad, no bill. Now they’re doing it in pieces.”

Schumer added that he thinks “a couple of their pieces are very similar to ours.”

Schumer is the latest amnesty proponent to admit publicly the end game strategy is to get to a conference with the Senate bill by having the House pass a group of bills. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has all but promised the same thing, as have House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI).

Schumer’s fellow Gang of Eight member, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), publicly admitted the same goal a few weeks ago when he pleaded with leftwing activists at the Center for American Progress to help get them to conference.

Ultimately, former Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) claimed in an op-ed on Wednesday that this is all part of the “secret Republican strategy to secure amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.”

“The names may have changed, but the tactics remain the same,” Hayworth wrote. “After decades of promises to address illegal immigration, we are once again hearing the same old nonsense from Republican politicians.”

“Lawmakers vowing to act tough on border security while looking to secure amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants has become infuriatingly all-too-familiar,” he said."

(CNN) - While the Internal Revenue Service maintains it was not focusing on conservative groups out of political bias, Sen. Rand Paul claimed Sunday there was a ""written policy"" floating around the agency that said IRS officials were ""targeting people who were opposed to the president.""

""And when that comes forward, we need to know who wrote the policy and who approved the policy,"" the Republican senator from Kentucky said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Pressed for more precise details about the memo he was referring to, Paul said he hasn't seen such a policy statement but has heard about it.

""Well, we keep hearing the reports and we have several specifically worded items saying who was being targeted. In fact, one of the bullet points says those who are critical of the president. So I don't know if that comes from a policy, but that's what's being reported in the press and reported orally,"" he told CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. ""I haven't seen a policy statement, but I think we need to see that.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also said the IRS targeting was an example of the administration punishing its opponents.

""There is a culture of intimidation throughout the administration,"" he said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

While he admitted that all the facts were not yet known, he argued an attitude of ""government knows best” seems to permeate.

""The nanny state is here to tell us all what to do and if you start criticizing, you get targeted,"" he said.

Appearing before a congressional committee Friday, IRS officials said a large increase in workload, rather than deliberate targeting, led to ""foolish mistakes"" and the political discrimination cited by the inspector general's report last week.

Numerous conservative groups said they faced heavy scrutiny and lengthy questionnaires in the past few years as they attempted to get tax-exempt status. The IRS admitted earlier this month it made mistakes, saying its office in Ohio that processed tax-exempt applications began singling out groups whose names included ""tea party"" and ""patriot"" for further review.

The actions have spurred criticism from both parties in Congress and President Barack Obama. A new CNN/ORC International survey released Sunday indicated that 71% of Americans find the targeting unacceptable.

Two IRS officials have announced they'll leave their posts, and more current and former IRS higher-ups are slated to appear for congressional hearings this week.

But Paul argued more people needed to be let go, saying the Obama administration didn't do enough in disciplining officials after the terror attack against a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in September.

""Why does Benghazi go on? No one was ever fired. So people made tragic errors - no one's accepting responsibility and no one was fired,"" he said.

Four State Department officials, however, were disciplined in December, with one resigning and three being placed on administrative leave and relieved of their duties. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeatedly said she accepts ultimate responsibility for the safety and security of U.S. diplomats abroad.

Paul, however, stood by his charge that Clinton demonstrated a ""dereliction of duty"" by not reading diplomatic cables requesting more security at the Benghazi post.

""She should have resigned and accepted blame for it,"" he said Sunday.

A potential 2016 contender for the Republican presidential nomination, Paul has taken his attacks against Clinton on the road in battleground states. He plans to make a trip to New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state, on Monday.

Asked if he was politicizing the controversy, Paul said he brings up the topic ""in every state and every stop because I think it's pretty important for her to accept blame for not providing security.""

http://news.yahoo.com/post-election-vacuum-rubio-rise-within-gop-100304866--politics.html,,[],"In post-election vacuum, Rubio on rise within GOP","WASHINGTON (AP) — Marco Rubio is taking center stage as Republicans search for a new leader.

In the nearly 100 days since President Barack Obama won a second term, the Florida senator has made calculated, concrete steps to emerge as a next-generation leader of a rudderless party, put a 21st-century stamp on the conservative movement and potentially position himself for a presidential run.

The bilingual Cuban-American lawmaker has become Republicans' point person on immigration and he pitches economic solutions for middle-class workers. He is an evangelist for a modern, inclusive party that welcomes more Hispanics and minorities, but says Republicans must stay true to their principles.

""In a way, he's trying to save us from ourselves,"" says Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union who gave Rubio his first job in politics, as a South Florida field staffer during Kansas Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. ""He gives us comfort against the naysayers who say we need to change our basic beliefs to attract a wider audience.""

Rubio will give the Republican response to Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday. Rubio advisers say his rebuttal will offer economic prescriptions for a sluggish economy and try to counter what they call Obama's government-centered economic approach.

The speech comes as demand for the 41-year-old son of immigrants has soared and the party has tried to recover from significant electoral losses and map out a path ahead.

Call it the ""it"" factor. Time magazine just splashed Rubio on its cover, anointing him ""The Republican Savior."" Rubio, a Catholic, responded on Twitter: ""There is only one savior, and it is not me. (hash)Jesus"". He shrugged off the label during an interview with The Associated Press: ""I didn't write the cover. I wouldn't have said it if I wrote it.""

""There are no saviors in politics,"" he said.

The former Florida House speaker has been on a Republican rocket ship since 2010, when he knocked off Gov. Charlie Crist in a Senate race that showed the tea party's clout. He introduced presidential nominee Mitt Romney at the Republican National Convention last year and attended dozens of rallies and fundraisers for the GOP ticket during the campaign.

Story continues

His rise draws comparisons to Obama, who moved from Illinois senator-elect to Democratic presidential nominee within four years. Both win accolades for their oratory skills and sought a lower profile at the start of their Senate careers.

Like Obama did for the Democrats, Rubio evokes a new generation for Republicans, as comfortable talking about hip-hop music as health care. In a recent interview with the online news organization BuzzFeed, he discussed at length the rap music of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., something that would have been unimaginable coming from Romney.

Since November's pummeling, Rubio has taken a series of public and private steps to raise his already high profile and create the political, organizational and message framework he'd need should he decide to seek the White House.

On election night, Rubio promoted ""upward mobility policies"" and counseled Republicans to renew their pitch to people from minority and immigrant communities. He made a quick trip to Iowa in mid-November for GOP Gov. Terry Branstad's birthday party, which placed him before influential party activists in the important electoral state. Branstad lauded Rubio as the ""kind of inspirational leader that's going to help point us in the right direction.""

In December, Rubio said Republicans needed to attract voters from all economic backgrounds, invoking his late father, who worked as a hotel bartender. People like that are not ""looking for a handout"" but conditions to help them reach the middle class, Rubio said at the Jack Kemp Foundation dinner.

Behind the scenes, Rubio has bolstered his political action committee, Reclaim America PAC, to help him raise money, elect fellow Republicans and essentially create a campaign-in-waiting. Terry Sullivan, a trusted aide with deep ties to the early primary state of South Carolina, has moved over to work full time at the organization, and Rubio hired Dorinda Moss, a leading GOP fundraiser, to be its finance director.

Rubio, who took hard-line positions on immigration policy such as branding Sen. John McCain's proposal in 2010 a form of amnesty, has shifted gears on the issue. He spent months meeting with different groups in the debate before releasing a set of principles with fellow senators that pairs increased border security with a possible path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.

Mindful that ""amnesty"" remains a dirty word in the GOP and that many still flinch at immigration changes approved under President Ronald Reagan, Rubio courted conservative talk-radio hosts and news outlets to head off criticism. Early on, he won positive reviews from powerful conservative media personalities.

Fox News' Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity offered praise for his approach. Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh called Rubio's ideas ""admirable and noteworthy,"" a tag line that could turn into a handy defense in a Republican primary.

Rubio has had detractors, too.

Conservative commentator Ann Coulter said Rubio's plan would allow illegal immigrants to live and work in the U.S., essentially jumping ahead of those who have waited in their own countries to immigrate to the U.S. legally. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, a Republican, called Rubio ""naive.""

Indeed, the focus on immigration could be a boon or a bust for Rubio. If he rallies Republicans behind a plan that offers some resolution, he could be connected to a big legislative victory. But if the plan draws the wrath of Republican activists, it could hinder his ability to seek the big prize in 2016.

""I really believe that if I do the best job I can in the Senate,"" Rubio told BuzzFeed, ""then in a couple of years I'll be in a position to make a decision about whether I want to run for re-election, leave politics and give someone else a shot or run for some other position.""

“Please use your executive order!” shouted the heckler, who was standing behind Obama on stage, close enough to be in the television camera shot, during an event in San Francisco’s Chinatown as the president began a two-day visit to California. Urging Obama to give immediate relief to those separated from their families at Thanksgiving, the man yelled, “You have the power to stop deportations!”

“Actually, I don’t,” Obama responded, signaling security personnel not to remove the heckler or other protesters who joined in the shouting. “These guys don’t need to go,” Obama said. “He can stay there.… I respect the passion of these young people.”

But the solution to the problem “won’t be as easy as just shouting,” Obama said to the young man. “If you’re serious about making that happen, then I’m willing to work with you.

“The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. What I’m proposing is the harder path” of trying to get the law changed.

It was a dramatic beginning to a California trip otherwise dominated by Democratic fundraising events, mostly closed to the public. After the immigration event and two fundraisers in San Francisco, the president flew south for two events in Beverly Hills: a reception at the home of entrepreneur and former basketball star Magic Johnson and a dinner hosted by Hollywood mogul Haim Saban.

At Johnson’s home, Obama leaned on sports analogies to criticize politics as practiced in Washington.

“Nobody played a team game better than he did,” Obama said about Johnson, “and that’s what we need in this country more than anything.”

He blamed partisanship for holding up action on issues like immigration.

“What’s stopping us is a failure of our politics and a lack of ambition,” Obama said. “Our politics all too often encourages people to think selfishly or short-term.”

The nation needs “that sense that we’re in this together,” he said.

Before the twin fundraisers, White House officials said, Obama met with the family of Gerardo Hernandez, a Transportation Security Administration officer killed in a violent attack at LAX on Nov. 1. He also met with Tony Grigsby and James Speer, two TSA officers wounded by gunfire that day.

In San Francisco, Obama used his speech to make a new appeal to Republicans to pass immigration measures before the end of the year.

As the prospects for immigration legislation in Congress have faded, activists have been increasing pressure on Obama to take executive action to reduce the record number of deportations during his administration.

Last year, Obama approved a step to shield one group of people from deportation, the so-called Dream Act youth, who were brought to the country illegally as young children. The administration justified that action as an exercise in prosecutorial discretion, the legal basis being that the executive branch has authority to say that some cases for deportation are less urgent than others.

That principle can’t be extended to cover everyone, administration lawyers have said. Immigration advocacy groups say, however, that some additional groups could be covered if Obama was willing to act.

Obama urged House Republicans to act on immigration even if that required passing several separate measures rather than one comprehensive package like the one approved by the Senate this year.

“It’s Thanksgiving. We can carve that bird into multiple pieces,” Obama said. “As long as all the pieces get done, and we actually deliver on the core values we’ve been talking about for so long, I think everybody’s fine with it.”

Obama had suggested a piece-by-piece approach before but not in such vivid terms.

Some House Republicans may be interested in that approach if they can finesse the intraparty politics. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said recently that his caucus was committed to considering immigration legislation, but he did not lay out a time frame.

The issue splits Republicans, and GOP lawmakers are particularly divided over the idea of providing a pathway to citizenship for more than 11 million immigrants in the country who have overstayed their visas or entered illegally. Obama has insisted that any immigration overhaul must include a pathway to citizenship.

“The speaker is sincere in wanting to get something done,” Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said after the president spoke, “and we’re pleased the president said he can accept the step-by-step approach we’re taking in the House.”

The two Monday night fundraisers benefited the joint House and Senate campaign committee for Democratic candidates. Tickets for the event at the home of Johnson and his wife, Cookie, ranged from $2,500 to $15,000 per person. The dinner hosted by Saban and his wife, Cheryl, cost $16,200 per person.

Obama was scheduled to appear at another fundraiser, on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, on Tuesday morning before heading to Glendale for an appearance with entertainment industry officials at Dreamworks Animation. The company’s chief executive, Jeffrey Katzenberg, has been a leading fundraiser for Obama.

Davidson Previously Was An Assistant City Editor At The Washington Post', 'A Washington', 'Foreign Correspondent With The Wall Street Journal', 'Where He Covered Federal Agencies', 'Political Campaigns.']","Feds would lose a raise, have pay freeze extended and suffer pay losses under bill","Federal employees are being pummeled by a one, two, three combination that could leave their morale weak and their wallets sapped.

First there was a left cross — the extension of the basic federal pay rate freeze through the end of March. That was followed by a right hook — budget cuts that could cost many federal employees up to 20 percent of their pay from April through September.

The kick in the gut came Wednesday with House approval of a temporary budget measure that would stretch the freeze to a total of three years and kill any hope of stopping the cuts known as sequestration.

The loss is more than money to federal workers. Many are devoted to the mission of their agencies. They worry about how their unpaid days off will diminish service to the American people.

If the House budget measure, called a continuing resolution, becomes law, it would hit feds three ways. It would wipe out the tiny 0.5 percent raise they are scheduled to find in their pay checks next month, extend the freeze through the end of the year and allow unpaid days off.

House Republicans earlier had voted to extend the freeze, originally set for two years, to three, so that provision in the resolution was not surprising.

Almost no one likes the sequester cuts, however, and few predicted that they would be implemented. Yet, after giving itself an additional two months to avoid sequestration, Congress surrendered to its incompetence and allowed the cuts to begin last Friday. There was still some hope among workers that Congress would act to avoid forcing unpaid days off on employees.

With the House action, what little hope there was is fermenting into anger.

“In the GOP-dominated House of Representatives, knuckle-dragging lawmakers lashed out yet again at modestly paid civil servants,” said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

Lawmakers, even the knuckle-dragging kind, also are affected by the mess they created. They haven’t had a pay raise since 2009, but they make much more than your average civil servant.

Some on Capitol Hill and in the media have suggested that the impacts of the budget cuts have been exaggerated by the White House. They don’t seem to realize that the full effect won’t be felt until the furlough days begin and the services that employees provide suffer. The naysayers also apparently don’t appreciate the situation facing workers who stand to lose a significant chunk of their pay.

Among the latest to be told that they face unpaid leave are workers in the White House Office of Management and Budget. They will be furloughed for 10 days between April 21 and Sept. 7.

Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House, wasn’t optimistic about ending the freeze when he told reporters that chances are “probably pretty good” that it will last through the year.

“The federal employee pay freeze could hold for the remainder of the calendar year because Republican lawmakers insist on targeting these hardworking public servants,” he added in a statement. “I strongly oppose their continued efforts to single out federal employees, who have already contributed $103 billion toward deficit reduction and who are the only middle-class workers who have been asked to do so.”

If the freeze does last through the year, it won’t happen without a fight.

“I’ll be working my earrings off,” said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md), “to fight the extension of the federal pay freeze included in the House-passed continuing resolution.”

Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) had a similar reaction, though he said nothing about earrings.

One Republican in a prominent place to influence federal workplace issues has sponsored legislation that would encourage agencies to avoid furloughs. Rep. Blake Farenthold’s Protecting America’s Civilian Employees (PACE) Act would require the administration “to send a report to Congress indicating how amounts could be transferred within agencies and departments for fiscal year 2013 to avoid all furloughs or reductions in force.”

Farenthold (R-Tex.), chairman of the House federal workforce subcommittee, said, “We should be able to achieve the needed savings and keep our dedicated federal workforce going strong, without devastating furloughs, and that’s what my bill intends to do.”

The bill’s good intentions are probably better than its chances of passage.

Hillary Clinton answered her critics. North Korea threatened theirs.

As the week comes to an end, here’s a look back at these stories and other international news that developed, including a surprising election in Israel and a growing humanitarian crisis in Syria.

Clinton in Benghazi hot seat



At times angry and choked with emotion, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared before two congressional committees Wednesday and answered questions about her department’s handling of the attack that killed four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador, in Benghazi, Libya, last year.

While Clinton was mostly calm and composed during the two hearings, which lasted more than five hours in all, she became visibly frustrated when Sen. Ron Johnson, a tea-party backed Wisconsin Republican, said the American public was deliberately misled.

“With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,” Clinton said, banging her hand on the table. “Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they’d go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening.”

What did we learn from Wednesday’s testimony? Here are five of the key themes, including what Clinton did on the day of the attack.

Clinton also warned of a growing security threat in North Africa, saying there was “no doubt” that weapons from Libya were used in last week’s attack on an Algerian natural gas plant.

Which leads to …

The future of terrorism?



There are still outstanding questions over the Algerian standoff, which resulted in the deaths of at least 37 hostages.

Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the North African branch of al Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for the attack. Algeria said the attack was retaliation for letting France use its airspace in its offensive against Islamist militants in Mali.

The question now is whether this was an isolated act of revenge or, as Clinton alluded to, an ominous sign of things to come in the region, where Islamist militants are quickly gaining traction.

One expert believes we might be seeing the future of terrorism.

“Europe has become a difficult environment to conduct large-scale terrorist incidents, and America even more so,” said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British-based think tank that specializes in defense and security issues. “But at the same time, groups desire to attack Western targets both for ideological reasons and to attract attention to their cause has not diminished. The net result is that they will aim to target Westerners where they can find and reach them.”

North Korea’s defiant threat



The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution Tuesday condemning North Korea’s recent rocket launch and expanding sanctions against the country.

Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images North Korea has vowed action against the United States, which it calls ""the sworn enemy of the Korean people.""

But North Korea remains defiant, saying it plans to carry out more long-range rocket launches and another nuclear test. It also vowed an “upcoming all-out action” to target the United States, which it called “the sworn enemy of the Korean people.” By Friday, South Korea had been threatened as well.

The U.S. envoy to North Korea responded by saying the U.S. would ultimately judge North Korea by its actions, not by its words. Some experts say the U.S. should give up on negotiation altogether and take a tougher stance.

North Korea has conducted two previous nuclear tests – one in 2006 and one in 2009 – but analysts say it does not have the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile.

Israel’s surprising election



As many expected, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing party received the most votes in Tuesday’s national elections.

AHMAD GHARABLI/AFP/Getty Images Yair Lapid's centrist party finished second in Israel's election. Will he join the prime minister or lead the political opposition?

But the surprising second-place finish of the centrist Yesh Atid party – led by Israeli TV personality Yair Lapid – might convince Netanyahu to form a more moderate government coalition rather than a hard-right bloc. (In Israel’s Knesset, coalitions must be built because no single party ever wins a majority of seats.)

“The pundits did not understand what Israeli society was thinking and feeling,” said Marcus Sheff, executive director of the Israel Project, an advocacy group. “Instead of the far right, they went to the center. … They were saying, ‘Let’s go to those values, the values Israel was established on, liberal Israel, secular Israel, moderate Israel – an Israel where peace with our neighbors is important but security is also important.’ “

The high voter turnout also confounded critics as the Israeli public “turned out to be far more engaged than many had imagined,” wrote Josh Block, CEO and president of the nonpartisan Israel Project.

Syria’s humanitarian crisis



As many as 20,000 Syrian refugees flooded Jordan this week, according to the nation’s foreign minister and refugee officials.

Daniel Lippman Children stand outside a building housing Syrian refugees in Hacipasa, Turkey.

There are now nearly 700,000 people who have fled Syria for neighboring countries, straining resources in places like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.

CNN’s Ivan Watson visited a refugee camp in Turkey where a U.S. delegation arrived Thursday. He had an exclusive interview with the U.S. ambassador to Syria, who described how the U.S. has given $210 million in humanitarian aid and $35 million to help the Syrian political opposition.

“The assistance is going in,” Ambassador Robert Ford said. “It’s things like tents, it’s things like blankets, it’s things like medical equipment, but it doesn’t come in big boxes with an American flag on it because we don’t want the people who are delivering it to be targeted by the Syrian regime.”

Ford said the needs are gigantic and that much more aid is needed, but he stressed that even with help from the U.S. and other countries, “it has to be Syrians who find their way forward.”

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/29/house-budget-vote_n_4010096.html,2013-09-29 00:00:00,['Ap The Huffington Post'],"House Budget Vote Passes In Favor Of New Obamacare Deal-Breaker, Shutdown Looms","The House voted early Sunday morning to pass a new continuing resolution, 231 to 192, which would fund the government thru Dec. 15.

The plan, which emerged on Saturday, would also impose a one-year delay of Obamacare and a full repeal of the law’s tax on medical devices.

""The House has again passed a plan that reflects the American people’s desire to keep the government running and stop the president’s health care law,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement, adding, ""Now that the House has again acted, it’s up to the Senate to pass this bill without delay to stop a government shutdown.""

Even before the House voted, Senate Democrats pledged to reject the measure and the White House issued a statement vowing a veto in any event. Republicans are pursuing ""a narrow ideological agenda ... and pushing the government towards shutdown,"" it said.

The Senate is not scheduled to meet until mid-afternoon on Monday, 10 hours before a shutdown would begin, and even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage in the fast-approaching end game. If so, a House GOP rank and file that includes numerous tea party allies would soon have to choose between triggering the first partial shutdown in nearly two decades – or coming away empty-handed from their latest confrontation with Obama.

Undeterred, House Republicans pressed ahead with their latest attempt to squeeze a concession from the White House in exchange for letting the government open for business normally on Tuesday. ""Obamacare is based on a limitless government, bureaucratic arrogance and a disregard of a will of the people,"" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind.

Another Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa of California, reacted angrily when asked whether he would eventually support a standalone spending bill if needed to prevent a shutdown. ""How dare you presume a failure? How dare you? How dare you?"" he said.

Apart from its impact on the health care law, the legislation that House Republicans decided to back would assure routine funding for government agencies through Dec. 15. Under House rules, the measure went to the Senate after lawmakers voted 248-174 to repeal the medical tax, then 231-192 for the one-year delay in Obamacare.

A companion measure headed for approval assures U.S. troops are paid in the event of a shutdown.

The government spending measure marked something of a reduction in demands by House Republicans, who passed legislation several days ago that would permanently strip the health care law of money while providing funding for the government.

It also contained significant concessions from a party that long has criticized the health care law for imposing numerous government mandates on industry, in some cases far exceeding what Republicans have been willing to support in the past. Acknowledging as much, Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said that as a conservative he had often found during Obama's presidency that his choice was ""between something bad or (something) horrible.""

GOP aides said that under the legislation headed toward a vote, most portions of the health law that already have gone into effect would remain unchanged. That includes requirements for insurance companies to guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions and to require children to be covered on their parents' plans until age 26. It would not change a part of the law that reduces costs for seniors with high prescription drug expenses.

One exception would give insurers or others the right not to provide abortion coverage, based on religious or moral objections.

The measure would delay implementation of a requirement for all individuals to purchase coverage or face a penalty, and of a separate feature of the law that will create marketplaces where individuals can shop for coverage from private insurers.

By repealing the medical device tax, the GOP measure also would raise deficits – an irony for a party that won the House majority in 2010 by pledging to get the nation's finances under control.

The Senate rejected the most recent House-passed anti-shutdown bill on a party-line vote of 54-44 Friday, insisting on a straightforward continuation in government funding without health care-related add-ons.

That left the next step up to the House – with time to avert a partial shutdown growing ever shorter.

For a moment at least, the revised House proposal papered over a simmering dispute between Speaker John Boehner and the rest of the leadership, and tea party conservatives who have been more militant about abolishing the health law that all Republican lawmakers oppose.

It was unclear whether members of the rank and file had consulted with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has become the face of the ""Defund Obamacare"" campaign that tea party organizations are promoting and using as a fundraising tool.

In debate on the House floor, Republicans adamantly rejected charges that they seek a government shutdown, and said their goal is to spare the nation from the effects of a law they said would cost jobs and reduce the quality of care. The law is an ""attack and an assault on the free enterprise and the free economy,"" said Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas.

Democrats disagreed vociferously. ""House Republicans are shutting down the government. They're doing it intentionally. They're doing it on purpose,"" said Rep. Donna Edwards of Maryland, as Republican lawmakers booed from their seats on the floor.

In the Senate, there was little doubt that Reid had the votes to block a one-year delay in the health care program widely known as ""Obamacare."" He said the same was true for the repeal of the medical device tax, even though 33 Democrats joined all Senate Republicans in supporting repeal on a nonbinding vote earlier in the year.

The 2.3 percent tax, which took effect in January, is imposed on items such as pacemakers and CT scan machines; eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and other items are exempt. Repealing it would cost the government an estimated $29 billion over the coming decade.

If lawmakers miss the approaching deadline, a wide range of federal programs would be affected, from the national parks to the Pentagon.

Some critical services such patrolling the borders, inspecting meat and controlling air traffic would continue. Social Security benefits would be sent and the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals.

The new health insurance exchanges would open Tuesday, a development that's lent urgency to the drive to use a normally routine stopgap spending bill to gut implementation of the law. ___

Police.']",Grounded TV Marti plane a monument to the limits of American austerity,"At an airfield in rural Georgia, the U.S. government pays a contractor $6,600 a month for a plane that doesn’t fly.

The plane is a 1960s turboprop with an odd array of antennas on its back end and the name of a Cuban national hero painted on its tail. It can fly, but it doesn’t. Government orders.

“The contract now is a ‘non-fly’ ” contract, said Steve Christopher of Phoenix Air Group, standing next to the plane. “That’s what the customer wants.”

The airplane is called “Aero Martí,” and it is stuck in a kind of federal limbo. After two years of haphazard spending cuts in Washington, it has too little funding to function but too much to die.

The plane was outfitted to fly over the ocean and broadcast an American-run TV station into Cuba. The effort was part of the long-running U.S. campaign to combat communism in Cuba by providing information to the Cuban people uncensored by their government.

But Cuban officials jammed the signal almost immediately, and surveys showed that less than 1 percent of Cubans watched. Still, when Congress started making budget cuts, lawmakers refused to kill the plane.

But then they allowed across-the-board “sequestration” cuts. And there was no more money for the fuel and pilots. So the plane sits in storage at taxpayer expense — a monument to the limits of American austerity. In this case, a push to eliminate long-troubled programs collided with old Washington forces: government inertia, intense lobbying and congressional pride.

The result was a stalemate. And a plane left with just enough money to do nothing.

“It’s hard to state how ridiculous it is” that the plane is still costing taxpayers money, said Philip Peters, an official in two Republican administrations and now the president of the Alexandria-based Cuba Research Center.

Peters said the plane’s broadcasts had “no audience. They’ve been effectively jammed, ever since their inception. And rather than spend the money on something that benefits the public . . . it’s turned into a test of manhood on Capitol Hill.”

This plane is a last remnant of a long, weird experiment in television broadcasting across the Straits of Florida. The plan was to broadcast uncensored news and commentary on a station named for Cuban patriot José Martí.

The hope was that something boundless — American disdain for the communist regime of Fidel and Raúl Castro — could overcome something fixed. Which was the laws of physics.

Much of Cuba was simply too far over the horizon to get a strong-enough TV signal from aircraft flying in U.S. airspace. Still, the effort moved ahead.

“I am convinced that TV Martí will succeed,” then-Sen. Ernest “Fritz” Hollings (D-S.C.), a major supporter, said in 1989. “Castro likes to tout his revolutionary credentials,” Hollings said. “But he cannot begin to match the revolutionary potential of television.”

As it turned out, he could.

The first broadcast of TV Martí was March 27, 1990. It came in clear in Havana for about 20 minutes. Then the American signal — weakened by distance — was jammed by Cuban broadcasts on the same channel.

“ ‘La TV que no se ve.’ The TV that can’t be seen,” was what Cubans called it, said Fulton Armstrong, a U.S. official in Havana at the time. Another problem: The early broadcasts happened very late at night, to minimize interference with other Cuban programming. What people saw, Armstrong said, was “a moving shadow of an image of . . . something. At something like 4 a.m.”

The TV signal was first broadcast from a blimp called “Fat Albert,” suspended 10,000 feet over the Florida Keys. But there is weather at 10,000 feet. “Fat Albert” blew off into the Everglades in 1991. It was pulled frequently out of action to dodge high winds.

In 2005, it was torn to bits by Hurricane Dennis, and the government gave up on blimps. Instead, it tried planes.

First, there was a military C-130. It cost too much. Then came “Aero Martí” and a sister aircraft (now retired), smaller planes fitted with broadcasting antennas and flown in a figure-eight pattern in U.S. airspace near Key West.

Since these planes first flew in October 2006, they have cost taxpayers at least $32 million. That’s more than $12,000 a day.

But on Cuban TV sets, they didn’t make much difference.

In 2008, according to the Government Accountability Office, a telephone survey found about the same viewership as had been reported in 2006. And in 2003. And in 1990. Less than 1 percent (after that, the U.S. government stopped taking the survey, declaring it was impossible to get valid data on Cuban TV habits).

But the planes kept flying.

The program was repeatedly protected from Washington budget-cutters by a coalition of Cuban American lawmakers and non-Cuban legislators from Florida. To them, what looked like the program’s worst problems were actually proof that it had to be saved.

For instance: The broadcasts are jammed. Well, wasn’t that the best evidence of their potential, if the jamming stopped or the Castros fell?

“If it wasn’t important, why would they block the signals? So we know that it’s effective,” Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) said in an interview last week. Other backers include Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) and Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).

Diaz-Balart also viewed another common criticism of the plane — the cost of the program — as a strong reason to keep it. After all, he said, the government spent a lot of money to turn an airplane into a flying antenna.

“It would . . . be a colossal waste of money” to junk the plane now, Diaz-Balart said.

Years went by. Millions poured in. Then, in 2012, the Obama administration officially gave up.

The federal Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which pays for the plane, asked Congress to eliminate it. The savings: about $2 million a year.

“We have evolved from the airplane to distribute our TV content toward means that we know are popular on the island,” said Carlos A. García Pérez, a Cuban American trial lawyer from Puerto Rico who now heads the office. The station, for instance, now broadcasts on DirectTV, to reach Cubans with pirated satellite dishes. And it burns newscasts onto DVDs and sends 1,000 a week to be handed out by Cuban activist groups and churches.

The plane kept flying.

“No one dislikes TV Martí more than the Cuban government,” said Mauricio Claver-Carone, the Washington director of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC, a group that lobbies for stronger measures against the Castro regime. “Do we therefore, essentially, give in to those efforts by the regime and do their job for them?”

Congress preserved the funding. So from October to this May, the administration spent $751,999 to operate a plane it had declared was not worth the money.

But then came sequestration.

This was a broad hack across the budget, which Congress made after it failed to agree on more targeted budget cuts. At the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, officials found their share of the cut was $1.4 million.

They kept the plane. They cut the flying.

Now, the agency still pays $79,500 a year to keep the aircraft in storage, paying money for nothing in a time when sequestration is causing painful cuts in other programs. That cost, for instance, is roughly equal to the average cost of nine children enrolled in Head Start (at a time when Head Start has eliminated services to 57,000 children because of sequestration).

And the plane does not seem likely to get out of limbo anytime soon.

Congress appears unwilling to kill it and too distracted to focus on small-bore budget cuts. The administration seems unwilling to start flying it again. But they’re also unwilling to get rid of it. What if Congress demanded it back?

“If the government thinks they may someday resurrect the program, then it would not be in their best interest to have us scrap the airplane,” said Dent Thompson, an official at Phoenix Air.

In the meantime, the TV Martí operation is adapting to a future without the plane. Under García Pérez, its content has turned from anti-Castro speeches toward more straight news, including reports about Cuba produced on the island by Cubans themselves. The station reports anecdotal signs of progress: 18,000 daily visits to its Web site. More than 2,600 entries from Cuba to an on-air moped giveaway. Marriage proposals to anchor Karen Caballero, sent electronically from Havana.

But — after 23 years, a blimp, three planes and millions of taxpayer dollars — the operation faces the same problem it did back in 1990. It is a mass broadcast in search of a mass audience.

“Only recently, they have started to deliver some DVDs into the island . . . and persons are very eager to watch this,” Orlando Luis Pardo, an independent blogger in Cuba, said in a telephone interview. He also said people listen to a sister broadcast, Radio Martí. Pardo said the end of the airplane-based broadcasts didn’t change the situation at all: For him, the station was as difficult to watch as it was before.

“TV Martí, unfortunately, was born completely blocked,” he said."

Black luxury car rammed a security barricade near the White House on Thursday

Incident ended 16 blocks away on Capitol Hill with police killing the woman driver

Police shot the driver after she got out of her vehicle and tried to flee

A chase that began with a black luxury car ramming a security barricade near the White House on Thursday ended 16 blocks away on Capitol Hill with police killing the woman driver, authorities said.

The Nissan Infiniti was registered to Miriam Carey, 34, of Stamford, Conn., according to a federal law enforcement official who was not authorized to comment publicly. Investigators believe she was the driver, and authorities were running fingerprint analysis to confirm her identity.

A child about a year old who was in car was taken to a local hospital and is in good condition, Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said at an evening news briefing.

The incident caused a brief lockdown of the U.S. Capitol as Congress tried unsuccessfully to end the three-day government shutdown.

""This does not appear to be in any way an accident,"" Lanier said, noting that the woman twice tried to breach security barriers and struck a uniformed Secret Service officer near the White House.

U.S. Capitol Police chief Kim Dine said the incident ""appears to be an isolated, singular matter, with, at this point, no nexus to terrorism.""

The chaotic events began at 2:12 p.m. ET when the driver rammed a temporary barrier at 15th and E Streets NW, hitting the officer, said Secret Service chief Ed Donovan. Other Secret Service officers chased the woman east on Pennsylvania Avenue but did not shoot.

Lanier said Capitol Police officers pursued the speeding car eastbound and tried to stop it in Garfield Circle, just west of the Capitol lawn. A 23-year-veteran officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries when he crashed into a barrier.

Police had the woman's car surrounded but she escaped, ramming a Secret Service vehicle as she fled. Lanier said police then fired their first shots at the suspect.

The driver made her way onto Constitution Avenue before eventually stopping in the 100 blocks of Maryland Avenue NE, near the Hart Senate Office Building.

Police then killed the driver after she got out of her vehicle and tried to flee.

Two federal officials told USA TODAY that all shots were fired by law enforcement officers. One official said no gun was recovered from the Infiniti.

Terrance Gainer, the Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate, said the woman's vehicle could not have reached the Capitol itself because ""there are barricades up all the time.""

As the chase unfolded, members of Congress and staff were told by Capitol police to ""immediately shelter in place."" Less than an hour later, a TV screen in the Senate press gallery flashed an ""all clear"" message.

Security was heightened at the White House as a precaution and President Obama was briefed on the incident, according to White House officials.

Larry Murr, a former Louisville resident living in Jacksonville, Fla., was visiting the Capitol building when he heard the gunfire, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported..

""We were standing there, looking at the building, and all of a sudden we heard a pop-pop-pop-pop,"" he said, saying he thought he heard four to five shots fired in rapid succession.

In a notice distributed by email, the U.S. Capitol Police advised everyone to ""close, lock and stay away from external doors and windows.""

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who was on the balcony off of the speaker's lobby when the gunshots erupted, tells reporters that they sounded like ""fireworks.""

Rep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.), who was also on the balcony, said he heard ""five or six"" gunshots.

""Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!"" Posey told POLITICO. ""Then sirens went off, cops started going everywhere yelling 'get inside, get inside!'""

People standing outside the Supreme Court across the street from Congress were hurried into the court building by authorities.

There is no reason to believe — with this court — that recess appointments will be permitted,” [Communications Workers of America President Larry] Cohen said in a conference call.

A new microsite went live today to highlight the job-killing overreach into the private sector of the National Labor Relations Board. (NRLB) The NRLB is an anti-business, pro-union operation masquerading as a watchdog for “labor issues.” The board is supposed to function fairly rather than as an advocate for union interests against private businesses. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth.

The NRLB caused quite a stir a few years ago, when they launched a job-killing complaint against Boeing as the company attempted to build a 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina. The Board asserted that opening a plant in non-union South Carolina was retaliation against union workers at their Washington state plant. There was no regard for potential new jobs for South Carolina when the NRLB decided to insert itself into a private business’ decision.

The NRLB has been in the news of late. Notably last week, Cablevision filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court to suspend actions against the company, as the board was continuing to function despite a court ruling declaring Obama’s appointments to the board unconstitutional.

At this very moment, the NRLB is continuing to function despite the fact that two courts have ruled that members on the board were put there unconstitutionally by Obama. There are no fewer than SIXTY lawsuits against the NRLB’s rulings with these unconstitutional appointments."
http://news.yahoo.com/transportation-secretary-leave-administration-143315594.html,,[],Transportation secretary to leave administration,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the only Republican still in President Barack Obama's first-term Cabinet, said Tuesday he plans to leave the administration. His move continues an exodus that will give Obama's team a new look in his second term.

The 67-year-old LaHood, a former congressman from Illinois, pushed for greater safety on the highways and in the air.

He led the Transportation Department throughout Obama's first term and helped steer a campaign to curb distracted driving, promote high-speed rail and repair roads and bridges. Under his watch, the department demanded tougher fuel efficiency requirements for automakers and took steps to address airline pilot fatigue.

Obama thanked LaHood in a statement, saying they were ""drawn together by a shared belief that those of us in public service owe an allegiance not to party or faction, but to the people we were elected to represent. And Ray has never wavered in that belief.""

LaHood said in an interview with The Associated Press that he told Obama a week after the November election that he needed to move on but said he was still ""conflicted"" by his decision because he liked working for Obama and considered it the ""best job I've ever had in public service.""

He said he plans to remain at the department until his successor is confirmed by the Senate, which he expected in about two months. The only other Republican who was in Obama's first-term Cabinet was Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who stepped aside and was replaced by Democrat Leon Panetta earlier.

LaHood said he would not run for public office in his home state of Illinois and said he did not have any specific plans.

""I have had a good run. I'm one of these people who believe that you should go out while they're applauding,"" he said. LaHood said he was content to watch from the sidelines as his oldest son, Darin, serves in the Illinois state senate.

Obama is remaking his Cabinet at the beginning of his second term with the departures of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Panetta and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. In addition to LaHood, the heads of the Interior and Labor departments also have announced their resignations in recent weeks.

Story continues

The Transportation Department has carried a bipartisan imprint in recent years and been the place for a president to ask a member of the opposing party to serve. Former Rep. Norman Mineta, a California Democrat, served as Transportation secretary during the administration of President George W. Bush. Obama has nominated former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Republican, to serve as defense secretary to succeed Panetta.

Possible replacements for LaHood include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has pushed for increased rail service in Los Angeles and served as chairman of last year's Democratic National Convention, and Debbie Hersman, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. The name of former Rep. Jim Oberstar of Minnesota, who led the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has also been mentioned.

LaHood, 67, served seven terms in Congress representing a central Illinois district that includes his hometown of Peoria, Ill., and overlapped with Obama in the state's delegation during the last four years of his career.

At the department, LaHood provided a bipartisan voice during the first term, helping implement billions of dollars in transportation projects from the 2009 economic stimulus bill and promoting the plan to wary Republicans. The department pushed forward thousands of infrastructure projects to improve roads and bridges and LaHood worked with Congress last year to pass an overhaul of highway and transit programs that gives states more flexibility in how they spend federal money.

He tackled a number of regulations that had been mired in gridlock. LaHood worked with auto makers and environmentalists to develop tougher fuel efficiency standards for new cars, with the goal of providing environmental benefits and reducing fuel consumption.

Guarding against airline pilot fatigue, the Federal Aviation Administration set new rules under LaHood's watch that would limit the maximum time a pilot can be scheduled on duty and place limits on scheduled flying time and hours for pilots flying overnight. The action was prompted by a deadly plane crash near Buffalo, N.Y., that raised concerns about pilot fatigue.

LaHood also has taken on major transportation companies during his tenure, slapping Toyota Motor Co. with record fines for delaying safety recalls and failing to promptly report problems to federal regulators.

He recently ordered United Airlines to ground its Boeing 787 Dreamliner following mishaps with the aircraft's batteries. The FAA is investigating the cause of the problems to the Dreamliner, which uses lithium ion batteries and is the world's first airliner whose structure is made mostly from lightweight composite materials.

Perhaps LaHood's most passionate work has involved distracted driving, which he has called a ""national epidemic."" He has launched a national media campaign to end texting and cellphone use by drivers, an awareness campaign that has drawn comparisons to efforts to promote seat belt use more than a generation ago.

The grandfather of 10, LaHood has often emphasized the toll that deaths and injuries from distracted driving can inflict on families.

""Safety will be something that people will remember us for in all modes of transportation,"" LaHood said.

Peters'],"A Former Engine of the G.O.P., the Town Hall Meeting, Cools Down","“The reason 2009 was so successful for the grass roots was because the politicians never saw it coming,” said Jennifer Stefano, the state director for the Pennsylvania chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a Tea Party group. “Now they know. And they are terrified.”

Many lawmakers, often from safe districts, are still holding town halls throughout the month. While a number of them are drawing voters outraged over Mr. Obama’s health care law, the intensity is nothing compared to the scale of 2009.

But where there are no gatherings, some groups have decided to take matters into their own hands.

After seeing a paltry schedule of Congressional town hall meetings this month, another major conservative group, Heritage Action for America, decided it would stage public forums of its own from Arkansas to Pennsylvania. The aim is to recruit people for a group it calls the Sentinels, a citizens’ brigade of sorts, to reach lawmakers through other means, like writing letters to the editor, dialing in to talk-radio programs and mastering the language of Twitter and Facebook.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is sending its advocates into Republican districts with two-dimensional cutouts of members without a traditional town hall on the calendar. Anyone who is feeling especially theatric is being encouraged to debate their cardboard congressman.

This month, the committee sent a batch of rubber ducks to Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois, who is under pressure to support a broad immigration overhaul. (The joke: He is “ducking” questions in an ethics investigation.)

Others on the Democrats’ target list have included Representative Tim Griffin of Arkansas, who was greeted at an airport by protesters calling for an end to the across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester, and Representative John Kline of Minnesota, who is also being pressed to support immigration overhaul and was picketed after attending a closed-door Chamber of Commerce event. Not one of the Republican congressmen has a town hall scheduled this month."

The rodeo clown who ignited a firestorm of controversy after donning a mask of President Barack Obama has spoken out for the first time, insisting that he was only making a joke with no underlying message.



""I didn't do this to do any hating on anyone. I did this to be funny. I did it to be a joke,"" Tuffy Gessling told KCTV about the Aug. 10 performance.

Gessling’s appearance drew waves of criticism when it was first reported that in addition to wearing the Obama mask, he made controversial comments such as, “We’re gonna stomp Obama.”

Some observers said the act went too far, bringing up questions of whether the performance had racial undertones. However, Gessling said it was only the latest iteration in a long tradition of mocking U.S. presidents.

""I didn't think anything more of it than what we've done 15 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago, when we've done it with Bush, Clinton and Ronald Reagan,"" Gessling said.

However, after the story went viral, the Missouri State Fair said it had banned the rodeo clown from performing at its event in the future. However, fair officials declined to release his name, saying they wanted to protect his anonymity over safety concerns.

And just when the story seemed to be fading out of the news cycle, Gessling was thrust back into the spotlight when Yahoo News reported that Texas Rep. Steve Stockman had invited Gessling to perform in his state.

Gessling said he is apolitical and was simply doing his job. But he said that job has come to a standstill since the story broke. Instead, he has faced five death threats and a number of personally painful interactions with individuals upset with him.

""I've had one lady spit in my face — called me a dirty name, spit in my face and walked off,"" Gessling told KCTV. ""I've had somebody threaten to run me over. One of them wanted to burn the house down.”

Interestingly, Gessling said he wouldn’t rule out wearing the Obama mask again. But at the same time, he said it would be an “honor” to meet the president in person.

""If President Obama turns out, I would be honored to shake his hand,"" Gessling said.

""I actually think that a lot of people have lost their ability to laugh,"" he added. ""Look at the country as a whole, there is a lot more to be mad at than a rodeo clown at a rodeo trying to make somebody laugh."""

This working-class city in the Poconos passed the country’s first law aimed at making life so difficult for illegal immigrants that they would pack up and leave.

Hazleton has faded from the national attention it drew with its Illegal Immigration Relief Act in 2006. But as Republicans in Congress advance plans to provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, the city presents a test case of whether the party risks leaving behind a critical part of its core constituency: white working-class voters for whom illegal immigration stirs visceral reactions.

A city of 25,000 on a mountain plateau, a former center of coal and rail, Hazleton evokes the white, ethnic Pennsylvania stronghold in “The Deer Hunter,” the 1978 Robert De Niro movie. Local officials and many non-Hispanic residents said last week that they did not accept the reasoning of Republican leaders in Washington, including some 2016 presidential hopefuls, that giving legal status to illegal immigrants was overdue and a political imperative if Republicans are to win more Hispanic voters."

""Apparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit,"" Palin wrote.

Palin said Obama, who has repeatedly warned about the dangers of default if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling ahead of the October 17 deadline, is using the debt limit to scare the public.

""It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default,"" she wrote. ""There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution.""

Palin went on to cite the Constitution's 14th Amendment.

""The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first,"" she wrote. ""We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first.""

However, Palin suggested that Obama could face impeachment if he used the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling without congressional approval — an option endorsed in a Courier-Journal op-ed by constitutional lawyer Brianne Gorod. Former President Bill Clinton and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have also urged Obama to invoke the 14th Amendment if necessary.

Palin, on the other hand, said any such action would be a ""betrayal"" of future generations.

""It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense,"" Palin wrote. ""A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill."""

Serrano Was A Federal Law Enforcement', 'Terrorism Reporter In The Los Angeles Times', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Bureau.

Comey, a former senior Justice Department official who famously challenged warrantless eavesdropping under President George W. Bush, to replace Robert S. Mueller III as director of the FBI, officials said Wednesday.

For the Obama White House, Comey’s Republican credentials and record as a federal prosecutor made him an appealing candidate for the nation’s top law enforcement job. By tradition, the FBI director is considered nonpartisan.

The White House will seek to win Senate confirmation for Comey, 52, before the August congressional recess, though it is uncertain exactly when he will be nominated, according to officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. Mueller, who has served as FBI chief since 2001, is set to retire in September.

It was unclear whether Comey’s chances of confirmation will be affected by his dramatic history in the Bush administration. Comey threatened to resign as deputy attorney general rather than consent to secret surveillance of telephone calls by the National Security Agency. Bush had authorized the effort after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but the Justice Department had determined the program was illegal.

If the program were to continue, the department needed to certify its legality. In March 2004, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft lay in the hospital, critically ill. Comey, the acting attorney general, refused to certify the program. As Comey would later tell the Senate Judiciary Committee, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. and White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales tried to go around him.

When Comey learned that Card and Gonzales were en route to the hospital, he rushed to Ashcroft’s room, arriving before them. Card and Gonzales tried to persuade Ashcroft to authorize the program’s extension. He refused and told them Comey was in charge.

Bush subsequently agreed to change the program to satisfy Comey’s objections. The incident helped cement Comey’s reputation as a principled lawyer who would not bend the law to please his superiors in the White House.

During Comey’s two years as second-in-command at the Justice Department, he ran day-to-day operations and won credit for seeking to shield U.S. attorneys around the country from political pressure. But he made powerful enemies.

In December 2003, he took the lead role in appointing Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney in Chicago and a close friend, as a special prosecutor to pursue the CIA leak investigation that ensnared I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.

Libby ultimately was convicted of four felony counts and sentenced to 30 months in prison, although Bush later commuted the sentence.

That investigation put a cloud over the Bush White House, and ended any possibility that Comey would be named attorney general when Ashcroft retired in early 2005. Gonzales got the job instead.

Comey left that August to become senior vice president and general counsel of Lockheed Martin Corp., the aerospace and defense giant. More recently, he worked in private practice and taught at Columbia Law School, although he occasionally emerged in the public eye.

In February, Comey signed onto a Supreme Court brief with more than 100 former Republican officials and lawmakers to support the right to gay marriage in California’s Proposition 8 case.

And in June 2011, Comey had urged a Senate committee to extend Mueller’s FBI tenure because America faced “an unusual and unique threat environment” after the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden the month before in Pakistan, and with the looming 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.

“I don’t think there’s ever a great time to change FBI directors, because something is always lost in a transition,” Comey testified. “But I think there are bad and even potentially dangerous times to change an FBI director, and I think this is one of them.”

FBI and Justice Department officials said Comey and Lisa Monaco, now the White House counter-terrorism advisor, were interviewed in April about the FBI director’s job and were the two top candidates.

Comey was born in Yonkers, N.Y., and grew up in Allendale, N.J. He graduated from the College of William & Mary in Virginia, and earned his law degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1985.

After a stint as a law clerk for a federal judge in Manhattan, Comey was hired as a federal prosecutor in 1987 by then-U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani in New York, and later took a similar post in Richmond, Va.

Advertisement

He got President Bush’s attention for his work on the 1996 terrorist bombing at the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 U.S. Air Force personnel. The case had stalled and then-FBI Director Louis J. Freeh got Ashcroft to transfer it to Comey, who quickly obtained an indictment of 14 suspects.

In January 2002, Bush appointed him the top federal prosecutor in New York, where he brought criminal charges against lifestyle business magnate Martha Stewart, as well as mobsters, Wall Street tycoons and gun-toting thugs. Ashcroft brought him to Washington in December 2003 to be his top deputy.

The FBI has changed dramatically since Mueller assumed the job a week before the Sept. 11 attacks. Detecting and preventing terrorist attacks became the bureau’s chief mission for the first time.

FBI agents foiled numerous plots and arrested hundreds of would-be terrorists for planning strikes within the nation’s borders. But several potentially catastrophic attacks, including attempts to take down passenger jets and to bomb New York’s Times Square, failed only because the bombs malfunctioned, not because the FBI had detected the plots.

The lucky streak seemed to run out on April 15, when two homemade bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon, the first successful terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 2001. The blasts killed three people and injured more than 260 others.

The rules are different, depending on who you are.","First lady Michelle Obama speaks about the nation's libraries and museums before handing out the 2013 National Medals for Museum and Library Service to recipients in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, May 8, 2013. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

The first rule of handling a heckler: Don’t get mad. Don’t try to get even. Get smart. Give better than you’ve so rudely gotten.

Michelle Obama may have forgotten the basics when confronted with every public speaker’s nightmare Tuesday night. A determined heckler interrupted the first lady’s talk at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at a home in Washington, haranguing her over her husband’s failure to sign an anti-discrimination order on behalf of gays and lesbians.

Obama at first seemed flummoxed by the interloper. And then, in a rare display of public peeve, she turned stern and combative. Moving away from the lectern and toward the heckler, she threw down a challenge. “One of the things I don’t do well is this,” she said, referring to the disruption. “Do you understand?” She said the protester could “listen to me, or you can take the mike, but I’m leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.”

As comebacks go, it wasn’t one of the classics, such as the surefire response of every nightclub comic to the blowhard in the third row: “I was the same way when I had my first drink, too.”

Then again, the rules of engagement between hecklers and speakers vary by time, place and position. Comedians are expected to whip out a withering retort; almost all have a few anti-heckler lines stored and ready for deployment. Sports fans, too, are entitled to heckle opposing players and to second-guess the refs.

Michelle Obama is only the latest political figure to face an impassioned heckler. From Reagan to Romney, and Clinton to Christie we look at how politicians have handled the uninvited interlocutors. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Politicians and public figures, meanwhile, fire back at their own peril.

Confronted by a heckler who urged him to raise taxes on corporations, Mitt Romney replied that they were part of his no-new-taxes pledge during a campaign stop in Iowa in 2011. “Corporations are people, my friend,” he declared, thereby providing a soundbite that reinforced his opponents’ portrayal of him as a friend of the wealthy.

On the other hand, George W. Bush defused an international incident in 2008 when an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at him and shouted, “This is a farewell kiss, you dog.” Bush’s amused response: “All I can report is it is a size 10.”

Unlike first ladies, seasoned politicians have faced hecklers many times and have strategies for dealing with them, says Chris Lehane, a Democratic political consultant. A humorous response is risky, he says, because it can come off as making light of a serious issue (“The middle of a speech is not the time to get in touch with your inner Seinfeld,” he says). Getting angry doesn’t play well, either; it makes a pol seem rattled and thin skinned.

Better, says Lehane, an advisor to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, was Gore’s “standard operating procedure” for dispatching loudmouths.

When interrupted, Gore would stop, listen a moment, and say, “‘the First Amendment’s a great thing, isn’t it? Let’s hear it for the First Amendment!’ The crowd’s roar would drown out the heckler, and then he’d continue: ‘Now, what I’m really here to talk about is [fill in the blank]. People have travelled a long way to hear this. My staff would be glad to have a conversation with you about the issue you’ve raised.’ That was the signal to the staff to hustle the guy out.”

According to Keith Fields, a comedian and magician, one of the most effective heckler-stoppers is to respond by saying, “Pardon me?”

“It puts the spotlight on the heckler, and they usually don’t know what to do next,” says Fields, the author of “How to Handle Hecklers.” “A heckler is a voice from the dark. If you shine a light on them, you take away their [anonymity]. They’re not good at thinking on their feet.”

Good comics know they have to size up a heckler quickly and to tailor their comeback appropriately, Fields says. Is the person drunk or angry? Or just a jerk? Male or female? A poorly conceived putdown can turn an audience’s natural sympathy for the performer against him. Witness the fate of former “Seinfeld” star Michael Richards, whose n-word-laden rant in response to a heckler in 2006 buried his career.

When in doubt, said Fields, there’s always a one-size-fits-all reply: “I’m sorry, I don’t speak alcoholic.”

As hecklers go, Robin Ficker was practically a pro. The Bethesda attorney and frequent political candidate terrorized visiting NBA teams at Washington Bullets and Wizards home games for years by taunting them from a seat behind the opposing bench. Ficker wasn’t subtle; his booming voice could be heard in the cheap seats.

Ficker was so obnoxious — or effective, depending on your perspective — that the NBA passed a rule outlawing fans from “interfering” with communications between players and coaches during timeouts.

Most of the players he taunted simply ignored him, or pretended to, Ficker says. But a few responded. Hall of Famer Charles Barkley always talked back. Once, Ficker tried picking on Barkley’s supposed political ambitions, yelling, “Charles, before I vote for you, I want to know what your views are about the economy, NAFTA and health care.”

Replied Barkley, “I do have a view about the death penalty. They should use it on you.”

Ficker recommends that Michelle Obama use a little humor or do some “role playing” to prepare for the next heckler she faces.

But even a veteran heckler like Ficker has only limited sympathy for the woman who interrupted the first lady. “It wasn’t very polite to the wife of the leader of the country,” he said. “I understand that many people feel the leaders of this country aren’t listening to them, but this woman’s timing was very poor.”

Yes, speakers sometimes look bad dealing with hecklers. But hecklers usually look worse.

The most famous heckle in recent years may have been the outbursts of Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), who twice shouted, “You lie!” during President Obama’s speech to Congress about health-care reform in 2009.

The impromptu commentary brought national and international attention to Wilson and supercharged his campaign fundraising. But it also was widely condemned as unacceptable by members of Congress from both parties.

In the end, Wilson did what most hecklers never do: He apologized for his behavior."

First there was a left cross — the extension of the basic federal pay rate freeze through the end of March. That was followed by a right hook — budget cuts that could cost many federal employees up to 20 percent of their pay from April through September.

The kick in the gut came Wednesday with House approval of a temporary budget measure that would stretch the freeze to a total of three years and kill any hope of stopping the cuts known as sequestration.

The loss is more than money to federal workers. Many are devoted to the mission of their agencies. They worry about how their unpaid days off will diminish service to the American people.

If the House budget measure, called a continuing resolution, becomes law, it would hit feds three ways. It would wipe out the tiny 0.5 percent raise they are scheduled to find in their pay checks next month, extend the freeze through the end of the year and allow unpaid days off.

House Republicans earlier had voted to extend the freeze, originally set for two years, to three, so that provision in the resolution was not surprising.

Almost no one likes the sequester cuts, however, and few predicted that they would be implemented. Yet, after giving itself an additional two months to avoid sequestration, Congress surrendered to its incompetence and allowed the cuts to begin last Friday. There was still some hope among workers that Congress would act to avoid forcing unpaid days off on employees.

With the House action, what little hope there was is fermenting into anger.

“In the GOP-dominated House of Representatives, knuckle-dragging lawmakers lashed out yet again at modestly paid civil servants,” said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

Lawmakers, even the knuckle-dragging kind, also are affected by the mess they created. They haven’t had a pay raise since 2009, but they make much more than your average civil servant.

Some on Capitol Hill and in the media have suggested that the impacts of the budget cuts have been exaggerated by the White House. They don’t seem to realize that the full effect won’t be felt until the furlough days begin and the services that employees provide suffer. The naysayers also apparently don’t appreciate the situation facing workers who stand to lose a significant chunk of their pay.

Among the latest to be told that they face unpaid leave are workers in the White House Office of Management and Budget. They will be furloughed for 10 days between April 21 and Sept. 7.

Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House, wasn’t optimistic about ending the freeze when he told reporters that chances are “probably pretty good” that it will last through the year.

“The federal employee pay freeze could hold for the remainder of the calendar year because Republican lawmakers insist on targeting these hardworking public servants,” he added in a statement. “I strongly oppose their continued efforts to single out federal employees, who have already contributed $103 billion toward deficit reduction and who are the only middle-class workers who have been asked to do so.”

If the freeze does last through the year, it won’t happen without a fight.

“I’ll be working my earrings off,” said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md), “to fight the extension of the federal pay freeze included in the House-passed continuing resolution.”

Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) had a similar reaction, though he said nothing about earrings.

One Republican in a prominent place to influence federal workplace issues has sponsored legislation that would encourage agencies to avoid furloughs. Rep. Blake Farenthold’s Protecting America’s Civilian Employees (PACE) Act would require the administration “to send a report to Congress indicating how amounts could be transferred within agencies and departments for fiscal year 2013 to avoid all furloughs or reductions in force.”

Farenthold (R-Tex.), chairman of the House federal workforce subcommittee, said, “We should be able to achieve the needed savings and keep our dedicated federal workforce going strong, without devastating furloughs, and that’s what my bill intends to do.”

The bill’s good intentions are probably better than its chances of passage.

USA TODAY

Capt. William Swenson is the second Medal of Honor recipient from September 2009 battle

Swenson is sixth living recipient of military%27s highest honor

Swenson was critical of delay in getting close air support to troops in battle

An earlier version of this story misstated the number of times that multiple surviving U.S. servicemembers have received the Medal of Honor for heroics in the same battle over the last 50 years. It has happened three times.

WASHINGTON — President Obama took a break from dealing with the fiscal crisis on Tuesday to award former Army captain William Swenson the Medal of Honor, making him the first Army officer to receive the military's highest honor since Vietnam.

Obama suggested that Washington could learn from Swenson, as he briefly reflected during the ceremony on the ongoing government shutdown and the precipice of default if Congress doesn't raise the nation's $16.7 trillion debt ceiling.

""At moments like this, Americans like Will remind us what our country can be at its best — a nation of citizens who look out for one another, who meet our obligations to one another not just when its easy but also when it is hard,"" Obama said. ""Will, you are an example to everyone in this city and to our whole country of the professionalism and patriotism we should strive for if we wear a uniform or not.""

Swenson became sixth living recipient of the honor from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was honored for his heroics in Afghanistan's Ganjgal Valley, where he was helping lead a column of American soldiers and Marines, and their Afghan counterparts, to meet a group of village elders. Swenson and his team were ambushed by some 60 well-armed Taliban fighters.

The American troops would face a barrage of rocket-propelled grenade, mortar and machine gun fire. Swenson would quickly coordinate a response of fire, while calling in artillery and aviation support, but the U.S. forces would become surrounded on three sides by the enemy. An hour into the fight communication with lead elements was lost.

At one point in the chaos, Swenson coordinated helicopter support, returning fire on the enemy and treating a critically wounded comrade, Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook.

Obama remarked about combat video from the helicopter that came to evacuate Westbrook, which showed Swenson emerge from a cloud of dust. The video, which the Army released last month, captures Swenson in a ""simple act of compassion and loyalty"" to his wounded comrade, Obama said.

""He helps carry that wounded soldier to the helicopter and helps place him inside and then in the midst the whipping wind and deafening roar he does something unexpected,"" Obama said. ""He leans in and kisses the wounded soldier on the head.""

Swenson and the Americans would fight for at least six hours and took more casualties and were even denied artillery fire and air support, but they never relented as Swenson led the recovery of the dead and wounded, Obama said.

The recognition of Swenson for his gallantry marks only the third time in the last 50 years that at least two surviving American servicemembers have received the Medal of Honor for actions in the same battle.

In 2011, Dakota Meyer, a Marine sergeant who also is now a civilian, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in that Sept. 8, 2009, battle in Afghanistan.

Swenson's medal comes with some controversy. Some, including Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., questioned whether the Defense Department purposely slow walked approval of the high honor. During an internal investigation of what happened at Ganjgal battle, Swenson expressed dismay that his repeated calls for close air support were denied.

The Army later acknowledged that close air support was improperly denied, and two Army officers who were at the combat operations center when the calls came in received reprimands.

Meyer told the Marine Corps Times before he was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 that it was ""ridiculous"" Swenson already hadn't received some form of valor award.

""I'll put it this way,"" Meyer said of Swenson. ""If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be alive today.""

In brief remarks to reporters following the ceremony, Swenson said the honor belongs not just to him, but all those who fought beside him.

""This award was earned with a team, a team of our finest,"" Swenson said. ""This medal represents them; it represents us.""

The mayor defied their command to get in their car and fled

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Two inmates who fled a Kansas prison face several charges in Missouri where they're accused of trying to ambush the officers pursuing them and of attempting to kidnap the mayor of the small town where they were eventually captured after less than a day on the run.

Platte County Prosecutor Eric Zahnd said Allen M. Hurst and Scott A. Gilbert were in the county jail on $5 million cash bond after being charged with 12 felonies Saturday. Hurst, 31, and Gilbert, 49, are accused of escaping from the minimum-security unit at the Lansing, Kan., Correction Facility on Friday, stealing a pickup truck and leading law enforcement on a 30-minute chase to a community across the Missouri River.

Zahnd said the men briefly stopped the stolen truck during the police chase and pointed a gun at Edgerton Mayor James Snook Jr., who was watching the pursuit from a street in his town, about 30 miles north of Kansas City. One of the men ordered Snook to get in the pickup, but Snook refused and safely fled the area.

""I don't know what he said, but he obviously declined. ... and he ran,"" Zahnd said of the mayor.

Snook, reached at home Saturday, declined comment.

A third inmate, Randy Ridens, 57, who also escaped with the pair from the northeast Kansas prison located across the Missouri River about 30 miles southwest of Edgerton, was captured late Friday in Topeka, Kan. Authorities didn't provide further details about how Ridens was apprehended.

Jeremy Barclay, spokesman for the Kansas Department of Corrections, said Saturday that Ridens has been returned to the Lansing prison. Additional charges have yet to be filed against him, Barclay said.

Corrections officials are investigating how the three inmates escaped from the large prison complex, which houses about 2,400 inmates. Barclay said the department will interview all three men about the escape.

""Inmates are usually helpful in detailing all of what they did,"" he said.

Authorities used GPS signals to locate the stolen pickup in Platte City, according to a probable cause statement. Officers tried to stop Hurst and Gilbert after they left a McDonald's, and the men eventually fired shots at four officers, hitting their cars, the statement said.

The officers, who were not injured, believed the two men were trying to ambush them, the probable cause statement said.

""At one point, officers radioed they perceived the suspects were luring officers into a trap by shooting the pursuing vehicles coming over a hill,"" the statement said. ""Within moments of that radio transmission, the fleeing vehicle had slowed on the blind side of a hill, allowing the passenger to take closer and more accurate shots at officers.""

Hurst and Gilbert stopped the truck at a rural home and bailed out of the vehicle after it became stuck in the yard of the house. They broke into the home, which had no one inside it at the time, the statement said.

After several hours of negotiations, Hurst and Gilbert walked out of the home and into police custody Friday about 5 p.m.

They're each charged with several counts of first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer and armed criminal action, and one count each of attempted kidnapping, resisting arrest and tampering.

The men, who had been serving sentences for crimes including burglary and theft, could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of the new charges, Zahnd said.

""The state of Missouri owes it to our law enforcement officers to do everything we can to protect those who are sworn to protect the rest of us,"" the prosecutor said."

He is on Twitter.

The First Amendment protects political speech and the use of resources (printing presses, the Internet, money) to facilitate that speech. Yet when someone wants to engage in the most obvious kind of political speech — supporting election campaigns — the government restricts this important constitutional right. These limits on political donations aren’t supported by any compelling governmental interest.

In a free society, people should be able to give whatever they want to whomever they choose, including candidates for public office.

In the seminal 1976 case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that such limits are justified when tied to preventing quid pro quo corruption or the appearance thereof. But the court also decided that restrictions on campaign spending put a heavier burden on political expression, one which the government couldn’t justify. One of the plaintiffs’ arguments in McCutcheon v. Federal Elections Commission is that contribution limits are simultaneously a limit on expenditures — a position that the Cato Institute supports in our amicus brief.

We argue that Buckley’s distinction between contributions and expenditures is problematic. Not only does it allow infringements on the freedom of speech, but it has led to an unbalanced and unworkable campaign finance system.

Various justices over the years have engaged this point. Justice Clarence Thomas in particular has assailed the distinction, pointing out that both contributions and expenditures implicate First Amendment values because they both support political debate. Moreover, candidates spend an inordinate amount of time fundraising instead of legislating because they face an unlimited demand for campaign funds but a tapered supply. At the same time, money has been pushed away from politically accountable parties and candidates and toward unelected advocacy groups, leading to a warping in political competition.

In a free society, people should be able to give whatever they want to whomever they choose, including candidates for public office. The Supreme Court should strike down contribution limits and give those who contribute money to candidates and parties as much freedom as those who spend money independently to promote campaigns and causes."

In a split vote, City Council members cleared the way early Wednesday for FivePoint Communities to build an extra 4,606 homes in the south Orange County city in return for constructing 688 acres of Great Park.

But the agreement is a big departure from what officials promised county voters in 2002 would be America’s next great municipal park, a bucolic landscape that would cover 1,300 acres and include forests, a lake, museums and a 60-foot-deep canyon.

In its place, county residents will get a more active space, with a sports complex twice the size of Disneyland, a wildlife corridor and an 18-hole golf course.

With the approval, FivePoint Communities now has the right to build nearly 10,000 homes around the park land, the former site of the El Toro Marine Corps base. It will be one of the region’s largest housing developments since the recession.

Final approval for the compromise came after a tense meeting, lasting nearly 10 hours, when it appeared that the eventual 3-2 vote could fracture over last-minute negotiations — including whether the city or the developer would control park operations.

To get the deal done, the developer finally agreed to give the city $10 million over time to maintain the park, starting in 2016, and an equal amount to improve the site’s main entrance.

“I will defend to the death Irvine’s ability to run its parks,” Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Lalloway vowed before the final decision.

Earlier, Mayor Steven Choi tried to draw the council together, pleading, “We are in the middle of a historic moment.” He, Christine Shea and Lalloway later voted in favor of the developer’s vision, with council members Beth Krom and Larry Agran dissenting.

To some, the decision stood as a broken promise. The new park, several residents said, lacked the museums and cultural spaces that were part of the original plan. Others said the new look seemed too “theme park-like.”

“They really are developing something that isn’t creating a great public park in any way,” Ken Smith, the New York landscape architect who spent years designing the space, said earlier this month. “It’s just sort of cheap and fast and takes up a lot of space.”

But years of spending and setbacks left city officials with few options.

In 2005, the military sold the land in an online auction to Lennar Corp., which struck a deal with Irvine to transfer about 1,300 acres to the city in return for being able to build thousands of homes. The company also paid Irvine $200 million.

City officials spent much of the money, but completed only about 230 acres of the park. Much of the land remains fenced off, dotted with old military barracks and criss-crossed by aging runways.

The real estate market crash slowed the arrival of the homes, and then Gov. Jerry Brown’s decision to eliminate local redevelopment agencies — the financial engine generating tax funds to continue construction of the park — dealt a crushing blow to Irvine’s plans.

Meanwhile, FivePoint, a Lennar spinoff, moved forward with plans to build homes around Great Park’s perimeter, and had a seller’s interest in making sure the space could be constructed.

“When you have conviction about something, you have to be patient that it will happen,” Emile Haddad, the company’s president and chief executive, said before the council meeting. “I believe this will happen.”

About 36,000 people have received ""potential overpayments"" from the agency between December 2010 and January 2013, the Government Accountability Office reported.

Disability insurance benefits are generally available to Americans who have been determined to be physically or mentally impaired by a long-term condition that prevents them from being able to work.

To become eligible, you must go through a five-month waiting period during which your earnings must not exceed $1,000 during any given month. But the GAO found that thousands of the people who were receiving benefits had incomes exceeding this limit.

Related: The Social Security mistake that costs retirees thousands

One recipient, a physician, raked in $90,000 in overpayments over three years, even though he had earnings of as much as $22,000 per month during the five-month waiting period. Two other people have received overpayments of more than $20,000 so far this year, despite the fact they held jobs that paid substantial income during the waiting period.

Once you qualify for disability benefits, you're able to enter a trial work period, where you can return to work and continue to receive benefits -- but only for up to nine months. The GAO found, however, that some people were receiving benefits long after that nine-month trial period had ended.

In one case, a woman was given $74,000 in payments after she had been working for more than nine months, and a man was paid $57,000 in benefits following the nine-month grace period.

Related: Federal disability trust fund on the brink

While the 36,000 people the GAO determined to have received overpayments represents less than 1% of all disability insurance recipients, the watchdog said the true number of improper payments could be higher. Only the Social Security Administration can determine precise numbers by conducting detailed investigations into specific cases.

The Social Security Administration said its accuracy rate for paying disability benefits exceeds 99%, but it will look into any potential overpayments.

""While our payment accuracy rates are very high, we recognize that even small payment errors cost taxpayers,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are planning to do an investigation and we will recoup any improper payments from beneficiaries. It is too soon to tell what caused these overpayments, but if we determine that fraud is involved, we will refer these cases to our Office of the Inspector General for investigation."""

Kelly Ayotte, a conservative Republican, announced her support Sunday for a bipartisan immigration overhaul plan, lending momentum to the comprehensive measure being debated in the Senate.

“Our immigration system is completely broken,” the New Hampshire lawmaker said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “This is a thoughtful, bipartisan solution to a tough problem.”

Ayotte, who was elected in 2010, is the first Republican to endorse the measure apart from the four in the Senate’s so-called Gang of Eight: Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

Ayotte, a former prosecutor and New Hampshire attorney general, said the U.S. has 11 million people living “illegally in the shadows” while the legal immigration system is not “meeting the needs to grow our economy.”

She wants more high-tech workers admitted to ensure the U.S. has the “best and brightest here … to grow our economy.”

Advertisement

She praised the bill’s pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are here without legal status as “tough but fair,” saying they would “go to the back of the line, pay taxes, pass a criminal background check, learn English.”

The bill faces a key test vote Tuesday. Several amendments are on tap before a vote on a final bill, which could come at month’s end.

With 60 votes needed for passage to avert a filibuster, Ayotte’s support puts backers closer to the threshold.

Still, some Republicans continue to push for enhanced border security. Among them is Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who cautioned on “Fox News Sunday” that the Senate’s bipartisan plan “has zero chances of passing in the House.”

Paul said he dislikes the plan’s cap on agricultural workers. He also wants people who are in the U.S. on work visas to stand in line for U.S. citizenship in their country of origin, and he would not create a new path to citizenship.

“I’m really trying to make immigration work,” he said. But other senators are “going to have to come to me and they’re going to have to work with me to make the bill stronger if they want me to vote for it.”

Jeff Sessions tries to halt the inevitable","Not since George Wallace, perhaps, has an Alabamian taken as passionate a stand for a lost cause as the one Jeff Sessions is taking now.

Bipartisan immigration legislation is making its way inexorably through the Senate Judiciary Committee. Although its ultimate fate is unclear, its passage by the committee is assured, and conservatives on the panel such as ranking Republican Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Orrin Hatch (Utah) are doing what they can to improve the bill. Even firebrands such as Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Mike Lee (Utah) are holding fire.

Then there’s Sessions. The wiry Southerner is on a one-man crusade to undo the compromise drafted by the Gang of Eight (four of whom, two Democrats and two Republicans, are colleagues on the committee).

He has dominated the four days of hearings to “mark up” the bill. As of midday Monday, he had spoken for two hours and 56 minutes — far longer than the second-place Grassley (2:24) and third-place Chuck Schumer of New York (1:38).

As of lunchtime Monday, Sessions had persuaded his colleagues to adopt just two of the 49 amendments he filed. (He voted against one of those two, after his colleagues modified it in a way he didn’t like.)

His most prominent defeat: a 17-1 vote last week against his proposal to restrict legal immigration. Before that bipartisan rebuke, he spent one hour and 11 minutes arguing his case.

On Monday morning, Sessions was up against a bipartisan majority again, this time opposing an amendment by fellow Republican Hatch to expand the use of fingerprinting. Sessions objected, saying the proposal didn’t go far enough.

His face flushing crimson, he waved a Department of Homeland Security report in the air that he said was being kept secret because it concluded that such “biometric” immigration checks weren’t as costly as claimed.

“I’m highly offended!” Sessions shouted in his trademark twang. “This is why the American people are upset about this! They don’t trust their government! . . . Now, that’s the truth. And I’m getting dad gum tired of it.”

“Well,” Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) replied calmly, “a lot of people are tired about a lot of things.” Leahy tried to call a vote on the amendment, but Sessions interrupted.

“Mr. Chairman, I had some other things to say about it,” he announced. Sessions had his say, then Leahy tried again to move along.

“Wait, one more thing,” Sessions said. “I’m concerned about this. I have the floor.”

“I’m sorry, I thought you’d finished,” the chairman said.

“I know you like to interrupt,” the petulant Alabamian complained. “I’m trying to explain a thought.”

“Repeat your statement as often as you’d like,” Leahy said. “You have the right.”

Sessions spoke again, and again. Then four of his seven GOP colleagues voted against him and sided with Democrats to approve Hatch’s amendment.

Even his fellow Republicans have at times become exasperated with him. Early in Monday’s session, Grassley was asking a question of Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) when Sessions interrupted. “I just want to follow up a little bit on that,” he said.

Grassley said he didn’t want people to think “we’re asking these questions to stall. I’d like to not have a debate, if we could.”

“I’m not debating,” Sessions muttered.

This is true. Sessions isn’t debating. He’s doing whatever he can to retard the inevitable. At every opportunity — regardless of the amendment under consideration — he gives speeches about the evils of the compromise.

Even before the panel considered the first of its amendments Monday morning, Sessions piped up. “Um, I would just note that this is not a bill that strengthens border enforcement,” he declared, then proceeded to read a pair of letters from opponents.

Minutes later, Sessions demanded to be heard on an amendment, even though its sponsor, Grassley, had withdrawn it.

“The amendment is no longer before us,” Leahy told him.

“Well, I know, but it’s very important,” Sessions said.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) brought up a noncontroversial amendment about elder abuse. “All those in favor?” Leahy asked.

“Mr. Chairman?” Sessions broke in, requesting more time to speak.

After the senators voted down one of Sessions’s amendments (it would have denied a low-income tax credit to those earning legal status), they moved to an amendment by Chris Coons (D-Del.) to simplify deportation hearings. “I’m very concerned about this amendment,” Sessions announced. After Coons tried to offer reassurance, Sessions declared, “I’m afraid your attempts to answer the questions I’ve raised are not sufficient.”

Leahy held a voice vote. The only audible “no” came from the man from Alabama.

He Was Previously Senior Editor At National Review', 'Lives In Washington']",Goldberg: A petty decision by Obama,"It’s official. President Obama has named former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) as his nominee for secretary of Defense. Hence, we may be in store for the worst Defense secretary nomination fight since George H.W. Bush’s failed appointment of Sen. John Tower (R-Texas) more than 20 years ago.

The interesting question is, why? Why waste the political capital? Why pass over more qualified candidates who would sail through confirmation, including Michele Flournoy — who’d be the first female Defense secretary?

The most ridiculous answer is among the mainstream media’s favorites: bipartisanship. According to Politico, the choice “appeals to Obama’s bipartisan spirit.” The Washington Post, in a front-page news story, says that a “successful nomination of Hagel would add a well-known Republican to the president’s second-term Cabinet at a time when he is looking to better bridge the partisan divide, particularly after a bitter election campaign.”

What is particularly bizarre about this talking point is that it often appears in articles that go on to talk about how tough and grueling the nomination battle will be thanks to strong Republican opposition. So which is it? Is it a bridge across the partisan divide? Or is it an “in-your-face” nomination (South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham’s words) aimed at eliciting a fight with Republicans?

At least from the perspective of nearly everyone on the right, it’s the latter. Whether it’s payback for the scuttled non-nomination of Susan Rice to be secretary of State or whether it’s simply of a piece with Obama’s efforts to divide and conquer the GOP that were on display throughout the “fiscal cliff” negotiations, the consensus in much of conservative Washington is that Obama is making this nomination at least in part out of spite.

Indeed, that’s one major reason Hagel has so many unlikely friends these days. Hagel — never overburdened with too heavy a reputation for insight, knowledge or humility — is loathed, with ample justification, by many foreign-policy hawks, Israel supporters and neocons (those are overlapping but hardly synonymous groups, by the way). He is arguably the most prominent opponent of sanctions on bad actors in the Middle East. He’s heaped scorn on those who’d take a hard line with Iran. His geopolitical acumen is of the sort that fails to shine even in the comment sections on blogs. The Iraq war, for example, was according to Hagel a war for oil.

And Hagel’s views on Israel are, to be generous, hard to reconcile with those of the man who successfully campaigned for president just a couple of months ago as a staunch friend of that country. Even if Hagel’s gaffe about the perfidious influence of the domestic “Jewish lobby” was accidental, his coolness to Israel is hard to dispute. For instance, when Palestinian suicide bombers were tearing the country apart in 2002, Hagel insisted in an OpEd article that this was the time for Israel to “take steps to show its commitment to peace.”

For some, the thinking seems to be that if the Hagel nomination is a thumb in the eye of the neocon crowd, it must be worth it. David Greenberg writes in the New Republic that many “liberals are bending over backward to praise Hagel, in effect saying they would prefer an archconservative male mediocrity to a liberal female rising star.” Why? Because punishing Hagel’s enemies is worth a potentially lousy Defense secretary.

This spirit results in some really batty arguments for Hagel’s confirmation. For instance, New York Times columnist Roger Cohen writes that the “chief” reason Hagel should be confirmed is that doing so “will provoke a serious debate on what constitutes real friendship toward Israel.” Even if you agree with Cohen’s barmy views of geopolitical “friendship,” Hagel’s got real problems if this is the best case for his nomination.

The Defense Department faces imminent cuts, Chinese and Russian nationalism are ascendant, the Middle East is becoming even more destabilized and theocratic, and we’re still at war in Afghanistan, but Hagel’s chief qualification is that he’ll be a great conversation starter? Wow.

The coming nomination fight will undoubtedly focus on the strength of the case against Hagel. But the real indictment of Obama’s pick is the weakness of the case for Hagel — and the pettiness of the pick in the first place.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes issued a verbal ruling which is expected to be followed by a written opinion later Tuesday.

""The city no longer has the resources to provide its citizens with basic police, fire and emergency services,"" Judge Rhodes said, ruling that Detroit, once the nation's fourth-largest city, ""was and is insolvent.""

The long-awaited decision sets up a bitter battle between the city’s finance officials and its unions, creditors and retirees, who expect deep cuts in pensions and sales of treasured city assets, such as its art collection, as part of the Chapter 9 process.

""It's a sad day for the people of Detroit,"" American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees attorney Sharon Levine told CNBC's Scott Cohn in an interview outside the courthouse. She said the AFSCME filed an immediate appeal.

In the meantime, Detroit’s emergency financial manager, Kevyn Orr, is expected to proceed towards the city’s next major step: submitting a plan to adjust Detroit’s approximately $18 billion in debt. Judge Rhodes said he will not stay the bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of any possible appeals.



Orr, who had testified the city's current conditions are ""unacceptable,"" released a statement praising the judge's ruling and pledging to ""press ahead with the ongoing revitalization of Detroit.""

Judge Rhodes read for 90 minutes from his 140-page ruling before issuing the court's decision.

His ruling listed the city's long litany of financial woes, including the loss of manufacturing jobs and population in recent decades.

""As of April 2013, about 48 percent of the city's street lights were not working,"" he said. ""In 2012 the average police response time was 30 minutes; in 2013, 58 minutes; and the national average is 11 minutes.""

There were a number of wrinkles in the judge's ruling. Among other things, Judge Rhodes said Detroit did not negotiate in ""good faith"" with the unions to whom the city owes money -- normally a prerequisite for allowing bankruptcy.

At the same time, he noted the obstinacy of the unions in the negotiation process saying that the city could not realistically negotiate with a ""stone wall.""

Rhodes' decision is a critical milestone. He said pensions, like any contract, can be cut, adding that a provision in the Michigan Constitution protecting public pensions isn't a bulletproof shield in a bankruptcy.

The city says pension funds are short by $3.5 billion. Anxious retirees drawing less than $20,000 a year have appeared in court and put an anguished face on the case. Despite his finding, Rhodes cautioned everyone that he won't automatically approve pension cuts that could be part of Detroit's eventual plan to get out of bankruptcy.

Orr, a bankruptcy expert, was appointed in March under a Michigan law that allows a governor to send a manager to distressed cities, townships or school districts. A manager has extraordinary powers to reshape local finances without interference from elected officials. But by July, Orr and Gov. Rick Snyder decided bankruptcy was Detroit's best option.



Detroit, a manufacturing hub that offered good-paying, blue-collar jobs, peaked at 1.8 million residents in 1950 but has lost more than a million since then. Tax revenue in a city that is larger in square miles than Manhattan, Boston and San Francisco combined can't reliably cover pensions, retiree health insurance and buckets of debt sold to keep the budget afloat.

Donors have written checks for new police cars and ambulances. A new agency has been created to revive tens of thousands of streetlights that are dim or simply broken after years of vandalism and mismanagement.

While downtown and Midtown are experiencing a rebirth, even apartments with few vacancies, many traditional neighborhoods are scarred with blight and burned-out bungalows.

Besides financial challenges, Detroit has an unflattering reputation as a dangerous place. In early November, five people were killed in two unrelated shootings just a few days apart. Police Chief James Craig, who arrived last summer, said he was almost carjacked in an unmarked car.

The Asiana pilots said in interviews with the National Transportation Safety Board that they had set the auto-throttles to maintain an air speed of 137 knots. That’s a significantly faster speed than the plane actually achieved as it came in for its landing at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday.

As the inquiry entered its fourth day, Deborah A.P. Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said investigators were still trying to verify whether the throttles were properly activated.

The pilots’ statements do not resolve the central question of why the Boeing 777’s speed and altitude fell so far out of the normal range for landing at SFO before it hit a sea wall and crash-landed. But outside air safety experts said the statements suggest a risky reliance on technology when the flight crew should have been constantly monitoring the airplane’s speed.

“Whether it was engaged or not working is almost irrelevant,” said Barry Schiff, a former TWA pilot and an air safety consultant. “The big mystery of Flight 214 is why in God’s name did these two pilots sit there and allow the air speed to get so low.”

Experts said the pilots should have been monitoring the plane’s speed every few seconds, and could have manually taken control of the engines at any time.

Auto-throttles, which are connected to an airplane’s flight management computers, allow pilots to select the appropriate speed for takeoff, cruising or landing. The devices automatically make corrections if there are deviations from the setting.

Jon Russell, a veteran airline pilot and safety official for the Air Line Pilots Assn. on the West Coast, said the auto-throttle is a valuable tool.

“I don’t know what happened. It just doesn’t make sense,” said Russell, noting that the pilots were very experienced in Boeing aircraft. “The situation deteriorated a lot farther than it should have.”

Much of the information released by the NTSB since Saturday morning’s crash has focused on the pilots, who were flying too low and slow during their final approach. Two people were killed and 182 were injured as the plane’s landing gear and tail struck a seawall at the end of Runway 28L.

Investigators said the plane was flying 30 knots under its target landing speed of 137 knots, or almost 158 mph, and had dipped well below the normal flight path into the airport.

Several seconds before the crash landing, a stall warning went off in the cockpit. With the impact 1.5 seconds away, the pilots finally attempted to accelerate and abort the landing, investigators said.

The Asiana pilots were making a visual approach to San Francisco without the instrument landing system, a part of which was not operating due to airfield renovations. NTSB officials said, however, that there were other automated systems and visual references available to assist the flight crew.

At the time, the pilot, Lee Kang-kook, who had only 35 hours flying Boeing 777s, was being checked out and supervised in the plane by Lee Jung-min, a captain who had been certified as a training pilot June 15, less than a month before the crash. It was Lee Kang-kook’s first landing in San Francisco in a Boeing 777 and Lee Jung-min’s first landing at the airport in a training situation.

Hersman said that when the jetliner crashed, three pilots were in the cockpit. Lee Kang-kook was in the left-hand or captain’s seat. Lee Jung-min was in the right-hand or co-pilot’s seat, supervising his flight, and a relief first officer was sitting in the jump seat to monitor the landing.

The approach to San Francisco International Airport is not particularly difficult, but it does require closely monitoring a jetliner’s air speed as it executes a sweeping 180-degree counterclockwise turn in the approach from the north, according to Robert Ditchey, former vice president for operations at US Airways.

Ditchey said that only the pilot in the left-hand seat — in this case, one who was not yet fully qualified to land the 777 — could see the runway during the turn. The supervising pilot in the right-hand seat could not see the runway from his position, he said.

Aviation safety experts and federal investigators have questioned why the crew did not recognize the problem and take action before the plane struck the end of the runway.

Hersman rejected the suggestion that any problem or misunderstanding about the auto-throttle by the crew would excuse the pilots from their duty to manually fly the airplane.

“But let me be clear: the crew is required to maintain a safe aircraft, which means that they need to monitor. They have a monitoring function, all three of them in the cockpit. One of the very critical things that need to be monitored on approach to landing is speed,” she said.

None of the crew was tested for drugs or alcohol after the crash, Hersman said, because foreign flight crews involved in accidents do not fall under the same regulatory requirements as U.S. crews.

Hersman also said that two flight attendants in the rear of the aircraft were ejected after the impact and found on the side of the runway with injuries.

During a news briefing in Seoul on Tuesday, Asiana President Yoon Young-doo defended the pilots, saying they were “excellent” and qualified members of the flight crew with experience flying into San Francisco International.

Lee Kang-kook, who has almost 10,000 hours in the air, had previously flown into San Francisco 29 times as a co-pilot on Boeing 747s, Yoon said. Lee Jung-min, with almost 12,000 hours, had flown into the airport 33 times.

Yoon said he personally apologized to the families of the two Chinese girls who were killed in the crash. He said he planned to visit the crash site and meet with survivors and their families in San Francisco to apologize. He added that would assist the investigation in any way he could.

That's largely because the threats have never been substantive; the most serious, Fast and Furious, landed some distance from his desk, and the media didn't bite at right-wing efforts to make it a big deal. But the Department of Justice's heavy-handed media subpoenas and search warrants have shifted that perspective, aligning the media for the first time with the interests of a Republican Congress antsy to see Holder go. Calls for Holder's resignation aren't common in the mainstream media, but they're happening — even at the administration-friendly Huffington Post.

RELATED: Holder and the White House Try to Make the Case for Media Surveillance

Forcing Holder out, however unlikely, would be a significant blow to the administration. So the attorney general (and, presumably, his boss) have launched an effort to rebuild his reputation, operating under the assumption that, with the media anyway, it's still salvageable.

RELATED: Obama Is Pushing for a Media Shield Law That Could Also Shield Him

The campaign has two components. Step one: Meet with the press and discuss the existing rules about how the government can collect information in leak investigations. Step two: Advocate for a new media shield law. The media would be wise to be skeptical of the overtures.

RELATED: Criminal Investigation Into Bush-Era Prisoner Deaths Announced

Politico's Mike Allen first reported on the meetings earlier today. The Department of Justice is ""contacting D.C. bureau chiefs of major print and broadcast news organizations"" for a meeting with Holder.

""The A.G. realizes that things might have gotten a little out of balance, and he wants to make changes to be sure the rules fully account for the balance between the First Amendment and law enforcement,"" the source said. The first media meeting will be held at main Justice, likely later this week. A later meeting will include First Amendment advocates.

Story continues

This appears to be a follow-up to Obama's calls last week for a review of the rules around issuance of subpoenas to media organizations. The rules, articulated here, offer only guidance, not mandated regulations. But they are ""intended to provide protection for the news media from forms of compulsory process, whether civil or criminal, which might impair the news gathering function"" — the heart of the concern in the aftermath of the Associated Press and Fox News information-gathering. Under the policy, media organizations must be informed about record collection, which should only occur as a last resort and with the authorization of the Attorney General. In both the AP and Fox cases, the Justice Department has offered lengthy explanations for how it followed those rules as best it could.

RELATED: Rand Paul Gets His Answer on Drones: 'No'

Which is where the second effort comes in. Earlier this month, the president began making quiet calls to reintroduce a media shield law. The policy would establish federal protection for media sources — protection that exists in 49 states but not at the highest level of government. The problem, as we noted at the time, is that previous versions of the bill, like that introduced by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, wouldn't have done much to protect the reporters in either of the recent high-profile cases.

RELATED: How Eric Holder Will Hold on Amidst the Fury in Washington

Peter Sterne at the New York Observer explains why:

The proposed federal shield law before the Senate is even weaker than Colorado’s. It simply allows journalists to petition a judge, who weighs the story’s public interest value and decides whether the journalist should be forced to reveal his or her sources.

Matthew Cooper was investigated by the Bush White House in 2003 after writing a story for Time based on a CIA source. At our sister publication National Journal, Cooper explains that press protections are largely contingent on good will. ""Prosecutors are often aspiring politicians,"" he notes, suggesting that fear of angering the press often served as a disincentive in the 1970s to subpoena those who ""buy ink by the barrel."" That generally hasn't changed much.

Prosecutors and others are always going to have the opportunity to persuade a court that national security overrides First Amendment issues. The best we can count on is that prosecutors will use their powers with discretion, especially since in most national security cases they wind up not prosecuting for any leak itself but for false statements to the FBI.

From Holder's perspective — and the president's — there isn't a lot of value in instantiating strong media protections, beyond the value of the positive media that might result. The Department of Justice isn't investigating security leaks in an effort to ingratiate itself with The New York Times; it's doing it to try and crack down on what it sees as dangerous law-breaking. The needs of the Times and The Washington Post are and will always be secondary to that.

But for now, they need to keep the ink-barrel-buyers happy, if only to keep the barbarians on Capitol Hill at bay. How far the media will be able to push the administration on new, tighter regulations remains to be seen. If Holder isn't successful in finding middle ground, the desire for a strong shield law might do exactly what the administration wants least: Create common ground between the media and a Republican Congress. If the White House can't deliver on a law that the media likes, John Boehner and Darrell Issa would certainly be happy to call attention to any apparent antipathy by the administration to protecting the First Amendment."

This allowed 9/11 Truther and cop killer-defender Van Jones to claim Ailes had made a “racial charge” against Obama:

Van Jones being Van Jones is not news.

But for Wolf Blitzer to take Ailes completely out of context and stand idly by as Jones dishonestly smears Ailes for making a “racial charge” only serves to further explain why this network is swirling the drain. In the age of the Internet, the media can no longer get away with this kind of stuff. Once the truth gets out, the damage to your brand’s credibility is forever.

The background and the truth:

Yesterday, Vanity Fair published an exclusive excerpt from an upcoming Ailes biography. Here’s the full context of the quote Blitzer wasn’t interested in sharing with his audience. I’ve bolded the portion not shared with CNN viewers:

‘Obama’s the one who never worked a day in his life. He never earned a penny that wasn’t public money. How many fund-raisers does he attend every week? How often does he play basketball and golf? I wish I had that kind of time. He’s lazy, but the media won’t report that.’ He noticed my arched eyebrows and added, ‘I didn’t come up with that. Obama said that, to Barbara Walters.’

Here’s what Obama told Barbara Walters in December of 2011:

BARBARA WALTERS: Okay. What’s the trait you most deplore in yourself and the trait you most deplore in others?

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Laziness.

WALTERS: You’re lazy?

OBAMA: You know, it’s interesting. There is a deep down, underneath all the work I do, I think there’s a laziness in me. I mean, it’s, it’s probably from, you know, growing up in Hawaii, and it’s sunny outside and sitting on the beach.

This morning, CNN’s Soledad O’Brien got caught on-the-air by her own panel doing the same thing.

Anyone sensing a pattern here? Horrible journalism? Agenda? My vote goes to “both.”

It’s also worth mentioning that those who hear the word “lazy” and immediately think of black people are the ones who might want to do some soul-searching.

ADDED: CNN Chief, Jeff Zucker (pictured), needs to have a sitdown with Blitzer to ensure the record is corrected on-the-air today. He might also want to throw in an apology

RELATED: DOJ Finally Sues Apple and Publishers for E-Book Price Fixing

Today, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division Bill Baer issued a statement saying that the DoJ will sue to prevent a $20.1 billion deal that could crush competition in the U.S. beer market. Baer writes:

If ABI fully owned and controlled Modelo, ABI would be able to increase beer prices to American consumers. This lawsuit seeks to prevent ABI from eliminating Modelo as an important competitive force in the beer industry.

Recent years have seen a lot of consolidation in beer ownership. In 2008, InBev (the Belgian company that owns Stella Artois and Beck's) bought Anheuser-Busch (the American maker of Budweiser, Rolling Rock, and Michelob, among other brands). It currently owns half of Grupo Modelo (their beers include Corona, Pacifico, and Modelo), but has been trying to buy the other half since the summer of 2012. The DoJ is now arguing that when you throw all those beers together under the same ownership, you get a monopoly.

You want a ""peppermint stout,"" a beer with ""caramel-like notes,"" or a blend with hints of ""hibiscus flowers?"" Anheuser-Busch has you covered, apparently."

President Obama did something relatively unusual Thursday -- he issued 13 pardons.

That brings Obama's total to 52 pardons during his presidency, still far behind recent successors George W. Bush (189), Bill Clinton (396), Ronald Reagan (393), Jimmy Carter (534), Gerald Ford (382), and Richard Nixon (863), according to statistics compiled by Mark Knoller of CBS News.

Obama could catch President George H.W. Bush, who issued 74 pardons, though he served only one term.

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama has weighed in. The pro football commissioner, has too. And now, a Native American tribe hopes recent attention to controversy surrounding the name of Washington’s National Football League team will provide the momentum needed to get it changed.

As NFL executives arrived in the nation’s capital for their annual fall meeting on Monday, the Oneida Indian Nation held a symposium in town to discuss their campaign to find a new name for the Washington Redskins after 80 years.

“We are asking the NFL to stop using a racial slur as the name of Washington’s football team,” said Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter.

The “Change the Mascot” campaign launched last month with a string of radio ads airing in Washington and cities where the Redskins play this season.

The NFL executives were invited to the symposium, but Halbritter said none attended.

In an interview with the Associated Press last week, Obama said if he were the owner of the Redskins and he knew the name was “offending a sizable group of people,” then he would “think about changing it.”

Halbritter began his remarks by thanking the president for weighing in.

“As the first sitting president to speak out against the Washington team name, President Obama’s comments over the weekend were nothing less than historic,” Halbritter said. “Isn’t that the real issue? No matter what the history of something is, if it’s offending people, then it’s time to change it. And this is a great time to do it.”

Obama on the Redskins

A Washington Post poll from June indicated that two-thirds of people who live in the D.C. metropolitan area didn’t want the Redskins to change their name, but more than eight in 10 said it wouldn’t make much of a difference to them if the name were changed.

Last month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who had previously expressed support for the team mascot, changed his tone on the “The LaVar Arrington Show with Chad Dukes” on 106.7 The Fan in Washington.

“I want all of us to go out and make sure we’re listening to our fans, listening to people of a different view, and making sure that we continue to do what’s right to make sure that team represents the strong tradition and history that it has for so many years,” Goodell said.

The NFL confirmed on Monday that it would meet with Oneida leaders.

But Redskins owner Dan Snyder has steadfastly refused to consider it, telling USA Today last spring that he will “NEVER” change his team’s name, even if they lose an ongoing federal trademark lawsuit that would stop the NFL team from exclusively profiting from the Redskins name.

In addition to the federal trademark lawsuit, a group of U.S. lawmakers drafted a bill last spring to cancel trademark registrations that use the name “Redskins.” Two of them, Democrats Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, and Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota attended Monday’s forum to voice their support.

D.C. council member pushes name change for Washington Redskins

McCollum, who is co-chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus, said the use of the Redskins name is “exploitation perpetrated for profit by the NFL and Dan Snyder’s football business.”

“Mr. Snyder, change the mascot. End this ugly history and tradition of your team’s racial slur. Pick a new mascot. Pick one that offends no one, hurts no one, dehumanizes no one. It is time to put dignity and respect for native American people ahead of your profits,” McCollum said.

Snyder did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.

But Redskins attorney Lanny Davis said Halbritter is being “selective in his outrage,” citing other teams named after Native Americans who are not targeted in the “Change the Mascot” campaign.

“Why is he not protesting the Atlanta Braves Tomahawk Chop, or President Obama’s hometown Chicago Blackhawks?” Davis said.

While Halbritter said that there are certain Native American names that “can be unifying and respectful,” he maintains that the Redskins name is “a dictionary defined racial epithet,” that shouldn’t be used to “sell a national sports team to America or to the rest of the world.”

Washington Redskins’ owner: ‘We will never change the name of the team’

“Washington’s continued use of the current team name is not just a slur against one group of people, it has demonstrable and serious public policy cultural educational, public health ramifications for our entire country,” Halbritter said.

Critics argue that the Redskins’ name is based on a historically offensive slur and presents negative identity issues for Native Americans, a community already distressed by a slew of public health and social crises including high rates of poverty, diabetes, and suicide.

Dr. Michael Friedman, a clinical psychologist who attended the forum, called Snyder’s refusal to consider calls for a name change “textbook bullying.”

“Experimental study after experimental study shows that if you bring a Native American person into an experimental situation and you show them an image of a Native American mascot, their self-esteem goes down, their faith in their community goes down, their feeling that they can achieve goes down,” Friedman said.

But Davis said Friedman is ignoring other data that shows Native Americans are not insulted by the name.

“I ask him, since there’s no intent to disparage or disrespect - and I certainly respect those, and am sorry for those, who are offended - why is he selecting the Washington Redskins? Does he see the Tomahawk Chop of the Atlanta Braves fans? They’re doing that not out of disrespect. They love the Atlanta Braves.”

Other at the forum, like Norton, said the intent behind keeping the name doesn’t matter.

“I want to say this to Redskins fans. No one blames you for having used a name that was always used as this team. They will only blame you if you continue to use it and if you use it will impunity,” she said.

The NFL Redskins were in Boston before the Washington franchise was born in 1933.

(CNN) —

The National Security Agency notched a much-needed win in court Friday after a series of setbacks over the legality and even the usefulness of its massive data collection program.

A federal judge in New York ruled the NSA’s bulk collection of data on nearly every phone call made in the United States was legal.

The ruling contrasts with another ruling last week by a federal judge in Washington, who called the same program “almost Orwellian” and likely unconstitutional.

In his ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said the NSA’s bulk collection of phone records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act was legal. The program was revealed in classified leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

“But the question of whether that program should be conducted is for the other two coordinate branches of government to decide,” said the ruling by Pauley, an appointee of President Bill Clinton.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, said it would appeal Pauley’s ruling.

“We are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government’s surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,” said Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU’s deputy legal director.

Review: NSA snooping program should stay in place

President Barack Obama is examining a review of the surveillance efforts that recommended changes in how the NSA program was conducted. Obama said last week he would decide what to do about it in January.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the NSA’s bulk collection of metadata – phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content – apparently violates privacy rights.

His preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice, but Leon limited the decision only to their cases.

“I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary invasion’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval,” said Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush. “Surely, such a program infringes on ‘that degree of privacy’ that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.”

Leon’s ruling said the “plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a Fourth Amendment claim,” adding “as such, they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury.”

He rejected the government’s argument that a 1979 Maryland case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata, noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in three decades.

Leon also noted the government “does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA’s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature.”

However, he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information, pending an appeal by the government.

A Justice Department spokesman said in response to Leon’s ruling that “we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found.”

Explosive revelations this year by Snowden triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks.

Snowden’s disclosures led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance.

The NSA has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.

The case before Leon involved approval for surveillance in April by a judge at a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for “foreign intelligence purposes.”

Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s, the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests – wiretapping, data analysis and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States.

The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government’s ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad, eventually including the metadata collection.

In order to collect the information, the government has to demonstrate it is “relevant” to an international terrorism investigation.

However, the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide: “A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person.”

In defending the program, Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA’s director, told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that “15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 (of the Patriot Act) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations.”

Initially, telecommunications companies such as Verizon were the targets of legal action against Patriot Act provisions. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses.

The New York ruling makes it more likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will have to tackle the issue of privacy and settle the dispute over the the NSA program.

For years, the courts have relied on a 1979 Supreme Court precedent that found privacy rights didn’t extend to personal information people give to third-parties such as the phone companies, which store basic data on calls made. The secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has relied on that ruling to periodically reauthorize the NSA phone data program.

But technology has come a long way since then; modern cell phones are in constant communication with phone towers and tell a lot more information about phone customers than old land line phones. And at least some justices may be ready to take on the issue again.

Ruling last year in an unrelated case, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the 1979 standard may be “ill suited to the digital age” because people reveal a lot more information in seemingly mundane tasks.

“It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties,” she wrote.

Pollak'],Why Obama Fears the Gettysburg Address,"President Barack Obama has elected not to attend the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address on Tuesday, Nov. 19th. Instead, he will be meeting with Senators at the White House to persuade them not to impose new sanctions on Iran, and to convince them of the merits of an agreement that will allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium at low levels. No doubt, that is important–but it is also a revealing choice.

Lincoln’s speech is remembered because it expressed, simply and elegantly, why hundreds of thousands risked their lives for an idea: “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” When President Obama sought to rouse Americans to support a “targeted military strike” on Syria, he failed to move the nation. Now, he prefers to counsel the nation to accept a weak compromise with tyranny.

The contrast is striking. Obama has repeatedly likened himself to Lincoln, launching his presidential campaign from the Old State House in Springfield. He cast his candidacy as the fulfillment of the promise Lincoln made at Gettsyburg–“that all men are created equal.” Like Lincoln, Obama came up through the Illinois legislature. Like Lincoln, Obama became known for his oratory. But Lincoln’s speeches had something Obama’s never will.

Lincoln’s speeches are admired not just because they are well-constructed, but because they contain timeless principles to which he devoted his career and to which he committed the nation. The fate of Obama’s speeches is to serve a political purpose, then fade. His speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, an appeal to unity, launched his national career. Today, it is largely forgotten amidst the failures of his divisive presidency.

Obama’s address on race in Philadephia, in the midst of the 2008 presidential primary, was praised by Chris Matthews and mainstream media as “a speech worthy of Abraham Lincoln.” Yet just weeks after declaring he could “no more disown” his pastor, the race-baiting Jeremiah Wright, than he “could disown the black community,” Obama severed ties with Wright and his church, the platitudes of Philadelphia quickly cast aside.

Lincoln’s speeches were more than words–which is why his words are still cherished. The highlight of the commemoration at Gettsyburg in 1863 had been the 13,000-word speech by Edward Everett, a rousing, anti-Confederate diatribe. But Lincoln did not distinguish among Union and Confederate dead. All, he suggested, fought in their own way for the same cause. He was committing the nation, and himself, to reconciliation.

Obama has never shown the same inclination to put partisanship aside for the sake of the nation’s needs. He has coveted the aura of Lincoln’s charisma, but has never humbled himself to learn from Lincoln’s example the way Ronald Reagan humbled himself before “The Boys of Pointe du Hoc.” For Obama to speak at Gettysburg, to stand where Lincoln had once stood, would only sharpen the contrast. That is why he is staying away."

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']",Lawmakers split on impact of access to benefits for illegal immigrants in Senate bill,"As the Senate prepares to take up comprehensive immigration legislation, one of the most pressing questions is how and when illegal immigrants who set out on the path to citizenship qualify for federal benefits.

Lawmakers disagree sharply on this front, which could drive debate as they begin formal work on the bill Thursday.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., points out that the proposal says applicants would not qualify for at least 10-13 years -- and would not qualify for another five years after getting a green card, under current law.

Further, Rubio argues that the proposal has ""very specific"" rules governing anyone who could be considered a ""public charge,"" or someone who would live off the government dole.

""If you are a public charge, you don't even qualify for renewal of that temporary status that you're getting,"" Rubio said.

But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., another Republican senator who has emerged as one of the chief critics of the bill, says the law does not properly enforce that provision.

Sessions told Fox News that the so-called ""public charge"" law, as currently written, has been ""totally ignored"" to date. And he argued that many immigrants will be eligible for benefits much sooner than proponents claim -- including the so-called ""dreamers,"" young illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. their parents.

Sessions said 2-3 million illegal immigrants who claim that status will be able to have access to federal benefits in five years.

And, he added, eventually ""everyone who entered illegally will be able to accept any benefits this country offers.""

After the 15-year waiting period, the number accessing federal benefits could be an additional 10 or 11 million.

Nevertheless, Rubio insists there will be checks at every stage of the process.

""When you re-apply at the six-year mark, by the way you're not eligible for any public benefits at that point, you have to prove you're not a public charge,"" he said.

A controversial report released earlier this week by the conservative Heritage Foundation estimated that, under the bill, the total cost of legalizing 11 million illegal immigrants could approach $6.3 trillion over the course of their lifetimes. The study factored in taxes those immigrants would pay, but also the services and other benefits that would be spent on them.

It has come under heavy scrutiny from some conservative economists who say it ignored significant factors - like the possibility of some of these illegal immigrants moving up the income ladder after coming out of the shadows, while expanding the economy and boosting federal tax revenue.

Sessions and other critics are unconvinced.

""We respect people who want to come to America. We believe that we should accept immigrants,"" Sessions said. ""But we've got to be realistic about the impact.""

As the debate wages on, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Wednesday offered an amendment to end the dispute -- by proposing to let illegal immigrants stay but deny them from ever receiving any ""means-tested benefits,"" or welfare."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/08/02/Daily-Beast-Harasses-Private-Citizens-Who-Donated-to-Palin-s-PAC,2013-08-02 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Daily Beast Harasses Private Citizens Who Donated to Palin's PAC,"This week, the Daily Beast contacted and harassed private citizens who made contributions to Sarah Palin’s political action committee, SarahPAC. In doing so, the outlet attempted to also weaken her organization by smearing it in the eyes of those most responsible for ensuring Palin’s free-market populist message and conservatism is widely disseminated.

During the first half of 2013, a political off-year in which there are few elections, Palin’s political action committee spent $35,000 more than it took in. The Daily Beast seized on that number and tried to convince donors to SarahPAC that Palin was defrauding them by spending money on expenses common to every political action committee.

As the Daily Beast conceded, Palin’s donors were not buying the Beast’s malarkey.

Tim Crawford, the treasurer of SarahPAC, told Breitbart News that since 2013 is an off-year, the organization did not aggressively raise money, cognizant of the fact conservative donors were flooded with requests during the 2012 election cycle.

“For the most part we gave our donors a break and didn’t fundraise aggressively at all. Very pleased with the results,” Crawford told Breitbart News. “It is an off year after a presidential election where every donor was bombarded with requests.”

As the Daily Beast mentioned, Palin’s PAC did make a $5,000 contribution to Jason Smith; the conservative Republican won a special election in Missouri’s Eighth Congressional District in June by a hefty margin, 67% to 27%.

John Avlon, the co-founder of the anti-Tea Party “No Labels” group, was recently promoted to be the “Executive Editor” of the Daily Beast. Avlon oversees a publication that declared the Tea Party was dead earlier this year before conceding less than six months later that the movement has roared back to life.

“No Labels” donors want to see the Tea Party destroyed, and Avlon’s group benefits financially and politically if the Tea Party and conservatives are weakened. Palin, coincidentally, is the political figure who former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint said had the most impact in Republican primaries. Furthermore, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) declared at this year’s CPAC that he would not be in the Senate were it not for Palin’s support in the Texas Republican Senate primary.

Showing Palin’s strong grassroots support, the Daily Beast acknowledges that 75% of SarahPAC’s donations are from “small donors” who contribute less than $200. The Daily Beast admitted they reached out to a “number” of donors and got three on record, all of whom dismissed the outlet’s assertion that SarahPAC was wasting their money.

One donor said, “I trust her judgment and her record.” Another said she has “done research” on Palin’s advisers and the ones that she uses are the “good” ones. Another donor mocked the Daily Beast for insinuating Palin was wasting their money, simply telling the reporter, “Come on, get real.”

The publication seems troubled that Palin, a figure whose star power is surpassed by few in American politics, paid North Star Strategies’s Jason Recher to organize and accompany Palin to events to ensure they went smoothly. To the Daily Beast’s surprise, Palin also has advisers, like Rebecca Mansour–who is mentioned in the piece–that are indispensable to any political figure, especially those like Palin whose time is in demanded like few others.

Breitbart News has already systematically undercut Avlon’s assertion that Palin was being hypocritical for railing against Washington’s permanent political class while having political advisers who fight against it. Palin’s advisers are different, as Breitbart News reported:

They don’t hang “for sale” signs around their necks every election cycle to field a slate of candidates to butter their breads. They don’t go on television shows while not disclosing their business interests or allegiances when attacking other candidates. In fact, it is difficult to even think of the last time a Palin staff member actually went on a television program. Again, it is because these are people who work for Palin, are assembled for the long run, and put Palin’s interests ahead of their own. They don’t have a stable or roster of clients.

In closing, the Daily Beast criticized Palin’s PAC for spending money on hotel rooms so that Palin could give a “commencement speech in the tiny town of Republic, Washington.” As Breitbart News reported, Palin gave that speech in a town elitist New York outlets like the Daily Beast so often dismiss, deride, and ignore.

The Daily Beast criticized Palin for paying her way–and not forgetting her roots–to speak at the high school graduation in Republic, Washington. Perhaps the outlet expected her to walk or drive to give that address. More disturbingly, though, the outlet harassed and pestered private citizens who donated to her political organization, trying to turn them off from supporting a political figure and organization that runs counter to the one co-founded by the Daily Beast’s Executive Editor.

That is the type of permanent-political-class politics that Palin and her political action committee have always fought."

Now, they’re taking a second look.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) is working on his own version, which some Republicans hope can bridge the divide separating the parties on the immigration overhaul, which has languished in the GOP-led House.

But it could also fall flat, both with Republicans who reject any citizenship option for those not lawfully in the country, and with Democrats who dismiss it as too little, too late.

The approach was aired Tuesday at a House judiciary subcommittee hearing as Republicans search for a way to respond to an issue that top party leaders say is vital for the GOP’s future.

The early reviews were not positive from those who could benefit most. “Dreamers,” as the young immigrants who had fought for the Dream Act call themselves, now reject the idea as a “childish” political game and vow not to leave behind the parents who struggled to give them better lives in the United States.

They largely back the Senate bill, which would provide a 13-year process for citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. But House GOP leaders have said they will not take up that bill.

In often tearful testimony, one young immigrant told the House subcommittee she could not imagine accepting the option of citizenship for herself but not her parents.

“When members of Congress tell me that I deserve an opportunity to earn citizenship and my mother does not, I tell them that if anyone deserves that opportunity to earn citizenship, it is my mother,” said Rosa Velazquez, 30, a graduate student in Arkansas.

Velazquez, who came to the United States from Mexico 25 years ago, described her mother’s job cutting chicken in one of the state’s poultry factories. “My mother’s working hands are the foundation on which this country was built,” she said. “I am my mother’s daughter. She and I are equal.”

Opponents, including Democrats on the panel, warned that excluding most immigrants who are in the country illegally from the possibility of citizenship would create a permanent underclass.

But interest in the proposal from several key Republicans on the panel could signal broader support within the House GOP, setting up a possible showdown with Democrats.

“We all view children as a special, protected class,” said Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the subcommittee chairman, who warned that holding out for greater inclusion would “only wind up hurting the most vulnerable.”

Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) said, “It seems to me it’s time we deal with these children in a very special way and bring them into our society.”

Those sentiments are a turnaround from late 2010, when Republicans opposed the Dream Act as it was narrowly approved by the then-Democratic-led House. The measure later died in the Senate.

Efforts to showcase a softened Republican approach to immigration hit a snag Tuesday when Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) suggested that young drug-runners could try to take advantage of such a citizenship proposal.

“For every one that’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there that … weigh 130 pounds and have calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” King said in an interview with the website Newsmax.

The White House, which supports the Senate-passed immigration overhaul, quickly shot back.

“Every member of the GOP should condemn Rep King for comparing the Dreamers to drug mules, they represent what is great about this country,” Dan Pfeiffer, an advisor to the president, wrote on Twitter.

The hearing was the first chance for many House Republicans to discuss publicly the citizenship pathway. Among those testifying was a representative from the Southern Baptist Convention who drew on biblical passages to support the immigration overhaul, creating a lively exchange over interpretations of Scripture with some Republicans.

The White House signaled its rejection of the limited approach. Pfeiffer earlier in the day pointed to an opinion piece that criticized what it called the “cruel hypocrisy of the GOP immigration plan: allow some kids to stay but deport their parents.”

The comment drew a sharp rebuke from Gowdy, who has been working on alternatives to the Senate bill in search of a compromise, as coming from a “self-serving political hack.”

Speaker John A. Boehner has yet to bring an immigration bill for a vote on the House floor and is unlikely to do so before Congress recesses for the month of August. The Ohio Republican has pledged not to consider legislation unless it has majority support from House Republicans.

A bipartisan group of House lawmakers has been working behind the scenes on a bill that would provide a citizenship pathway for most immigrants in the country illegally, along with border security and new visa programs. It is expected to be unveiled in the fall.

Fighting fires with aging tankers from another era Many of the tankers used by the Forest Service are retired military aircraft that are costly to maintain and dangerous to fly. Wings break off, engines catch fire and parts must be scrounged.

T

he blaze near Yosemite National Park had incinerated scores of acres and was spreading fast. It was time, federal officials decided, to attack it from the air with all the resources at their command.

As the nation's armada of air tankers began landing at a staging area near here, it was clear that this was a fleet from another era.

The planes showed their age. Propellers coughed to a stop and smoke spewed from their piston engines. Many of these restored tankers were built during the Eisenhower administration.

The Forest Service fleet, which drops retardant to give firefighters on the ground crucial time to put out raging wildfires, is too old, industry and government officials say. Because there are so few planes, critics contend, the fleet is no longer capable of doing all it should to contain fires. Over the last decade, the service reduced its fleet from 47 to just 12, all operated by businesses under federal contract.

Critics also say the planes are dangerous. Since 2001, tanker crashes have killed 22 aviators. Six died last year.

""It's pathetic,"" said Tony Kern, former Forest Service chief of aviation. ""We have brave aviators using ancient technologies and as a result they're losing their lives. It's a horrifying fact that won't change unless government action is taken.""

Demands that the Forest Service replace these planes have come from former pilots, government officials, firefighter advocacy groups and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Half-century-old aircraft are difficult to keep flight-ready, and these tankers take an extra beating from the turbulence, updrafts and hot ash they encounter on firefighting missions.

Wings break off. Engines catch fire. And, in those conditions, stressed pilots make mistakes.

A few of the tankers started out as airliners. Nearly all the rest are retired military aircraft that were refurbished after being culled from the Pentagon's boneyard of discarded planes in Arizona.

Maintenance is a challenge. Engine parts are scrounged from warehouses. In one instance, a propeller was pulled from storage at a museum. If parts can't be found, technicians machine their own from blueprints drawn up around 1950.

At the air attack base near Yosemite in August, the challenges the Forest Service faces were apparent. After one of the tankers rumbled in for a landing, mechanics scurried to replace a blown engine.

It happens so often that the crew hauls a trailer full of spare parts from fire to fire.

Nothing can match the speed and power of a large tanker, the Forest Service says.

An all-out air attack to slow a fire includes helicopters and smaller single-engine tankers. But their capacity to carry retardant is much less than the Forest Service's larger tankers, which can drop 2,000 to 10,000 gallons ahead of the fire.

Aging air tankers Neptune Aviation Services Inc. is the Forest Service's biggest air tanker contractor. The company flies the P-2V Neptune, a Navy sub hunter that first flew in 1947.

""That's the best way to get a lot of retardant delivered,"" said Jeanne Pincha-Tulley, a fire commander who oversees planning for some of California's largest fires. ""When you're trying to hold a ridge and you see it coming, it definitely settles your stomach a bit.""

California, with 23 smaller air tankers, is one of four states that have their own fleets to supplement the Forest Service's armada.

These days, firefighters know they can't count on aerial support; there are too few planes. Half the times a Forest Service air tanker was requested last year, the answer was no: They were all fighting fires elsewhere.

Christian Holm, 55, is a former wildland firefighter who became a tanker pilot in 1998. At the time, he was stationed at an air attack base for four months a year and would swarm a fire with as many as 10 other planes. Now he works nearly year round.

""A lot of times, I'm the only guy out there,"" he said.

The Forest Service quickly suppresses more than 95% of wildfires. The ones that escape immediate containment, like the Rim fire in Yosemite, take longer to put out, and costs can skyrocket.

One plane, 112 days, about 160 fires From April 28 to Aug. 17, Neptune Aviation's 55-year-old P-2V air tanker flew 243 times, dropping retardant on about 160 fires.

The agency has exceeded its $1-billion annual budget for fighting wildfires seven times since 2002. Aviation accounts for about a fourth of that budget. Most of the aviation expenditure goes for helicopters; about $50 million a year is spent on deploying the large tankers.

Nearly all of the nation's firefighting aircraft are owned and operated by private companies, and the bill starts mounting when an incident commander calls aircraft to a fire.

Aviation companies have to keep bids low to win government contracts, and old military aircraft come cheap. Neptune Aviation Services Inc. of Missoula, Mont., has a Forest Service contract to operate eight large air tankers, the most of any company. It flies Lockheed P-2Vs, an aircraft first built in 1946 to hunt for Soviet submarines.

Walking into the company's engine room is like walking into a World War II aircraft hangar. Mechanics sort through oil-smeared parts as they refurbish hulking piston-powered engines and hefty propellers.

""We have had Navy officials walk through here, and they're absolutely shocked that we keep these things flying,"" said Gavin Mouse, 43, overhaul specialist with Neptune.

The company is now modifying the BAe-146, a regional airliner produced in Britain in the 1980s. Neptune officials say it makes a great tanker, but it's more expensive to operate. The daily rate for keeping one of the military planes available is about $14,500, with an average flight rate of $8,000 per hour. The airliner runs about $25,000 daily, plus $10,000 an hour in flight.

""We're doing the best we can, realizing we can't do it on the cheap,"" said Tom Harbour, the Forest Service's director of fire and aviation management. ""When you look forward, by golly, do we have a problem. We need more aircraft and much more capability.""

There are few federal standards regulating the safety of these planes. The Federal Aviation Administration sets standards for aircraft airworthiness and flight crew competency. But once the aircraft begins to fight forest fires, the FAA does not have authority or responsibility to enforce its rules.

Contractors hire outside engineering firms to set safety guidelines for the planes.

""That's problematic,"" said Michael Barr, a former accident investigation officer who now teaches aviation safety at USC. ""It's a little like shooting an arrow from a bow, then drawing the target around the arrow.""

Eleven studies since 1995 have concluded that the Forest Service needs to replace its tankers.

In 2009, the service sought $2.5 billion to buy 18 to 28 aircraft. The funding was denied by its parent agency, the Department of Agriculture.

The department's inspector general acknowledged that the Forest Service needed new planes but said the proposal was poorly prepared and did not include enough data. The Government Accountability Office reached similar conclusions last month.

Walt Darran, chairman of the advocacy group Associated Aerial Firefighters and a former tanker pilot, said the problems stem from a lack of leadership.

""The Forest Service only changes the way it does business after a high-profile death,"" he said. ""Any improvements that have been made in this industry have been bought with blood.""

In 2002, a 46-year-old Lockheed C-130 tanker dropping retardant on a fire near Lake Tahoe broke apart when its wings folded up like a bird's. The crash killed the three crew members. A camera crew captured the accident and the footage was shown on the nightly news across the nation.

Another fire plane, this one 57 years old, broke apart during a Colorado fire one month later, and an investigative panel was convened to examine the industry.

The panel's 60-page report released in 2002 said that the Forest Service's safety standard was unacceptable and that its oversight was lacking. It recommended that the agency foster a closer relationship with the aviation industry to improve the safety of its fleet. By 2004, the Forest Service had removed 33 tankers from its fleet.

The Forest Service says it is trying to modernize. It issued contracts to seven companies this year; most of those planes are not yet ready to enter service. Although the contracts call them ""next-generation"" planes, they aren't so new.

One of them was pulled from an aviation museum in San Bernardino, where it had been on display for 10 years.

Probably only one other lightening-rod VIP could have stolen the mogul’s buzz in the pro-am zeitgeist tournament known as the White House Correspondents’ weekend, and darned if she didn’t pull a surprise appearance. You betcha, she did.

Sarah Palin walked into the Georgetown home of Mark Ein shortly before noon Saturday to dazzle a brunch crowd of Washington insiders and visiting luminaries. Black bell-sleeved summer dress, shiny hair. She and a clean-shaven Todd Palin posed for a few photos with hosts Wendi Murdoch and Susan Axelrod, then carved a path through the crowded dining room with their host for the weekend, Fox News’s Greta Van Susteren. (** read more: Donald Trump vs. Sarah Palin at WHCD weekend **)

So, a win for Van Susteren, scoring the buzziest guest? (Her other guest, Kate Hudson, had to bow out for movie-promotion commitments.) Sure, but with an asterix, for Palin’s not actually expected at tonight’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, Van Susteren’s husband John Coale told us: “She’s just doing the brunch and the after-parties.”

At Friday night’s “Emerging Voices in Media” party, looking down on the White House from atop the Hay-Adams hotel, every attractive young pundit you’ve ever seen hold forth on cable-news mingled over champagne and canapés. Rodell Mollineau, a longtime aide to Sen. Harry Reid who just left the Hill for a new job as head of a Democratic mega-PAC, noted wryly that it was the first year in many that he hadn’t scored an invitation to the dinner.

“Not getting invited is a rite of passage,” said Terence Samuel, an editor at National Journal. Some years you’ve got the juice, other years you don’t.

The trend these days is to insist that your pre-WHCD party be For a Good Cause. At a Creative Coalition cocktail party at Dupont Circle’s Washington Club, a line of showbiz folks took the stage to denounce bullying. “Courage is totally cool – Mahatma Gandhi,” said David Arquette, wearing a purple velvet suit. At a late-night loud-music fete thrown by National Journal and the Atlantic in collaboration with Impact Film Fund, actors Maria Bello and Ian Somerhalder tried to holler some words about the BP oil spill over the din of the open-bar scene.

Miro Sorvino dropped her iPhone on our foot. John Waters walked in.... nope, it’s look-a-like Steve Buscemi. “Top Chef’s” Carla Hall towered over the crowd. CNN’s Dana Bash showed off her baby bump. Cate Edwards showed off her fiance, surgical resident Trevor Upham; they’re tying the knot in October. Hey, isn’t that blonde in the white beaded dress “Semi-Homemade” cookbook diva Sandra Lee? Sandra, what’s your connection to the White House Correspondent’s dinner? “Nice to meet you,” she said, tossing us an icy glare and walking away. (Nothing personal. She refused to be photographed with Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. Go figure.)

Just down the street at the MPAA, actual politicians (Sen. Pat Leahy, former Sen. John Breaux) mingled with new head Chris Dodd. “I’m trying to bring some life back to this association,” he told us. “This is a way for me to thank all the people in this business and promote what we do.”

“Saturday Night Live’s” Seth Meyers, tapped to entertain the crowd at Saturday’s dinner, was the guest of honor. Meyers said he was “nervous but excited” and said he’d been working hard to prepare jokes for his routine. “Thanks for inviting Donald Trump!” he said with a big grin when he found out we were from the Washington Post.

We followed the bread crumbs to the New Yorker’s rooftop party at the W Hotel, where we spotted Van Susteren and her husband for the third time. Van Susteren jetted in from covering the royal wedding in London in time for the DC follies. “I never get to go out nights,” she told us. “You never see me at parties.”

Twin DJ’s in pink chino suits, white glasses and iPads kept the club beat; they played a ‘Talking Heads” song when they saw David Byrne. Kind of amazing since the lights were so low it was hard to see much of anything. Ted Olson, Gene Sperling, Rashida Jones, Zach Galifianakis some guy from “Modern Family” and literally bumped into Jon Hamm, who thought it was deliberate. He was getting that a lot. Lara Logan, radiant in a black-and-white patterned dress, was making one of her first public appearances since her brutal assault in Cairo.

Hey, Sean Penn! We hear you were just at the White House, talking about Haiti. Get a good reception. “Everybody’s fighting the same machine,” he told us, “but we’re all in synch.” It sounded more profound the way he said it.

Why all the stars? Last year editor David Remnick tried to invite David Axelrod, only to find out he’s been booked since January. Thus the celebs. “I’m not against meeting people I wouldn’t normally meet,” said Remnick. “And I’m not against promoting the magazine. But it has become bizarro world.”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/us/14pot.html,2013-01-14 00:00:00,['Adam Nagourney'],"In California, It’s U.S. vs. State Over Marijuana","“I had some reservations going in,” he said of Mr. Davies’s enterprise. “But the industry was exploding. Matt wanted to have internal controls in place. And we thought: This was a legitimate business. If the State of California deems it legitimate, we want to be the best at it.”

Mr. Davies’s accountant, David M. Silva, said he set up spreadsheets to keep track of inventories, revenues and expenses. “I’ve been a C.P.A. for 30 years,” Mr. Silva said. “What I saw was a guy who was trying to run an operation in an up-and-up way.”

The federal authorities said they stumbled across the operation after two men were spotted apparently breaking into Mr. Davies’s 30,000-square-foot Stockton warehouse. The police said they smelled marijuana plants. Federal agents conducted a raid and confiscated 1,962 plants and 200 pounds of marijuana.

Mr. Davies, who is free on $100,000 bail, greeted visitors to his gated home by asking them to speak softly while walking through the entryway so as not to awaken his sleeping infant. He called out to his wife when asked when he was indicted: “Hey, Molly — we were indicted on your birthday, right? July 18.”

Mr. Davies referred to marijuana as “medicine,” and himself as a turnaround expert.

“We were basically pharmacists for medical marijuana — everything was in full compliance with state law,” he said. “We paid our employees. We paid overtime. We had people going for unemployment if we fired them.”

“Why are they coming after me?” he asked. “If they have such a problem with California, why can’t they sue California?”

Stephanie Horton, 25, who went to work for Mr. Davies after going to one of his dispensaries to obtain medical marijuana to help her deal with ovarian and cervical cancer, said she was devastated by the arrest of employers she described as among the best she had ever had — not to mention the loss of her job."

He Has Been The Washington Post S Enterprise Editor', 'Local Columnist', 'Berlin Bureau Chief', 'He Has Covered Politics', 'Education', 'Pop Culture']",Honorees in arts and humanities often reflect administrations that honor them,"The nation’s highest awards for the arts and the humanities aren’t about politics, one president after another has said; rather, they’re about celebrating the artists and scholars whose work best represents American ideals of freedom, openness and creativity.

But when one set of presidents honors conservative icons such as Midge Decter, Hilton Kramer and the Hoover Institution, and another set of presidents bestows medals upon liberal voices such as Anna Dea­vere Smith, Toni Morrison and Philip Roth, a political message is being sent.

When President Obama hands out this year’s National Humanities Medals and National Medals of Arts at an East Room ceremony Wednesday, he will make a markedly different statement than his predecessors. By honoring William Bowen, the former Princeton University president who wrote one of the most rigorous defenses of affirmative action, and Tony Kushner, the playwright who turned the AIDS epidemic into a metaphor for a society suffering from a selfishness intrinsically linked to Reaganism, he takes a stand in the nation’s continuing culture wars.

The honorees are selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, whose chairmen are appointed by the president.

Obama is by no means the first president whose arts and humanities awards aligned his administration with a particular intellectual approach. George W. Bush’s annual honorees tended to celebrate tradition, broad appeal and middle American tastes: He honored conservative actor Robert Duvall, jazz traditionalist Wynton Marsalis, the genial TV host Art Linkletter, the PBS show Austin City Limits, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association.

Bill Clinton shared Bush’s preference for celebrities, but his administration’s choices tended to come from more liberal sectors of the culture, such as Hollywood (Robert Redford, Gregory Peck, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee) and media (Studs Terkel, Garrison Keillor, Norman Lear and National Public Radio).

Some choices seem to be above politics: When Obama honors Tijuana Brass trumpeter and record label mogul Herb Alpert this year, when Bush gave an arts medal to electric guitar pioneer Les Paul or when Clinton honored violinist Isaac Stern, ideology does not appear to be at play.

But the 24 honorees that Obama’s staff selected this year continue this administration’s turn away from celebrities and, especially in the humanities choices, toward writers and academics known for strong and even harsh critiques of U.S. government and policy. Journalist Joan Didion’s early writings against American policy in Central America and editor Robert Silvers’ direction of the New York Review of Books as a forum for criticism of U.S. policy from Vietnam to Iraq, along with Kushner’s work as an acutely political playwright, indicate a view of the medals as an opportunity to support a certain stripe of artistic and intellectual activism.

Although some administrations have sought to avoid controversy in their selections, the choice of Kushner represents the opposite pole. The playwright, one of eight New York City residents among the 24 honorees, wrote a scathing short play in 2004 in which Laura Bush reads a bedtime story to Iraqi children who have been killed by American bombs. Kushner is best known for his two-part AIDS/Age of Reagan play “Angels in America.”

More recently, the City University of New York rescinded an invitation to Kushner to receive an honorary degree because of allegations by a college trustee that the playwright had insulted the state of Israel. The invitation was later restored. Kushner has called the removal of Palestinians from their homes in Israeli-occupied territories ethnic cleansing, but he said he is a strong supporter of Israel’s right to exist.

Many of this year’s choices are less controversial, including screenwriter and playwright Elaine May, who was half of the 1950s comedy team Nichols and May and went on to direct movies such as “The Heartbreak Kid” and co-write films such as “Tootsie” and “Reds.”

Another arts medal is going to George Lucas, creator of the “Star Wars” franchise, which helped introduce the blockbuster culture that has dominated Hollywood since the 1970s. “Star Wars” represented a break from the cynicism and edgy aesthetics that defined post-Vietnam cinema, instead immersing viewers in a nostalgic “far, far away” world that had more to do with the movie serials and sci-fi adventures of baby boomers’ youths than with the probing self-examination that characterized movies in the years just before “Star Wars.”

Lucas is less well-known for his important contributions to the medium in sound and visual effects technology. With the THX sound system and his Industrial Light & Magic firm, Lucas vastly improved the clarity and precision of image and sound, which audiences now take for granted in theaters and home entertainment systems.

Among the music awardees this year is Allen Toussaint, a songwriter and producer who wove New Orleans’ rich, dense musical history into the R&B, funk and soul of the 1960s and ’70s. He’s an alchemist who took a local sound and made it universal — sparking imitations and echoes in the work of the Rolling Stones, Glen Campbell and scores of hip-hop producers.

Herb Alpert’s A&M Records introduced many Americans to mariachi and Brazilian music, and then went on to make a huge impact on pop music, producing hit albums by Carole King, Cat Stevens, Janet Jackson, the Police and Soundgarden.

Alpert and Toussaint also share a connection: “Whipped Cream,” the title track of Alpert and the Brass’s chart-topping 1965 album, was written by “Naomi Neville,” Toussaint’s pseudonym.

There’s only one Washington-area honoree on this year’s list, an arts medal for the Washington Performing Arts Society. Medals have been given to arts institutions and sponsors before, including Hallmark Cards and Exxon Corporation (both under President Ronald Reagan), the MacDowell artists colony (Clinton), the Interlochen Center for the Arts summer camp (George W. Bush) and the Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival (Obama).

But WPAS gets its award before Carnegie Hall or Lincoln Center, and the honor comes just as the D.C. organization has embarked on a major change of direction, having hired a new leader, Jenny Bilfield. The award reflects the 10-year tenure of her predecessor, Neale Perl, who ramped up WPAS’s educational activities and presented an increasing number of rising artists.

Although this year’s list is weighted heavily toward New York artists and scholars, the medalists do include some regional figures, such as Joan Myers Brown, who has brought African American dance and dancers into the national spotlight by founding Philadanco (the Philadelphia Dance Company) and by supporting black dance artists around the country by creating the International Association of Blacks in Dance and the International Conference of Black Dance Companies.

Honorees often recall their moment in the White House as a career highlight. The poet Donald Hall, who won an arts medal in 2010, cherished his brief embrace with Obama, but noted that “honors inevitably bring on self-doubt. Everyone knows that all medals are rubber.”

Summers, President Obama’s preferred candidate to lead the Federal Reserve, the messy debate over a military attack in Syria was the final sign.

After weeks of opposition to his candidacy from an array of progressives, the president’s inability to rally Congressional Democrats on Syria persuaded Mr. Summers that his most important audience — the Senate, which must confirm a Fed chairman — probably could not be won over.

He concluded that the White House was also unlikely to overcome opposition to his candidacy from many of the same Democrats, who view him as an opponent of stronger financial regulation, according to supporters who insisted on anonymity to describe confidential conversations with him.

“Clearly Obama couldn’t bring his own most enthusiastic supporters to back him on an issue of national security,” one supporter said. “How was he going to corral them for Larry?”"
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-heads-florida-weekend-boys-171053691--politics.html,,[],Obama heads to Florida for weekend with the boys,"PALM CITY, Fla. (AP) — Faced with a long weekend in an empty White House, President Barack Obama figured he needed a getaway, too, so he put together a golf outing with some buddies.

Not at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland or at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, two Washington-area military posts where he's a regular on their courses.

Instead, he went south, to Florida, to spend the long President's Day weekend staying and playing at the Floridian, an exclusive and secluded yacht and golf club on the state's Treasure Coast. He arrived Friday night after a speech in Chicago and wasn't expected to be seen again in public — including by the members of the news media traveling with him — until he returns to Washington on Monday.

""At this time, there are no public events scheduled or plans for the president to leave the grounds of the golf club,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Saturday.

Call it a weekend with the boys, presidential style.

Eyebrows might have been raised at the thought of the president, any president, high-tailing it out of Washington, without his family, for some ""me time"" hundreds of miles away from the Oval Office. First lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha are on an annual ski vacation out West.

As it turns out, it isn't at all uncommon for a president to go on vacation on his own.

And, Obama has gone off alone in the past.

During the weekend, the president, a sports enthusiast and avid golfer, planned to practice his putting technique on the club's private, 18-hole course, which opened in 1996, according to golfnow.com, and is owned by Jim Crane, a Houston businessman who also owns Major League Baseball's Astros.

Crane has made political contributions to Republican and Democratic candidates, including $35,800 last year to a joint fundraising committee for Obama and the Democratic Party, and $2,300 to Obama in 2007, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Members of the club and their guests have access to one of eight cottages, a 68-slip deep water marina, the club's 61-foot Viking yacht, a 24-foot Hurricane Deck Boat and the club's private helicopter service with two on-site helipads along the St. Lucie River.

Story continues

The White House arranged for reporters traveling with the president to stay at a hotel in Port St. Lucie, about a 25-minute drive away.

Obama's longtime friend from Chicago, Eric Whitaker, joined him on the flight from Chicago to Florida. The two have played golf together in the past. Another regular member of Obama's golf foursomes is White House trip director Marvin Nicholson, who also traveled with the president on Friday.

Besides Whitaker and Crane, Obama played golf Saturday with Ron Kirk, the outgoing U.S. trade representative; Tony Chase, a Houston businessman and lawyer who threw a fundraiser for Obama last March; and Milton Carroll, chairman of Houston-based CenterPoint Energy. Carroll donated $2,300 to Obama's first presidential campaign, according to campaignmoney.com, which gathers information about financial contributions to federal political campaigns.

Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Obama also got some instruction and played a few holes with Butch Harmon, Tiger Woods' former swing coach. Harmon had told The Associated Press by text message earlier Saturday that he would be at the Floridian to play nine holes and practice with Obama.

Crane said earlier Saturday that he was scheduled to play a round of golf with Obama on Sunday, according to a report on the website for Major League Baseball. Crane said he was at the club to welcome Obama when he arrived Friday night.

""Looks like I might get to play with him a little bit tomorrow, and we're looking forward to that,"" Crane said Saturday as he addressed the Astros before a team workout, according to mlb.com. ""He came in late last night and was very cordial. His staff is great and it's very exciting. I mean, when do you get the president staying in your place?""

Crane said he received a call about a week ago asking if the president could use the course. He said Obama then contacted him personally to thank him.

America's presidents have been taking solo vacations for decades, according to Larry Knutson, a former White House reporter for The Associated Press who wrote a book about presidents and their vacations.

Although Bess and Margaret Truman visited him there just a couple of times, President Harry Truman vacationed most often by himself in tropical Key West, Fla. Many aides, all men, accompanied him.

Truman enjoyed the male companionship and his wife may have stayed away out of a desire to not interrupt his cherished late afternoon and evening games of poker. Truman vacationed in Key West 11 times between November 1946 and March 1952; his wife and daughter joined him for the first time in November 1948, after his surprise victory in that year's election campaign.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt often visited his cottage at Warm Springs, Ga., alone; wife, Eleanor, didn't much care for the place or the Southern atmosphere. Roosevelt was at Warm Springs, on his own, when he died in April 1945.

He also often traveled solo to his home in Hyde Park, N.Y., during World War II. The first lady often did not accompany Roosevelt on his wartime visits to Shangri-La, which is now the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, or when he traveled on the presidential yacht or on Navy warships.

In 1997, President Bill Clinton was in Florida for fundraising and to play in a golf tournament when he stumbled on steps at the home of golf pro Greg Norman and needed surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right knee. He was treated at a hospital in West Palm Beach before being flown to Washington for the operation.

Obama's stay at the Floridian isn't his first get-away without his wife and daughters.

In 2010, as his 49th birthday approached, Obama was left home alone after the first lady took Sasha with her on a trip to Spain, and Malia was away at camp.

Rather than stay in the sprawling White House by himself, Obama fled, taking family dog Bo, home to Chicago for a birthday dinner with friends there that included Oprah Winfrey, her pal Gayle King, Whitaker and White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, a fellow Chicagoan.

Pollak'],"Coulter Jokes, Provokes at USC Republican-Tea Party Event","Conservative columnist Ann Coulter entertained an audience of 400 at the University of Southern California on Sunday night at an event co-sponsored by the USC College Republicans and the Hancock Park Patriots, a local Tea Party group.

Fears of large and violent protests failed to materialize, as five peaceful demonstrators were the only presence outside the Ronald Tudor Campus Center.

Coulter spoke at length about crime, and the New York of the 1980s–to which, she joked, New Yorkers were about to return with leftist Bill de Blasio as mayor. (She is re-reading Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities to prepare, she joked.)

Though she has written about race and crime, she is an equal-opportunity critic–arguing, for instance, that accused murderer Amanda Knox was protected by the U.S. media because she is a “pretty white girl.”

There were plenty of macabre jokes to follow–including an extended riff on how several MSNBC hosts would each commit suicide (“Chris Matthews would bungle it…Al Sharpton would do it in such a way as to blame some poor white guy”). On a more serious note, she slammed MSNBC for attacking what they called “pro-rape Republicans” over the Jamie Lee Jones rape case, in which the victim’s claims were dismissed and she was ordered to pay the attorneys’ costs of her former employer, an American military contractor.

Likewise, she noted that MSNBC had pushed the false allegation that a U.S. Census Bureau worker had been a victim of a right-wing attack, when in fact he had committed suicide in apparent insurance fraud scheme.

In her remarks, conducted in an interview format, Coulter fielded questions about her new book, Never Trust a Liberal Over 3–Especially a Republican. She criticized New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for his support for immigration reform (“amnesty”) and for playing into sudden enthusiasm in the mainstream media for his political prospects.

She also had a few choice words for those who she said were not true Tea Partiers–evidently including Liz Cheney in that category for challenging Republican Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming: “If only she’d moved to South Carolina to run against Lindsey Graham.”

Coulter described the Senate Conservatives Fund as a “fake group”: “On their ‘About’ page, they won’t tell me who runs it–George Soros, George Soros, George Soros.” Her message was that Republicans had to unite to unseat Senate Democrats rather than following new, would-be leaders into internecine party strife.

“Look, unless they get a good candidate to run against Lindsey Graham, I don’t think they should primary him either, and he’s my favorite candidate to primary.” She criticized the nomination of Christine O’Donnell in 2010, saying that the Delaware seat in the U.S. Senate she contested was now lost to the GOP “forever.”

She joked that Republicans needed to do a better job of removing primary candidates who could not win a general election. “We need a Luca Brasi,” she said, referring to the assassin in The Godfather, offering herself as a volunteer.

In the question-and-answer session that followed, Coulter defended her support for the Iraq War–a “magnificent war,” she said, whose gains President Barack Obama had been “pissing away.” She noted that Iraq had been relatively stable during the Arab Spring, and that the case for war in 2003 remained strong, including suspected links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.

Asked about GOP strategy in 2014 and 2016, Coulter said: “Why do we keep using the same strategists? Because we don’t know their names.” She said that her book was the beginning of an effort to expose failed consultants who had misled candidates into believing they could win in places where they could not. “I think a lot of these Tea Party groups are George Soros fronts,” she warned. She lamented that Republicans had lost the Virginia gubernatorial race, saying that Ken Cuccinelli had suffered from a “fake libertarian” spoiler and was dragged down by “a black Christian minister [E.W. Jackson] who could not win a statewide election” because of his social views.

On a more encouraging note, she said that Democrats would struggle without Obama in the presidential race: “They have a suck-ass ‘B team.'”

At the close, a liberal student asked politely “what kind of world” Coulter was looking for, citing some of her more offensive Google quotes.

“My ideal world is a world without liberals,” she said, to laughter and applause."

I discussed the truth about the McDonald's Coffee Case last year. Click on that link and read about it and then come back, or take a look at it later.

Consider, if there were an onslaught of frivolous lawsuits crowding our dockets, wouldn't you expect judges to be aware of the problem and even active in demanding a solution to the problem? Who better to know what a case is really about and whether it is frivolous or notl?

In fact, there is a study that asked judges about this issue conducted by the Federal Judicial Center. Never heard of the Federal Judicial Center? Well, here is a description:

The Federal Judicial Center is the research and education agency of the federal judicial system. It was established by Congress in 1967 (28 U.S.C. §§ 620-629), on the recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The many specific statutory duties of the Center and its Board fall into a few broad categories: o conducting and promoting orientation and continuing education and training for federal judges, court employees, and others;

o developing recommendations about the operation and study of the federal courts;

o conducting and promoting research on federal judicial procedures, court operations, and history. By statute, the Chief Justice of the United States chairs the Center's Board, which also includes the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and seven judges elected by the Judicial Conference.

Hardly folks who could be called wild-eyed radicals.

In 2005, they issued a report on sanctionable behavior, and that includes the filing of frivolous lawsuits: Report of a Survey of United States District Judges' Experiences and Views Concerning Rule 11, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by David Rauma & Thomas E. Willging

The study - a survey of most of the federal judges - was performed, because many were claiming that frivolous lawsuits were common and that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure R. 11 needed to be beefed up. Rule 11 provides for sanctions for litigants, lawyers, and lawfirms who file suits where they have not done reasonable investigation into the facts and law and where there is not factual and legal support for their filings. Or as the study describes Rule 11.

As currently written, Rule 11 expressly authorizes judges to impose sanctions on lawyers and parties who present to a district court a pleading, written motion, or other paper without reasonable support in fact or law or for an improper purpose, such as to cause unnecessary cost or delay. Rule 11 provides that sanctions for violations are within the judge's discretion; that a party should have a period of time, a ""safe harbor,"" within which to withdraw or correct a filing alleged to violate Rule 11; and that Rule 11's primary purpose is to deter future violations and not necessarily to compensate the opposing party for losses, including attorney fees.

Here is the study abstract:

A report of the results of a survey completed by 278 of 400 (70%) federal district judges in the winter of 2004-05. The Center conducted the study at the request of the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on Civil Rules. A questionnaire elicited the judges' experiences and opinions about the merits of past and current versions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and about a legislative proposal to modify Rule 11. The judges expressed a strong preference for Rule 11 in its current form.

The study asked judges whether frivolous lawsuits were a problem. The overwhelming majority said no.

The views of judges who responded to the survey are likely to be related to their estimation of the amount of groundless civil litigation they see in their own docket, especially when focusing on cases where the plaintiff is represented by counsel. Approximately 85% of the district judges view groundless litigation in such cases as no more than a small problem and another 12% see such litigation as a moderate problem. About 3% view groundless litigation brought by plaintiffs who are represented by counsel as a large or very large problem. For 54% of the judges who responded, the amount of groundless litigation has remained relatively constant during their tenure on the federal bench. Only 7% indicated that the problem is now larger. For 19%, the amount of groundless civil litigation has decreased during their tenure on the federal bench, and for 12% there has never been a problem.

What is most interesting is that judges appointed more recently feel that way most strongly.

The overwhelming result was that Rule 11 sanctions should not be amended to be made harsher. Here are the more detailed results:

More than 80% of the 278 district judges indicated that ""Rule 11 is needed and it is just right as it now stands."" In evaluating the alternatives, 87% of the respondents preferred the current Rule 11, 5% preferred the version in effect between 1983 and 1993, and 4% preferred the version proposed in H.R. 4571. Judges' opinions about specific provisions in Rule 11 and the proposed legislation followed a similar pattern. The results indicated that relatively large majorities of the judges who responded to our survey have the following views about Rule 11: * 85% strongly or moderately support Rule 11's safe harbor provision; * 91% oppose the proposed requirement that sanctions be imposed for every Rule 11 violation; * 84% disagree with the proposition that an award of attorney fees should be mandatory for every Rule 11 violation.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide a link that gets you directly to the study. You can find it by going here and doing a search for sanctions."

Aides say Obama is showing solidarity with federal employees facing furloughs

The move%2C which adds up to a %2420%2C000 cut in pay%2C is retroactive to March 1

A few members of Congress have announced similar sacrifices

President Obama plans to take a 5% salary cut in support of federal workers who are going to be furloughed, officials said Wednesday.

The decision comes a day after a similar move by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Obama's move is retroactive to March 1, the first day the ongoing $85 billion in budget cuts known as the sequester began to take effect.

The president's base salary is $400,000 a year; 5% adds up to $20,000.

Because Congress sets the president's salary by law, his actual paycheck cannot be reduced; Obama will have to honor the voluntary pay cut by returning money to the Treasury.

Hagel and Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter have announced plans to give up part of their pay because about 700,000 civilian workers face mandatory furloughs this summer.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Deputy Secretary Maurice Jones will also forgo some of his salary, their office said.

Two administration officials discussed Obama's plans on the condition they not be named while discussing the president's personal finances.

Said one official: ""The salary for the president, as with members of Congress, is set by law and cannot be changed. However, the president has decided that to share in the sacrifice being made by public servants across the federal government that are affected by the sequester, he will contribute a portion of his salary back to the Treasury.""

A few members of Congress also have announced self-imposed pay cuts. Lawmakers' salaries are exempted from the sequester, so any reductions in pay are voluntary.

Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, who is up for re-election in 2014, said Wednesday that he will return a portion of his $174,000 salary to the Treasury. ""We need to be making responsible cuts wherever we can, and there is no reason that members of Congress shouldn't feel the pinch like everyone else,"" he said in a statement.

More than half of the senator's staff will take a pay cut this year, he said, and his office began furloughs in March.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., also said she will give up a portion of her salary.

The Senate approved an amendment last month authored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to establish a reserve fund to lessen the sequester's impact by allowing members of Congress to donate 20% of their salaries to it. However, it was a non-binding vote to the budget resolution and does not have the force of law.

Congress returns next week from the two-week spring recess. Begich said he intends to work with Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., to cut ""billions"" more in federal spending, and ""I hope my colleagues come back from the holidays ready to get to work.""



Prior to adjourning for the spring recess, the GOP-controlled House approved reduced funding levels for the chamber's 21 committees, but not for lawmakers. The approximate 11% reduction in spending from 2012 is mandated under the sequester.

House Administration Committee Chairman Candice Miller, R-Mich., said the cuts were necessary and ""will undoubtedly challenge each committee to do more with less."""

USA TODAY

The Missouri State Fair has banned a rodeo clown who this past weekend donned a President Obama mask, and asked a crowd if they wanted to see ""Obama run down by a bull.""

Officials said the clown will never perform at the fair again, the Associated Press reported.

Organizers are also reviewing whether to take any actions against the contractor responsible for Saturday's rodeo.

There has been bipartisan criticism of the gag.

Missouri Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a Republican, tweeted that the clown act was ""disrespectful"" to Obama, and ""we are better than this.""

A spokesman for Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, said the governor ""agrees that the performance was disrespectful and offensive, and does not reflect the values of Missourians or the State Fair.""

State Fair officials called the performance ""inappropriate,"" and added in a statement: ""We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday's rodeo badly missed that mark.""

Also from the Associated Press:

""Perry Beam, who was among the spectators, said 'everybody screamed' and 'just went wild' as the announcer talked about having the bull run down the clown with the Obama mask.

""'It was at that point I began to feel a sense of fear. It was that level of enthusiasm,' Beam, a 48-year-old musician from Higginsville, said Sunday, referring to the reaction from the crowd that filled the fair's grandstand.

""He said another clown ran up to the one wearing the Obama mask, pretended to tickle him and played with the lips on the mask. About 15 minutes into the performance, the masked clown had to leave after a bull got too close, Beam said.""

Beam also said:

""It was the usual until the very end at bull riding. As they were bringing the bulls into the chute and prepping them. ... They bring out what looks like a dummy. The announcer says 'Here's our Obama dummy, or our dummy of Obama.' They mentioned the president's name, I don't know, 100 times. It was sickening. It was feeling like some kind of Klan rally you'd see on TV."""

Vice President Thomas Jefferson challenged President John Adams for the top spot in the vicious campaign of 1800. President Andrew Jackson mused sardonically about executing Vice President John C. Calhoun. In the modern era, Lyndon Johnson seethed at slights real and perceived during John Kennedy’s thousand days, then turned around and humiliated his own vice president, Hubert Humphrey. Even Dick Cheney and George W. Bush fell out by the end of their tumultuous terms. But perhaps the most intriguing — and dysfunctional — political marriage in history was the one between the subjects of Jeffrey Frank’s meticulously researched “Ike and Dick.”

Franklin Roosevelt’s vice president memorably said that being No. 2 was in effect not worth a bucket of warm spit. Dwight D. Eisenhower’s vice president may have considered that assessment overly generous after spending eight years under the heel of a war hero whose sunny smile hid the soul of a cold, calculating politician. Frank, a former editor at both The New Yorker and The Washington Post, examines how Ike’s cool nature and detached management style left Richard Nixon insecure and embittered through the remainder of his political career.

“Ike and Dick” is a highly engrossing political narrative that skillfully takes the reader through the twisted development of a strange relationship that would help shape America’s foreign and domestic agenda for much of the 20th century. The two men’s political paths first crossed in 1952 after Eisenhower’s advisers listed Nixon as a potential running mate. (When later asked to explain the pick, Eisenhower would say dismissively, “He was on the list.”) But once his choice was made, Ike found himself tied to a political brawler whose aggressiveness on the campaign trail embarrassed him even when he benefited from those rough-and-tumble tactics."

Gannett Washington Bureau

About %24500%2C000 in loose change was left at airport security checkpoints in fiscal 2012

Money would benefit USO and other groups supporting service members

Measure now heads to Senate

WASHINGTON — The jingle of loose change abandoned at airport checkpoints might soon be sweet music to America's military personnel.

The House passed a bill Tuesday that would require the Transportation Security Administration to give nonprofits such as the United Service Organization the approximately $500,000 in quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies collected every year at airport screening stations. The money would help finance airport programs that support service members as they trek from city to city.

The USO operates lounges in nearly 40 major airports that offer food and other amenities exclusively to military personnel.

""What may seem like a small amount of change left behind... actually amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars each year,"" said GOP Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, lead sponsor of the TSA Loose Change Act. The bill ""would ensure that thousands of coins, when bundled together, will be used in support of millions of our nation's warriors.""

Miller, who chairs the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, has introduced the bill for several years, but this is the first time it's made it to the House floor. In a rare show of bipartisan support, the bill passed by voice vote without dissent.

The measure now heads to the Senate.

TSA agents collected more than $531,000 in cash — almost all of it in coin form, and about 6 percent of it in foreign currency — that travelers left behind at airport checkpoints in fiscal 2012, according to the most recent data provided by the agency.

That's an increase over fiscal 2011 ($487,870) and 2010 ($409,086).

Miami International ($39,613), McCarran International serving Las Vegas ($26,900), and O'Hare International in Chicago ($22,116) collected the most change in fiscal 2012, TSA figures show.

But even at airports in smaller cities such as Pensacola, Fla., Des Moines, Iowa, and Reno, Nev., TSA agents emptied at least $1,000 from the plastic tubs passengers use prior to walking through metal detectors.

Travel experts say people abandon change for a number of reasons: They're in a rush, they can't be bothered to repocket a relatively small amount in coins, or they're heading to a foreign country where the change can't be used.

TSA officials say they make every reasonable effort to return abandoned change to its rightful owner.

Under current rules, the TSA gets to keep the money left behind. The agency says it uses the cash ""for the purpose of providing civil aviation security.""

According to the TSA, these 10 airports reported finding the most money left behind by travelers at airport checkpoints during fiscal 2012:

1) Miami International — $39,613

2) McCarran International (Las Vegas) — $26,900

3) O'Hare International (Chicago) — $22,116

4) Los Angeles International — $21,916

5) John F. Kennedy International — $21,201

6) Dallas/Fort Worth International — $20,190

7) San Francisco International — $19,874

8) Washington Dulles International — $16,537

9) Logan International (Boston) — $16,406

10) George Bush Intercontinental (Houston) — $16,082"

President Obama hit the links Saturday with comedian Larry David, the star of HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm, as his weeklong vacation in Martha's Vineyard comes to a close.

The president rounded out his foursome with former U.S. trade representative Ron Kirk and businessman Glenn Hutchins, a part owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team.

Obama has spent much of his vacation golfing, including a five-hour round to kick off his stay, in which David, designer Kenneth Cole, filmmaker Peter Farrelly and restaurateur Patrick Lyons made up the foursome in front of the president, the Boston Globe reports.

Obama and the Seinfeld co-creator also crossed paths on Wednesday, at a sunset cocktail party thrown in the president's honor by cable TV mogul Brian Roberts. David discussed his new movie, set in Martha's Vineyard, The New York Times reports. Attorney General Eric Holder, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett were also in attendance.

The president wraps up his vacation Sunday. He has made few public statements during his stay, although he did condemn the bloody street battles in Egypt.

The initiatives come amid a growing national awareness of sexual assault in the military. Critics, especially in Congress, have questioned how the armed services handle these cases. Under one legislative proposal, sexual assault cases would be handled by an independent military legal authority, removing commanders from overseeing sexual assault cases within their units.

One new rule under consideration by Mr. Hagel would expand the role that victims have throughout the court-martial process, including the sentencing phase. In a handful of cases that have been the focus of sharp Congressional rebuke, senior commanders have overturned convictions of their subordinates in sexual assault cases.

Another rule would require that all reports of sexual assault filed by service personnel who choose to seek legal remedies be immediately brought to the attention of the first general or admiral in the chain of command of that organization. This, officials said, would guarantee accelerated senior-level supervision and rapid corrective action."

Pages 43 and 44 of the bill detail what one conservative blogger, Javier Manjarres of Shark Tank, has already described as the “ObamaPhone” from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). That section reads:

SEC. 1107. ACCESS TO EMERGENCY PERSONNEL.

(a) SOUTHWEST BORDER REGION EMERGENCY COM- MUNICATIONS GRANTS.–

(1) IN GENERAL.–The Secretary, in consultation with the governors of the States in the South- west Border region, shall establish a 2-year grant program, to be administered by the Secretary, to im- prove emergency communications in the Southwest Border region.

(2) ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS.–An individual is eligible to receive a grant under this subsection if the individual demonstrates that he or she–

(A) regularly resides or works in the Southwest Border region; (B) is at greater risk of border violence due to the lack of cellular service at his or her residence or business and his or her proximity to the Southern border. (3) USE OF GRANTS.–Grants awarded under

this subsection may be used to purchase satellite telephone communications systems and service that–

(A) can provide access to 9-1-1 service;

and

(B) are equipped with global positioning systems.

(4) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.– There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the grant program established under this subsection.

Manjarres first found the immigration bill’s free cell phone goodies and dubbed the handout the “MarcoPhone.”

“Move over ‘Obama phone,’ we present the new ‘Hola, Como Estas?!’ MarcoPhone,” Manjarres wrote on Wednesday morning.

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant did not return a request for comment from Breitbart News.

Interestingly, TracFone, a company that will likely benefit from this type of government program, is based in Rubio’s Miami, Florida.

This was not the politician who campaigned in 2008 on themes of transcending the divisive politics of the past, though there were ritual calls for the country and its political leaders to seize this moment together. Instead, it was a president who has accepted the reality of those divisions and is determined to prevail on his terms.

Obama’s first campaign was aspirational, and he came to office believing, or at least hoping, that through force of personality he could gently guide the opposing sides to consensus on issues that had long resisted resolution. Monday’s speech conveyed the ambitions of a president looking at his next four years with a sense of frustration and impatience, and who now believes that a different style of leadership is required.

In his speech, Obama set out his priorities for a second term, goals that will cheer the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and probably alarm many on the right. He challenged Republicans to meet him partway, though not exactly in the middle. If there was an underlying message Monday, it was not “Come, let us reason together.” It was “Follow me.” The question is whether he will be any more successful in his second term than he was in his first.

Pressure on Republicans

There are reasons for the president setting a different tone in his second inaugural than in his first. Two years after he and his party took a beating in the midterm elections, he now holds the strongest hand in Washington. His approval ratings have climbed above 50 percent, while his Republican opponents in Congress remain mired in disapproval ratings almost three times as high as their approval ratings.

Williamson/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Obama once hoped that he could overcome the united opposition of congressional Republicans, whose militant House members set the party’s tone during the battles of the past two years, through negotiation with GOP leaders. Now he is looking to the country to pressure his opponents to compromise in ways that they would not during his first term.

Republicans have already tested the reelected president and discovered the limits of their power. Their decision not to pick a fight — for now — over the debt ceiling signaled their recognition of that reality. It was an acknowledgment that the tactic of opposing Obama at almost every turn may be self-defeating.

Obama appears ready to try to split the Republican coalition by setting pragmatists against ideologues. On Monday, he rebuked those who have been most aggressive in their opposition when he said, “We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.”

Republicans will have to choose their battles more carefully, and they may prevail in some cases. Obama knows that he won’t get all he wants, but the balance of power at the start of his second term is far different from what it was 24 months ago.

The year ahead promises more debates over the size and scope of government, issues that dominated the past two years in Washington. Obama acknowledged the need to deal with spending and the deficit, but he also set out terms for the coming fight over federal entitlements.

During the campaign, Obama talked about the philosophical divide between Republicans and Democrats on these issues, as he condemned the broken politics of Washington. He said the American people could break the tie with the election.

But the election returned a majority of Republicans to the House, and on Monday the president seemed to suggest that there were grounds for compromise. “Progress,” he said, “does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time.”

Addressing his coalition

Obama’s second inaugural address also reflected a changing America and the coalition that reelected him to office. The nation’s first African American president leads an ever-more diverse population and a country in which attitudes and mores continue to change, particularly among the youngest segment of society.

The policy agenda he put forth, and the values he enunciated, spoke directly to that coalition. Never before has a president used an inaugural address to speak so openly about the cause of gay rights, linking the 1969 Stonewall uprising that led to the gay rights movement with Selma and civil rights and the 1839 Seneca Falls Convention and women’s rights.

Not all Americans agree with these changes, and as president, Obama must attempt to speak for them and to them. But his remarks Monday suggest that he believes history is on his side on these issues.

The president’s second inaugural address was notable also for what he talked about only in brief. Four years ago, he stood on the Capitol’s West Front with the country facing an economic crisis. Output was falling, the stock market had plunged, many Americans were threatened with housing foreclosures, and unemployment was rising rapidly. He talked about “a sapping of confidence across our land.”

On Monday, he touched only lightly on that crisis and spoke of the economy in positive terms. “An economic recovery has begun,” he said. At a time when jobs remain a top priority for most Americans, he chose neither to highlight that problem nor to offer any new solutions — though, ultimately, he will be judged on his effectiveness in restoring the economy to its full strength.

Opponents will find much to dislike about what Obama said Monday, for this was not a speech aimed at mollifying those who lost the election. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who lost the presidential race four years ago, expressed disappointment that Obama was not more explicit about bringing the two sides together. “I would have liked to have seen more on outreach and working together,” McCain said. But the senator added, “It’s his privilege to say what he wants.”

Obama risks overreaching or over-interpreting his mandate, which can be an affliction of newly reelected presidents. His victory in November was decisive but not overwhelming. Self-confidence can slip over the line to arrogance or hubris. Second terms often disappoint. So there are dangers ahead for the president.

On Monday, he set out his ambitions for a second term in clear language. What follows will define how history judges both those priorities and his ability to turn them into action."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) offered some harsh words for his Republican colleagues not actively trying to gut the Affordable Care Act.

He explained that some Republicans are taking a more passive approach to opposing the health care law-- hoping it doesn't work and then using the failures for political gain.

""I consider that the Bad Samaritan theory,"" he said. ""Basically inflict a bunch of harm on the American people and hope we benefit politically from it. What a terrible, cynical approach. I'm not interested in seeing the American people suffer just because my party might benefit politically if they blame the Democrats for the foolish policies that have been imposed.""

His comments came from an interview with CNN's Dana Bush that aired on Sunday's episode of 'State Of The Union.'

Cruz said that, though his repeated attempts to defund Obamacare have been futile, he will continue to oppose the law.

On ABC's 'This Week', he told host Jon Karl that he ""would do anything, and I will continue to do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare.""

Last year, researchers at Stanford and Harvard reported that the vast majority of high-achieving, low-income students do not apply to any selective colleges.

“Kids who’ve never heard of most elite institutions, who don’t know anyone who’s gone to one, who assume they can’t afford one, aren’t going to apply unless you go out and recruit them,” said Anthony W. Marx, president of Amherst from 2003 to 2011.

Most of the top private colleges rely on nonprofit groups like Questbridge and the Posse Foundation to help them find promising disadvantaged students. However, some recruit heavily that way while others only take one or two students per year. And some elite institutions, like Washington University, do not work with such groups.

For colleges that have the resources, another factor is how willing they are to spend the money to hunt for those applicants, and the much larger amount needed to help lower-income students go to a $60,000-a-year college. In addition, poor students face bigger challenges to remain enrolled and colleges often spend money on support services for them.

Among the 50 most selective private colleges, as measured by test scores and the percentage of applicants admitted, about four-fifths have need-blind admissions, meaning that they pledge to judge applicants without considering their ability to pay. Most of the colleges that do consider financial need to varying degrees, including Colby College and Washington and Lee, have lower Pell enrollments than most of their peers.

At a forum last fall, Mark S. Wrighton, the chancellor of Washington University, said of need-blind admission, according to the student newspaper, “It’s not our highest priority” — a comment that Mr. Berg said was taken out of context."

“A bipartisan group of senators plans to introduce its long-awaited immigration bill on Tuesday, Senate sources confirmed to ABC News,” Jim Avila and Jordan Fabian wrote on Friday. “Four Democrats and four Republicans, known as the ‘Gang of Eight,’ wrapped up months of hard-fought negotiations this week and will put forth a bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.”

If the Senators actually do wait until Tuesday to roll out their lengthy proposed overhaul of the U.S. immigration system, that will give members of the Senate Judiciary Committee less than a full day to read it before the only Senate hearing on the topic. Despite ardent pleas from Senate conservatives, including ranking Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee’s chairman, Sen. Pat Leahy, has only agreed to one hearing on the legislation.

Leahy scheduled that single hearing for Wednesday at 2:30 PM, and the hearing’s sole scheduled witness is Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. Napolitano would have less than a full day to read the bill she is scheduled to testify about.

“Gang of Eight” member Marco Rubio (R-FL) has said he supports multiple hearings and an open and transparent immigration reform process, but his actions do not necessarily back his words. He has not pushed Leahy to force multiple hearings; he appears content with the single hearing Leahy has scheduled on the issue and now appears to be backing down from his demand for multiple hearings.

In a Friday morning report, Politico’s Manu Raju notes that after Rubio was “rebuffed” in his request for multiple hearings, “the senator wants to launch his own public hearing process of sorts to allow Republican senators to question expert witnesses about the plan, a move aimed at alleviating conservative fears that the plan will be jammed through Congress with little public airing.”

Rubio is clearly worried about the perception that this bill will be rushed through, just like Obamacare was a few years ago. On Saturday morning, Rubio’s office issued a press release containing a single quote from Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace:

The one thing that’s clear is that this isn’t going to be health care reform. It’s not going to be rushed through. It’s going to go through the committee process. There’s going to be hearings. There will be lots of amendments. And I think the only way to get buy in from some of those other 92 senators is going to be regular order, that is a very gradual slow way.

Despite Wallace’s claim, there is only one hearing that is scheduled to happen. At the same time, there are multiple reports that keep surfacing indicating that the Gang of Eight will band together to block amendments to their bill."

He was 76.

Gardner died Friday at his Tacoma home, said family spokesman Ron Dotzauer.

The millionaire heir to the Weyerhaeuser timber fortune served as the state’s 19th governor from 1985 to 1993 following terms as Pierce County executive, state senator and business school dean.

Since then, he had worked as a U.S. trade ambassador in Geneva, in youth sports and for a variety of philanthropic works. But his biggest political effort in later years was his successful “Death with Dignity” campaign in 2008 that led to the passage of the controversial law that mirrored one in place in Oregon since 1997.

Washington state had rejected a similar assisted-suicide initiative in 1991. But after a contentious campaign, in which Gardner contributed $470,000 of his own money toward the $4.9 million raised to support the measure, nearly 58% of voters approved the new law.

The law allows terminally ill adults with six months or less left to live to request a legal dose of medication from their doctors.

Gardner knew that he wouldn’t qualify to use the law because his Parkinson’s disease was incurable, not fatal. But his worsening condition made him a right-to-die advocate.

“There’s more people who would like to have control over their final days than those who don’t,” Gardner told the Associated Press at the time.

Since the Washington law took effect in March 2009, more than 250 people have used it to obtain lethal doses of medication.

A 2009 documentary about his crusade, “The Last Campaign of Governor Booth Gardner,” was nominated for an Academy Award.

As governor, Gardner pushed for standards-based education reform, issued an executive order banning discrimination against gay and lesbian state workers, banned smoking in state workplaces and appointed the first minority to the state Supreme Court. He also oversaw the 1987 launch of the state’s Basic Health Care program for the poor.

William Booth Gardner was born Aug. 21, 1936, in Tacoma to a socialite mother, Evelyn Booth, and Bresson “Brick” Gardner. His father was an alcoholic who was cruel to his son, according to Booth Gardner’s biographer.

After his parents divorced when he was 4, his mother married Norton Clapp, a wealthy former president of Weyerhaeuser who helped build the Space Needle for the 1962 World’s Fair.

FOR THE RECORD:

An earlier version of this article incorrectly gave Norton Clapp’s first name as Morton.



Early in life, Gardner endured tragedy. His mother and 13-year-old sister were killed in a plane crash in 1951, an event he later said “had a greater effect on me than anything else in my life.” It also left him with an inheritance that made him a millionaire.

In 1966 his father fell to his death from a ninth-floor Honolulu hotel room balcony.

Clapp remained a presence in Gardner’s life, and though he was a Republican, made significant donations to Gardner’s gubernatorial runs.

Gardner earned bachelor’s and law degrees from the University of Washington and a master’s in business administration from Harvard University.

While abroad in 1995 he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. In 2000, he launched the Booth Gardner Parkinson’s Care Center, a clinic in Kirkland, Wash.

Twice divorced, Gardner is survived by two children from his first marriage, his son Doug and daughter, Gail; and grandchildren.

General is the commanding officer at Fort Jackson%2C S.C.

Female general from Missouri will serve in the interim

Pentagon has been rocked by sexual assault%2C harassment cases

WASHINGTON — The Army announced Tuesday that it has suspended the top general at Fort Jackson in South Carolina over allegations of assault and adultery, the latest in a string of sex scandals to rock the military.

It was not clear whom Brig. Gen. Bryan Roberts struck or with whom he was involved. Fort Jackson conducts basic training for 60% of the Army's incoming women recruits.

This is not a case of sexual assault or harassment among soldiers, according to Army spokesman George Wright.

According to his Army biography, Roberts is a 29-year veteran. Before assuming command in April 2012, he served in Iraq as head of a unit training Iraqi soldiers. Adultery is a crime under military law.

While the investigation is ongoing, Brig. Gen. Peggy C. Combs, Commandant of the U.S. Army Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear School, Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., will serve as the interim commander until the investigation is complete and the issue resolved.

Adultery is punishable under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Army documents show, if three legal criteria are met. An Army member must have had sexual intercourse with someone and either the soldier or sexual partner had to be married to another person at the time. Finally, under the circumstances the conduct had to be determined to be counter to good order and discipline in the military or to bring discredit to the armed forces.

Earlier this month, an Air Force officer in charge of sexual-abuse prevention, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, was arrested near the Pentagon, accused of drunkenly groping a woman. His trial is slated for July. Two weeks ago, the Pentagon announced that incidents of sexual assault had jumped 35% from 2010 to 2012, hitting 26,000.

A soldier responsible for sexual assault prevention at Fort Hood in Texas, Sgt. 1st Class Gregory McQueen, is under investigation for sexual assault and running a prostitution ring, while Lt. Col. Darin Haas, who led Fort Campbell's sexual harassment prevention office, was removed from his job last week after threatening his ex-wife.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has said the sexual abuse crisis in the military threatens its ability to conduct its mission. He has ordered re-screening of sexual abuse prevention trainers and recruiters and directed an inspection of military facilities for degrading and offensive material.

President Obama said the problem of sexual harassment and assault poses a threat to national security."

Washington (CNN) – Amid all the chaos of the last-minute deal in Washington, there was an unusual moment on the House floor moments after the bill passed.

A House stenographer and well-known employee calmly took to a microphone and began screaming.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""Do not be deceived. God shall not be mocked. A House divided cannot stand,"" she said, according to a House GOP aide. After a few seconds, she was escorted out by the Sergeant-at-Arms, but an audio recording by Todd Zwillich of Public Radio International captured the rest of her rant.

""He will not be mocked, He will not be mocked, (don't touch me) He will not be mocked. The greatest deception here, is that this is not one nation under God. It never was. Had it been... it would not have been... No. it would not have been... the Constitution would not have been written by Free Masons... and go against God. You cannot serve two masters. You cannot serve two masters. Praise be to God, Lord Jesus Christ.""

House members and aides were surprised and unsettled by the scene.

""I don't know, she just snapped,"" said a GOP aide.

CNN's Dana Bash spoke with several staffers who knew the woman well.

""She’s a well-known person, she’s a perfectly nice person, a good colleague, somebody who’s respectable and dependable, and this is very surprising to everybody who works with her,"" Bash reported on air.

""The Sergeant in Arms didn’t try to stop her because she works there and that’s where she’s situated,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told Jake Tapper. ""And she actually went up behind the podium where the president speaks from. They thought she was going to hand something to the speaker, and then they realized.""

Officer Shennell S. Antrobus of Capitol Police told CNN she wasn’t arrested or charged and was transported to a local area hospital by DC Fire for further evaluation.

In terms of an ongoing investigation or further action about the stenographer, Antrobus said no such action will be taken.

""There is nothing more, from our end, that we are going to do,"" Antrobus said.

Story highlights Stephen Breyer, 74, fell off his bike near the Korean War Veterans Memorial He underwent ""reverse shoulder replacement"" surgery, the Supreme Court says Breyer is expected to be released from the hospital early next week

(CNN) —

Stephen Breyer is known as one of the most active and engaging justices on the Supreme Court.

He’s also been known to take a painful spill, every now and then.

One such fall – from the bicycle he was riding Friday afternoon near the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington – landed the associate justice in an ambulance, and eventually at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, the Supreme Court announced in a press release.

It is the third publicly known major bike crash for Breyer in the last two decades.

At the hospital, the 74-year-old was diagnosed with a proximal humerus fracture – the humerus being the upper bone of the arm. He underwent reverse shoulder replacement surgery on Saturday morning.

Unlike in a healthy shoulder, where the humerus ends in a ball shape and fits into the shoulder blade to form a shoulder, in reverse shoulder replacement surgery the anatomy is reversed. In other words, a new metal “ball” is attached to the shoulder blade, or scapula, and a plastic cup is put at the upper end of the humerus bone.

Patients typically leave the hospital after this procedure – first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003 – in two or three days, according to the American Academy of Ortophaedic Surgeons. The Supreme Court said Breyer is expected to head home early next week.

It’s not the first time that he’s tumbled off his bike and ended up in a hospital.

In 1993, he had a nasty accident when a car stuck him in Harvard Square while he was on his two-wheeler. He suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs.

Then, over Memorial Day weekend in 2011, Breyer broke his right collarbone after falling off his two-wheeler in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he has a second home.

He’s had bad luck in other ways as well.

An intruder armed with a machete robbed Breyer, two guests and his wife – renowned pediatric psychologist Dr. Joanna Breyer – while they were vacationing on the Caribbean island of Nevis in February 2012.

A longtime White House reporter said on Monday that the Obama administration has been more ""extreme"" about keeping the press away than any she's ever covered.

Ann Compton, the ABC journalist who has reported on every president since Gerald Ford, told Politico that the way the White House press corps was treated by the Obama administration was a ""disgrace.""

""The president's day-to-day policy development ... is almost totally opaque to the reporters trying to do a responsible job of covering it,"" she said. ""There are no readouts from big meetings he has with people from the outside, and many of them aren't even on his schedule. This is different from every president I covered. This White House goes to extreme lengths to keep the press away.""

The awkwardness between the Obama administration and the White House press is nothing new -- this past summer, for instance, reporters blanched at White House attempts to edit a press pool report. But the latest fracas -- over the lack of access to a golf game that Obama played with Tiger Woods on Sunday -- has brought the journalists' anger out into the open again. Obama eventually had a brief off the record conversation with reporters on Monday night but, judging by Compton's comments, journalists see a deeper issue.

Ed Henry, the White House correspondent for Fox News who is also president of the White House Correspondents' Association, made the rounds on Monday to defend the press corps' indignation at being kept from covering the game. He told HuffPost's Michael Calderone on Monday night that the protest was about having a ""minimal level"" of access to Obama, not about a desire to watch him play golf.

Two people who see a tempest in a teapot? Henry's Fox News colleagues Bill O'Reilly and Charles Krauthammer. The anchor and pundit dismissed Henry's objections during a conversation on Monday.

""It is a trivial issue,"" Krauthammer said. ""The guy wants to play golf. The guy deserves a couple of days off. He wants privacy. Big deal. This is -- this is the biggest non-media, non-story that the media have created since the Kardashian weddings.""

""The press being banned from covering his leisure activities, you don't care?"" O'Reilly asked.

""Absolutely not,"" Krauthammer said. ""You want to watch him shank and slice?""

""I'm kind of with you on this, I don't care,"" O'Reilly said.

At Friday night’s “Emerging Voices in Media” party, looking down on the White House from atop the Hay-Adams hotel, every attractive young pundit you’ve ever seen hold forth on cable-news mingled over champagne and canapés. Rodell Mollineau, a longtime aide to Sen. Harry Reid who just left the Hill for a new job as head of a Democratic mega-PAC, noted wryly that it was the first year in many that he hadn’t scored an invitation to the dinner.

“Not getting invited is a rite of passage,” said Terence Samuel, an editor at National Journal. Some years you’ve got the juice, other years you don’t.

The trend these days is to insist that your pre-WHCD party be For a Good Cause. At a Creative Coalition cocktail party at Dupont Circle’s Washington Club, a line of showbiz folks took the stage to denounce bullying. “Courage is totally cool – Mahatma Gandhi,” said David Arquette, wearing a purple velvet suit. At a late-night loud-music fete thrown by National Journal and the Atlantic in collaboration with Impact Film Fund, actors Maria Bello and Ian Somerhalder tried to holler some words about the BP oil spill over the din of the open-bar scene.

Miro Sorvino dropped her iPhone on our foot. John Waters walked in.... nope, it’s look-a-like Steve Buscemi. “Top Chef’s” Carla Hall towered over the crowd. CNN’s Dana Bash showed off her baby bump. Cate Edwards showed off her fiance, surgical resident Trevor Upham; they’re tying the knot in October. Hey, isn’t that blonde in the white beaded dress “Semi-Homemade” cookbook diva Sandra Lee? Sandra, what’s your connection to the White House Correspondent’s dinner? “Nice to meet you,” she said, tossing us an icy glare and walking away. (Nothing personal. She refused to be photographed with Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. Go figure.)

Just down the street at the MPAA, actual politicians (Sen. Pat Leahy, former Sen. John Breaux) mingled with new head Chris Dodd. “I’m trying to bring some life back to this association,” he told us. “This is a way for me to thank all the people in this business and promote what we do.”

“Saturday Night Live’s” Seth Meyers, tapped to entertain the crowd at Saturday’s dinner, was the guest of honor. Meyers said he was “nervous but excited” and said he’d been working hard to prepare jokes for his routine. “Thanks for inviting Donald Trump!” he said with a big grin when he found out we were from the Washington Post.

We followed the bread crumbs to the New Yorker’s rooftop party at the W Hotel, where we spotted Van Susteren and her husband for the third time. Van Susteren jetted in from covering the royal wedding in London in time for the DC follies. “I never get to go out nights,” she told us. “You never see me at parties.”

Twin DJ’s in pink chino suits, white glasses and iPads kept the club beat; they played a ‘Talking Heads” song when they saw David Byrne. Kind of amazing since the lights were so low it was hard to see much of anything. Ted Olson, Gene Sperling, Rashida Jones, Zach Galifianakis some guy from “Modern Family” and literally bumped into Jon Hamm, who thought it was deliberate. He was getting that a lot. Lara Logan, radiant in a black-and-white patterned dress, was making one of her first public appearances since her brutal assault in Cairo.

Hey, Sean Penn! We hear you were just at the White House, talking about Haiti. Get a good reception. “Everybody’s fighting the same machine,” he told us, “but we’re all in synch.” It sounded more profound the way he said it.

Why all the stars? Last year editor David Remnick tried to invite David Axelrod, only to find out he’s been booked since January. Thus the celebs. “I’m not against meeting people I wouldn’t normally meet,” said Remnick. “And I’m not against promoting the magazine. But it has become bizarro world.”"

Before his second NFL season began last September, Ryan Kerrigan came across a typed, one-page piece of fan mail. The first paragraph grabbed him:

My name is Ryan D’Emidio. I am 16 years old with seven brothers and sisters. My Mom and I got into a car accident and I had to come three months early. I was critical for 21 / 2 years. The doctors said I would die several times, and if I did live, I would be a vegetable (I eat vegetables now!). I do have cerebral palsy and some learning difficulties. I have two belly buttons on my body. The little flower is where the feeding tube was for seven years.

The boy went on to tell Kerrigan how he was hired as the team manager of the Woodbridge High School football team, how he played a blind child in a school play called “The Miracle Worker.”

I love the way you sack and take it all the way. . . . I make people happy and laugh and I have a dream to meet you. . . . Please write back to me.

The big, strong 6-foot-4, 260-pound linebacker, about to embark on his first Pro Bowl season with Washington, held the letter and thought about the difference between the courage shown on an NFL field and the courage shown in life.

“As a player, you’re always getting things sent to you, tons of mail,” Kerrigan said. “I always try to be nice, but I just can’t write everybody back. But I saw his letter. It . . . it did something to me.”

Kerrigan found a pen, a piece of paper and started writing in neat cursive, putting the letter in the mailbox two days before last season’s opener:

Dear Ryan,

Thanks for your kind letter! I am terribly sorry to hear about your car accident + your condition. But I am inspired by your upbeat personality! Keep that attitude and you can do whatever you dream! Thanks for being a Redskins fan + for your support. God Bless!

Ryan Kerrigan #91

This is a story about two people named Ryan who inspired each other, and it would end here except Ryan D’Emidio is more relentless than any locked-in Pro Bowl linebacker at the snap count.

See, Kerrigan’s note gave the kid an opening, a gap to shoot. He wrote Kerrigan back, working it, appealing to his ego, “Sack Tony Romo!” He thanked him for the handwritten letter in another note, soberly adding, “I would hand write but my hands don’t work so well and I was afraid you would not be able to read it!”

When I asked Kerrigan two months ago whether he would be up for meeting his fan Ryan, he didn’t hesitate. “That kid? He’s amazing. Sure. I’d be honored. His story was so uplifting.”

Ten days before Christmas on a cold, rainy night in Woodbridge in 1995, Susan D’Emidio got in her car and headed out for some last-minute holiday shopping. “I was being silly, I know, but with seven kids I just thought I had forgot something,” she said. By the time she turned onto busy Minnieville Road, the rain had turned to black ice. An out-of-control car hurdled the barrier and came into her lane. Hers was the first vehicle involved in a 15-car pileup.

At 28 weeks pregnant with Ryan, she was deemed healthy enough to return home. But within a week, her body went into toxic shock and her baby was suddenly in grave danger.

“Basically the doctor said the baby was killing her and she was killing the baby and it would have to come out early,” said John D’Emidio, Ryan’s father. She had an emergency cesarean section to save her child.

Ryan was born a mere 1 pound 12 ounces, three months ahead of schedule. He lived most of the first year of his life in an incubator. He had multiple surgeries and was fed through his nostrils. Every time Ryan was taken home those first few months, doctors told the family he had to come back to the hospital because his lungs weren’t strong enough to be unhooked from a respirator.

“He died several times in the first two years of his life, and they brought him back,” Susan said.

Ryan kept fighting. And growing. And always embracing the good instead of cursing the havoc an awful disorder had wreaked on his life.

“I am home from surgery,” he wrote on his Facebook page Tuesday night after he had filler inserted in both legs to keep his knee and his femur from rubbing together, his second of four planned surgeries this year alone. He has to have Botox routinely injected into his hips, thighs and lower back to loosen the areas.

Cerebral palsy is not a progressive disorder, and people afflicted often have a normal life expectancy. But the constant tightening of his muscles — contracture — is one of the recurring symptoms that disrupt Ryan’s life.

The Ryan-meets-Ryan spot was designated as Reston Town Center after Kerrigan had biked 20 miles in former teammate Lorenzo Alexander’s annual charity bike ride.

D’Emidio could barely contain his excitement, almost skipping toward the player he had first written over a year ago.

“Hi, I’m Ryan,” Kerrigan said.

“I’m Ryan,” D’Emidio shot back, laughing and wearing Kerrigan’s No. 91 jersey. “How are you?”

“I’m doing well.”

Instinctively, D’Emidio went in for a hug. Kerrigan wrapped him up, snugger than Eli Manning.

“I appreciate that,” the player said as the two shared a few minutes.

D’Emidio walked away for a few minutes and returned with a 70-page, self-published book he had written, titled “My Life — Ryan D’Emidio.”

“Read this book to your family,” he said, handing it to Kerrigan. “It’ll make you cry.”

“I don’t want to cry,” Kerrigan said.

Not to worry, he was told, it’s a good cry: the story of a baby who almost didn’t make it, who survived a 15-car pileup in his mother’s womb, an incubator, thousands of tubes and needles thrust into his body and, as a young boy, bullying in school. Oh, and the awkwardness of adolescence. He beat all of them, answering fear with faith.

One Sunday night recently, John picked up the phone and saw the word “ESPN” on the caller ID. Neil Everett, the “SportsCenter” anchor, was on the line. “He said Ryan had sent him a letter, and he was so touched he had to call,” John said.

Ryan has gumption and then some. He occasionally crosses boundaries — “Can I have your cellphone number?” or “Can you go to my birthday?” or “Can you get me an announcing job at Fox or ESPN?” — but he’s pretty much been a mover and shaker since becoming a memoiristat 15 for The Washington Post magazine.

Susan handed me a folder that contained letters of correspondence between Kerrigan and her son and a letter Ryan sent to the NFL during the lockout, urging the league to play. The folder also contains numerous letters to people Ryan has found inspirational, like Tim McGraw, Joel Osteen and Alfred Morris.

He thinks they’re inspiring him “when it’s actually the other way around,” Kerrigan said. “He makes me feel I can do anything.”

The same goes for his mother, who recently underwent the same kind of chemotherapy given to breast-cancer patients in order to treat a hyperactive thyroid condition connected to rheumatoid arthritis. “He’s my inspiration,” Susan said. “If it wasn’t for Ryan and his hurting, I don’t think I could endure mine.”

Six months ago, Susan read some of her son’s writing relating to his several brushes with death as an infant. She came across something she had never read before: “He wrote that when he went to go see God, God told him he couldn’t stay and had to come back and he had to go make people happy and he was going to have a wonderful life.”

Ryan D’Emidio’s mother covers her mouth for a moment.

“It gave me shivers,” she finally said. “I said, ‘Ryan, you never told me about that.’ He had that little secret in him for a long time.”

Obama’s election was a symbol of reconciliation in America’s longest, bloodiest conflict — the one that produced Antietam. It was followed by a partisan lunge to fulfill the dreams of the Great Society by delivering universal health care. Which was followed by an ideological backlash that shifted control of the House, led by activists who talked as if the whole welfare state might be undone. Which was followed by Obama’s victorious reelection campaign, which turned the mobilization of partisans and ethnic groups into an exact science and reengaged the culture war on abortion.

The compression of these ideological mood swings into four years has left an impression of political instability, perhaps bipolarity. Both parties overreach. Their tone is often frantic and overheated. They focus mainly on energizing the faithful rather than persuading the undecided.

Such polarization has deep roots. Parties, communities and regions have sorted themselves by ideology, producing citizens who operate in separate partisan worlds. Partisan media outlets succeed through the reinforcement and exaggeration of grievances. Most House members represent safe districts in which their greatest political fear is offending those who vote in primaries.

What can a presidential inaugural address do to oppose these centrifugal forces? Probably not much. Maybe admit some mutual fault and call for a new beginning. Maybe direct attention to unifying national values beyond current controversies. Maybe just assert the moral duties of kindness and civility we owe each other in a democracy.

1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.

This year, however, the influence of such a speech remains untested because it was not attempted. President Obama set an unobjectionable goal: “a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American.” He asserted that this objective can only be achieved “together, as one nation, and one people.” But he proceeded to define an agenda, in some detail, that could have been taken from any campaign speech of the 2012 election. It involves the building of roads and research labs, promoting clean-energy technology, protecting entitlements from significant change, passing equal-pay legislation and immigration reform.

Those who oppose this agenda, in Obama’s view, are not a very admirable lot. They evidently don’t want our wives, mothers and daughters to “earn a living equal to their efforts.” They would cause some citizens “to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.” They mistake “absolutism for principle” and “substitute spectacle for politics” and “treat name-calling as reasoned debate.” They would have people’s “twilight years . . . spent in poverty” and ensure that the parents of disabled children have “nowhere to turn.” They would reserve freedom “for the lucky” and believe that Medicare and Social Security “sap our initiative,” and they see this as “a nation of takers.” They “deny the overwhelming judgment of science” on climate change, don’t want love to be “equal” and apparently contemplate “perpetual war.”

For Abraham Lincoln, even the gravest national crimes involved shared fault. For Obama, even the most commonplace policy disagreements indicate the bad faith of his opponents. In his first inaugural address, George Washington described the “sacred fire of liberty.” In his second, Obama constructed a raging bonfire of straw men.

This will, no doubt, please the president’s strongest supporters, who are grateful that he has given up the pious balderdash of bipartisanship. They welcome his sharper political edge. They describe him as “wiser,” “wary” and more realistic about the unchangeable obstructionism of his opponents.

It is not the first time a president has been indicted by the praise of his courtiers. Obama arrived with limited experience on the national stage — only to find himself in the fight from the last act of Hamlet. He seemed surprised that Washington could not be changed by the force of his personality. He has become a sobered and hardened figure. A former public official who often interacted with Obama put it this way to me: “Obama disdains politicians and the art of politics, but he is highly competitive and wants to beat them at their own game.”

This is not a problem if the president is merely one participant among many in a series of zero-sum political battles. But this approach has serious drawbacks if a president is called to play a leadership role in reforms that require both parties to trust each other and take simultaneous risks. On the evidence of his second inaugural, Obama has moved beyond such idealism."

The state is immune to lawsuits unless they're allowed by state Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr., who approved the state's motion to dismiss Charla Nash's claim.

Nash was blinded, lost both hands and underwent a face transplant after being mauled in Stamford in 2009. She reached a $4 million settlement last year with the estate of chimp owner Sandra Herold, who died in 2010.

Her lawyer said the state should be held responsible for not seizing the animal before the attack, because it was warned the animal was dangerous. State Attorney General George Jepsen said the state shouldn't be held liable for the mauling.

Vance said in his decision that at the time of the attack, state law did not prohibit the private ownership of chimpanzees and did not require the state to seize an animal that was privately owned and not banned by the state. Vance noted that the state banned the ownership of chimpanzees after the attack.

More On This... $4M settlement in lawsuit over Connecticut chimp attack that blinded woman

""The State of Connecticut, were it a private person, would generally not have any duty to control the conduct of (a) third party absent some special relationship,"" Vance wrote.

Nash, 59, had gone to Herold's home on the day of the attack to help lure her friend's 200-pound chimpanzee, Travis, back inside. But the chimp went berserk and ripped off Nash's nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer. Nash now lives in a nursing home outside Boston.

Travis had starred in TV commercials for Old Navy and Coca-Cola when he was younger and made an appearance on ""The Maury Povich Show."" The chimpanzee was the constant companion of the widowed Herold and was fed steak, lobster and ice cream. The chimp could eat at the table, drink wine from a stemmed glass, use the toilet, and bathe and dress itself.

Travis had previously bitten another woman's hand and tried to drag her into a car in 1996, bit a man's thumb two years later and roamed downtown Stamford for hours in 2003 before being captured after escaping from Herold's home, according to Nash's lawsuit against Herold.

The $4 million settlement covers a small fraction of Nash's medical costs, according to her lawyers, who have said she requires care and supervision around the clock. She is facing another surgery for hand transplants and will need to be on antibiotics for the rest of her life.

Nash holds the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection responsible for not seizing the animal before the attack despite a state biologist's warning it was dangerous.

""I hope and pray that the commissioner will give me my day in court,"" Nash told reporters following a hearing last year before Vance. ""And I also pray that I hope this never happens to anyone else again. It is not nice.""

State Attorney General George Jepsen has said the state should not be held liable for the mauling. He has acknowledged that a state biologist had warned that the chimp was ""an accident waiting to happen"" before the attack. But Jepsen said state law on the issue was ambiguous and difficult to enforce, and there was no guarantee a court hearing would have led to a seizure order."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama--obamacare-critics-are--desperate--fat-cat-fox-news-watchers-224720869.html,,[],Obama: Obamacare critics are 'desperate' fat-cat Fox News watchers,"President Barack Obama went nuclear this week in his attacks on Republicans trying to derail the Affordable Care Act, painting the controversial law’s opponents as fat cats who watch too much Fox News. Or freeloaders. Or the Koch Brothers. Or folks who think the Fugitive Slave Act and Obamacare are equally terrible.

That’s a slight exaggeration. Slight.

And always-pugnacious senior Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer took to CNN to compare Republicans to terrorists. And kidnappers. And arsonists.

Here’s Pfeiffer on CNN’s The Lead :

“It is not a negotiation if I show up at your house and say give me everything inside or I'm going to burn it down.”

And

“The Republicans have provided a laundry list of essentially ransom demands.”

And

“What we're not for is negotiating with people with a bomb strapped to their chest.”

That’s some take-no-prisoners stuff, only days before Americans can sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and the government might shut down if congressional Republicans and the White House can’t agree on a spending plan for fiscal 2014 by Tuesday.

The strategy is not without risks, like alienating good-faith skeptics about the law. But Democrats say it serves multiple purposes. It rallies the troops ahead of the 2014 elections (midterm elections are generally thought of as decided by the parties’ core or “base” supporters). It also turns signing up for Obamacare into a blow against some of liberals' favorite targets. And it aims to transform the discussion about Obamacare from a philosophical dispute about the government’s role in health care into a fight over benefits. If that sounds almost like an effort to turn Obamacare from a battleground into a popular entitlement, well, here’s another part of Obama’s message on Thursday at Prince George’s Community College just outside Washington:

“Medicare and Social Security faced the same kind of criticism. Before Medicare came into law, one Republican warned that ‘one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it once was like in America when men were free,” Obama said. “That was Ronald Reagan. And eventually, Ronald Reagan came around to Medicare and thought it was pretty good, and actually helped make it better.”

Story continues

On the possible government shutdown, it’s even simpler: Democrats say they're sure that the public will blame Republicans.

When it comes to Obamacare, the president said Thursday, “There are parts of the bill that some folks don't like. “

What kinds of folks? Here’s how Obama broke it down:

The rich

“To help pay for the program, the wealthiest Americans, families that make more than $250,000 a year, will have to pay a little bit more. Extremely costly health insurance plans will no longer qualify for unlimited tax breaks.”

Freeloaders

“When uninsured people who can afford to get health insurance don't, and then they get sick or they get hit by a car and they show up at the emergency room, who do you think pays for that? You do, in the form of higher premiums because the hospitals, they got to get their money back somehow. So if they're treating somebody who doesn't have health insurance, they jack up premiums for everybody who does have health insurance. It's like a hidden tax of a thousand dollars per family every year whose got health insurance. So we're saying, well, that's not fair. If you can afford to get health insurance, don't dump the costs on us.""

Fox News watchers

“We need you to spread the word. But you don't have to take my word for it. If you've talked to somebody who said, well, I don't know, I was watching Fox News, and they said this was horrible [the transcript records “laughter, boos”] and you can say, ‘you know what? Don't take my word for it. Go on the website. See for yourself what the prices are. See for yourself what the choices are. Then make up your own mind. Just make — that's all I'm asking. Make up your own mind.’”

The Koch Brothers (though he did not name them)

“Some of the tea party's biggest donors, some of the wealthiest men in America, are funding a cynical ad campaign trying to convince young people not to buy health care at all. I mean, think about it. These are billionaires several times over. You know they've got good health care.”

“But they are actually spending money, on television, trying to convince young people that if you've got the choice between getting affordable health care or going without health care, you should choose not having any health care. Now, do you think if you get sick or you get hurt and you get stuck with a massive bill, these same folks — they're going to help you out? Are they going to pay for your health care?”

GOP extremists

“One congressman said that 'Obamacare' is the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed. Ever in the history of America, this is the most dangerous piece of legislation. Providing, creating a marketplace so people can buy group insurance plans, the most dangerous ever.”

More extremists

“You had a state representative somewhere say that it's as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act. Think about that. Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets slave-owners get their runaway slaves back. I mean, these are quotes. I'm not making this stuff up.”

(He isn’t making this one up, anyway. Here’s Republican New Hampshire state representative Bill O’Brien on Aug. 1: “What is Obamacare? It is a law as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, that allowed slave-owners to come to New Hampshire and seize African-Americans and use the federal courts to take them back to ... slave states.”)

""The closer we get, the more desperate they get,"" Obama said. ""All this would be funny if it wasn’t so crazy.""



It might be tempting to view this ugly debate as the latest exhibit in the case against Obama's 2008 campaign promise to drain the fever swamps of nasty political rhetoric.



But here's the thing about presidential candidates who promise to ""change the tone"" in Washington:

If they mean it, they’re naïve. Republicans are hardly blameless in the escalation of Washington rhetoric since Obama took office. And even presidents can’t change their opponents’ tone, after all.

If they don’t mean it, oh, right, they’re politicians."

The new Interior Department proposal, which is subject to 30 days of public comment and further revision, disappointed environmental advocates, who had pushed for full disclosure of the chemicals used in the drilling process and tougher standards for groundwater protection and well integrity.

The new rule allows oil companies to keep some components of their drilling fluids secret and will allow them to run well integrity tests on one representative well rather than all wells in a field where the geology and well construction techniques are similar.

The proposed regulation, which revises one proposed a year ago, also allows drillers to comply with state regulations in places where federal officials deem them as tough or tougher than the applicable federal rules."

Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White's office announced Tuesday that it will begin accepting applications Dec. 3 on a limited basis. The expected high demand means applicants must schedule an appointment to visit one of four designated offices to complete the tests and paperwork.

Appointments may be scheduled by calling 855-236-1155 or visiting cyberdriveillinois.com. Walk-ins will not be served, officials said. In addition to English, services will provided in Spanish, Polish, Mandarin Chinese and Korean. An additional 21 offices will begin scheduling appointments in January.

The launch of the program comes almost a year after Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn signed a law creating the specialized license, officially known as the temporary visitor driver's license. Unlike standard driver's licenses, they cannot be used as a form of identification for purposes such as boarding a plane, voting or buying a gun.

Supporters say the change will make Illinois roads safer because immigrants will undergo driver's tests and be required to have insurance for the license to be valid.

Critics fear fraud and abuse, with some lawmakers saying immigrants living here illegally should be fingerprinted to qualify. Immigrant rights organizations fought back on that idea, arguing that it would deter participation among a population that often is distrustful of law enforcement and other government agencies.

To qualify, applicants must prove they have lived in Illinois for a least a year and show they are ineligible for a Social Security card. Documents that will be accepted include a copy of a lease, utility bills and a valid passport or consular identification card.

Drivers also must pass vision, written and road tests and pay a $30 fee. Licenses will not be issued on the spot, officials said, but only after the state can verify application information and perform a facial recognition search against other databases. That process could take 15 to 20 business days.

The licenses will be valid for three years, one less than standard licenses. After that, a person would have to reapply.

Officials estimate that they will be able to process about 100,000 applications a year, which would generate about $3 million annually to run the program. White said his office has spent about $1 million to get the program off the ground, including hiring translators. White said that will lead to ""sacrifices"" in other areas but contended the expense is worth it.

""Before the implementation of this law, individuals would have an automobile crash and they would leave the car and they would run,"" White said. ""Now they don't have to run because now they can stand and say to the officer, tell their story of how the accident occurred, show their driver's license, show their registration card.""

White said the information collected during the application process will not be shared with federal immigration officials but that some data may be given to police during the course of an investigation or if documents are subpoenaed.

For those who got a license using fraudulent information but want to apply under the new system, officials warn that the best course of action is for drivers to report themselves to the secretary of state's office. People who self-report wrongdoing would have their license suspended for one year but could regain driving privileges. If a driver does not come forward and fraud is detected, he or she will be denied a license under the program, officials said.

Program manger Lisa Grau said such cases will be handled internally by fraud investigators unless other criminal activity such as identify theft or credit card fraud is discovered, at which point the case would be forwarded to the proper law enforcement agency.

""This program is not meant to be a 'gotcha,'"" Grau said. ""We're doing this to try to improve road safety and give people the chance to go to work and to school.""

Meanwhile, officials are warning potential new drivers to be smart consumers when it comes to buying the required insurance. They acknowledged that immigrant drivers will likely face higher insurance premiums because of a lack of official driving history.

Marco Rubio played a crucial role in orchestrating passage of the bipartisan immigration overhaul in the Senate last month, but the Florida Republican and potential 2016 presidential contender has bowed out of the messy battle as it moves to the House.

Key senators behind the immigration bill admonished top business leaders in a session at the Capitol this week to put more pressure on reluctant House Republicans, but Rubio was notably absent. The bill’s supporters were counting on his voice as a Latino and tea party favorite to help sell the measure to conservatives.

At the same time, President Obama has adopted a lofty approach, speaking of the benefits of immigration but staying above the fray, aware that efforts to rouse public opinion would almost certainly chase away House Republicans who typically distance themselves from his initiatives.

Obama did a round of interviews with Spanish-language television anchors on Tuesday. He said nothing new, but his message to House Republicans, though not overt, was clear: Millions of Latino voters are watching.

The decisions by Rubio and Obama to step back leave the two highest-profile champions of changing the nation’s immigration laws in cameo roles for what is expected to be the toughest part of the fight.

Instead, the most influential advocates for comprehensive reform will probably be business and religious leaders who hold more sway over House Republicans than either the Florida senator or the president.

Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), who along with Rubio were among the chief architects of the Senate bill, told those leaders at the session that it was past time to launch a high-level campaign.

McCain delivered a “stern” message, according to one source in the room. And Schumer said, “You guys are working, but you need to ramp it up,” according to another source familiar with the meeting.

Rubio’s decision reflects a broader conflict among immigration advocates of how best to prod the House, where the GOP majority remains cool to the cornerstone of the legislation, the path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the nation illegally.

Schumer and McCain sought to build political momentum that would leave the House little choice but to act.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

Rubio appears to have decided to give House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) space to work with his often unruly majority. He has no plans to continue meeting with the other senators who wrote the bill with him.

“The House has an opportunity to improve on the Senate’s efforts and advance reform further, but they should be given the deference to decide the best way forward,” said Rubio spokesman Alex Conant.

Boehner engaged on the issue Wednesday by suggesting he would favor a path to citizenship limited to immigrants brought to the country as children.

“This is about basic fairness,” the Ohio Republican said. “You know, these children were brought here of no accord of their own, and frankly they’re in a very difficult position. And I think many of our members believe that this issue needs to be addressed.”

Democratic lawmakers and Obama are likely to resist that approach as insufficient.

Obama has called some House members, mostly Democrats, but he believes his most effective role is to keep the pressure on Republicans with a public campaign, administration officials said.

On Tuesday, the administration held a Spanish-language media day at the White House, hosting four anchors from Telemundo and Univision stations in Los Angeles, New York, Denver and Dallas. Obama did eight-minute interviews with each, welcoming them with a hearty “mucho gusto” — a customary Spanish greeting — and launched into an argument that a “pathway to citizenship” was an essential component of any immigration reform.

The president is expected to host more of these not overtly partisan events, traveling to communities where he can stand with a coalition of business, farm and faith leaders who support the immigration overhaul.

One congressional aide referred to it as using the pulpit, rather than the bully pulpit.

Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) was among those in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who met with Obama recently at the White House, where the president made his stand-to-the-side approach clear. “He said, ‘You all know the House better than I know the House. Let me know how I can be helpful. I’m ready to go,’” Becerra said of the president.

Many Democrats, including several top advisors to Obama, believe the party has nothing to lose no matter what happens. If House Republicans allow a bill with a pathway to citizenship to pass, the president fulfills a campaign promise. If not, Latino voters could be further alienated from the GOP.

But Obama’s top advisors say he does not want to keep the immigration debate alive simply to use it as a wedge issue. “The president says his metric for success is what he gets done,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior political advisor. “How do we make progress on our agenda? That’s the only thing that matters.”

House Republicans, however, may leave for the August recess without voting on any immigration bills.

At the Capitol meeting this week, the senators told those gathered that they needed to deliver a unified message to House members over the break. “The message was: Let’s band together and push for overall immigration reform in the House,” said Kristi Boswell, director of congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Blair Latoff Holmes, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman, said business leaders planned to meet with lawmakers to communicate “why this is important from an economic and business perspective.”

“Rest assured,” she said, “we will be engaged in the districts that matter to ensure the House takes up immigration reform.”

Story highlights NEW: Thomas covered White House with ""intensity and tenacity,"" Clintons say Thomas will be buried in Detroit She was a trailblazer on the White House press corps Her retirement in 2010 came amid controversy

(CNN) —

Trailblazing White House journalist Helen Thomas has died at age 92 after a long illness, sources told CNN Saturday.

Thomas covered 10 presidents over nearly half a century, and became a legend in the industry.

She was a fixture at White House news conferences – sitting front and center late in her career – where she frequently exasperated government spokesmen with her pointed questions.

Thomas began covering the White House for United Press International when John F. Kennedy became president in 1961 and was a fixture there until her retirement in 2010.

She was considered the dean of the White House press corps because she was the longest-serving White House journalist.

Thomas will be buried in Detroit, and a memorial service is planned in Washington in October, according to her family.

President Barack Obama said that it was “not just the length of her tenure, but her fierce belief that our democracy works best when we ask tough questions and hold our leaders to account,” that put her in high esteem.

In a written statement, Obama called Thomas a “true pioneer” and said she kept the presidents she covered – including himself – on their toes.

“Helen was just a living inspiration”

Her career, however, came to an end under a cloud of controversy.

Thomas, then working for the media conglomerate Hearst as a syndicated columnist, was blasted for comments she made regarding Jewish people.

In 2010, a YouTube video surfaced showing her saying that Israel should “get the hell out of Palestine,” and that the Jewish people should go home to “Poland, Germany … and America and everywhere else.”

Thomas apologized for her remarks, writing, “They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon.”

She announced her retirement one week later.

In 2012, Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi presented Thomas with an award.

She was a mentor to young journalists

Helen Thomas: Fast Facts

Thomas, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants, was born in Winchester, Kentucky, on August 4, 1920. She was one of nine children. Thomas was raised in Detroit, where she attended Wayne State University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 1942.

In October 1971, Thomas married Douglas Cornell; he died in 1982.

She wrote three books: “Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times” (1999); “Thanks for the Memories Mr. President: Wit and Wisdom from the Front Row at the White House” (2002); and “Watchdogs of Democracy? The Waning Washington Press Corps and How it Has Failed the Public” (2006).

Share your memories

In describing her job, Thomas once said, “I’ve never covered the president in any way other than that he is ultimately responsible.”

Along the way, she broke some barriers by becoming the first female president of the prestigious White House Correspondents’ Association and Washington’s Gridiron Club.

“I hope there are many women following me right in this same spot,” she said. Well into her 80s, she was a mentor to many young journalists.

Thomas left UPI in May 2000, when the wire service was sold to a company controlled by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the Korean founder and leader of the worldwide Unification Church.

Two months later, Hearst News Service hired her as a syndicated columnist, and she returned to the White House for fodder for her columns.

Former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, recalled Thomas’ “tough-minded dedication.”

“Helen was a pioneering journalist who, while adding more than her share of cracks to the glass ceiling, never failed to bring intensity and tenacity to her White House beat,” the Clintons said in a statement.

“… Her work was extraordinary because of her intelligence, her lively spirit and great sense of humor, and most importantly her commitment to the role of a strong press in a healthy democracy.”

No question seemed off-limits

Colleagues remember her as a genuinely fearless woman who asked the toughest questions of presidents, no matter their party.

In January 2009, as President George Bush was preparing to leave office, Thomas aimed her editorial guns at him and his administration.

Among her criticisms: that before the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, administration officials ignored “significant early warnings of an imminent strike against the U.S.”

Journalists remember Helen Thomas

In a commentary, she slammed Bush for what she considered his failings, including leading the country “into a senseless war against Iraq, a calamity still under way as he leaves office almost six years after the invasion.”

She considered him “the worst president ever.”

Thomas embraced the freedoms of a columnist with vigor.

“I censored myself for 50 years when I was a reporter,” Thomas told an audience at the Massachusetts of Technology (MIT) in late 2002. “Now I wake up and ask myself, ‘Who do I hate today?’”

One afternoon in October 2009, she targeted President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, during the daily briefing.

Health care reform was being debated at the time, and Thomas asked Gibbs every day whether a public option would be part of the package.

In the back-and-forth that ensued, Thomas said that she already had reached a conclusion but could not get a straight answer from the presidential spokesman.

“Then why do you keep asking me?” Gibbs inquired.

“Because I want your conscience to bother you,” Thomas replied.

The room broke into laughter as Gibbs turned red.

USA TODAY

Immigration bill goes to full Senate%3B vote possible in June

Conservatives say it faces obstacles because of lack of security

The bill survived more than 200 proposed amendments over five hearings

After three long weeks of hearings and debates, spectators burst out into screams and applause Tuesday night after the Senate Judiciary Committee approved an immigration bill that would be the biggest overhaul to the nation's immigration laws in a generation.

The bill was produced by a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight. With four of those members on the committee, the bill survived 212 amendments over five lengthy hearings.

Left intact was the core of the bill, which will allow the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship, add significant investments in border security and fundamentally alter the legal immigration system of the future.

The committee approved the bill 13-5, meaning the bill is on track to be debated on the full Senate floor beginning the first week of June.

Some Republicans warned that the amendment process had done little to assuage their fears that they were facing a repeat of 1986, when Congress last passed a sweeping immigration bill that allowed up to 3 million people to gain citizenship, but did not fulfill its promises of fully securing the nation's borders.

""Today, we're right back at the same place talking about the same problems and proposing the same solutions,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and the ranking member of the committee.

The committee's chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said it was not ""the bill I would've written,"" but he called it the best opportunity for immigration reform he's seen in years.

""We've demonstrated to the United States Senate that we can all work together, Republicans and Democrats,"" Leahy said. ""Now let's go out of this room, and work together with the other members of the Senate.""

President Obama issued a statement late Tuesday, congratulating the committee for advancing the bill that is ""largely consistent with the principles of common-sense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system.""

""None of the committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I, but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line,"" the statement read.

Tuesday's vote capped off a grueling, sometimes-emotional trek through the committee where senators voted on everything from visas for displaced Tibetans to the ability of unauthorized immigrants to access government benefits. Sponsors of the bill tried to accept as many Republican amendments as they could to garner their support, while holding off ""poison pill"" amendments that could scuttle the carefully negotiated bill.

One example came Tuesday, when Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., finished days of negotiations and reached a breakthrough compromise on visas for high-tech workers.

The bill increases the number of H1-B visas that are primarily given to foreigners trained in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, but Hatch and other Republicans worried that the bill placed too many restrictions on U.S. tech companies trying to hire those workers. Tuesday's agreement requires companies to make a good faith effort to hire Americans for high-skilled technology jobs, but eases some of the hiring requirements originally in the bill.

Hatch called it a ""sensible and reasoned balance"" that made the final product a ""much more acceptable bill.""

Sponsors of the bill also found middle ground in the border security debate.

The committee voted down an amendment from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., to require that all the nation's airports, seaports, and land ports of entry establish a system to collect the fingerprints of all departing foreigners. Republicans, and some Democrats, feel that is the most efficient system to track who has remained in the country after their visas have expired. That is a major concern since 40% of the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants fall into that group.

On Monday, the committee accepted a scaled-down version of the program. Under an amendment filed by Hatch, the nation's 10 busiest international airports will have to implement the program within two years, and it will be expanded to the 30 biggest airports within six years."

Follow Her On Twitter']",Corey Feldman slammed for calling criticism of lingerie birthday party 'bullying',"Some anti-bullying experts are calling foul after former child actor Corey Feldman likened online criticism of his money-making lingerie birthday party to cyber bullying.

Held at his ""Feldmansion,"" the party (which guys could reportedly attend for $250, and was free to gals), featured scores of scantily clad women, many in angel outfits, who he dubbed ""Corey's Angels."" In photos of the soiree published by Vice magazine, Feldman is wearing a mask and a robe alongside his barely clothed female guests in a home covered with posters of his movies from the 1980s.

Apparently Feldman thought the photos Vice ran portrayed his party in a negative light and, thus, were a form of bullying. In a press release distributed on Tuesday, Feldman lashed out at those who had trashed his party. “Bullying is present in schools, homes, professional environments and online and here is a case no different from just that,” Feldman stated. “I can take criticism, but what people are saying online as of late is far beyond that.”

Many disagreed with Feldman’s take, and noted that while some comments directed toward him may have been inappropriate, it was wrong to use the serious issue of bullying to promote his own agenda.

“This is horrible! I can’t believe that Corey would utilize such a serious issue to gain traction for his ‘comeback.’ If this is what I think it is, Corey should be ashamed and every national bullying organization should demand he apologize,” Dr. Chuck Williams, Drexel University Clinical Professor and Director of the Center for the Prevention of School-Aged Violence. “This could be what I call the ‘Miley Cyrus Effect’ – doing anything, no matter how pathetic, in order to get attention.”

Beverly Hills-based clinical psychologist Dr. Jared Maloff also pointed out that while celebrities are often easy targets for keyboard bullies, criticism is different.

“Anyone using the public eye for their personal gain is going to be subjected to criticism,” Maloff said. “Not everyone has to like the material released, and for Mr. Feldman, it is simply an occupational hazard.”

James McGibney, co-founder of BullyVille.com told FOX411 that bullying can occur no matter a person’s stature, but that making false accusations of bullying doesn't help anyone. “If any child or adult claims to be being bullied, then it needs to be seriously looked at, as bullying at any age can occur and is a serious thing,” he said. “However, if false claims (of bullying) are made, then it will negatively impact those who are genuinely suffering from bullying cases in their lives.”

Pop culture site Uproxx called Feldman’s cyber-bullying accusations “a novel bit of spin doctoring.” Indeed Feldman’s press release seemed to use the bullying accusation as a springboard to publicize his other business ventures, including a follow-up event in October, a clothing line, an autobiography, a new movie, and new music.

Still, others are willing to give the “Lost Boys” star the benefit of the doubt.

“We have no idea how Corey is feeling after his seeing negative words written about him. If he was hurt, then he was hurt, and I feel horrible for anyone who gets hurt by another's words,” said Elissa Kravetz, co-partner of Kravetz PR and founder of the non-profit, anti-bullying organization The Farley Project. “If Corey wants to also use this time to spread awareness for what he has going on, then good for him!”

Though his press release invited interviews with Feldman, his rep did not respond to a request for further comment.

USA TODAY

So where was Lincoln, exactly?

Where in Gettysburg, exactly, did Lincoln actually deliver his Gettysburg Address on Nov. 19, 1863? A prominent, 1912 monument to the speech by the entrance of the town's National Cemetery leads casual observers to believe it happened there. But look closely: A nearby, vintage plaque says the speech occurred 300 yards away on the spot of another cemetery monument (to fallen soldiers). Except . . . that's not right, either, modern research has found. The true spot, according to research backed by the National Park Service, lies along the crest of a hill just outside the gates of the cemetery, on the grounds of an older, private cemetery.

Lincoln wasn't the keynote speaker

The dignitary who spoke before Lincoln, Edward Everett, delivered what was scheduled as the main speech of the day. The former Massachusetts governor and onetime Secretary of State took two hours navigating its 13,607 words.

The speech was really, really short

Lincoln's speech, a mere 271 words if you use the version that's attributed to Lincoln, took only two minutes. The New York Times reported of the Gettysburg Address: ""It was delivered (or rather read from a sheet of paper which the speaker held in his hand) in a very deliberate manner, with strong emphasis, and with a most business-like air.""

The Gettysburg Address was ridiculed at first

One of the world's best-remembered speeches, it includes the line, ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here."" Ridiculed at first in some prominent quarters -- The Chicago Times, for one, citing ""silly, flat and dish-watery utterances"" -- the address is now regarded as one of the finest speeches ever given. In 1963 Martin Luther King Jr., kicking off his ""I Have a Dream"" speech before a crowd of 250,000 gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, noted Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation took effect ""five score years ago."" The phrase of course invoked the address whose words were etched into the interior of the monument just a few steps behind the civil rights icon.

Different versions of the speech exist

There are five manuscripts of the speech, and the most widely quoted one is the oldest. The earliest versions were given to his two secretaries, John George Nicholay and John Hay. You can find them at the Library of Congress' web site, myloc.gov."

The bill, signed Friday by Gov. Scott Walker, would require women to view an ultrasound of the fetus before an abortion. Providers would be required to point out the fetus’ features on the ultrasound.

In addition, doctors performing the procedure are required to have admitting privileges at a hospital within a 30-mile radius.

Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and Affiliated Medical Service, both opponents of the bill, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Madison to block the law from taking effect Monday, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported.

The American Civil Liberties Union also sued. Planned Parenthood has abortion clinics in Milwaukee, Madison and Appleton; Affiliated has one in Milwaukee, according to the Journal-Sentinel.

Abortion clinic operators say the bill would cut the number of clinics offering abortions in Wisconsin from four to two, and one of the remaining clinics would have to significantly cut back on operations, the newspaper reported.

Planned Parenthood contends the law puts an undue burden on a woman’s right to choose abortion. The Republican-majority Legislature passed the bill a month ago.

Other states have passed similar restrictions.

In April, Alabama approved a measure requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit, and a federal judge last month temporarily blocked the law.

In late March, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple signed a law outlawing abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, making that state the most restrictive in the nation. There is only one abortion clinic in North Dakota and it has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the law.

Three weeks earlier, Arkansas passed a law that bans most abortions after 12 weeks. A federal judge there has temporarily blocked that law.

And that same month, a federal judge struck down an Idaho law prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks, ruling that the so-called fetal pain law violates U.S. Supreme Court prohibitions against unduly impeding a woman’s ability to seek an abortion before her fetus is able to live outside the womb.

Suicide rates rose 40% in the first six months of 2011 alone.

Murder has doubled.

9,100 doctors in Greece, roughly one out of every seven, have been laid off.

Joining those doctors in joblessness are 27.6% of the entire Greek labor force. By comparison, in the depths of the Great Depression, unemployment in the United States peaked at a lower percentage than that. Among Greek young adults under 25 years old, unemployment reached an abominable 64.9% in May. (Yet the unemployment rate in Greece was as low as 7% as recently as 2008.)

I'm sure that my Tea Party friends will blame universal healthcare, paid sick leave and ""generous"" unemployment benefits for this catastrophe. ""If we simply stopped helping people, then they wouldn't need our help,"" they would say. You can see where that ""logic"" leads. The dead need no help whatsoever, except possibly burial. Sort of like this: ""The Republican healthcare plan: Don't Get Sick. And if you do get sick, Die Quickly.""]

Maybe you think that I'm kidding about what my Tea Party friends would do. I'm not. A few years ago here in Florida, we had a children's health insurance program called KidCare, with a waiting list of over 100,000. The Tea Party Republicans didn't like that. So they eliminated the waiting list.

But back to Greece. A lot of people blame Greek government debt for the current suffering. According to the Central Intelligence Agency, that most authoritative of all conceivable sources, Greek government debt stands at 160% of GDP, which seems like a lot. But Japanese government debt stands at 215% of GDP, and the unemployment rate in Japan is only 4%.

Moreover, Spain's unemployment rate is virtually as high as Greece's, but Spain's government debt stands at only 85% of GDP. That's less debt than Singapore's, and Singapore's unemployment rate is 1.8%.

So we cannot properly attribute the catastrophe in Greece to labor protection, nor can we attribute it to government borrowing. What is the cause, then? The World Health Organization has the answer: austerity. ""Austerity"" is a bloodless term for gross economic mismanagement, animated by heartlessness. That robotic cut-cut-cut mentality that deprives us of jobs, of public services, of safety, of health, of infrastructure, of help for the needy, and – ultimately -- of our economic equilibrium and the ability to survive. The mentality that ushers in, and welcomes, a vicious war of all against all. Austerity is destroying an entire country, right before our eyes.

Or, as the World Health Organization put it: ""These adverse trends in Greece pose a warning to other countries undergoing significant fiscal austerity, including Spain, Ireland and Italy. It also suggests that ways need to be found for cash-strapped governments to consolidate finances without undermining much-needed investments in health.""

In America, we have a rich and powerful lobby that has the same prescription for every economic malady: austerity. Cut-cut-cut. Cut Social Security and Medicare. Cut teacher and police and firefighter jobs. Cut health care. Cut pay and cut pensions. It all boils down to that one ugly word: austerity. And austerity always brings disarray, disaster, decay and death.

People often ask me my position on various issues. Well, I'm for certain things, and I'm against others. But on one issue, I'm very consistent. I'm against pain and suffering. Especially avoidable pain and suffering. And therefore, I'm against austerity. It begins with seemingly innocuous budget cuts. It then leads inexorably to the destruction of countless lives.

Why am I telling you about Greece? In 1935, Sinclair Lewis wrote a book called ""It Can't Happen Here."" But it can. And it's up to us to prevent it.

Courage,

(CNN) —

A pregnant nurse tells CNN she was fired from her job after she refused to get a flu shot for fear of miscarrying.

“I’m a healthy person. I take care of my body. For me, the potential risk was not worth it,” Dreonna Breton told CNN Sunday. “I’m not gonna be the one percent of people that has a problem.”

Breton, 29, worked as a nurse at Horizons Healthcare Services in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, when she was told that all employees were required to get a flu shot. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention advises that all health care professionals get vaccinated annually.

She told her employers that she would not get the vaccine after she explained that there were very limited studies of the effects on pregnant women.

Breton came to the decision with her family after three miscarriages.

CDC: More states reporting widespread flu

The mother of one submitted letters from her obstetrician and primary care doctor supporting her decision, but she was told that she would be fired on December 17 if she did not receive the vaccine before then.

Horizons Healthcare Services spokesman Alan Peterson told CNN affiliate WPVI that it’s unconscionable for a health care worker not to be immunized and that pregnant women are more susceptible to the flu.

The CDC website states that getting a flu shot while pregnant is the best protection for pregnant women and their babies.

“I know that the CDC says to get it, and that’s fine, but it was our choice to avoid the flu vaccine and the unknowns that come with that,” Breton said.

Breton offered to wear a face mask at work, a practice that is used if employees are exempted for religious reasons. The hospital did not approve, according to Breton.

Breton has no interest in taking legal action, she said. She stated she only wants the company to reevaluate their policy on vaccines for pregnant employees and to continue working as a nurse.

Alan Grayson lost $18 million in a scheme by a Virginia man that involved over a 100 victims, the congressman’s office confirmed Monday.

The man who ran the scheme, William Dean Chapman, was sentenced Friday in federal court to 12 years in prison. Prosecutors say Chapman used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle including a Lamborghini, a Ferrari and a $3 million home.

In most of the court papers, Grayson's identity is protected -- prosecutors say only that an elected official with the initials A.G. was the primary victim -- but documents twice mention Grayson by name.

Nothing in the court papers suggests Grayson was anything but a victim of the scheme. Grayson, a former trial attorney, said he has had a long record for picking winning stocks, which formed the basis for his personal fortune.

The scheme worked like this: clients would turn over their stocks to Chapman as collateral for a loan, and Chapman would let customers borrow about 90 percent of the stocks' value.

If the stocks did badly, borrowers could walk away and keep the money they were loaned. But if the borrowers' stocks did well, they would repay the loan with interest, and Chapman was supposed to return the stocks to the investor at their increased value.

But, according to court papers, Chapman sold the stocks and had no way to fulfill his obligations if a client's stock portfolio did well.

""That's why (Chapman) is going to prison for a long, long time,"" Grayson told The Associated Press. ""At least in the end, some kind of justice was served.""

In Grayson's case, his stocks performed astronomically well while they were entrusted to Chapman and his company, Alexander Capital Markets.

Grayson’s office said Chapman’s lawyers tried to claim the spectacular performance of Grayson's stocks caused Chapman to be unable to uphold his financial obligations to his clients, but prosecutors found that he was actually using the money to fund his own expenses.

In 2007, Grayson had $9.35 million in a stock portfolio that Chapman was supposed to be holding as collateral. In that year alone, the portfolio's value increased by 147 percent, to $23 million, according to a chart in the court documents.

Chapman, of Sterling, Va., pleaded guilty in May but tried at Friday's sentencing hearing to withdraw the plea, saying he felt pressured to plead and that he never intended to defraud.

It is not the first time Grayson, who represents parts of the Orlando area, has lost tens of millions of dollars in a fraud scheme. In 2009, he won a $34 million judgment after filing a lawsuit in South Carolina under federal racketeering laws against a company called Derivium Capital. Derivium's business plan for hedging an investor's stock profile was nearly identical to the plan outline by Chapman.

Grayson said he first entered into deals with Chapman in 2003, well before the deal with Derivium went south, so he had no reason to be suspicious the arrangement.

And he said the loans themselves were a perfectly reasonable way to manage his portfolio, but relied on Chapman and Derivium to hold up their end of the bargain. He disputed that the astronomical returns to which he was entitled caused Chapman's downfall.

""If they had not sold the collateral, it all would have worked,"" said Grayson, who is generally listed as one of the 20 wealthiest members of Congress with assets of more than $20 million. His financial disclosure forms list holdings in dozens of stocks. His dealings with Chapman preceded his time in Congress, which began in 2009.

Court records indicate Chapman's firm was drawing regulatory scrutiny as early as 2007.

Grayson also expressed concern that his identity as a victim was not protected by the court file, and that a defense motion and an attachment to a prosecution motion both identified him by name despite procedures that are supposed to be in place to protect victims' privacy.

""I think that's unfortunate,"" Grayson said. ""They should have been more careful, should have used my initials throughout rather than using my name.""

Before he was elected to Congress, Grayson practiced law and was best known for winning a major whistleblower lawsuit exposing fraud on a government contract in Iraq.

In the House, he is known as one the most sharp-tongued critics of Republicans, once famously summarizing Republican's health care plans as little more than wanting sick people to ""die quickly.""

[twitter-follow screen_name='JRavitzCNN']

(CNN) - Of course Tevi Troy has heard the hubbub.

He knows full well that his onetime boss, former President George W. Bush, plans to speak Thursday at a Dallas fundraiser for the Messianic Jewish Bible Institute – a group dedicated to converting Jews to Christianity.



“I have yet to meet a Jewish person who hasn’t heard about this,” says Troy, who served as a Bush administration liaison to the Jewish community and was a former deputy secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The topic of conversion can prompt a visceral reaction for Jews whose darker times have been marred by persecution, expulsion and forced conversions. Millions have died for and because of their faith.

“There’s good historical reason for the Jewish discomfort,” Troy says.

But before Troy, an Orthodox Jew, will tread into this controversy, he wants to discuss the Jewish value of hakarat hatov, or “recognizing the good.”

He says people should remember and appreciate that Bush was “a very good president to the Jewish people.”

He was a friend to Israel during the Second Intifada, Troy says. He was an outspoken opponent of anti-Semitism. And in the wake of the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2002, when Jews felt like targets, Troy says Bush took on terrorism.

That said, when it comes to Bush’s decision to speak at the annual banquet for this messianic group, one that believes Jews like this former aide need to be saved, Troy admits, “I would be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed.”

CNN tried to speak with five other former Bush administration liaisons to the Jewish community, but only two of those responded. Both suggested Troy could speak for them, too.

His words, though, are tempered. Others, such as Rabbi David Wolpe, who was dubbed America’s most influential rabbi by Newsweek in 2012, called Bush’s decision “infuriating.”

The Messianic Jewish Bible Institute is representative of a longstanding effort to convert Jews, one that dates back to Paul in the New Testament who said, in Romans 1:16, that the Gospel should be taken “to the Jew first.”

The institute's website features a menorah in its logo. Its chairman is listed as Rabbi Jonathan Bernis, a man who heads up another organization called Jewish Voice Ministries International, where an “Ask the Rabbi” feature includes an image of him wearing a yarmulke and Jewish prayer shawl.

CNN reached out to Bernis at Jewish Voice Ministries but was told by a spokeswoman that he was not allowed to comment on the upcoming fundraiser.

Then CNN asked where he had been ordained as a rabbi, and the spokeswoman hung up the phone.

We also called the Messianic Jewish Bible Institute, which pulled down from its website any references to Bush’s upcoming appearance soon after Mother Jones broke the story. An institute spokeswoman said there would be no comment.

A source close to Bush, who didn't want to be named, confirmed to CNN on Wednesday afternoon that the former president still plans to speak at Thursday’s banquet, where tickets reportedly range in price from $100 to $100,000.

The source also said that Bush addresses all sorts of groups, secular and religious of varying stripes. Bush tells stories from the White House and speaks about his love for America, which includes a commitment to religious freedom and tolerance, according to the source.

Had Bush’s onetime liaison to the Jewish community still been working with the former president or been asked, Troy said he certainly would have advised against such an appearance.

Troy says the problem is most people don’t understand why talk of converting Jews stirs up such strong feelings in the Jewish community.

“It dates back to a time when forced conversion was a serious issue, when the church was imbued with the power of state,” he says.

Troy points to the Spanish Inquisition as an example, explaining how under duress and torture, Jews had to convert to Christianity or face expulsion from Spain in 1492. Those who stayed and exhibited any shred of Jewish observance were persecuted.

The Messianic Jewish Bible Institute, founded in the mid-1990s, includes in its mission the goal to ""educate Christians in their role to provoke the Jewish people to jealousy and thus save some of them.""

The institute's statement of faith also says that those who are born Jewish and ""place their faith in Messiah Yeshua,"" Jesus, ""have not disowned or separated themselves from their race and Judaic heritage, but remain sons and daughters of Israel.""

Missionary outreach to Jews in America isn't new. It dates back to the 19th century. A Hungarian man who called himself a ""rabbi"" established a ministry in 1894 to target Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn, offering them assistance, education and New Testaments translated into Yiddish.

On the opposite coast in San Francisco in 1973, a Baptist minister - who was born Jewish - founded a proselytizing organization called Jews for Jesus. His small army has been knocking on doors and pounding the pavement ever since.

A less aggressive approach, preferred by others who might call themselves Messianic Jews or Hebrew Christians, has been the establishment of Messianic “synagogues” and organizations. They’re sponsored by Christians, and they incorporate Jewish symbols and modified Jewish rituals. They’re often led by leaders who call themselves rabbis, use Hebrew phrases and wear traditional Jewish accessories.

Critics cry false advertising, subterfuge and bemoan how such outfits, including the Messianic Jewish Bible Institute, which built its base in the former Soviet Union, often target Jews who don’t know better – what Rob Eshman of the Jewish Journal in Los Angeles called, “the low-hanging fruit of Jewish identity.”

While Messianic Jews believe it’s possible to be Jewish while believing Jesus is the Messiah, others say this makes as much sense as a vegetarian who believes in scarfing down steak.

The historical concern may have been rooted in forced conversions, but Troy knows that's not an issue today.

In fact, the group Bush will address - and others like it - don’t really worry him. He’s more concerned about a recent Pew study that showed how a growing number of American Jews don’t identify with any faith, let alone their own.

About a third of American Jews born after 2000 answered “none” when asked about their religious affiliation, the survey showed. Of everyone surveyed who was raised Jewish, according to the researchers, 6% now describe themselves as Christian - mostly as Catholics, Protestants or ""just Christian.""

Messianic Jews, Pew said, constitute a very small group. Meantime, though, the Pew survey also showed that 34% of those asked believe a person can be Jewish and believe Jesus was the messiah.

But the fundraiser in Dallas, even if it features the likes of a former U.S. president, isn’t what’s hurting American Jews, Troy says.

""Judaism,"" he says, ""has other and bigger problems."""

The idea of the president picking up the tab for dinner in a swanky Washington restaurant for 12 of his most staunch political foes sounds like an improbable plot twist straight out of “The West Wing.” But, as I learned long ago, political reality is almost always more weird and fascinating than political fiction.

In my mind, it’s easy to visualize the film version of the dinner. Low lights casting a golden glow on shadowy faces as the camera moves along the table: Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator with his boyish face sinking into jowls; Saxby Chambliss, the beady-eyed, white-haired Georgian looking slightly appalled to be dining with a Kenya-born socialist; Tom Coburn, with his spiky hair, boxer’s nose and Oklahoma common sense that keeps him from pandering to the lunatic fringe of his party; all the other senators sitting tense and alert as they look toward their host. Obama would have to be seated at the head of the table with John McCain, the man he defeated for the presidency, uncomfortably placed at his right. That dramatic juxtaposition would be impossible to resist – unless McCain were in the farthest seat at the other end of the long table, still seething over his lost place in history.

Just add the expository, rapid-fire Aaron Sorkin dialogue and you’d have an instant HBO hit.

I reviewed the political implications of the dinner in Thursday’s Top of the Ticket post, pondering whether Obama’s charm offensive had any chance of breaking through the virulent partisanship that has stalled our government since Republicans took back the House of Representatives in the 2010 congressional election. Today’s cartoon would have been a good match for that column, but I didn’t dream it up until late Wednesday night. Sometimes inspiration fails to keep pace with breaking news.

The cartoon that did run with the column – the double-genie cartoon, caricaturing the ideological rancor between U.S. Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid -- shows where I started the day on Wednesday. That drawing was completed and my column was half done when I heard about the Obama dinner. Through a couple of rewrites, the column became less about political polarization and more about the president’s charm offensive. By 10:30 p.m., I realized the cartoon and column were no longer a precise pairing, and I thought about starting over. By 11 p.m., I had the “arugula” idea, but was not too anxious to stay up until 3 a.m. to get it done.

Instead, we have today’s follow-up.

To be completely candid about my creative process, I should mention I had one other dinner-related cartoon in mind – a Last Supper scene with Obama at the center in Jesus’ seat, flanked by the 12 senators. Obama would say, “One of you will betray me,” and one of the senators would reply, “Only one of us?!”

It’s a pretty funny idea, but I opted for the simpler vision of an arugula eater dining amid a dozen red-meat devotees. But don’t be surprised to see the Last Supper concept turn up somewhere. I hate wasting a good metaphor."
http://news.yahoo.com/andrew-johnson-worst-president-american-history-110208446.html,,[],Is Andrew Johnson the worst president in American history?,"Today marks the birthday of perhaps the most-maligned president in American history. But was Andrew Johnson really that bad, or just the target of some second-guessing historians?

Andrew Johnson’s impeachment trial.

Johnson was born on December 29, 1808 in North Carolina. He served in the Senate and the House and as governor, and then military governor, of Tennessee. It was when he was serving as military governor that Abraham Lincoln asked him to replace Hannibal Hamlin as vice president in the 1864 campaign. A Democrat, Johnson switched parties for the election.

Already an enigma because of his well-known independent streak and his earlier support of slavery, Johnson turned heads when he was apparently drunk at his own inauguration in 1865. (Another theory was that Johnson was ill and he hadn’t been known for drinking in public.)

Johnson suddenly found himself as president when Lincoln died just after starting his second term. His policies during Reconstruction were controversial and caused his newfound party to impeach him in 1868. Johnson kept his job by one vote in a Senate trial.

In his official biography on the White House website, Johnson’s term is summed up politely.

“Although an honest and honorable man, Andrew Johnson was one of the most unfortunate of presidents. Arrayed against him were the Radical Republicans in Congress, brilliantly led and ruthless in their tactics. Johnson was no match for them,” says a bio prepared by Michael Beschloss and Hugh Sidey.

Looking back at historians who have ranked Johnson (and other presidents) since 1948, he appears to be the one president who has suffered at the hands of revisionist history—either because more facts are available about his term, or because his place in the history of race relations has been re-evaluated.

In 1948, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. ranked Johnson as a middle-of-the-pack president: a respected 19th out of 29 presidents.

Since then, some presidents have risen in the eyes of historians, like James K. Polk and Andrew Jackson.

Story continues

Andrew Johnson’s ratings have plummeted like a rock. In a recent 2010 Siena College survey, Johnson was called the worst president in history. A 2011 survey from a British academic institute ranked Johnson as 36th out of 40 presidents.

In general, two presidents who died early in their terms—William Henry Harrison and James Garfield—aren’t considered in presidential rankings.

Johnson has been tossed into the bottom rung of presidents, including James Buchanan (who served before Lincoln), Franklin Pierce (who preceded Buchanan), and Warren Harding.

Buchanan, Pierce, and Harding have always been considered really bad presidents by historians. Andrew Johnson has taken the place of Ulysses S. Grant, who has received an upgrade from “bad” to “mediocre” in recent years.

In Johnson’s case, Lincoln was a tough act to follow, and his failed role in obstructing much of the GOP’s Reconstruction plans was a tough pill for historians to swallow.

After becoming president, Johnson fought with his own Cabinet and party members over the scope of readmitting secessionist states and the voting rights of blacks.

Johnson favored a very lenient version of Reconstruction and state control over who could vote, according to their race. He also openly opposed the 14th Amendment.

Although Johnson had supported an end to slavery in the 1860s, he was a white supremacist. “This is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, it shall be a government for white men,” he wrote in 1866.

In the end, the Radical Republicans won control over Reconstruction and Johnson became a pariah.

Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Bill, but Congress overrode the veto in an unprecedented move.

Somehow, Johnson survived the impeachment trial, possibly because there was no vice president to replace him, and moderates feared Benjamin Wade, the Senate president pro tempore who would have replaced Johnson.

The Radical Republicans also eventually failed, and Reconstruction had ended within a decade. Racial discrimination continued on into the middle of the following century.

And not everyone is convinced Johnson was a one-dimensional figure.

Dr. Robert Orr, a historian in North Carolina, told a local newspaper in 2008 that “the modern hostility to Andrew Johnson, I believe, mostly comes from comments he made that are racially insensitive.”

Among historians today, James Buchanan is the one president who is consistently ranked as low as Johnson. Buchanan’s seeming indifference to the onset of the Civil War, and his own failings as a president, were monumental."

USA TODAY

The powerful National Automobile Dealers Association is facing a backlash over its choice of Hillary Rodham Clinton as the keynote speaker for its big annual convention.

At least a dozen dealers are raising objections about the former secretary of State and possible 2016 Democratic presidential contender as the keynoter at the NADA convention in January. One dealer says he's not only going to boycott the confab in New Orleans, but is canceling his membership, Automotive News reports.

""When I see the announcement that the 'Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton' will be giving the keynote address, the hair on my back just sticks up,"" the News quotes Jon Lind, general manager of a Ford-Lincoln dealership in Burlington, Colo., as saying.

Not all auto dealers are Republicans. President Bill Clinton's former chief of staff, Thomas ""Mack"" McLarty, is a top executive in an auto dealer group based in Arkansas. But it appears the 16,000-member NADA leans conservative when it comes to speaker choices.

Among former presidents who have addressed the NADA, Bill Clinton has been the only Democrat. Others have included Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Another former secretary of State, Colin Powell, addressed the group a couple of years ago. Powell, of course, served in the Cabinet of President George W. Bush.

Perhaps to head off a backlash, the NADA tried to put the Hillary Clinton choice in context when it announced her as keynoter on July 10.

""NADA has a long history of inviting high-profile speakers who have provided diverse perspectives on a wide range of issues,"" Desmond Roberts, chairman of NADA's convention committee and a Chevrolet dealer in Hodgkins, Ill., said in the statement. ""We've hosted U.S. presidents from both parties, as well as prime ministers and other dignitaries who have offered interesting insights and opinions.""

Her speaking fee was not disclosed."

LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) — A Louisiana pastor was fatally shot as he preached to a crowd of more than 60 during a revival service and a suspect has been arrested, law enforcement officials said Saturday.

The shooting at about 8:20 p.m. Friday was at Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center in Lake Charles, Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kim Myers said Saturday. Sixty-five people were inside at the time, including the victim's wife, Chief Deputy Stitch Guillory said.

Deputies have no information on a motive or on whether the preacher and suspect knew each other, Myers said.

Myers said Ronald J. Harris was shot twice by the gunman. He walked into the church while Harris was preaching and shot him, then hit him again when Harris fell to the floor.

The gunman ""walked up to him and shot him at close range,"" Myers said.

Harris was pronounced dead at the scene.

Woodrow Karey, 53, of Lake Charles is charged with second-degree murder and was held in the parish jail Saturday, Myers said. Karey's bond has been set at $1 million.

The gunman left the church, but Myers said Karey called the sheriff's office and surrendered.

Myers said after picking up Karey, deputies found two guns in a wooded area — one was a shotgun, the other a .22-caliber pistol.

Myers said Karey has no known criminal history.

Deputies were ""interviewing everybody who was there at the church,"" Myers said.

Family members who answered the telephone Saturday at the Harris home in Lake Charles said there would be no comment. There was no answer at a telephone listing for Karey or at Tabernacle of Praise."

Christine Quinn promises to build 40,000 units of affordable housing; Bill de Blasio promises to “build or preserve” 200,000; Thompson, wouldn’t you know, comes in at 120,000. On education, where he speaks with some authority as a former president of the Board of Education, he is a moderate reformer: for charter schools, the Common Core and testing accountability, but for attempting to save failing schools before closing them, and for treating teachers as partners in reform rather than intransigent slackers. (His mother was a public-school teacher, and he has an endorsement from the teachers’ union.)

For a revealing demonstration of the Thompson way — his manner of taking the heat out of a hot-button issue — consider his handling of the police tactic called stop-and-frisk.

Stop-and-frisk, or, as its advocates prefer, stop-question-and-frisk, is as old as policing. Bill Bratton, the former New York police commissioner, former Los Angeles chief of police and the go-to policing guru for mayoral candidates of both parties this year, says the practice is indispensable and uncontroversial when done right: it should be based on a reasonable suspicion, it should be done with respect, and it should be employed consistently. In Los Angeles, which has a famously assertive police force and a population at least as diverse as New York’s, Bratton says stop-and-frisk is routinely employed with little protest."

Washington (CNN) - Only four out of 10 Americans believe President Barack Obama can manage the federal government effectively, according to a new national poll.

And a CNN/ORC International survey released Monday morning also indicates that 53% of Americans now believe that Obama is not honest and trustworthy, the first time that a clear majority in CNN polling has felt that way.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

According to the survey, conducted last Monday through Wednesday, 40% say the President can manage the government effectively. That 40% figure is down 12 percentage points from June and is the worst score Obama received among the nine personal characteristics tested in the new poll.

""A lot of attention has focused on the President's numbers on honesty in new polling the past three weeks, but it looks like the recent controversy over Obamacare has had a bigger impact on his status as an effective manager of the government, and that may be what is really driving the drop in Obama's approval rating this fall,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.

Does being an effective manager count more than honesty?

""Just ask Bill Clinton, whose overall approval ratings remained high during and after the Monica Lewinsky scandal because three-quarters of all Americans thought he could get things done, even though only about one in five said he was honest,"" Holland added.

Obama's woes are not limited to honesty and his managerial skills. Fifty-six percent say he is not a person they admire, and an equal number say he does not agree with them on important issues. Fifty-six percent also say he does not inspire confidence, and 53% don't view him as a strong and decisive leader. All of those figures are all-time records for Obama in CNN polling.

There is a silver lining in the poll for the President: He's still seen as someone who cares about ordinary Americans, six in 10 say he has a vision for the country's future, and seven in 10 say he is likable–his best attribute of the nine items tested in this poll. But the numbers are down for both admiration and likeability.

""It's clear that views of Obama as a person - once his strong suit - have taken a hit in October and throughout 2013,"" said Holland.

The poll was conducted November 18-20 for CNN by ORC International, with 843 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

She Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In']",Kathleen Parker: The Obama White House ‘threat’ to Bob Woodward matters,"To the world beyond the Beltway, it might not mean much that Bob Woodward of the famed Watergate duo went public with his recent White House run-in.

This would be an oversight.

It also may not mean much that the White House press corps got teed off when they weren’t allowed access to President Obama as he played golf with Tiger Woods. This, too, would be an oversight.

Though not comparable — one appeared to be a veiled threat aimed at one of the nation’s most respected journalists and the other a minor blip in the scheme of things — both are part of a pattern of behavior by the Obama administration that suggests not just thin skin but a disregard for the role of the press and a gradual slide toward a state media.

This is where oversight can become dangerous.

Understandably, everyday Americans may find this discussion too inside baseball to pay much mind. Why can’t the president play a little golf without a press gaggle watching? As for Woodward, it’s not as though the White House was threatening to bust his kneecaps.

Add to these likely sentiments the fact that Americans increasingly dislike the so-called mainstream media, sometimes for good reason. Distrust of media, encouraged by alternative media seeking to enhance their own standing, has become a tool useful to the very powers the Fourth Estate was constitutionally endowed to monitor. When the president can bypass reporters to reach the public, it is not far-fetched to imagine a time — perhaps now? — when the state controls the message.

To recap: Woodward recently wrote a commentary for The Post that placed the sequester debacle on Obama’s desk and accused the president of “moving the goal posts” by asking for more tax increases.

Before his piece was published, Woodward called the White House to tell officials it was coming. A shouting match ensued between Woodward and Gene Sperling, Obama’s economic adviser, followed by an e-mail in which Sperling said that Woodward “will regret staking out that claim.”

Though the tone was conciliatory and Sperling apologized for raising his voice, the message nonetheless caused Woodward to bristle.

Again, Woodward’s kneecaps are probably safe, but the challenge to his facts, and therefore to his character, was unusual, given Woodward’s stature. And, how, by the way, might Woodward come to regret it? Sperling’s words, though measured, could be read as: “You’ll never set foot in this White House again.”

When reporters lose access to the White House, it isn’t about being invited to the annual holiday party. It’s about having access to the most powerful people on the planet as they execute the nation’s business.

Inarguably, Woodward has had greater access to the White House than any other journalist in town. Also inarguably, he would survive without it. He has filled a library shelf with books about the inner workings of this and other administrations, the fact of which makes current events so remarkable.

Woodward, almost 70, is Washington’s Reporter Emeritus. His facts stand up to scrutiny. His motivations withstand the test of objectivity. Sperling obviously assumed that Woodward wouldn’t take offense at the suggestion that he not only was wrong but was also endangering his valuable proximity to power.

He assumed, in other words, that Woodward would not do his job. This was an oversight.

This is no tempest in a teapot but rather the leak in the dike. Drip by drip, the Obama administration has demonstrated its intolerance for dissent and its contempt for any who stray from the White House script. Yes, all administrations are sensitive to criticism, and all push back when such criticism is deemed unfair or inaccurate. But no president since Richard Nixon has demonstrated such overt contempt for the messenger. And, thanks to technological advances in social media, Obama has been able to bypass traditional watchdogs as no other president has.

More to the point, the Obama White House is, to put it politely, fudging as it tries to place the onus of the sequester on Congress. And, as has become customary, officials are using the Woodward spat to distract attention. As Woodward put it: “This is the old trick . . . of making the press . . . the issue, rather than what the White House has done here.”

Killing the messenger is a time-honored method of controlling the message, but we have already spilled that blood. And the First Amendment’s protection of a free press, the purpose of which is to check power and constrain government’s ability to dictate the lives of private citizens, was no accident.

The idea of the president picking up the tab for dinner in a swanky Washington restaurant for 12 of his most staunch political foes sounds like an improbable plot twist straight out of “The West Wing.” But, as I learned long ago, political reality is almost always more weird and fascinating than political fiction.

In my mind, it’s easy to visualize the film version of the dinner. Low lights casting a golden glow on shadowy faces as the camera moves along the table: Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator with his boyish face sinking into jowls; Saxby Chambliss, the beady-eyed, white-haired Georgian looking slightly appalled to be dining with a Kenya-born socialist; Tom Coburn, with his spiky hair, boxer’s nose and Oklahoma common sense that keeps him from pandering to the lunatic fringe of his party; all the other senators sitting tense and alert as they look toward their host. Obama would have to be seated at the head of the table with John McCain, the man he defeated for the presidency, uncomfortably placed at his right. That dramatic juxtaposition would be impossible to resist – unless McCain were in the farthest seat at the other end of the long table, still seething over his lost place in history.

Just add the expository, rapid-fire Aaron Sorkin dialogue and you’d have an instant HBO hit.

I reviewed the political implications of the dinner in Thursday’s Top of the Ticket post, pondering whether Obama’s charm offensive had any chance of breaking through the virulent partisanship that has stalled our government since Republicans took back the House of Representatives in the 2010 congressional election. Today’s cartoon would have been a good match for that column, but I didn’t dream it up until late Wednesday night. Sometimes inspiration fails to keep pace with breaking news.

The cartoon that did run with the column – the double-genie cartoon, caricaturing the ideological rancor between U.S. Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid -- shows where I started the day on Wednesday. That drawing was completed and my column was half done when I heard about the Obama dinner. Through a couple of rewrites, the column became less about political polarization and more about the president’s charm offensive. By 10:30 p.m., I realized the cartoon and column were no longer a precise pairing, and I thought about starting over. By 11 p.m., I had the “arugula” idea, but was not too anxious to stay up until 3 a.m. to get it done.

Instead, we have today’s follow-up.

To be completely candid about my creative process, I should mention I had one other dinner-related cartoon in mind – a Last Supper scene with Obama at the center in Jesus’ seat, flanked by the 12 senators. Obama would say, “One of you will betray me,” and one of the senators would reply, “Only one of us?!”

It’s a pretty funny idea, but I opted for the simpler vision of an arugula eater dining amid a dozen red-meat devotees. But don’t be surprised to see the Last Supper concept turn up somewhere. I hate wasting a good metaphor."

Napolitano made the declaration in an exchange with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) when he was questioning her on how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have alleged that political officials in the Obama administration, including her, have blocked them from enforcing the law.

Sessions noted that ICE agents’ union president Chris Crane had testified on Monday “that agents are prohibited from enforcing the law and, indeed, the ICE officers have filed a lawsuit [to that effect].”

“I started out as a federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice in 1975,” Sessions said. “I have never heard of a situation in which a group of law officers sued their supervisor and you for blocking them from following the law. They weren’t complaining about pay, benefits, working conditions. They were saying their very oath they took, to enforce the law, is being blocked by rules and regulations and policies established from on high and that this is undermining their ability to do what they’re sworn to do.”

In her response to those remarks from Sessions, Napolitano said she believes she and other political officials have the authority to tell law enforcement agents which laws to enforce and which ones to ignore.

“There are tensions with union leadership, unfortunately, but here’s what I expect as a former federal prosecutor and attorney general, and that is that law enforcement agents will enforce the law in accord with the guidance they’re given from their superiors,” Napolitano said. “That’s what we ask of ICE, that’s what we ask of Border Patrol, that’s what we ask throughout the Department and I believe that would be consistent with all law enforcement. Agents don’t set the enforcement priorities. Those are set by their superiors and they are asked then to obey that guidance in accord with the law.”

Sessions was not pleased with Napolitano’s response, so he followed up by asking: “”Well, what Mr. Crane testified to was that there are law provisions that say an agent shall do this, that and the other, and that the policies set by their political supervisors refuse to allow them to do what the law plainly requires. You are not entitled to set policies, are you, that violate the mandates of congressional law?”

Napolitano answered that question by saying she “disagree[s] with almost everything” Sessions has said, “but we’ll just have to respectfully disagree with each other.”

“But, I think it does point to why this bill needs to be passed, because what we want our officers doing is focusing on narco-traffickers and human smugglers and money launderers and others who misuse our border and our immigration system,” Napolitano said. “By having a process by which those in the country illegally can pay a fine, pay fees, register so we know who they are, by dealing with the employer demand for illegal labor, by opening up the visa system, that will have the effect, basically, of confirming the focus of resources where they need to be.”

Despite Napolitano’s and the administration’s belief that they can tell law enforcement agents which laws to enforce and which ones to ignore, the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill cedes even more authority away from Congress and gives it to the administration.

In their lines of questioning with Napolitano during Tuesday’s hearing, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) focused on how the bill cedes authority. In a statement he issued after the hearing indicating he is not satisfied with the bill’s so-called “border security triggers” that are supposedly meant to ensure the border actually gets secured, Cruz said he does not trust the bill will actually secure the border.

“As it stands, the border security component – which numbers only 58 pages of the 844-page bill – largely cedes authority to the Department of Homeland Security to determine when and how the border would be secure,” Cruz said. “However, today’s hearing revealed that the last clear metric for border security – ‘operational control’ – reflected that in 2010, DHS had secured 873 miles of the more than 2,000 mile border. When that metric did not demonstrate success, DHS decided to simply abandon the metric. In order for a metric to be real, it must be meaningful. Currently, there are no objective metrics in place to ensure any triggers in this bill will be meaningful, all while the pathway to citizenship component remains contingent on this undefined border security.”

Lee similarly questioned why the Gang of Eight bill gives Napolitano and the administration so much authority. “Some of the questions that I have as I’ve read through this bill over the last few days relate to the amount of discretion you are given, you and your successors will be given over time, should this become law,” Lee opened his line of questioning with Napolitano on Tuesday.

Even Gang of Eight member Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) admits the amount of authority the bill would cede to the administration is controversial. “Biggest challenge on #immigrationreform has been well founded lack of trust that Obama administration will enforce the law,” Rubio Tweeted on Tuesday. “Its [sic] a big problem”"

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/13/Powell-vein-of-intolerance,2013-01-13 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Powell: GOP 'Looks Down on Minorities',"This morning, former Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press to discuss the nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to Secretary of Defense. During the discussion, David Gregory asked the liberal Powell, nominally a Republican but a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama, about the Republican Party. “I’m struck when you talk about Republicans as they. I know you insist despite voting for President Obama twice now that you’re still a Republican. But as– as I go through your record on some social issues and even foreign policy issues, I challenge you a little bit to say on what basis are you still a Republican? Do you feel like this Republican Party has left you or have you left it?”

Now, this is a half-decent question, given that Powell has been quite liberal on the issues for years now. But Powell’s answer wasn’t that he differed from Republicans on the issues. Instead, he went directly to the most common liberal meme these days in defending a radical left president: Republicans are racist. It’s a bully tactic that has become all the rage these days – Republicans don’t oppose Obama on policy, and they don’t have a good rationale for standing against liberalism. It’s just that they secretly hate black people.

Here’s what he said:

I think the Republican Party right now is having an identity problem. And I’m still a Republican. I’m a Republican who grew up along with George Bush XLI. I grew up with Ronald Reagan, Cap Weinberger, Frank Carlucci, that Republican Party, the Republican Party of Dick Lugar and John Tower. But in recent years, there’s been a significant shift to the right and we have seen what that shift has produced, two losing presidential campaigns.

So far, this is a typical leftist talking point. The Republican Party has not moved to the right. In fact, it has moved in rather extreme ways to the left, given its spending record and establishment opposition to the Tea Party. Ronald Reagan was significantly more conservative than George W. Bush. But this was prelude to Powell’s real agenda: labeling Republicans closet bigots.

I think what the Republican Party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country has changed. The country is changing demographically. And if the Republican Party does not change along with that demographic, they’re going to be in trouble. And so, when we see that in one more generation, the minorities of America, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans will be the majority of the country, you can’t go around saying we don’t want to have a solid immigration policy. We’re going to dismiss the 47 percent. We are going to make it hard for these minorities to vote as they did in the last election. What did that produce? The court struck most of that down and most importantly, it caused people to turn out and stand in line because these Republicans were trying to keep us from voting. There’s also a dark– a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the Party. What I do mean by that? I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor say that the president is shuckin’ and jivin’, that’s a racial era slave term. When I see another former governor after the president’s first debate where he didn’t do very well, says that the president was lazy. He didn’t say he was slow, he was tired, he didn’t do well, he said he was lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans but to those of us who are African-Americans, the second word is shiftless and then there’s a third word that goes along with it. Birther, the whole Birther Movement. Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the Party? I think the Party has to take a look at itself. It has to take a look at its responsibilities for health care. It has to take a look at immigration. It has to take a look at those less fortunate than us. The Party has gathered unto itself a reputation that it is the party of the rich. It is the party of lower taxes. But there are a lot of people who are lower down the food chain, the economic chain, who are also paying lots of taxes relative to their income and they need help. We need more education work being done in this country. We need a solid immigration policy. We have to look at climate change. There are a lot of things that the American people are expecting and the Republican Party, as they get ready for the next election, really has to focus on some of these issues and not ignore them. Everybody wants to talk about who’s going to be the candidate. You better think first about what’s the party they’re actually going to represent. If it’s just going to represent the far right-wing of the political spectrum, I think the Party is in difficulty. I’m a moderate but I’m still a Republican, that’s how I was raised. And until I voted for Mister Obama twice, I had voted for seven straight Republican presidents.

Notice the subtle linkage there: Republicans oppose global warming, immigration reform of the type leftists want, redistribution of income, not out of principle, but out of hatred of those with a different skin color. This is despicable. And it is a lie. Powell’s statements are outrageous. His statements about “shuckin’ and jivin'”? He’s referring to former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AL), who wrote this about President Obama’s feckless foreign policy on Benghazi:

Why the lies? Why the cover up? Why the dissembling about the cause of the murder of our ambassador on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil? We deserve answers to this. President Obama’s shuck and jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end.

Is that racist? Of course not. But Powell labels it racist because it serves his political ends.

Is the word “lazy” racist? If so, half the media hates white folks, because presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower have routinely been labeled lazy.

As for the birthers, nobody in the mainstream of the Republican Party has ever given credibility to them. Only in Colin Powell’s opportunistic mind is the GOP linked with birtherism.

What’s more, Powell is the last person on earth who should be making this claim. He says that he voted for President Obama twice because he’s a moderate Republican whose party has left him. That’s nonsense. In 2008, Republicans ran the most moderate Republican in history in Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). And Powell voted against him. Why? Let Powell, circa 2009, explain:

And I spoke at length with John McCain about his campaign and I watched Mr. Obama and his campaign. And at the end, I cannot say I was totally colorblind. But at the end, I convinced myself, based on the facts as I saw it, that he was the better choice for this time in our nation’s history.

It is Colin Powell and his perspective that are underlaced with a vein of intolerance. Powell should know better than anyone that the GOP has no such vein – after all, the GOP discussed the possibility of him running for president on its ticket for years. No, this is about liberal bullying and thuggery – claiming that anyone who opposes leftist policies does so out of racism rather than political differences. And it’s vile.

The last page of the pamphlet, which was distributed via the Wednesday morning GOP conference meeting, included a collage of what it described as “What Conservative Groups Are Saying.” Under that header, the pamphlet includes statements from Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) president Grover Norquist, Southern Baptist Convention ethics and religious liberty commission president Dr. Russell Moore, the American Conservative Union (ACU), and the American Action Forum (AAF).

Each of these groups supports amnesty, and each has endorsed the Senate immigration bill.

Norquist, who was cited twice on the last page of the pamphlet, helped champion the “Gang of Eight” bill through the Senate. He even testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of it, for which he received glowing praise from Democrat senators like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The ACU, which is chaired by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) ally Al Cardenas, also backed the Senate bill.

AAF and its sister group American Action Network are actually part of an aggressive public pressure campaign to get the House to take up the Senate bill. Finally, Moore is a member of the George Soros front group Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) that has been advocating in favor of the Senate bill as well.

That page also quoted a months-old article from Roll Call that pointed out the Club For Growth and FreedomWorks were not going to get involved in the immigration battle, suggesting a tacit endorsement from those two conservative watchdog groups by not fighting this battle.

The page included nothing from Tea Party Patriots or the Heritage Foundation, which are both adamantly opposed to the Senate bill, nor any of the statements from the litany of conservative groups that have come out against the Gang of Eight.

When asked about whether she specifically approved the distribution of this material to all GOP members via conference on Wednesday, GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers told Breitbart News’ Kerry Picket that she had approved it because she thought it was being done on behalf of the Judiciary Committee. “Well we did distribute it at conference,” McMorris Rodgers said in an interview with Picket on Capitol Hill. “But it’s a product of the Judiciary Committee. We allowed for it to be handed out at conference.”

Breitbart News then reached out to several of the House Republican members on the committee to see if they personally endorsed the literature. Almost a full day later, not one member has returned a request for comment.

The full packet opens with a “Dear Colleague” letter from House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). “This recess packet has been put together to help you communicate to your constituents the importance of immigration reform and the House Republican plan to produce solutions that actually fix the problems that plague our immigration system,” Goodlatte wrote. “The Committee welcomes your insight and input as we move forward together on this important issue.”

The pamphlet lays out several pieces of legislation individually supported by most immigration hawks, like the SAFE Act from Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and the Legal Workforce Act from Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX). But it also touts legislative proposals that do not have broad support like the Border Security Results Act from House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX).

The packet confirms the suspicions of many critics of comprehensive immigration reform by saying the House is working on an amnesty provision: “House Republicans are currently discussing a way forward on how to provide legal status to unlawful immigrants living in our country. However, the current unlawful immigrant population is diverse, so the solutions may vary.”

“For example, while some knowingly broke our immigration laws, others were brought illegally to the U.S. as children by their parents,” the writing claims. “These children came here through no fault of their own and many of them know no other home than the United States.”

The packet does, however, say that any amnesty would need to come after border security and interior enforcement are strengthened, but does not say whether any forthcoming specific proposals would actually do that. Proponents of the Senate bill had similarly originally said legalization, or amnesty, would come after border security and interior enforcement were improved. When the Senate bill was finally introduced, that talking point changed."

The new survey finds that 34 percent of adults would favor establishing Christianity as the official state religion in their own state, while 47 percent would oppose doing so. Thirty-two percent said that they would favor a constitutional amendment making Christianity the official religion of the United States, with 52 percent saying they were opposed.

Although a large percentage of Americans said they would favor establishing a state religion, only 11 percent said they thought the U.S. Constitution allowed states to do so. Fifty-eight percent said they didn't think it was constitutional, and 31 percent said they were not sure.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment, which (among other things) prohibits the government from establishing an official religion, also applies to the states.

Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say that they would favor establishing Christianity as an official state religion, with 55 percent favoring it in their own state and 46 percent favoring a national constitutional amendment.

The relatively high level of support for establishing Christianity as a state religion may be reflective of dissatisfaction with the current balance of religion and politics. Respondents to the poll were more likely to say that the U.S. has gone too far in keeping religion and government separate than they were to say religion and government are too mixed, by a 37-29 percent margin. Only 17 percent said that the country has struck a good balance in terms of the separation of church and state.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted April 3-4 among 1,000 U.S. adults. The poll used a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

The video Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen’s recent “parliamentary inquiry” on the floor of the House of the Representatives is making the rounds, and will likely be seen by millions by the end of the week. I include this video at the bottom of the page.

The video puts to rest any argument that the GOP wants to end the shutdown and get government working again. Perhaps they are having too much fun waving confederate flags in front of the White House. The bill, H.R. 368, forbids anyone except “the Majority Leader or his designate” from bringing a clean continuing resolution to the floor for vote.

Now it doesn’t surprise me in the least that Republicans would do this. It doesn’t outrage me that the use of backhanded, undemocratic measures are being employed by the party controlled by Tea Party loons.

What does infuriate me is the fact the seven Democrats crossed party lines to vote for a resolution that gives Eric Cantor, and only Eric Cantor the ability to bring fourth a vote a clear CR to get the government working aging…and yes, open the monuments.

And now several of the seven House Democrats that voted for HR 368, are Tweeting and saying that they want a clean CR and are supporting the discharge petition. But I’m not falling for it. These seven members willfully voted against democracy, and supported the GOP’s effort to create yet another manufactured crisis.

The seven back-stabbing, turncoat, worthless Democrats are:

Ron Barber AZ-2

John Barrow GA-12

Dan Maffei NY-24

Sean Patrick Maloney NY-18

Jim Matheson UT-4

Mike McIntyre NC-7

Collin Peterson MN-7

Here’s what some of these dishonest Reps. have been Tweeting:



These are examples back-stabbing Democrats who side with the Tea Party when they think we’re not watching, then want us honest Democrats to believe them in wanting the shutdown to end.

Words are not capable of expressing my outrage and pure contempt for these low-life, scumbag traitors in our party.

Thank you Chris Van Hollen for pulling back the curtain and exposing these truly worthless Democrats!

Here's Van Hollen's Floor action:

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is a busy place.

It has been examining the Internal Revenue Service, postal reform, border security and other high-profile issues.

Now Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) turns the committee’s attention to a series of federal employee-related bills that have fallen into the legislative hopper by flying far below the public’s radar.

Federal employee groups wish some of the measures would crash before takeoff.

On Wednesday, the committee is scheduled to vote on several pieces of legislation, including those that would prohibit employee bonuses for the rest of this fiscal year, allow agencies to place senior executives on “investigative leave without pay,” and facilitate the taping of employee telephone conversations by taxpayers.

With all the angst about government surveillance of telephone and other communications, Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) wants to turn the tables. “The Citizen Empowerment Act” would “require most federal agency employees to provide individuals with a verbal or written notice of the individual’s right to record a conversation before a meeting or telephone call,” according to a statement from her office.

The legislation, she said, would “give individuals a new tool to fight back, and allow citizens to protect themselves or their businesses when a government official comes calling.”

Fight back?

“The real intent of this legislation is to vilify federal employees and make us appear untrustworthy,” said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) wants to stop federal employee bonuses for the rest of this fiscal year and cap them at 5 percent of salary through fiscal 2015. “The federal government has no business handing out millions in bonuses to senior-level staff,” he said, while at the same time furloughing employees.

The National Treasury Employees Union opposes the bill, saying “performance awards . . . serve the important purpose of recognizing performance above established standards, and in that way, encourage and reward high-performing federal employees.”

Senior Executive Service members would be punished before being found guilty of misconduct under the Government Employee Accountability Act, introduced by Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.). The legislation, which passed the House last year, would allow agencies to place senior executives on “investigative leave without pay.”

The legislation, Kelly said, would “stop those under investigation from receiving salaries paid for by the very public whose trust they abused.” But if the situations are under investigation, then apparently it hasn’t been finally demonstrated that the employees abused the public’s trust.

“To the uninformed, Rep. Kelly’s bill sounds sensible, however, Senior Executives already serve at considerable risk since they have virtually no effective appeal rights,” said Carol A. Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association. The bill, she added, would create a “guilty until proven innocent” standard.

Bipartisan legislation offered by Texas Reps. Henry Cuellar (D) and Michael McCaul (R) seeks to improve federal government services through the establishment of government-wide standards to improve response times. The Office of Management and Budget would set the standards and the chief performance officer at each agency would be responsible for improving customer service.

“Too often we hear that Americans are frustrated with government service,” Cuellar said. “It is our responsibility to act when we hear that students are having difficulty with federal student loans or when seniors experience a delay in their retirement benefits. Every taxpayer every day will benefit from this legislation.”

Another bipartisan bill targets government waste by requiring Uncle Sam to produce more reports.

“The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act addresses federal government waste by requiring each federal agency to produce an annual report that identifies every program with a description of the program and its costs, expenditures for services, beneficiaries of services and number of staff,” said a statement from the office of Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who sponsored the bill with Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). “This information would be posted online with recommendations from each agency to improve efficiency.”

Issa’s bill to reform the long-ailing U.S. Postal Service also is on the agenda. It would do a number of things, including phasing out Saturday delivery of bills and letters, but continue six-day delivery of packages and medicine. The Postal Service would be allowed to forget about past-due payments to pre-fund retiree health-care benefits and the payments for this fiscal year and next would be eliminated.

Postal employees would pay more for health insurance benefits, and postal labor contracts would not be allowed to have no-layoff clauses.

“The legislation incorporates reforms offered by members of both sides of the aisle and builds upon months of bipartisan and bicameral discussions,” Issa said.

American Postal Workers Union President Cliff Guffey said Issa’s plan isn’t as bad as one previously advanced, but is still “deeply disturbing.” The union is urging its members to fight the bill by calling lawmakers.

“This bill would have a devastating effect on the Postal Service and on postal employees, as well as the American people,” said Gary Kloepfer, APWU legislative and political director. “We must do everything we can to stop it.”

This isn’t the only bill generating that response.

The network launched with an hour-long introduction to what it will be offering. The main message that the promo hammered home over and over again was that Americans were being denied the news they deserved on television.

Clips of Bill O'Reilly and Al Sharpton were played, and people in different towns were filmed talking about how underserved they felt.

""Americans want wider coverage and more real news,"" Richelle Carey, one of the anchors hosting the promo, told viewers.

The network also touted its 12 bureaus across the country and vowed to tell stories that weren't airing on its rival channels.

The problem for Al Jazeera America is that many millions of people don't have access to those stories.

Though the network is available in 40 million households, Al Jazeera America faces a distribution challenge. The network recently took its request directly to viewers, asking potential audience members to ask their cable providers for Al Jazzera America if they do not already provide it.

The network's highly anticipated debut was more than 8 months in the making. In January, former Vice President Al Gore and Joel Hyatt sold Current TV to Al Jazeera. The Doha-based news network said it would replace Current TV's programming and launch a new cable network called Al Jazeera America, which would be based in New York City.

The announcement was met with some hostility, as many criticized Gore for selling to a network backed by oil money. ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart described the deal as an ""odd move"" and grilled the former vice president on his decision to sell the network to a ""fossil-fuel-based buyer.""

Upon news of the sale, Time Warner Cable, which accounts for 12 million households, dropped the low-performing Current TV. Hyatt told staff in a memo that Time Warner Cable ""did not consent to the sale to Al Jazeera.""

Al Jazeera also has a well-known image issue with viewers who stubbornly associate it with anti-Americanism. The initial promo tried to address this head-on, playing clips of Hillary Clinton and John McCain praising Al Jazeera, and showing a man on the street who said, ""It's a business. They're entitled to set up a business.""

Originally set to launch in June, Al Jazeera America had to push its launch back a few months as it searched for New York office space, a news director and top talent. The network eventually hired hundreds of employees and plucked some top talent from competing cable news networks."
http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2013/09/stop-or-theyll-shoot-a-video.html,,[],"Change of Subject: Stop, or they'll shoot (a video)","The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. recently installed a stop-sign enforcement camera at an intersection near a northwest side school. It was billed as a test of a system that will eventually include 32 such cameras district wide.



That’s right, a stop-sign camera – a device calibrated to detect and photograph all vehicles that don’t come to a complete halt before proceeding, as the law requires, then generate a $50 ticket to be mailed to the owner.



It’s an obvious idea. The Chicago Department of Transportation was reportedly considering it in 2004 as an alternative to speed bumps, intersection islands and other “traffic calming” devices in neighborhoods.



Talk about fishing where the fish are. Virtually no one comes to a full stop --- where the wheels lock and your head bobs back slightly --- at signs when there are no pedestrians, cross traffic or police officers present.



People say they do. They may even think they do. But they don’t. I’ve watched carefully for years.

They slow down. They pump their brakes. They perform what’s variously known as the “Rhode Island roll” or the “California stop.” And they’re safely on their way.



Police could write literally 100 tickets an hour for this violation at an intersection near my house every morning as drivers cut through the neighborhood on their way to the Kennedy Expressway. A ticket-cam would be the equivalent of a currency printing machine.



And perhaps because treating a stop sign as though it were a yield sign is so common --- and generally such a minor safety concern --- Big Brother with his photo enforcement cameras has largely chosen to ignore it.

The first and, until the D.C. rollout began Aug. 20, the only stop-sign camera program in the U.S. has operated since 2007 in the Santa Monica Mountains outside of Los Angeles under the auspices of the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority.



Sensors in the pavement detect when a car is traveling faster than 7 miles per hour as it approaches one of seven marked intersections. This activates a video camera, the images from which are later reviewed by park rangers .



And no, despite the location, the half-hearted “California stop” won’t get you out of a $100 ticket (formerly $175). The Authority has to share proceeds from the fines with the company that maintains the equipment.



When the program begin, officials insisted it was “100 percent about safety,” not revenue. Commuters were driving recklessly when using park roads as cut-throughs, said spokeswoman Dash Stolarz. Stop-sign camera revenue has actually fallen in recent years as drivers have gotten wise to them and as commuters have started avoiding the area, Stolarz said.



Washington D.C. police spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump also stressed safety last week when she said stop-sign cameras are planned only for “locations in the District near schools where flagrant stop sign running is a significant issue.”



Safety concerns are also supposedly why Chicago has 190 intersections monitored by red-light enforcement cameras and will have 50 camera enforced speed-zones by the end of the year, though this claim tends to be the cause of many local coughing fits.



What’s next?



“We don’t have any plans to do stop-sign cameras,” said city spokesman Tom Alexander.



Not yet. But you can bet that officials in cities and suburbs all across America will be monitoring the D.C. experiment closely. How much money will it make? Will a drop in accident statistics justify its expansion? Will the citizens rise up in revolt or, in the end, shrug it off as yet another inevitability in the surveillance society?

Mr. Wilson is one of the sailors known as the Norfolk Four, and there is every reason to think he is innocent of the rape charge that sent him to prison for more than seven years. But the conviction stands, and that means he must register as a sex offender.

He wants to clear his name, and last week the Supreme Court indicated interest in his case. All Mr. Wilson asks for is a hearing on his challenge to his conviction. But lower courts have slammed the door on him, reasoning that it is too late to consider a petition for a writ of habeas corpus because he is no longer in custody.

Mr. Wilson is working as an electrician in Texas. He was composed and polite when we spoke on Friday evening, though he sounded weary of talking about his lot. He would rather, he said, get ready for the Easter weekend. He had family coming in.

But it takes time to tick off all the ways in which the effects of his conviction will linger for the rest of his life. There is the stigma, of course. He must report to the police in person every year, keep them posted about changes in his life and check in with local authorities if he travels."

(CNN) - One of the most restrictive abortion laws in the U.S. was temporarily blocked from enforcement after a federal judge said Monday that North Dakota's pre-viability provisions were ""invalid and unconstitutional.""

The state legislature had passed a law that would ban an abortion when a fetal heartbeat was detected–sometimes as early as six weeks into pregnancy. The legislation was set to go into effect August 1, but Judge Daniel Hovland granted a temporary injunction, after a Fargo women's clinic filed a lawsuit last month.



The judge noted that the law would ban 90% of abortions performed at Red River Women's Clinic, North Dakota's only clinic that performs abortions. While proponents say the law enhances medical safety for women in the state, opponents argue it makes it nearly impossible for women to have an abortion.

In his decision, the judge said ""there is no question"" that the law known as HB 1456 directly contradicts a ""litany"" of Supreme Court cases that address restraints on abortion, including Roe v. Wade.

""The State of North Dakota has presented no evidence to justify the passage of this troubling law,"" he wrote. ""The State has extended an invitation to an expensive court battle over a law restricting abortions that is a blatant violation of the constitutional guarantees afforded to all women.""

With the law, North Dakota would have had the strictest limit in the country. A number of states have passed abortion bans after 20 weeks, such as Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Indiana and Alabama. Arkansas has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 12 weeks.

Some states have no time limit, while others allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester, about 27 or 28 weeks into the pregnancy.

""I respect the attention Judge Hovland has given to this case,"" said North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem on Monday. ""It is also important to remember that courts routinely grant preliminary injunctions in these types of cases, so this was not unusual or unexpected. This is an early stage of the proceeding. As it is the constitutional duty of the Attorney General to defend legislation enacted by the North Dakota Legislature, we will continue to defend the challenged statutes through the established legal process.""

Abortion rights groups hailed the judge's order.

""The nation's most extreme abortion ban has been blocked, and the message to hostile politicians could not be clearer: the rights of women guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution and protected by 40 years of Supreme Court precedent cannot be legislated away,"" said Bebe Anderson of Center for Reproductive Rights, which helped bring the lawsuit. ""Today's decision ensures for the moment that the women of North Dakota won't need to worry whether they will still have the same constitutionally protected rights as women living in other parts of the United States.""

Sarah Stoesz, the president of the regional chapter of Planned Parenthood, wrote the ruling ""means that women throughout the state will have access to safe and legal abortion while the state continues to pursue its attack on women’s health in the courts.”

Proponents of the North Dakota bill anticipated the law would be challenged in the courts shortly after the legislation passed back in March.

When signing the bill, Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple acknowledged the law had a tough road ahead.

""Although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question, this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade,"" the governor said in a statement, directing the legislature to set aside funds to cover the cost of the expected legal battle.

The state now has the option of asking a federal appeals court in St. Louis to step in and allow the law to go into effect while the court challenges continue, a process that could take several months. An eventual appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is a possibility.

The law would have targeted doctors rather than women having an abortion, with a maximum punishment of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Doctors, if convicted, could also lose their license to practice medicine. Women who have the abortion may not be prosecuted.

While the law does not rule out abortions when a medical emergency threatens the life of a woman, it does not allow for an abortion in the case of rape or incest.

Abortion was legalized in all 50 states in 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. Statutory time limits on when abortions can take place, however, vary from state to state.

For the justices, Roe reflected earlier cases involving the right to privacy. That ""right,"" wrote Justice Harry Blackmun in the main opinion for the court, is ""broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.""

But the ruling was a qualified one, and that fact has been used by abortion opponents over the decades in their efforts to narrow the scope of other abortion provisions. Some activists have said they hope restrictions like those imposed by North Dakota would lead to a fundamental rethinking of access to abortion by the Supreme Court in coming years.

The ""qualified right"" established by the high court found its form in the controversial ""trimester analysis"" laid out by the justices in Roe: permitting no government regulation during the first three months of a pregnancy; allowing limited regulation in the second trimester to protect the woman's health and safety; and granting government the power to ban abortions during the third trimester - a time when, medical consensus has concluded, the fetus is capable of living on its own.

USA TODAY

President Obama says immigration plan can be split up if that will help it pass

Obama faced protesters over deportations

The Senate has passed an immigration bill%3B the Republican-run House has not

While urging House Republicans to back new immigration legislation, President Obama said Monday he is willing to split a bill into pieces if that will get it passed.

""That's okay,"" Obama said during a speech in San Francisco. ""It's Thanksgiving. We can carve that bird into multiple pieces — a drumstick here, breast meat there.""

But Obama also said a final package must include certain elements, including a proposed pathway to citizenship that has drawn opposition from Republicans.

Said Obama: ""As long as all the pieces get done, soon, and we actually deliver on the core values we have been talking about for so long, I think everybody is fine with it.""

Obama caught flak during his speech as protesters yelled at him over the number of deportations during his time in office.

""Stop deportations! Stop deportations!"" protesters chanted.

The president said he is bound by the law. When someone yelled he had the ""power"" to stop deportations, Obama replied, ""Actually, I don't. And that's why we're here.""

Obama told the protesters that it's ""easy"" to shout about problems, but he is seeking a harder path designed ""to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting.""

The Democratic-led Senate passed an immigration bill earlier this year; the Republican-run House has not taken action on the issue.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said Republicans want to take a ""step-by-step"" approach to immigration challenges.

""The American people are skeptical of big, comprehensive bills, and frankly, they should be,"" Boehner said last week. ""The only way to make sure immigration reform works this time is to address these complicated issues one step at a time.""

Obama, who has offered the piecemeal approach before, said a final immigration package should include strengthened border security, punishment for businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers, and a modernization of the immigration system.

He also advocated ""a pathway to earned citizenship"" for people who are already in the country illegally, a sticking point in past immigration debates in Congress.

Many Republicans oppose a pathway to citizenship, likening it to amnesty to lawbreakers,

Neither Obama nor Boehner have specified what pieces of an incremental immigration plan might look like.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who opposed the immigration bill in the Senate, said the issue surfaces at a time of high unemployment and flat wages.

""The president must be asked — by media and lawmakers alike -- how he can possibly justify a plan that will double the flow of immigrant workers at a time when 91.5 million Americans are outside the labor force?"" Sessions said.

During his speech, Obama said immigration is not just a problem along the U.S.-Mexican border, saying, ""We're blessed with immigrants from all over the world.""

Obama spoke at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center in San Francisco, part of a three-day trip focused mainly on campaign fundraising. (Ong was a flight attendant who died on 9/11.)

Many people study in the United States, then take their skills back to their home countries, Obama said, adding, ""We're training our own competition.""

He pointed out that many Republicans, including predecessor George W. Bush, support immigration changes. The president didn't mention it, but many Republicans cite a decline in Hispanic support for the GOP as a major election problem."

They hire competent managers for their units, set goals and establish clear metrics for evaluating performance. As in politics, competition in business is tough, and CEOs must set ethical boundaries for their managers’ conduct.



In all this, the CEO’s personal conduct is critical.



Early in his presidency, Mr. Obama flaunted American constitutional tradition by pushing through major social legislation, ObamaCare, without a bipartisan compromise and consensus. And he relied on a legislative sleight of hand to pass the Senate.

[pullquote]

Simply, Mr. Obama’s hard left agenda requires him to treat the Constitution and Congress as mere inconveniences – expediency is his ethical standard.



For example, unable to obtain Congressional ascent, even among moderate Democrats, for limits on CO2 emissions and other environmental goals, the EPA – at his public behest – has written regulations imposing new and onerous requirements on business.

The Obama Credo of Management: We’ll do as we please, stop us if you can.

His failure as a CEO, now with grave political consequences, was to impose no limits on managers’ behavior and implement adequate controls – mechanisms for the CEO to monitor the performance of units and head off emerging threats to the survival of the organization. Regarding the latter, of paramount importance is to insulate the president from any fallout from their actions.

More On This... Obama scandals lay bare very real dangers of big government

Cabinet secretaries and agency heads took their cues from the boss – at State, Justice and the IRS senior management would have had us believe they were unaware of what was happening in Benghazi, with the Associated Press, or at the Cincinnati Office of the IRS. And the president only learns about many problems when reported in the news?

Mr. Obama simply has been too busy giving speeches, raising money, and trying to turn every event to political advantage to keep tabs on his managers, as any good CEOs would do.

CEOs periodically meet with their principal managers – in groups and where necessary individually – to probe their tactics, offer assistance from their own wealth of experience, and discern areas where managers may be planting problems that will burgeon into crisis.

Failing at this, the president has managed to continence management failures that cost the lives of Americans abroad, weaken our national security, rock public confidence in government, and threaten our constitutionally guaranteed liberties.

Mr. Obama has a lot in common with one predecessor, Jimmy Carter – both failed as CEOs. The man from Plains is a decent and ethical man but micromanaged too much, whereas Mr. Obama acquired his moral compass in the Windy City and simply can’t manage at all.

Americans should not be surprised. Mr. Obama came to Washington with profound campaign skills but virtually no record as a legislator or manager. He spent seven years in the Illinois Senate as a virtual non-participant, bored and seeking higher office, and his four years in the U.S. Senate running for president.

Americans turned to him, because they were justifiably disappointed with President Bush and tagged John McCain with the blame.

Prior to his presidency, Americans never observed Mr. Obama running anything, other than a campaign. He had not been a governor or a congressional committee chair. In military terms, we made him a five star general before even serving as a lieutenant.

By his own actions, he is arrogantly ambitions but sadly incompetent. He has corrupted the foundations of our Republic, and for that he gets a failing grade."

Synopsis: The bowl season gets off to its traditional start in the Land of Enchantment. The Rams should be familiar with the environs, having beaten usual tenant New Mexico on the same field Nov. 16. The Cougars, in their first bowl game since 2003, figure to provide CSU more of a challenge. WSU's up-and-down season has hinged on the play of QB Connor Halliday, who has amassed a lofty 4,187 yards in the Mike Leach offense with 28 TDs but 21INTs. If his throws go as intended, WRs Gabe Marks, Vince Mayle and Dom Williams will be the beneficiaries. But if he is bothered, it will likely be because of Rams LB Shaquil Barrett, the Mountain West defensive player of the year who recorded 12 sacks and 201/2 total tackles for loss. The CSU offense is more balanced, though it generally operates through TB Kapri Bibbs. He has rushed for 1,572 yards and 28 TDs. QB Garrett Grayson is capable of lending aerial support, but he'll have to watch out for Cougars S Deone Bucannon."

Both President Obama and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) are proposing “paths to citizenship” for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. Other proposals abound, including finishing the border fence, creating a better E-Verify system for employers and passing the last Congress’ Dream Act.

All of these ideas, however, fundamentally misunderstand immigration in America: Future immigration is probably going to be governed not by U.S. domestic policy choices but by global demographics.

For the last 30 years, a massive number of immigrants has poured into the U.S. from south of the border. Today there are 38 million people living in the United States who were born somewhere else. That’s an average of more than 1 million immigrants a year for three decades, a sustained influx unlike any we’ve seen before in U.S. history. And regardless of what policies Washington decides on, that supply is likely to dry up soon.

Like much else in the world, immigration is influenced by the fertility rate: that is, the number of children the average woman has during her lifetime. If the total fertility rate of a country is above 2.1 — what demographers called the replacement level — then that country’s population grows. If the rate is below 2.1, then eventually its population contracts.

When it comes to immigration, demographers have a general rule of thumb: Countries with fertility rates below the replacement level tend to attract immigrants, not send them. And so, when a country’s fertility rate collapses, it often ceases to be a source of immigration.

Consider Puerto Rico. In the 1920s, Puerto Ricans began to trickle into the United States. Their numbers accumulated slowly, and by 1930, there were 50,000 Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. (nearly all in New York City). Over time, however, the community reached a critical mass, and by the mid-1940s, 30,000 Puerto Ricans were arriving every year. The Puerto Rican wave continued, and grew. In 1955, 80,000 Puerto Ricans came to the United States.

Advertisement

But from 1955 to 2010, the number plummeted. Even though the population of Puerto Rico had nearly doubled in that time, the total number of Puerto Ricans moving to the United States in 2010 was only 4,283.

Why? After all, migrating to the United States from Puerto Rico had become easier, not harder. And while economic conditions in Puerto Rico brightened somewhat, the opportunities and standard of living in the U.S. are still superior.

Advertisement

What happened is that Puerto Rico’s fertility rate imploded. In 1955, Puerto Rico’s total fertility rate was 4.97, well above replacement. By 2012, it had fallen to 1.64 — even further below the replacement line than the United States’.

And what has happened in Puerto Rico is happening all across Latin America, where fertility rates have been dropping on an express elevator for 20 years.

Advertisement

Many Latin American countries have already fallen below the replacement level. It’s not a coincidence that sub-replacement countries — such as Uruguay, Chile, Brazil and Costa Rica — send the U.S. barely any immigrants at all. The vast majority of our immigrants come from above-replacement countries, such as Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico.

But even though they’re still above-replacement, those countries are witnessing epic fertility declines too.

Advertisement

Consider Mexico, which over the last 30 years has sent roughly two-thirds of all the immigrants — legal and illegal — who came to the United States. In 1970, the Mexican fertility rate was 6.72. Today, it’s hovering at the 2.1 mark — a drop of nearly 70% in just two generations. And it’s still falling.

The result is that from 2005 to 2010, the U.S. received a net of zero immigrants from Mexico.

Advertisement

Certainly some of that change can be attributed to the Great Recession, particularly the slowdown in construction and the housing industry. But we may also be witnessing the beginning of a structural change in our immigration relationship, as Mexico’s demographic profile comes to resemble Puerto Rico’s.

It’s important to understand that Mexico’s experience is not unique but rather is part of a global phenomenon. Today, 97% of the world’s population lives in countries where the fertility rate is falling. And once a country’s fertility rate starts dropping, it nearly always settles far below the replacement level. And because of this, most demographic models project that the world’s population will peak sometime before the end of this century, and then begin contracting — for the first time since the Black Death ravaged Europe.

The U.S. immigration debate is largely driven by politics. And the truth is that both liberals and conservatives have valid concerns about immigration’s effect. But this political debate is shortsighted, and whatever policy choices we make will probably only matter in the near term. In the end, demography always wins.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court critical of patents on human genes,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court justices said Monday they were highly skeptical of the idea that a company or a scientist can hold a patent on human genes and prevent others from testing or using them.

“What about the first person who found a liver?” asked Justice Elena Kagan.

She was agreeing with other justices who said patents should not be given for “products of nature,” whether they are plant leaves that cure a disease or tiny parts of the human body.

Justice Stephen Breyer said patent law involves an “uneasy compromise” because it seeks to advance science and innovation by giving an inventor a temporary monopoly to profit from an advance.

If inventors devise a new use for a substance, they can patent this use, he said. But they cannot patent the underlying substance, he added. “It’s important to keep products of nature free” for use by all, he said.

During the argument Monday, most of the justices questioned the decision of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to grant Myriad Genetics a patent on two isolated gene sequences that signal a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said Myriad had simply “snipped” part of the gene sequence. It did not invent a new product, but simply found a way to isolate part of the human DNA, he said.

Advertisement

Because of Myriad’s patents, the Utah company has been able to profit from testing women who are concerned about their inherited risk of the two cancers.

Four years ago, breast cancer patients and medical researchers sued to challenge Myriad’s patents, arguing that human genes themselves could not be subject to patent protection.

These patents “cover the genes of every man, woman and child,” Christoper Hansen of the American Civil Liberties Union told the court. It “can’t be right,” he said, that a private company can hold monopoly control over genes from the human body.

A lawyer from Myriad argued that the company had devoted years of research to isolating the human genes and the mutations that are correlated with a high risk of cancer. “It would be dangerous,” he said, for the court to backtrack and to deny patents to innovators who make scientific advances using natural products.

Advertisement

But the justices did not sound convinced. “I don’t see how this is different from snipping,” Roberts said. If snipping the leaf of a medicinal plant could not be patented, snipping a gene sequence is not enough to obtain a patent either, he said.

This case of patients versus patents has drawn extraordinary interest because of its potential to reshape the law on biotechnology and personalized medicine.

Advertisement

For more than 30 years, the U.S. patent office has been granting patents to those who isolate living cells and make new uses of them, whether they are bacteria, plant seeds or human cells.

The biotech industry says these patents have spurred advances in medicine and agriculture. About half of the drugs in modern use and most anti-cancer drugs are derived from natural organisms, they say.

Advertisement

But the Supreme Court has grown increasing skeptical of patents and the apparent willingness of the U.S. patent office to grant inventors and innovators a 20-year monopoly over the use of formulas and processes.

Last year, the high court unanimously rejected a patent for a personalized medicine dosing formula that was held by Prometheus Labs. The justices said this formula, which relied on a blood test to guide doctors on the proper dose of a drug that treats auto-immune disorders, rested on a “law of nature” and therefore, could not be patented.

Advertisement

“Einstein could not patent his celebrated law that E=mc2, nor could Newton have patented the law of gravity,” said Justice Stephen Breyer. “Such discoveries are ‘manifestations of ... nature, free to all men and reserved exclusively to none’,” he added, quoting from a 1948 opinion.

The justices then issued a one-line order telling a federal patent court to take another look at the gene patents held by Myriad Genetics, the company based in Salt Lake City.

Advertisement

In 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union and Public Patent Foundation had sued on behalf of the cancer patients and medical professionals to challenge the validity of Myriad’s gene patents. They argued that giving one company a monopoly over a distinctive gene sequence resulted in patients paying too much for testing, and it prevented them from getting a second opinion from other medical experts.

But they lost in the federal circuit court that oversees patent appeals. It upheld Myriad’s patents in 2011, and it did so again last year, despite the warning from the high court. The patent judges held that the isolating of the particular gene mutation that signals a risk of cancer was a “new and useful” invention that can be patented.

Even though Myriad’s patents are due to expire within two years, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the ACLU’s contention that genes cannot be patented.

A decision in the case of Assn. for Molecular Pathology vs. Myriad Genetics can be expected by the end of June.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/philosophical/selfdefence.shtml,,[],Abortion: Abortion in self-defence,"Abortion in self-defence

Even if we accept that the foetus is a person with a right to live, this doesn't mean that all abortions are wrong.

In some circumstances it may be ethical for a mother to have an abortion to defend herself from the danger to her mental or physical health that continuing with the pregnancy would cause.

Where continuing the pregnancy threatens the mother's life or health

If continuing with the pregnancy would cause the mother's death, even those most strongly against abortion accept that this is a case where abortion is ethically acceptable.

(NB: some people argue that this is a case of the doctrine of double effect rather than a self-defence argument, and that the death of the foetus is merely the side-effect of medical treatment to save the mother's life.)

It is generally accepted that a person has the right to defend themselves when they are in danger, and that they may use violence, or even kill in extreme circumstances, in order to protect themselves from physical attack.

This can apply even when the person causing the danger is entirely innocent of any bad intent, completely unaware that they are causing a danger, or is in some other way not responsible for being a danger.

Thus if a foetus (entirely innocently) endangers the life of a mother, it's argued that the mother has the right to abort it.

A person may also have the right to kill when threatened with severe harm but not actual death (e.g. a pregnancy that would permanently damage the mother but not kill her).

And a person may get someone else to take the necessary action to protect them (e.g. the doctor who performs the abortion).

There are a couple of objections to note:

in most cases the mother has brought the danger on herself by becoming pregnant - should this change the moral argument? in practical terms it won't, because if the pregnancy kills the mother it will probably kill the foetus too the mother could argue that she only consented to becoming pregnant, and did not willingly consent to having a defective and life-threatening pregnancy

unlike most cases of self-defence, the foetus isn't actually doing anything that threatens the mother - does this make a difference?

Non-physical threats to the mother

But supposing the mother is not in physical danger, what then?

There are a number of cases where some people argue that a woman should have the right to an abortion, such as:

damage to mental health

damage to family

damage to career prospects

damage to financial prospects

damage to plans for her life

The self-defence argument for abortion seems to fail here, because although a threat to life can be a defence to a charge of killing someone, none of the above would be an adequate defence in a case of homicide, nor would they be regarded as reasons that justified euthanasia.

But if we don't regard the foetus as a person with a right to live, or if we regard it as a being that doesn't have a full right to life, then these cases of self-defence may be arguable."

Bill now awaits House approval

The state has 16 licensed abortion clinics

Texas and other states are trying to implement new abortion limits

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The North Carolina Senate gave its final approval Wednesday to legislation adding new restrictions for abortions in North Carolina, even as hundreds of angry protesters descended on the legislature to express their displeasure.

The Senate voted 29-12 for the measure that would direct state health regulators to change abortion clinic rules so they're similar to those for ambulatory surgery centers.

More than 500 opponents of the legislation — mostly women and many wearing pink — organized quickly to gather at the Legislative Building after Senate GOP leaders late Tuesday added several abortion-related provisions to an unrelated bill and won quick approval in a committee and in an initial Senate vote.

Even Republican Gov. Pat McCrory criticized the rushed legislative process in a statement Wednesday but was silent on the contents of the bill, which would still need House approval again before it goes to his desk. The General Assembly won't take up legislation again until early next week.

""Regardless of what party is in charge or what important issue is being discussed, the process must be appropriate and thorough,"" McCrory, who was elected last year, said. When McCrory was asked last fall during a debate which additional abortion restrictions he would agree to sign into law, he responded, ""None.""

More than 100 protesters in the atrium outside the full gallery above the Senate floor chanted ""Shame!"" after Wednesday's vote. One woman was arrested by General Assembly police after yelling ""Shame on you!"" before the daily session ended. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who presided over the nearly two-hour debate, warned the crowd several times about their debate outbursts before clearing the gallery before adjournment.

The bill, which received initial approval Tuesday night, could force abortion clinics to close and would effectively limit the rights of women to obtain an abortion in the state, according to its opponents. There are 16 licensed abortion clinics in the state but only one ambulatory surgical center that performs the procedure, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

""If they can restrict access to abortion, they can officially take away that right and it's really distressing,"" said Maria Lynn of Chapel Hill, a former nurse and one of the protesters.

The updated bill also would prohibit gender-selective abortions, restrict abortion insurance coverage and require a physician to be physically present during an entire surgical abortion and when a woman takes an abortion-inducing drug such as RU-486.

Social conservatives pushed the bill, and backers say it would make abortion procedures safer for women in the light of recent problems with some clinics, bringing them in line with other medical facilities.

Sen. Warren Daniel, R-Burke, who is shepherding the bill through the Senate, referred to the abortion doctor in Philadelphia convicted recently of killing live babies at a clinic that prosecutors labeled ""a house of horrors"" in pushing the bill. Another senator read a newspaper story about a Charlotte clinic that was forced to close briefly this spring after state officials determined staffers were improperly administering a drug to induce abortions.

The legislation comes as Republican-led legislatures in North Carolina and several other states — including Ohio and Texas — work to place new restrictions on abortion, in some cases effectively limiting their availability. The North Carolina General Assembly passed abortion restrictions in 2011, but some were struck down by a federal court.

Sen. Angela Bryant, D-Nash, equated the bill with ""enslavement and domination of me and my body and my uterus ... and my human and constitutional rights to health care."" But Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, said this bill does not attempt to overturn the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.

""We have an obligation to protect the health of the people — the women — that go to these clinics,"" Berger said. ""Anyone who is interested in having safe abortions in North Carolina has nothing to fear from this bill.""

The swift Senate action on the bill further energized abortions rights groups, many of which already have participated in weekly protests at the Legislative Building against Republican policies on health care, voting rights and other matters. The GOP took control of the legislature after the 2010 elections. Those protests, which have led to nearly 700 arrests, are expected to resume Monday with a focus on the abortion bill.

The Senate leadership knew ""they couldn't pass these sweeping restrictions by playing by the rules. It is shameful that they chose to stoop to these underhanded tactics,"" said Melissa Reed of Planned Parenthood Health Systems, which runs clinics that provide reproductive health care services, including abortions.

Senate Rules Chairman Tom Apodaca, R-Henderson, said Democrats had rammed their own legislation through the chamber for years, and more debate wouldn't have changed the outcome. But McCrory said in his statement the legislative procedure ""was not right then and it is not right now.""

Lalitree Darnielle of Durham, who stood outside the Senate gallery with 22-month-old son Roman in his stroller, came Wednesday because she said the public should have had more advance notice. ""For them to sneak something like this into a vote without public input is disingenuous,"" she said.

Abortion opponents praised the bill. ""We think it's a great victory for the unborn and for women,"" said Tami Fitzgerald with the North Carolina Values Coalition. ""Abortion clinics in North Carolina have problems ... this bill fixes some of those problems.""

As for whether the bill becoming law, Fitzgerald said she and allies ""would expect the governor to sign the bill.""

The bill may be tricky for House Speaker Thom Tillis, R-Mecklenburg, who is running for Democratic U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan's seat in 2014; his spokesman said he had no comment on the legislation Wednesday. The issue could become an issue in any primary race he has.

Hagan criticized the state Senate's move as ""shameful."" If legislative ""leaders think they can pull a fast one on women's health right before a holiday, they are wrong,"" Hagan tweeted. ""Women are watching.""

The bill also contains provisions that already passed the House. Those would outlaw or limit abortion-related services from health insurance plans offered through exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act or by cities and counties. Conscientious refusals to participate in an abortion would be expanded beyond doctors and nurses to any medical professional."

Columbus, Ohio (CNN) - President Obama told graduates Sunday that ""the institutions that give structure to our society have at times betrayed your trust"" but called on young people to take a more active role in the political process as part of the solution.

Obama delivered his first commencement address of the spring to nearly 10,000 graduates at The Ohio State University in Columbus. He urged students to reject the ""voices"" that ""incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that's the root of our all our problems, even as they do their best to gum up the works.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

On the stage in Ohio Stadium, Obama told the crowd that ""your democracy does not function without your active participation. At a bare minimum, that means voting, eagerly and often. It means knowing who's been elected to make decisions on your behalf, what they believe in and whether or not they deliver.""

His comments came exactly one year after Obama went to the heart of the key battleground state of Ohio to officially kick off his re-election campaign with a rally at The Ohio State University.

On Sunday he called for voters to hold officials accountable, saying, ""if they let you down, there's a built-in day in November where you can really let them know that's not OK.""

""I'm not going to get partisan, because that's not what citizenship is about,"" the president said. And he invoked the words President George W. Bush used in a graduation address in the same stadium, saying, ""America needs more than taxpayers, spectators and occasional voters. America needs full-time citizens.""

But Obama seemed to refer to the congressional defeat of stronger background checks for gun buyers and other parts of his domestic agenda when he told the graduates, ""when we abdicate that authority, we grant our silent consent to someone who'll gladly claim it. That's how we end up with lobbyists who set the agenda, policies detached from what middle-class families face every day, the well-connected who publicly demand that Washington stay out of their business, then whisper in its ear for special treatment that you don't get. That's how a small minority of lawmakers get cover to defeat something the vast majority of their constituents want.""

The president's remarks came as the administration vowed that the defeat of the background check measure was not the end of the fight. Obama spoke out on the gun issue on his trip to Mexico City last week, and Vice President Joe Biden wrote a Sunday opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle as the National Rifle Association met there.

Obama called on graduates on ""harness the ingenuity of your generation"" to tackle issues like gun violence, climate change, road and airport repairs and education. ""We can always aspire to something more. That doesn't depend on who you elect to office. It depends upon you as citizens, how big you want to be, and how badly you want it.

""I dare you to do better"", he added, ""I dare you to be better. From what I have seen of your generation, I have no doubt you will"".

In his Ohio State speech, Obama said he's been ""obsessed"" with the idea of keeping citizenship alive at the national level, ""not just on Election Day or in times of tragedy,"" because he spends most of his time in Washington, ""a place that sorely needs it.""

He told the students ""you don't have to run for office yourself,"" later saying, ""only you can ultimately break the cycle.""

In lighter moments during the commencement, Obama donned a black hat with an Ohio State O on it. He joked about speaking at archrival University of Michigan graduation in 2010, referring to a ""certain university up north.""

To laughs, he said he had been to OSU's campus five times recently and added, ""to be fair, you did let President Ford speak here once, and he played football for Michigan.""

Obama teased students about eating breakfast so late, at 11:30 a.m. when he dropped by a campus eatery during one stop. But he mispronounced the name of Sloopy's, named for the song that's an OSU tradition. He asked for forgiveness, noting that it's a Sunday after a foreign trip. He returned from Costa Rica on Saturday evening."

Abouhalkah, a columnist and member of the editorial board of the Kansas City Star, has been the one to first post on this. Here is his latest.

Abouhalkah notes that the state of Missouri contributes $400,000 to the fair.

There have been condemnations from the political spectrum:



• Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a Republican, tweeted: “I love the MoStateFair and will attend this week. I implore GovJayNixon to hold the people responsible for the other night accountable.” • Also from Kinder: “The MoStateFair celebrates Missouri and our people. I condemn the actions disrespectful to POTUS the other night. We are better than this.” • Democratic Rep. Jeremy LaFaver of Kansas City tweeted: “I will no longer be attending MOStateFair events with family.” • Republican Rep. Caleb Rowden of Columbia tweeted, “I don’t agree w/this Prez on many things. But he is deserving of respect and shouldn’t be the object of political stunts. Out of line!”

The performance by one of the rodeo clowns at Saturday’s event was inappropriate and disrespectful, and does not reflect the opinions or standards of the Missouri State Fair. We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday’s rodeo badly missed that mark.

The Missouri Fair Association blames the clown. In the Abouhalkah piece is the Fair Association's statement:Of course, the clown did not do any of the announcing. Perry Beam also has some film. Listen to the announcer.

The problem is with the Fair Association for not doing its due diligence and the company that organized this stunt. The company that organized this rodeo is doing a rodeo in my county next month.

Oh, and one more thing. The announcer is the superintendent of schools in Booneville, Missouri.

It would also vindicate the Republican Party’s (often notional) commitment to offering incremental alternatives to bloated liberal bills.

But such incrementalism would punt on the question of how to handle the bulk of the existing illegal-immigrant population, and thus wouldn’t be anything like the game changer sought by many Republican strategists worried about the Hispanic vote. And politically, it would have been much more clever months ago, before the Senate bill raised expectations for how sweeping a reform should be. In the shadow of Rubio-Schumer, a House that passed incremental bills and then refused to negotiate its way to something bigger might well receive the same kind of “do nothing” coverage as a House that did nothing at all.

Hence the (quiet, for now) appeal of the second option, mentioned last week by The Washington Post’s Ezra Klein and The Huffington Post’s Jon Ward, in which the House would find a way to go along with a version of amnesty that either didn’t include the promise of citizenship or made the path so long and arduous that few immigrants would take it.

To its supporters, this combination would deliver illegal immigrants the security and stability that pro-legalization activists are seeking, without running afoul of either the principled Republican desire to avoid rewarding people who have broken America’s laws, or the more cynical Republican desire not to have the newly legalized showing up to vote for Democrats.

But it, too, would come at a cost. We’re living through an era of stratification, a period of mass unemployment, an economic “recovery” in which working-class wages aren’t actually recovering. This is a strange climate in which to create — and then augment, via guest-worker programs — a permanent tier of explicitly second-class, mostly low-skilled residents, deliberately curtail their political leverage and then ask low-wage native workers to compete with them for jobs.

And it’s a particularly strange climate for a Republican Party struggling to shed its “party of the rich” label to identify with such a policy, and give up one of the few issues where it has some credibility with working-class voters.

The party faces risks whatever it does: killing comprehensive reform might further alienate Hispanics, as the conventional wisdom has it, but then again going along with Charles Schumer and a flood of corporate money might exacerbate the kind of “who’s looking out for me?” disaffection that kept many conservative-tilting, economically strapped voters from the polls in 2012.

But a clever-sounding deal that legalizes immigrants as laborers but not as citizens risks disaster on both fronts: rejection by Hispanics as insufficient and ultimately insulting, and rejection by many of America’s tired, poor, huddled workers as another example of the political class’s indifference to their fate."

Jeff Sessions (R-AL) told Boston’s conservative radio host Howie Carr on Wednesday that the political momentum is starting to turn against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.

When Carr asked the senator if this process behind the push for this bill is the “same thing as Obamacare” where “we have to pass it so we can read it,” Sessions replied: “Absolutely, it really is.”

“That is exactly what it is,” Sessions said. “They’re selling the sizzle. They’re selling the smell. And it’s a shoe leather instead of a steak.”

Carr said that though everyone can agree that the immigration system is “broken,” Americans should not support the Gang of Eight bill because it would make the system “worse.” Instead, Carr argued people should support a yet-to-be-introduced solution that actually solves the problems at hand and this issue does not need to be an all-or-nothing deal with the Gang of Eight bill.

“That is exactly correct,” Sessions responded. “And Professor [George] Borjas at Harvard, the leading expert on immigration and labor, has made so clear in his work that basically what he concludes is any benefit to this economy is at the expense of lower income workers’ salaries going down.”

When Carr asked if Gang of Eight supporters had the votes to pass the bill in the House or Senate, Sessions said that they are claiming they have it in the Senate. “But I think the tide is beginning to turn,” Sessions said. “A lot of people, like myself, I thought the bill was better than it is based on what I hear the proponents say. But as we examine it, we realize that this is going to be a disaster. It’s going to be a disaster for enforcement, it’s going to be a disaster for our budget, it’s going to be a disaster for the wages of American workers, it’s going to add to our financial deficit, Social Security and Medicare are going to be impacted over the long term by trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities and these numbers are not going to be disputed if we go forward.”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a Gang of Eight member, recently said the bill could not pass the House as is, a sign it is in serious trouble. On Sean Hannity’s radio program on Wednesday, Rubio said the bill “quite frankly, may struggle to pass the Senate” because it does not effectively enforce border security as originally promised.

On the recently discovered loopholes in the Gang of Eight bill that would allow illegal immigrants access to welfare benefits for illegal immigrants, Sessions said “of the 11 million people here today illegally, over half do not have a high school diploma. And statistics and careful analysis shows a huge percentage will qualify for all kinds of these government programs. We’ve also discovered, Howie, that the people that are coming legally, about two-tenths of one percent, virtually nobody, is being rejected based on the requirement that you should not be a public charge. In other words, we’re not even enforcing that requirement and it’s certainly not going to be enforced with regard to those that will be given amnesty.”

“Any smart nation would say ‘we want immigrants, but if you’re not able to take care of yourself, if you’re going to come in and be dependent on welfare, you don’t get admitted,'” Sessions added.

The welfare loopholes allowing illegal immigrants access to public benefits is a major stumbling block for the Gang of Eight.

Rubio is even now joining his Gang of Eight colleague Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in acknowledging that their bill contains a massive loophole that will allow illegal immigrants access to state and local benefits. “I think what he’s talking about is state and local benefits, and I would just say that yeah, if a city or a county or a state legislature decides to give benefits to illegal immigrants or someone who was previously illegally in the country, you know, they have a constitutional right to do that,” Rubio told Hannity on Wednesday in response to Sessions’ criticisms. “I would disagree with that position, and people should take it up with their state legislator or their governor or their county commissioner or what have you.”"

He hasn’t discussed that subject with the president. He will refer you to the Department of [insert agency here]. He refuses to speculate on that. He’ll have to get back to you.

But he appreciates the question.

A Yahoo News analysis of the 444 briefings through June 18 that Carney has held since becoming White House press secretary has identified 13 distinct strains in the way he dodges reporters' question. Since Carney held his first daily briefing with reporters in the White House Brady Press Briefing Room on Feb. 16, 2011, for example, he’s used some variation of ""I don’t have the answer"" more than 1,900 times. In 1,383 cases he referred a question to someone else. But will he at least speculate on hypotheticals? No. In fact, he has refused to do so 525 times.

In the following interactive, you can browse all 9,486 of Carney’s most-used responses and verbal crutches.

The main function of a White House press secretary is to shape messaging for the administration, which often requires stymieing questions as a form of damage control.

Reporters got several doses of that at Friday's briefing, including a rather repetitive back-and-forth over what kind of aid (arms? weapons? U.S. troops?) America is sending to Syrian rebels. ""We have stepped up our assistance, but I cannot inventory for you the elements of that assistance. And as the president said, I cannot and will not get into some specifics about the assistance that we provide,"" Carney said.

When pressed further? ""We can't comment on specifics around our program.""

And further? ""I'm simply saying that given the nature of the assistance that we provide, the way in which we implement our assistance ... I can't give you an itemized list or be specific about every single aspect,"" he said. ""I think I've given the answer that I can give.""

Reporters also heard many ""as you know's,"" some ""I'm not going to's"" and several referrals.

Story continues

The referral to another agency or person is one of Carney's favorite evasive maneuvers. During the 43-minute briefing on Jan. 25 alone, for example, Carney referred reporters to the Justice Department four times, the National Labor Relations Board twice, the State Department twice, once to the historic precedent of recess appointments, once to a New York Times article, once to a speech that President Barack Obama delivered earlier in the week, and once to the Defense Department.

As should be abundantly clear, Carney doesn't have all the answers. As he recently reminded the gathered reporters at his briefing, he and his team are mere mortals battling an army of professionals bent on stumping him.

""We have a team here that works really hard trying to anticipate the questions you're going to ask. The problem is, there's a lot of you and you're good at your jobs and you're smart. And we almost invariably do not anticipate every question that you ask. So sometimes we don’t have the answers, and sometimes we need to go back and get them,"" Carney said during the May 22 briefing.

That was a rare moment of effusive praise for the press. It followed what had been a rough series of briefings for Carney amid controversy over the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, the Internal Revenue Service scandal and the Justice Department's secret seizure of journalists' phone records.

Those stories put Carney in a tougher-than-usual spot to speak for Obama and the White House, share information and shape the president's message, all without creating new controversy as he stood behind the podium.

More often than not, the imperative to do no harm prompts a total nonanswer from Carney. This results in the ""I have no personnel announcements"" for you today, referrals to other individuals and other gems that the press readily anticipates and often mocks.

Carney's recent predilection for saying ""I appreciate the question,"" upon hearing a question he very likely did not appreciate, even prompted Politico to release a video montage May 14 of all those responses.

With good humor, Carney acknowledged it the next day.

""You know it’s a personal question, but a great question,"" Carney told CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller, who asked whether Carney personally dreaded the briefings amid the controversies. ""Do you appreciate it?"" Knoller added, prompting laughter in the room.

""You beat me to my punch line,"" Carney said.

So it wasn’t a hoax after all?

Organizers of the “Truckers Ride for the Constitution” rally say they are indeed coming to Washington on Friday — but whether they will shut down the Beltway or just make a lot of noise remains to be seen.

Zeeda Andrews, one of the organizers of the event, said the ride is a go but emphasized that it will be peaceful. She said that Georgia trucker Earl Conlon “overstepped his boundaries” earlier this week in saying the event was just a ploy to get attention for the group’s agenda.

“Yes, it is happening,” she said about the rally. Andrews said she expects “a few thousand truckers” to descend on the District on Friday.



State police officials in the region said they will be prepared either way.

“Virginia State Police is aware of the proposed convoy of commercial vehicles and is preparing accordingly with the region’s law enforcement agencies and the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), just as we have done in the past for similar demonstrations held within the National Capital Region,’’ said spokeswoman Corinne N. Geller in an e-mail statement.

Geller said additional troopers will be deployed Friday and through the weekend in case any incidents or problems tied to the rally occur. But as long as no one breaks the law, the truckers will be allowed to proceed with their activities — just as other groups have in the past. She said the additional staffing is to ensure that traffic continues to move safely through the region.

Sgt. Marc Black of the Maryland State Police said that the agency does not plan to add additional patrols, but that authorities will be watching the highways to ensure no traffic issues occur. Pennsylvania State Police will be doing the same, a spokesman said.

Andrews said truckers plan to meet in two spots Friday morning before convoying into Washington: at Exit 98 off Interstate 95 in Doswell, which is north of Richmond, and at Exit 77 off Interstate 81 in Pennsylvania. Beginning about rush hour, truckers will take shifts in circling the Beltway, driving at the speed limit — an action that might end up jamming the roadway, she said.

“It’s a minor inconvenience, but things could be a lot worse,” Andrews said.

Truckers and their supporters have been asked to post #T2SDA (Truckers to Shut Down America) on their vehicles to indicate their support. Even as the rally has picked up support with more than 136,000 Facebook likes and counting, industry groups have stepped forward to disavow the group’s action

The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, which represents small-business trucking professionals, said it does not support the group.

“The individuals leading this particular effort have no direct affiliation with trucking and appear to be using truckers in order to gain media attention and air other political grievances,” said Norita Taylor, who heads communications for the 150,000-member­ group, in a prepared statement. “We do not support assembling in an unlawful, unpermitted manner, committing crimes, making threats on our lawmakers, or behaving in such a way to cast safe, professional truck drivers in a negative light.”

Officials with the American Trucking Associations said their organization “is not a sponsor of this ‘strike’ nor do we endorse or condone the activities of these few individuals.”

The protest group’s agenda has evolved since the story began making the rounds of news outlets across the country early this week with a story in U.S. News & World Report, which said the truckers wanted members of Congress to be arrested while others called for the ouster of President Obama.

Andrews said the group still wants to get rid of Obama, but will do so by legal means. She said independent truckers also are upset about new regulations, including on idling and hours of service, that threaten to put them out of business."

The president is psychologically predictable. He does not surprise. Having been abandoned as a boy by his father, and then his mother, only to then learn that his grandmother feared people of his race, he seems inherently to distrust individual initiative and intention and to place his trust only in the collective—i.e. the state. What benefits a burgeoning central authority is good for all. When a child’s guardians keep letting him down in profound ways, that child can grow up to want a lot of power himself and distrust the idea of giving anyone else very much.

Hence, the president wants to use tax increases to remove wealth from those who earned it, fair and square. Because, you see, wealth really does confer power on those who amass it, and giving that kind of authority to individuals, rather than the collective, is anathema to the President. It likely reawakens in him very closely held memories of what he got from his parents when most in need: Not much.

Individuals are also better off without guns, the president would have us believe. It is true, of course, that some capital crimes are committed with guns (but only the minority with automatic weapons, and lots with knives and explosives and by strangulation, too).

[pullquote]

More On This... Rubio trumps Obama as both men offer competing visions of America’s future

But guns also happen to empower tens of millions of American individuals, too. They promote in individuals the idea that they can take care of themselves and make their own decisions and take care of their families, including their children. And that’s what I believe is the president’s real problem with them. Because, as a boy, the independent decisions of the adults around him were, frankly, horribly traumatizing.

The president celebrates his Affordable Care Act. But the reality of ObamaCare is that, for the first time, ever, it earmarks American citizens’ after-tax income to be spent, by law, on a product that they might or might not want: health insurance. They have to buy it. The collective always knows best in Obama’s mind. Because individuals left him out in the cold, when he needed consistency and nurturance the most.

Many millions of young Americans listened to Barack Obama on Tuesday night, as they have listened to his core message for nearly five long years. And his message has remained remarkably consistent and remarkably toxic to their psychological well-being: Do not rely on yourself. Entitlement Nation will parent you, until you forget about growing up, period. Stay on your parents’ health insurance, even if you are 18 and in great health and would rather—wisely or not—use that money to start an Internet company in your basement. It’s okay to blame rich people if you can’t earn money. Just ignore the fact that government policy is now hostile to entrepreneurs who might otherwise decide it is worth the risk to staff up.

The government will even grade colleges and tell you which ones are worth attending. Really? Teenagers can’t even research that for themselves, anymore? Their parents can’t help them evaluate schools? The state, the collective—long known for the miserable educational system it has deployed—will decide which institutions of higher learning are worthy?

Welcome to the psychological projection of an abandoned boy’s vision of how much you can rely on other individuals and on yourself. The less, the better. When your mother and father take off on you as a kid, when your white grandmother seems to fear people of color, you probably figure putting any trust in individuals is crazy.

My 10-year-old son was watching last night. I was just glad that he got to see part of the Bruins’ game, too. Because he saw remarkable athletes find something inside themselves that they tapped to come back from being down three goals, to tie the game 3-3 (even though they eventually lost in a shootout). And when Brad Marchand scored that tying goal, with 42 seconds left, and no goalie in the Bruins’ net, I saw my son jump up, out of his chair and pump his fist in the air and yell, “Yes! He did it! He did it!”

“Yup,” I said, “He’s amazing.”

People—individual people—make things happen. Yes, they are part of a team. But celebrating their individual accomplishments and rewarding them for them isn’t bad. It’s good. Brad Marchand scored that goal. He did it. And people build their own businesses, too, Mr. President. Things did not go well for you at the hands of the individuals who were empowered to care for you. But individuals are not inherently bad."

Schneider', 'Mark Berman', 'Tom Legro', 'Natalie Jennings', 'Mike Debonis', 'Nicki Demarco']",Live updates: The shutdown,"One of the most high-profile effects of the shutdown has been the closure of monuments and memorials on the Mall.

Of course, a big reason so much attention has been paid to the shuttering of the World War II Memorial and other landmarks is because groups of veterans have stormed these spots anyway. A group of World War II veterans visited the memorial to that war on Tuesday, bypassing the barriers; the same day, Korean War veterans moved the barricades at the Korean War Veterans Memorial to lay a wreath. The scene repeated itself on Wednesday, with another group of veterans (again accompanied by members of Congress) entering the grounds of the World War II Memorial.

Stories about veterans storming closed memorials were quickly picked up by news outlets and spread far and wide on social media platforms.

But all closures are not created equally. The Smithsonian museums on the Mall? Those are definitely locked. Some of the parks and memorials around D.C.? Not so much.

On Friday, the fourth day of the shutdown, gates and closed signs remained but visitors weren’t paying them much heed. The Post’s Michael Ruane reports that at the World War II Memorial on Friday, visitors simply walked by the park rangers manning a gate without being stopped. The American Legion also held a news conference there, saying they want the memorial to stay open. At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, gates had been pushed aside, and the memorial was crowded with visitors.

This followed several days of similar events around the Mall and elsewhere. Children played on Wednesday inside supposedly closed parks on Capitol Hill.

Still, even though visitors are still making their way into closed memorials and strolling around the Mall, they are encountering a different problem. Some memorials may be accessible, but the bathrooms are all closed."
http://news.yahoo.com/fox-news-obamacare-most-trusted-150510482.html,,[],Fox News 'most trusted' source of news on Obamacare: survey,"CNN may call itself ""the most trusted name in news,"" but when it comes to information about President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, more Americans trust Fox News, a new study suggests.



According to a YouGov survey conducted earlier this month, 19 percent of those polled said Fox News was the most trusted source of information on Obamacare. The top-rated cable network came in ahead of ""Friends and Family"" (17 percent), Obama (11 percent) and National Public Radio (10 percent) in YouGov's results.



Just 3 percent said they trust CNN and MSNBC for information on the new health care law, slightly less than trust Republicans in Congress (4 percent) and slightly more than congressional Democrats (2 percent).



Among Republicans, nearly half (45 percent) named Fox News as their most-trusted source of Obamacare news, with ""Friends and Family"" (19 percent) a distant second. By comparison, just 7 percent of Democrats polled said they trust Fox News on Obamacare.



But while Fox News is more trusted on the Affordable Care Act than all other major cable news channels, lawmakers and Obama himself, it is not as well-trusted as local TV news, the poll found.



When asked how much trust they had in each source of news, 45 percent of the respondents said they trusted local cable news ""a lot"" or ""some,"" compared to 33 percent who said ""not too much"" or ""not at all"" — a net rating of 12, compared to Fox News' 4 net rating.



That Obama is among the least trusted is not surprising, given his health care-related campaign promise — that Americans who liked their existing health care insurance plans could keep them — was cast into doubt. (The YouGov poll was conducted prior to Obama's recent public apology about the rollout of Obamacare.)



That Fox News is more trusted than its cable news rivals on Obamacare shouldn't be surprising, either. A Public Policy Polling survey conducted earlier this year found Fox News was the most trusted television news source in the country.



The same poll, though, found Fox was also the least trusted.

Tucked into the 100-page document — mostly a compilation of prosaic suggestions such as “reinstitute field finance team structure” and “develop a surrogate list of women” — are a few crucial sentences about policies Republicans must embrace for the party to remain viable: a path to legal status for illegal immigrants and more acceptance of gay rights.

Republicans “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,” it concludes. “If we do not, our party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.”

Further, the report concludes, Republicans “need to make sure young people do not see the party as totally intolerant of alternative points of view. Already, there is a generational difference within the conservative movement about issues involving the treatment and the rights of gays — and for many younger voters, these issues are a gateway into whether the party is a place they want to be.”

But in his 27-minute speech at the National Press Clubannouncing the report, the words “immigration” and “gay” didn’t cross Priebus’s lips. Questioned by the moderator about whether there is “a need to shift some basic positions on some of the issues,” he asserted that there is not. “No,” he said, “I think our policies are sound.”

After the event, reporters surrounded Priebus to ask him about the report’s call for “comprehensive immigration reform” — shorthand in Washington for a policy that includes legalization. “To some people, that means securing the border; to some people, that means E-Verify,” he said, referring to workplace checks of immigration status. “To some people, that means a pathway.”

Politico’s Jonathan Martin pressed him on legalization, and the chairman bristled.

“You’re not going to bulldog me, buddy,” Priebus said.

Presumably, he meant “bulldoze,” but his response, a felicitous echo of “Don’t tase me, bro,” is an indication of how bullheaded the party remains on immigration reform.

The report’s authors had been assigned to diagnose mechanical problems in the party, not policy problems, but they recognized, correctly, that the hard line on social issues “will limit our ability to attract young people” and women, and that the hard line on immigration repels Latinos: “If Hispanics think that we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.”

One of the report’s authors, Ari Fleischer, said before Priebus’s speech that the demographic gap “is a killer” for the party. “It’s going to be very hard for Republicans to win if Republicans don’t do better in many of these communities,” said Fleischer, a former spokesman for George W. Bush.

Priebus, giving the presentation on his 41st birthday, said that after November’s “wake-up call,” the Republicans were taking “a fresh start.” With commendable honesty, he acknowledged that “focus groups described our party as narrow-minded, out of touch and, quote, ‘stuffy old men.’ . . . The perception that we’re the party of the rich, unfortunately, continues to grow.”

“We know that we have problems, we have identified them, and we’re implementing the solutions to fix them,” the chairman said.

But he dismissed the notion that these problems could be related to positions the GOP has taken. “To be clear, our principles are sound,” Priebus asserted, moving on to read a flurry of numbered recommendations: “Nine, work with state parties, sister committees. . . . Third, I want to hold hackathons in tech-savvy cities.”

Many of the ideas are good, such as the calls for fewer debates and primaries rather than caucuses. But Priebus, in the Q&A, took pains to avoid offending the conservative orthodoxy that is antagonizing segments of the electorate that Republicans need if they are to win. He embraced voter ID laws (an irritant to many minority voters) and was cautious about GOP Sen. Rob Portman’s acceptance last week of same-sex marriage (“It’s not a matter of whether I support his decision. I support him doing what he wants to do as an elected person and as an American.”).

The chairman also declined an invitation to distance the party from inflammatory commentators on racial matters such as Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter. “I think our whole team is a blessing,” Priebus replied. “I welcome everyone into our party, no matter what spectrum in our party or wherever they’re at on the conservative, in that bandwidth, they’re welcome.”

All are welcome in the Republican Party — as long as they’re conservative.

(CNN) – There's a new Obama in town.

Sunny – a female Portuguese Water Dog – is joining Bo as “first pet,” the White House announced Monday.



Photos showed the all-black animal roaming the White House North Lawn with what appeared to be a pink flamingo dog toy.

Bo, a male of the same breed, came to the White House shortly after the Obamas first arrived at the White House in 2009. The coats of Portuguese Water Dogs are hypoallergenic, meaning Sunny and Bo won't affect first daughter Malia's canine allergies.

In a post on the White House's website, Sunny is described as ""full of energy and very affectionate,"" whose name was chosen to ""fit her cheerful personality.""

She was born in Michigan, and is just over a year old, the White House said.

Sunny’s coat is completely black - unlike Bo, who has black and white “tuxedo” markings on his chest and feet.

The Obamas made a donation to the Washington Humane Society in honor of their newest pet, the White House said.

Bo first arrived at the White House in April 2009, after months of speculation about which type of dog the Obamas would bring into the executive mansion. Obama made a campaign promise to his daughters that if he was elected president, they would get a new pet.

While the president originally expressed a desire to adopt a shelter dog, Bo eventually won out for his non-allergenic coat. He came from a breeder that was also favored by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy.

The White House wasn’t Bo’s first home – he didn't fit in well with his first owners and was returned to the breeder. When Kennedy learned the puppy was available, he arranged to offer him to the Obamas.

Bo spent a month with Kennedy's trainer before coming to the White House. His name - which happens to be the president's initials - was explained by the first family as homage to the first lady's father, who went by the nickname Diddley.

Since arriving more than four years ago, Bo has appeared countless times with the Obamas, including in White House videos and photos. He donned bunny ears for a spot promoting the annual White House Easter Egg Roll this spring.

In their blog post Monday, the White House predicted a similar regimen for Sunny.

“We suspect Sunny will follow in Bo's footsteps and keep the President company in the Oval Office, go for walks with the First Family after their 6:30 family dinner and even ’jump up on the First Ladys lap from time to time!” the White House wrote."

(CNN) – Fans of ""The West Wing"" remember well the fake President Josiah Bartlett's advice when boarding the presidential helicopter, Marine One: duck.

He might easily have offered this advice as well: salute.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Those who closely watch the president's every step and gesture noticed Friday he didn't salute the Marine standing guard at the foot of the chopper's stairs. After boarding and then shaking hands with the pilots, he quickly exited the chopper, and offered a handshake to the Marine at the steps, then returned for the short ride to Annapolis, Maryland for the United States Naval Academy commencement.

It's become tradition for presidents to salute the military officers he encounters when boarding the official helicopter, a tradition which is widely understood as begun by President Ronald Reagan in 1981.

But to not salute is not a break in protocol or a violation of any rule.

Nor was it likely a slight to the military. After all, Obama told the graduates in Annapolis later Friday morning, ""Today we salute all the Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in these wars, including 18 graduates of this Academy. We honor them all, now and forever.""

The tradition is believed to have been started by Reagan. The story goes that he consulted the Marine Corps commandant who ""told the president that as commander in chief he could salute anybody he wished,"" Smithsonian Magazine editor Carey Winfrey wrote in the New York Times.

It's not thought that President Dwight Eisenhower, who attained the rank of five-star general prior to his election and was the first commander-in-chief to ride a helicopter, saluted his pilot, and those before him would not have had the chance.

A hallmark of the U.S. military is that it is overseen by a civilian commander-in-chief. Some suggest the presidential salute to the troops is a sign of respect; others say it is not customary to offer a salute when out of uniform, and a sign of the over-militarization of the presidency.

And while the helicopter's rotor blades aren't spinning when a president approaches, there is still a reason for him to duck. It's to avoid hitting his head on the door opening which is a little low.

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/08/zimmerman-defense-to-continue-presentation-monday/,2013-07-08 00:00:00,[],Judge rules defense can show Trayvon Martin died with marijuana in his system,"Defense lawyers will be permitted to show that Trayvon Martin had marijuana in his system when he and George Zimmerman had their fateful encounter in a gated community in Florida last year, the judge in Zimmerman's murder trial ruled Monday.

Judge Debra Nelson denied a motion by prosecutors to keep toxicology results showing THC in Martin's system from the jury, paving the way for Zimmerman's lawyers to argue the drug may have influenced the teen's behavior. Defense attorney Don West noted that in Zimmerman’s statement to the non-emergency 911 dispatcher that it appeared the person he was observing in the Sanford, Fla., community was “on drugs.”

Late Monday, Zimmerman defense spokesman Shawn Vincent said the defense could rest by the end of the day Tuesday or early Wednesday morning. The prosecution would then have rebuttal witnesses, with closing statements by Thursday or Friday. Vincent stressed this scenario depended on everything going as expected.

Nelson's ruling on the toxicology results came after the jury was dismissed following a day of conflicting testimony about whose voice could be heard screaming on a subsequent 911 tape. A parade of Zimmerman's friends said they recognized the neighborhood watch volunteer's voice, but Martin's father, who police said initially told them he did not recognize the voice, said he came to realize it was his son after hearing the tape some 20 times.

The testimony, in week three of Zimmerman's murder trial, came after the mothers of both Zimmerman and Martin testified Friday it was their son doing the screaming in the Feb. 26, 2012, 911 call made to Sanford, Fla., police. The issue is critical because Zimmerman, a 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, says he shot the 17-year-old in self-defense as he was being beaten.

Sanford Police Det. Christopher Serino and Police Officer Doris Singleton both recalled playing the 911 tape for Tracy Martin days after his son was killed, and both said the elder Martin did not recognize his son's voice on the tape. But later, Tracy Martin, curiously called to the stand by lead defense attorney Mark O'Mara, took the stand to say that he did recognize his son's voice on the tape later, after hearing it several more times when played at the Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett's office.

""After listening to the tape for, maybe 20 times, I said I knew that it was Trayvon's voice,"" the elder Martin said under questioning by O'Mara. Martin called his son his ""best friend in life,"" and said the boy's death turned his world ""upside down.""

Earlier, close friends and former co-workers of Zimmerman testified that they recognized Zimmerman's voice on the the 911 tape that captured his confrontation with Martin. Sondra Osterman, wife of Zimmerman’s best friend Mark Osterman, told jurors that the shrieking voice on the tape was “definitely” that of Zimmerman.

“Yes, definitely, it’s Georgie,” Osterman said. “I hear it, I hear him screaming.”

[pullquote]

Osterman told jurors she has known Zimmerman since 2006, when they worked at a mortgage company. Osterman’s husband has written a book about the fatal shooting — ""Defending our Friend: The Most Hated Man in America"" — and Sondra Osterman told jurors that would not affect her testimony in the case.

“I wouldn’t lie for him or for anybody,” Sondra Osterman said of Zimmerman; she said she was unsure how many copies her husband's book has sold.

Osterman testified she did not think Zimmerman's use of an expletive on the 911 call indicated any ill-will or hatred on his behalf.

""I don't think he was angry,"" she told jurors.

Mark Osterman, a federal air marshal, told jurors he discussed gun safety with Zimmerman and took him to a gun range. Osterman testified that Zimmerman was “very safe all the time” with his Kel Tec 9-mm. handgun, which does not have an external safety and is difficult to fire accidentally.

“It’s a reliable firearm,” said Mark Osterman, who recommended to Zimmerman that he keep a round chambered in the weapon.

Mark Osterman also testified that he heard Zimmerman screaming on the 911 call.

“It sounded like George,” he told jurors.

During cross-examination by prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda, Osterman said he was unsure how many copies his book has sold, but confirmed that all proceeds were destined for Zimmerman.

Geri Russo, a friend who previously worked with Zimmerman, testified that the yelling heard on the 911 tape is Zimmerman.

“I recognize his voice, I’ve heard him speak many times,” Russo told jurors. “I have no doubt in my mind that’s his voice.”

Leanne Benjamin, who owns a real estate company and formerly worked with Zimmerman, also identified Zimmerman as the screaming voice on the 911 call.

“I know his voice,” Benjamin told jurors. “I know what his voice sounds like when he gets excited or loud.”

Benjamin and her husband, John Donnelly, contributed $2,500 to Zimmerman's defense fund and Donnelly purchased suits for Zimmerman to wear during his trial, she testified.

Donnelly, who said he thought of Zimmerman as a son, later testified he found it “distressing” to listen to the 911 tape, which he recently heard twice online and again on Monday in court. Donnelly said he also recognized Zimmerman’s voice as the shrieking individual on the 911 tape, becoming the seventh witness since the defense began its case Friday to testify that the former neighborhood watch volunteer is screaming for help on the 911 call.

“There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that is George Zimmerman and I wish to God I didn’t have the ability to understand that,” Donnelly said.

Donnelly testified he also donated an additional $500 to Zimmerman for his website and purchased $1,700 in suits for the former neighborhood watch volunteer.

Further bolstering the defense contention that Martin was getting the better of the fight when Zimmerman shot him was Adam Pollock, owner of a kickboxing gym where Zimmerman trained prior to the incident. Pollock said Zimmerman was ""grossly obese,"" and not atheltic at all.

""He came to the gym to lose weight and get in shape,"" Pollock said.

When O'Mara asked him to rate Zimmerman's athletic ability on a scale of one to 10 when he began training, Pollock replied, ""Point-five.""

Also on Monday, prosecutors asked Judge Debra Nelson to prevent Zimmerman's defense attorneys from showing jurors a computer-animated depiction of his confrontation with Martin. A motion made public Monday requests that the animation not be mentioned or played at Zimmerman's trial.

Prosecutors — who believe the animation would only confuse jurors — say the animation doesn't depict a murder weapon and only approximates positions based on witness accounts.

Zimmerman's attorneys called their first two witnesses Friday after prosecutors rested their case and Nelson denied a request for acquittal. Some of the witnesses called by the defense could be the same neighbors and investigators called by prosecutors. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara told reporters Friday he expects his case to last a few days and may recall some of the prosecution's witnesses.

The mothers of both Zimmerman and Martin testified on Friday that it was their own son's voice calling for help on a taped 911 call minutes before Zimmerman fatally shot the teen on Feb. 26, 2012. The screams are considered to be crucial pieces of evidence because they could determine who was the aggressor in the confrontation. An FBI expert testified earlier in the week that a person familiar with a voice is in the best position to identify it.

Zimmerman, 29, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, claiming self-defense. It remains unclear whether Zimmerman will testify, although jurors already have heard his account through videotaped police interviews played in court.

Zimmerman faces life in prison if convicted. The state argued during its opening statement that the neighborhood watchman profiled and followed Martin in his truck and called a police dispatch number before he and the teen got into a fight.

His dissertation committee consisted of

George J. Borjas (chair)

Richard J. Zeckhauser

Christopher Jenks

Borjas is your basic, run-of-the-mill anti-immigrant conservative, with substantial scholarly and popular works explaining just how bad brown people are for America.

Zeckhauser is more of a money guy, but his wikipedia page describes him as one of ""the ""whiz kids"" assembled by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara to apply cutting-edge analysis to Cold War military strategy.""

The oddball in this list is Christopher Jenks. Jenks is currently on the editorial board of the American Prospect and many decades ago he was the editor of the New Republic. In the acknowledgements of Richwine's dissertation, he states that



I want to thank my Harvard committee members, starting with George Borjas, who helped me navigate the minefield of early graduate school and has now seen me through to the finish. Richard Zeckhauser, never someone to shy away from controversial ideas, immediately embraced my work and offered new ideas as well as incisive critiques. Christopher Jencks generously signed on as the committee's late addition and offered his own valuable input.

Reading between the lines, it seems to me that someone refused to pass the dissertation as written, and Jenks was brought in late.

Whatever else, these three people signed and passed Richwine's obviously bigotted and substandard dissertation. A dissertation that was so obviously wrong and bigoted that the Heritage Foundation...the Heritage Foundation...distanced themselves from Richwine immediately.

These three professors should be held publicly accountable. More-so, I believe that the signatures of these professors demonstrate, unequivocally, that simple bigotry resides at the heart of movement conservatism--and that this bigotry is no different whether taking about teabaggers or 'scholars'.

The dean of the Kennedy School of Government is David T. Ellwood, (david_ellwood@Harvard.Edu). I've already dropped him a line asking why the School awarded Richwine a PhD and what they plan to do in the future to prevent it from happening again. Perhaps you might as well.



Sorry to have been absent from this diary for so long now. When I posted it I never thought it would get to the rec list, and I was frankly startled to see it still there when I woke up this morning. I stuck around as long as I could.

A couple thoughts to add after all the comments.

1. Clearly there is too much variation and potential hijinks about PhD committees for my claim that the late addition of Jencks might show some problems in getting people to sign off on the dissertation. That was based on my experience as a professor in one discipline and school. Clearly, every school and discipline seems to do things differently. So, I concede that I overstated that.

2. Many folks are saying things like Harvard is a bullshit institution, Bush got his MBA there, it is a school for the 1%, etc. At some level all of that is true. I have my PhD (not from Harvard), and I would be the first to admit that a PhD does not indicate some great level of intelligence. That said, there is a difference between a PhD and an MBA, and while Harvard is seriously over-rated, they aren't the simple hacks some claim them to be. A Harvard PhD does still mean something to many folks.

I can live with dumb people getting PhDs for dumb things. Its always happened and it always will. But a PhD for what is basically a low-budget version of 19th and early-20th century eugenics? No, that is too fucking far. That is beyond what is acceptable."
http://news.yahoo.com/white-mayor-black-wife-nyc-shatters-image-160244789.html,,[],"White mayor, black wife: NYC shatters an image","Another milestone is passing in America's racial journey: The next mayor of New York City is a white man with a black wife.

Even in a nation with a biracial president, where interracial marriage is more accepted and common than ever, Bill de Blasio's marriage to Chirlane McCray is remarkable: He is apparently the first white politician in U.S. history elected to a major office with a black spouse by his side.

This simple fact is striking a deep chord in many people as de Blasio prepares to take office on Jan. 1, with McCray playing a major role in his administration.

""It reflects the American values of embracing different races, ethnicities, religions. I think it's just a great symbol,"" said William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, who is married to a black woman.

Cohen was already a senator when he started dating Janet Langhart, a black television journalist. He proposed several times, but she feared that her race would hurt Cohen's political future. They married in 1996, a few weeks after Cohen announced he would not seek a fourth term.

""There has been that fear (of interracial marriage) on the part of politicians. I didn't have it,"" Cohen said. He noted that a few white politicians have married Latino or Asian women, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose wife is from Mexico, or Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is married to the Taiwan-born former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao.

There have been black men in politics who have been married to white women, such as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas or former Massachusetts Sen. Edward Brooke. And high-profile women such as South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whose parents are from India, and Mia Love, the black mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, are married to white men.

Yet unions of white men and black women have retained a forbidden aura, Cohen said.

""It's black and white, it's slavery and Jim Crow and the fact you can't talk about it,"" he said. ""Black and white has been more of a taboo in the eyes of enough people to be a deterrent.""

Story continues

The taboo is declining, polls show.

In July, a Gallup poll found that 87 percent of Americans approved of interracial marriage — the highest rate ever — compared with 4 percent in 1958. In 2010, more than 15 percent of all new marriages were interracial, according to the Pew Research Center.

Yet statistics also indicate why de Blasio and McCray are such a rarity.

The Gallup poll showed that 14 percent of white people did not approve of intermarriage, compared with 2 percent of black people. And white men are the least likely to marry outside of their race — more than 97 percent of white men are married to white women (82 percent of black men, 65 percent of Hispanics and 48 percent of Asians marry within their own group). The figures are based on 2005 census data analyzed by Michael Rosenfeld, a Stanford University sociologist who studies interracial marriage.

Much has been made of the difficulties black women have in selecting husbands from a pool of eligible black men shrunk by unemployment and incarceration. Among black women age 35 and over, more than 25 percent have never been married, compared with about 7 percent of white women, census figures show. Black men also are twice as likely as black women to marry outside of their race, according to Rosenfeld.

American history and culture, meanwhile, are littered with troubled tales of interracial couples. There have been centuries of debate over President Thomas Jefferson fathering children with his slave Sally Hemings; Sen. Strom Thurmond fought for segregation after having a child with a black housekeeper. In his 1991 film, Spike Lee dubbed interracial sex ""Jungle Fever.""

All of which helps explain why many saw the matrimonial script being flipped by McCray and de Blasio.

""We're seeing black women loved in a way we have not seen before,"" said Aja Monet, a poet and New Yorker.

She sees this trend in real life and fiction, from McCray to first lady Michelle Obama to the Olivia Pope character in ""Scandal,"" the hit TV show about a powerful black political operative in a relationship with a white president.

Monet has black, Cuban, Jamaican and Puerto Rican heritage. Her boyfriend is Korean-American. She noted that McCray and her brown children not only helped de Blasio connect with black voters — ""their love functioned like a political technology"" — but McCray also was a key player in de Blasio's campaign and will be an important part of his Democratic administration.

""It's fair to say the most important voice in my life is Chirlane McCray,"" de Blasio said after his victory.

As de Blasio and McCray celebrated on election night with their two children, Tiya Miles saw them on television and stopped in her tracks. ""I was very moved,"" she said.

Miles, a black University of Michigan professor, recently wrote a column about being stung by the sight of so many successful black men choosing white wives. It feels like ""a personal rejection of the group in which I am a part, of African American women as a whole, who have always been devalued in this society,"" Miles wrote.

""I think black women sit there with these feelings and they fester, and they take little bits of us over time,"" Miles said in an interview. ""We can deal, we can manage, we keep on moving because that's our job in life, but it still affects us.""

So for her, de Blasio and McCray's victory feels like confirmation — especially since McCray does not resemble the type of black woman that mainstream America usually deems beautiful, like Halle Berry or Beyonce.

""A woman who has darker skin and natural hair, and a white man,"" Miles said. ""To see a black woman who is in a long-term relationship with children and her partner, who does not fit that stiff, narrow, idealized image of what a black woman should look like, I think is powerful.""

It's more a simple sign of progress for Love, the mayor from Utah and a rising Republican star.

""I tend not to look at race in any issue,"" she said. However, ""the fact that people are able to marry someone outside of their race without feeling as if they are going to have any issues or repercussions is a great thing.""

Interracial marriage is not entirely accepted. A recent Cheerios ad featuring an interracial family inspired so many racist remarks that YouTube stopped allowing comments on it. And there remains some black resistance to marrying white people — it's widely accepted that if President Barack Obama had married a white woman, or even a light-skinned black woman, black voters would have caused him problems.

De Blasio was elected in New York, perhaps the most diverse city in America. But he is connecting with people across the country, especially the children of interracial marriages.

""Thank you, New York City, for this gift,"" wrote Liz Dwyer, whose father is white and mother is black, on her losangelista.com blog.

""It's just the resonance of it. How much it means for families to see a family like them in a visible place,"" said Ken Tanabe, a New Yorker with a Japanese father and Belgian mother. He is the founder of the Loving Day organization — www.lovingday.org — which organizes annual events celebrating the 1967 Supreme Court decision that struck down laws against interracial marriage.

""Within our community, when someone does well, it feels like an affirmation,"" he said. ""Not on the scale of a Barack Obama, but sort of a local version of that.""

Said Cohen, the former defense secretary: ""It says a lot about this country. Where we've come from, how far.""

""The mayor,"" he said, ""has shattered an image.""

Now, they’re taking a second look.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) is working on his own version, which some Republicans hope can bridge the divide separating the parties on the immigration overhaul, which has languished in the GOP-led House.

But it could also fall flat, both with Republicans who reject any citizenship option for those not lawfully in the country, and with Democrats who dismiss it as too little, too late.

The approach was aired Tuesday at a House judiciary subcommittee hearing as Republicans search for a way to respond to an issue that top party leaders say is vital for the GOP’s future.

The early reviews were not positive from those who could benefit most. “Dreamers,” as the young immigrants who had fought for the Dream Act call themselves, now reject the idea as a “childish” political game and vow not to leave behind the parents who struggled to give them better lives in the United States.

They largely back the Senate bill, which would provide a 13-year process for citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. But House GOP leaders have said they will not take up that bill.

In often tearful testimony, one young immigrant told the House subcommittee she could not imagine accepting the option of citizenship for herself but not her parents.

“When members of Congress tell me that I deserve an opportunity to earn citizenship and my mother does not, I tell them that if anyone deserves that opportunity to earn citizenship, it is my mother,” said Rosa Velazquez, 30, a graduate student in Arkansas.

Velazquez, who came to the United States from Mexico 25 years ago, described her mother’s job cutting chicken in one of the state’s poultry factories. “My mother’s working hands are the foundation on which this country was built,” she said. “I am my mother’s daughter. She and I are equal.”

Opponents, including Democrats on the panel, warned that excluding most immigrants who are in the country illegally from the possibility of citizenship would create a permanent underclass.

But interest in the proposal from several key Republicans on the panel could signal broader support within the House GOP, setting up a possible showdown with Democrats.

“We all view children as a special, protected class,” said Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the subcommittee chairman, who warned that holding out for greater inclusion would “only wind up hurting the most vulnerable.”

Advertisement

Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) said, “It seems to me it’s time we deal with these children in a very special way and bring them into our society.”

Those sentiments are a turnaround from late 2010, when Republicans opposed the Dream Act as it was narrowly approved by the then-Democratic-led House. The measure later died in the Senate.

Efforts to showcase a softened Republican approach to immigration hit a snag Tuesday when Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) suggested that young drug-runners could try to take advantage of such a citizenship proposal.

“For every one that’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there that … weigh 130 pounds and have calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” King said in an interview with the website Newsmax.

The White House, which supports the Senate-passed immigration overhaul, quickly shot back.

“Every member of the GOP should condemn Rep King for comparing the Dreamers to drug mules, they represent what is great about this country,” Dan Pfeiffer, an advisor to the president, wrote on Twitter.

The hearing was the first chance for many House Republicans to discuss publicly the citizenship pathway. Among those testifying was a representative from the Southern Baptist Convention who drew on biblical passages to support the immigration overhaul, creating a lively exchange over interpretations of Scripture with some Republicans.

The White House signaled its rejection of the limited approach. Pfeiffer earlier in the day pointed to an opinion piece that criticized what it called the “cruel hypocrisy of the GOP immigration plan: allow some kids to stay but deport their parents.”

Advertisement

The comment drew a sharp rebuke from Gowdy, who has been working on alternatives to the Senate bill in search of a compromise, as coming from a “self-serving political hack.”

Speaker John A. Boehner has yet to bring an immigration bill for a vote on the House floor and is unlikely to do so before Congress recesses for the month of August. The Ohio Republican has pledged not to consider legislation unless it has majority support from House Republicans.

A bipartisan group of House lawmakers has been working behind the scenes on a bill that would provide a citizenship pathway for most immigrants in the country illegally, along with border security and new visa programs. It is expected to be unveiled in the fall.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/29/bush-library-rewrite_n_3833623.html,2013-08-29 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Bush Library Rewrite Website Presents Democratic Version Of President's Legacy,"WASHINGTON -- The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum opened May 1 on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas after much anticipation. The $250 million library brought together all living presidents for a dedication ceremony on April 25, where they showered praise on the 43rd president of the United States.

But according to the Democratic nonprofit group Bridge Project, which focuses on ""exposing the conservative movement's dishonest tactics,"" the library's version of the Bush legacy suffers from selective memory loss. Bridge Project thus created a library of its own Thursday, in the form of a website BushRewrite.org, which the group said will ""rectify the falsehoods and omissions of the Bush library.""

The timing coincides with the eighth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a low point of Bush's two-term presidency. The Bush library has already been accused of glossing over Katrina, which killed 1,833 people and destroyed an estimated $81 billion in property. The library overlooks the Bush administration's delayed reaction and includes no pictures of the desperate crowds at the Louisiana Superdome or the New Orleans Morial Convention Center -- images that quickly spurred suggestions that race was a factor in the muted federal response.

The halls of the Bush library ignore other disturbing facts, the Bush Rewrite states on the website. The Huffington Post was offered an exclusive look at the website, which says that the Bush White House ""was plagued by a series of scandals and controversies"" and ""policy failures."" It contains pages with what Bridge Project calls a ""stark reminder"" of Bush's true legacy, ranging from the economy, which revisits events preceeding the 2008 financial collapse, to war and national security, which highlights the Bush administration's torture and rendition programs.

The Bush Rewrite also recalls Bush's record on education, environmental policy and Social Security. In some cases, the website displays pictures taken at the Bush Library to underscore the contrast between the museum's more favorable remembrance with media reports.

A section called ""The Missing Wing"" is dedicated to controversial moments under Bush's presidency that his library chose not to mention, such as the roles played by Vice President Dick Cheney and senior adviser-turned-deputy chief of staff Karl Rove, the Abu Ghraib prisoner torture scandal, and Bush's support for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.

Bridge Project also uses the website to argue that congressional Republicans continue pushing policies that are harmful today.

The Bush library contents are ""American fiction,"" Eddie Vale, vice president of Bridge Project, told HuffPost. ""The inaccuracies and omissions are a disservice to the annals of history, but ignoring the lessons of the Bush administration poses a threat to our nation’s future. The failure to recognize the consequences of Bush’s policy decisions is why today’s congressional Republicans are even more ambitious than Bush ever was in pursuing the policies that served as the catalyst for the crises from which we are still recovering."""

Bush said when asked about Obama Jimmy Carter hasn't adhered to the rule and regularly critiques Democrats and Republicans Dwight Eisenhower is considered the gold standard for working with a successor

(CNN) —

In President Barack Obama’s two presidential campaigns, his predecessor loomed large; Obama and Democrats regularly laid the blame for the downtrodden economy at George W. Bush’s feet.

When pressed on their pledge to turn the faltering economy around, Obama and Democrats often pointed out that they had inherited the product of the Bush administration’s policies.

Bush, however, in his limited public appearances has stayed mute about his successor, maintaining a custom among former presidents that dates back decades. While not all presidents have adhered to the practice, it has created a mostly amicable brotherhood of former presidents.

“George W. Bush is a traditionalist,” CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said. “I think he holds to an old-fashioned standard that the presidency is one of the world’s greatest fraternities and its members don’t criticize each other.”

After leaving the White House, Bush made it clear that he was finished with the public stage. Although he has been more public since his presidential library opened in April, Bush has maintained that he will not criticize Obama.

“I don’t think it does any good,” Bush said Monday in an exclusive interview with CNN’s Robyn Curnow in Zambia, where he was helping to renovate a women’s clinic. “It’s a hard job. He’s got plenty on his agenda. It’s difficult. A former president doesn’t need to make it any harder. Other presidents have taken different decisions; that’s mine.”

Bush’s new mission: Helping those with the least

In “The Presidents Club,” a book by Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy about the fraternity, a Bush adviser says the most the former president will say about Obama’s decisions is, “Well, I might have done it differently.”

In public, though, Bush has refused to comment on Obama.

“He deserves my silence,” Bush said in a March 2009 speech. “There’s plenty of critics in the arena. I think it’s time for the ex-president to tap dance off the stage and let the current president have a go at solving the world’s problems.”

Unexpected friendships

Gergen said he feels Bush’s silence about Obama stems from how Bush was treated in his last few years in office.

“There was a sense among the Bush people that a lot of this criticism was gratuitous and ill-informed and painful,” Gergen said. That could be “part of his staying away from issues with Obama.”

When you are president, there are literally only a handful of people in the world who can relate to the pressure, the commitment, the arduous decision making. This unique understanding has led many presidents to rely on one another after leaving office.

Former, current presidents on George W. Bush

Some of these relationships have led to unexpected political friendships.

Despite the fact they faced off in the 1992 presidential election, the relationship of Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush has been described as father-and-son-like. They are so close that Clinton joked at the opening of George W. Bush’s library that he “had become the black sheep son” of the Bush family.

5 presidents on hand for Bush Center opening

He even jokingly referred to former first lady Barbara Bush as his “mother.”

Clinton praises Bush at library opening

Other presidential relationships have been similarly close. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, opponents in the 1976 election, grew close in their retirement and worked together on a number of international issues.

President Harry Truman also befriended a predecessor, Herbert Hoover. After working together to restructure the executive branch, Truman called Hoover “the best man that I know of” and an appreciative Hoover wrote Truman to say, “For all of this and your friendship, I am deeply grateful.”

Most former presidents look better through history’s eyes

Gergen, who served in the White House in four administrations, said that once in the Oval Office you appreciate the “continuity of the office.”

“You form part of a chain and each link is important. You almost have a sacred responsibility to keep the office strong,” he said.

Breaking the club’s rules

Not all former presidents have held their tongue.

Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who served one term in office, has a history of biting criticism of those who followed him in the White House.

In 2007, Carter delivered a blistering critique of the Bush administration, telling the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette “as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world, this administration has been the worst in history.”

Carter hasn’t directed his criticism only at Republicans, though. In a February 2013 speech, he faulted the Obama administration for its dealings with North Korea and Iran.

“Our country is now looked upon as the foremost warlike nation on Earth, and there is almost a complete dearth now of commitment of America to negotiate differences with others,” Carter said.

And throughout much of Clinton’s presidency, Carter was a Democratic agitator. He embarked on his own foreign policy projects, at times at direct odds with the White House, and after Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky became public, Carter questioned Clinton’s morals.

Even after Clinton left office, Carter continued to criticize.

In February 2001, a month after the Clinton presidency had ended, Carter said Clinton’s last-minute pardon of Marc Rich was a “most serious mistake” and even alleged that the reason Rich was pardoned was donations that Rich had made.

“I don’t think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts,” Carter said. “In my opinion, that was disgraceful.”

But Carter has been the exception, not the rule. While some presidents have stepped out and criticized during the heat of a political campaign, it is a rare occurrence.

“Carter puts issues ahead of fraternity and will often speak out about things,” Gergen said. “I think it is part of his nature. Maybe being a one-term president changes your view.”

’Little Boy Blue’ and the Bay of Pigs

Dwight Eisenhower is by most accounts the gold standard for how to deal with other presidents.

Eisenhower chewed out his successor, John F. Kennedy, in private for the botched Bay of Pigs invasion, but publicly offered him a level of support.

Kennedy had been in office for just three months when he called for a meeting with Eisenhower in April 1961 after the attempt to topple the young Castro regime in Cuba was a massive failure. The operation had originated before Eisenhower left office and Kennedy’s administration had carried it out.

The Kennedy-Eisenhower relationship had been frosty. Eisenhower had long viewed Kennedy as naive and young – he referred to Kennedy as “Little Boy Blue” in private – and Kennedy had disparaged the Eisenhower administration in his 1960 presidential campaign.

The two put their chilly relationship aside, however, and Kennedy invited the former general to Camp David to review the mistakes in Cuba.

According to Eisenhower’s notes from the meeting and a number of media reports, the conversation between the new and former president previewed the pitfalls of foreign policy campaign promises:

Kennedy: “No one knows how tough this job is until he’s been in it a few months.”

Eisenhower: “Mr. President. If you will forgive me, I think I mentioned that to you three months ago.”

After the meeting, Eisenhower stood in front of television cameras and said, “I am all in favor of the United States supporting the man who has to carry the responsibility for our foreign affairs.”

In “The Presidents Club,” Gibbs and Duffy write that despite the fact that all of these men have risen to the highest level of their profession, they not only work better together, but they need one another.

“There is no fraternity like it anywhere, and not just because of the barriers to entry of the privilege of membership,” they write. “For all of the club’s self-serving habits and instincts, when it is functioning at its best, it can serve the president, help solve his problems and the nation’s, and even save lives.”"

Dee Dee Myers, who was Bill Clinton’s campaign spokeswoman and his first White House press secretary, said she could not imagine where “such thoughts even come from” and tweeted “#Gottago” while linking to an article in which MSNBC was mum about whether Bashir’s apology was enough.

Honestly…where do such thoughts even come from? #Gottago. MSNBC not saying whether Martin Bashir apology is enough http://t.co/5ElIrTM1bn — Dee Dee Myers (@deemyers) November 20, 2013

Myers, who has written a book about why women leaders should rule the world, spoke out after Breitbart News reported that feminist and women’s groups had been silent on Bashir’s remarks. Talk radio host Mark Levin suggested women’s groups were silent because Palin is not a left-wing politician.

After Bashir apologized on his show on Monday for words that he admitted were “wholly inappropriate” and “offensive,” Breitbart News exclusively obtained a letter from Palin’s PAC, SarahPAC, that asked MSNBC President Phil Griffin and NBC News President Deborah Turness what action the network would take against Bashir for his “appalling” words. It also mentions that MSNBC has set a precedent of firing and disciplining other anchors for “offensive language.”

“You fired Don Imus for offensive language in describing the Rutgers University Women’s Basketball team, you suspended Alec Baldwin, and yet nothing has happened to Mr. Bashir,” the letter reads. “Are we to assume then, that disciplinary procedures at your network take place based on the target of the remarks rather than the remarks themselves?”

The letter also mentions that MSNBC suspended Baldwin’s show for two weeks after he made anti-gay remarks on the streets of New York off the air, while “Mr. Bashir’s violent rhetoric” was displayed on the air.

The letter concludes by saying, “Americans deserve to know that your network doesn’t condone violent and hateful rhetoric directed at anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or political persuasion.”"

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/conservative-hispanic-group-tells-gop-avoid-amnesty-label-173408974--election.html,,[],Conservative Hispanic group tells GOP to avoid ‘amnesty’ label,"A conservative pro-immigration reform group has issued talking points to Republican lawmakers, telling them to avoid referring to the U.S. citizen children of illegal immigrants as ""anchor babies"" or calling for the construction of an ""electric fence"" on the border, among other things.

The talking points, published by BuzzFeed, went out to Republican lawmakers on the Hill as momentum builds for an immigration bill that would legalize most of the country's 11 million illegal immigrants. The memo urges lawmakers to call them ""undocumented immigrants"" and to avoid terms such as ""aliens"" or ""illegals,"" which are seen as offensive and dehumanizing. Another phrase to avoid? ""Send them all back.""

""Conservatives get a bad rap when it comes to immigration reform because of a few people who say things that can be taken to be offensive,"" said Jennifer Korn, executive director of the Hispanic Leadership Network, the center-right group that sent the talking points on Monday. ""It all means the same thing, but the way you say it matters.""

Korn worked in the White House when President George W. Bush attempted to get immigration reform passed in his second term. Two bills—one in 2006, the other in 2007—died after a vocal grass-roots movement emerged in opposition to what it called ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants. The amnesty tag stuck, even though both bills would have required any applicant to go through a lengthy legalization process that required him or her to meet certain requirements, like paying back taxes and a fine and learning English. Lawmakers received thousands of phone calls about the bill, Korn remembers, almost all of them strongly against reform.

Korn hopes theses talking points will help avoid the ""pitfalls"" she saw then.

""Right now what's really giving me heartburn is people saying 'pathway to citizenship,'"" she said. ""It's not a pathway to citizenship. It's 'earned legal status.' If you want conservative support you have to explain what it is so there's not this knee-jerk reaction of 'No amnesty!'""

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida who's part of a bipartisan group of senators pushing for immigration reform, has used ""earned residency"" at times in interviews with conservative talk show hosts to describe what immigration reform would provide to qualifying illegal immigrants. Democrats, including Obama, often use ""pathway to citizenship"" to describe the bill."

Haynes of the First Amendment Center writes:

A majority of the American people (51%) believes that the U.S. Constitution establishes a Christian nation, according to the State of the First Amendment survey released last month by the First Amendment Center. Because language about a Christian America has long been a staple of Religious Right rhetoric, it’s not surprising that acceptance of this patently false interpretation of the Constitution is strongest among evangelicals (71%) and conservatives (67%). But even many non-evangelical Christians (47%) and liberals (33%) appear to believe the fiction of a constitutionally mandated Christian America is historical fact.

I am not aware of any polling or sociological survey data that would tend to confirm or cast doubt on these numbers. But whatever degree of truth there may be in them, they come from a credible source and are sufficiently concerning that I think we need to sit-up and take notice and begin to consider what might be done.

Haynes uses the occasion of these hair-raising findings to offer a counter historical narrative. (I did the same in longer form a few years ago, as have many others over the years.)

If it is true, as the First Amendment Center's survey suggests, that most Americans embrace the main assertion of Christian Nationalism, there is much to be done. For today, I will restate the premise of most of us who do research and writing in this area.

We have pretty much the same issue when it comes to Christian Nationalism as we do when addressing any dimension of the Religious Right: We have to at least consider the whole of the movement in order to best understand and figure out how to contend with any of its constituent parts or concerns. That does not mean that everyone needs to know everything there is to know about the Religious Right. I don't know anyone who does (certainly not me) and it would be a silly ambition in any case. But my point is that actual knowledge and expertise nevertheless, matters. What also matters is that we have a commonly accepted vocabulary so we can communicate about these things. It can be challenging, but it ain't rocket science, and I think we have made progress in this area (organized efforts to stop us not withstanding.) A close corollary is that unfair labels, terms of demonization -- and loaded language generally -- are obstacles to thoughtful consideration and conversation in this, and really any arena.

These are obvious prerequisites to dispassionate scholarship, journalism, and strategic conversation among affected and concerned constituencies.

The Asiana pilots said in interviews with the National Transportation Safety Board that they had set the auto-throttles to maintain an air speed of 137 knots. That’s a significantly faster speed than the plane actually achieved as it came in for its landing at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday.

As the inquiry entered its fourth day, Deborah A.P. Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said investigators were still trying to verify whether the throttles were properly activated.

The pilots’ statements do not resolve the central question of why the Boeing 777’s speed and altitude fell so far out of the normal range for landing at SFO before it hit a sea wall and crash-landed. But outside air safety experts said the statements suggest a risky reliance on technology when the flight crew should have been constantly monitoring the airplane’s speed.

“Whether it was engaged or not working is almost irrelevant,” said Barry Schiff, a former TWA pilot and an air safety consultant. “The big mystery of Flight 214 is why in God’s name did these two pilots sit there and allow the air speed to get so low.”

Experts said the pilots should have been monitoring the plane’s speed every few seconds, and could have manually taken control of the engines at any time.

Auto-throttles, which are connected to an airplane’s flight management computers, allow pilots to select the appropriate speed for takeoff, cruising or landing. The devices automatically make corrections if there are deviations from the setting.

Jon Russell, a veteran airline pilot and safety official for the Air Line Pilots Assn. on the West Coast, said the auto-throttle is a valuable tool.

“I don’t know what happened. It just doesn’t make sense,” said Russell, noting that the pilots were very experienced in Boeing aircraft. “The situation deteriorated a lot farther than it should have.”

Much of the information released by the NTSB since Saturday morning’s crash has focused on the pilots, who were flying too low and slow during their final approach. Two people were killed and 182 were injured as the plane’s landing gear and tail struck a seawall at the end of Runway 28L.

Investigators said the plane was flying 30 knots under its target landing speed of 137 knots, or almost 158 mph, and had dipped well below the normal flight path into the airport.

Several seconds before the crash landing, a stall warning went off in the cockpit. With the impact 1.5 seconds away, the pilots finally attempted to accelerate and abort the landing, investigators said.

The Asiana pilots were making a visual approach to San Francisco without the instrument landing system, a part of which was not operating due to airfield renovations. NTSB officials said, however, that there were other automated systems and visual references available to assist the flight crew.

At the time, the pilot, Lee Kang-kook, who had only 35 hours flying Boeing 777s, was being checked out and supervised in the plane by Lee Jung-min, a captain who had been certified as a training pilot June 15, less than a month before the crash. It was Lee Kang-kook’s first landing in San Francisco in a Boeing 777 and Lee Jung-min’s first landing at the airport in a training situation.

Hersman said that when the jetliner crashed, three pilots were in the cockpit. Lee Kang-kook was in the left-hand or captain’s seat. Lee Jung-min was in the right-hand or co-pilot’s seat, supervising his flight, and a relief first officer was sitting in the jump seat to monitor the landing.

The approach to San Francisco International Airport is not particularly difficult, but it does require closely monitoring a jetliner’s air speed as it executes a sweeping 180-degree counterclockwise turn in the approach from the north, according to Robert Ditchey, former vice president for operations at US Airways.

Ditchey said that only the pilot in the left-hand seat — in this case, one who was not yet fully qualified to land the 777 — could see the runway during the turn. The supervising pilot in the right-hand seat could not see the runway from his position, he said.

Aviation safety experts and federal investigators have questioned why the crew did not recognize the problem and take action before the plane struck the end of the runway.

Hersman rejected the suggestion that any problem or misunderstanding about the auto-throttle by the crew would excuse the pilots from their duty to manually fly the airplane.

“But let me be clear: the crew is required to maintain a safe aircraft, which means that they need to monitor. They have a monitoring function, all three of them in the cockpit. One of the very critical things that need to be monitored on approach to landing is speed,” she said.

None of the crew was tested for drugs or alcohol after the crash, Hersman said, because foreign flight crews involved in accidents do not fall under the same regulatory requirements as U.S. crews.

Hersman also said that two flight attendants in the rear of the aircraft were ejected after the impact and found on the side of the runway with injuries.

During a news briefing in Seoul on Tuesday, Asiana President Yoon Young-doo defended the pilots, saying they were “excellent” and qualified members of the flight crew with experience flying into San Francisco International.

Lee Kang-kook, who has almost 10,000 hours in the air, had previously flown into San Francisco 29 times as a co-pilot on Boeing 747s, Yoon said. Lee Jung-min, with almost 12,000 hours, had flown into the airport 33 times.

Yoon said he personally apologized to the families of the two Chinese girls who were killed in the crash. He said he planned to visit the crash site and meet with survivors and their families in San Francisco to apologize. He added that would assist the investigation in any way he could.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/13/us/airline-merger-antitrust-lawsuit/index.html,2013-08-13 00:00:00,['Evan Perez'],US government seeks to block American-US Airways merger,"Story highlights The merged American Airlines-US Airways would be the world's largest airline Lawsuit: The merger would ""substantially lessen competition"" for air travel Airline mergers won approval in recent years amid the poor economy, but industry now making money NEW: American/US Airways say they will fight government attempt to block their deal

(CNN) —

The Justice Department and attorneys general from six states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the $11 billion merger of American Airlines and US Airways, saying the combination would lead to higher prices and less service for consumers.

The merger, which would create the world’s largest airline, would “substantially lessen competition” for commercial air travel, contends the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington.

The carriers said in a joint statement that they would mount a “vigorous and strong defense” of their deal and pursue all legal options to move it forward.

“We believe that the DOJ is wrong in its assessment of our merger. Integrating the complementary networks of American and US Airways to benefit passengers is the motivation for bringing these airlines together. Blocking this procompetitive merger will deny customers access to a broader airline network that gives them more choices,” the companies said.

Opinion: Why American-US Airways deal is good

US Airways shares slid more than 9 percent on Wall Street. American is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

A top concern is local markets, the Justice Department said. It cited the example of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where the combined airline would control 69% of takeoff and landing slots, and 63% of the outbound nonstop routes.

The Justice Department also said in its complaint that if the two airlines were allowed to merge, there would be higher fees for baggage and flight changes.

The states that joined the antitrust lawsuit are: Texas, where American’s parent company AMR Corp. is based; Arizona, home base for US Airways; Florida; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; and Virginia.

The lawsuit comes as somewhat of a surprise. In recent years the Justice Department has allowed other big airline mergers – Delta gobbled up Northwest, and United absorbed Continental – in part because the airline industry was losing so much money and the mergers were seen as necessary for survival.

But airlines are now making billions of dollars, not only from higher fares but also from $6 billion in fees they collected in 2012 alone, for baggage and seat selection and other things that used to be included in fares.

Minority businesses would fight any US Air merger

American and US Airways had touted their combination as one that “joins two highly complementary networks with access to the best destinations around the globe – offering you increased choices, improved efficiency and better options” under American’s Oneworld alliance.

The Justice Department lawsuit cites internal documents from the airlines to show that the merger isn’t needed and in fact would lead to cuts in programs that benefit travelers.

An example is US Airways’ Advantage Fares discount program, which executives said would likely be eliminated after the merger, according to the Justice Department. Without the merger, antitrust officials said, other airlines would be forced to continue to match US Airways’ discounts to compete.

American has been in bankruptcy protection since 2011 and has been working to get approval from antitrust authorities and shareholders for the merger so it can emerge from court protection. The companies had hoped to complete the deal by the end of September.

The European Union this month cleared the merger with the condition that the airline give up slots to allow new competition in the Philadelphia-to-London route.

Some see a source of tax revenue,"WASHINGTON — As America’s road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.

The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America’s major roads.

The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances. Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them — then use the information to draw up a tax bill.

The tea party is aghast. The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.

And while Congress can’t agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting. They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over. Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.

“This really is a must for our nation. It is not a matter of something we might choose to do,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025. “There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes. The technology is there to do it.”

The push comes as the country’s Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke. Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to. Cars get many more miles to the gallon. The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn’t gone up in 20 years. Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.

“The gas tax is just not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota. His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system. “This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term,” he said.

Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee. It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example. California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state’s ambitious global warming laws. But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative. The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.

“This is not just a tax going into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason. “People are paying more directly into what they are getting.”

The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.

The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars. But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.

Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own. The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country’s biggest experiment. Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state. Nevada has already completed a pilot. New York City is looking into one. Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks. And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.

The concept is not a universal hit.

In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers’ cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.

“Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation. “It was not something people wanted.”

As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.... There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals’ everyday comings and goings.”

Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time. If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.

The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage. The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers. It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage. But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don’t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.

“People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage. “There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs. There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.”

In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices. They can choose a device with or without GPS. Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.

Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less. In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide “pay-as-you-drive” insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.

“Motorists would be attracted to participate … because of the value of the benefits it offers to them,” says a city planning document.

Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction. At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes. An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don’t use much gas, so they pay their fair share.

“There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs. “If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.”

As TPM noted, this is not the first time, even this month, that Reid has made such a threat. The first was when Republicans filibustered Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court. And did that threat get Republicans to back down? Nope.

1.Eliminate the Filibuster on Motions to Proceed: Clears a path to debate by making motions to proceed not subject to a filibuster, but providing two hours of debate. 2.Require a Talking Filibuster: Forces Senators who filibuster to actually speak on the floor, greatly increasing public accountability and requiring time and energy if the minority wants to use this tool to obstruct the Senate. 3.Expedite Nominations: Reduces post-cloture debate on nominations from 30 hours to 2 hours, except for Supreme Court Justices (for whom the current 30 hours would remain intact). 4.Eliminate the Filibuster on Motions to Establish a Conference Committee: Reduces the steps to establish a conference committee from three motions to one, and limits debate the consolidated motion to 2 hours.

Some of us might like to see even stronger filibuster reform, but at least this proposal was under public discussion in January, and, according to Merkley and Udall, got significant support within the Democratic caucus, tantalizingly close to a majority. Now is the time for the waverers to come on board, and for Harry Reid to make the change. Stop threatening, and start doing. NOW."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/12/02/Diane-Feinstein-says-the-unsayable,2013-12-02 00:00:00,['Frank J. Gaffney'],Feinstein: Jihadists Will Stop Hating the West Only When They Achieve Shariah Law,"Yesterday was a red letter day–or perhaps it should be called an Islamic green letter one–for U.S. intelligence. For the first time I can recall, the top legislator on a congressional oversight committee actually made clear what motivates our enemies in what used to be called euphemistically the “War on Terror,” and what Team Obama now dubs even more opaquely as the effort to “counter violent extremism.”

This breakthrough came in the course of a joint appearance on CNN’s State of the Union by the chairpersons of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), respectively. The media seized on the ostensibly big news from their remarks: bipartisan agreement that the United States is at greater risk of terrorist attack today than two years ago.

But important, ominous, and accurate as that assessment is, it was not the most important point made by these two respected lawmakers. Instead, it was Sen. Feinstein’s observation in response to a question about what causes the “hatred” that makes our situation more perilous:

There is a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist jihadist Islamic community, and that is that the West is responsible for everything that goes wrong and that the only thing that’s going to solve this is Islamic shariah law.

What makes this incontrovertible statement so noteworthy? It is the fact that the intelligence community is not allowed to say it. Under Obama administration guidelines, for intelligence officers-and for that matter, law enforcement, Homeland Security and military personnel-to talk about Islamic jihadism and shariah as the motivation for terrorism can be a career-ending offense.

For example, on May 10, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, used a press conference to denounce a highly decorated and up-and-coming Army officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Dooley, for teaching an elective course at the Joint Forces Staff College using approved curriculum. According to Gen. Dempsey, what prompted this extraordinary action was that a student–who it turns out, had not actually been enrolled in Col. Dooley’s class–“was concerned that the course was objectionable and that it was counter to our values …our appreciation for religious freedom and cultural awareness. And the young man who brought it to my attention was absolutely right. It’s totally objectionable.”

At the core of what was so “totally objectionable” is the fact that students were exposed to information that made plain the gravity of the threat of which Sen. Feinstein warned: the supremacist, totalitarian Islamic doctrine of shariah and the jihad or holy war it obliges adherents to perform. Col. Dooley’s promising career was cut short and the files of his institution and that of the rest of the national security community have been purged of all such information deemed by unidentified “experts” engaged for the purpose to be “counter to our values.”

Sen. Feinstein’s forthright declaration is particularly gratifying as I had an opportunity to discuss the danger posed by shariah with her in the course of testimony I provided the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 24, 2013 at the invitation of her colleague, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). In the course of making the case for keeping the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open, I observed:

We have been obliged to go to war because it was thrust upon us. And, if we are to prevail in this conflict, we must understand the nature of the enemies with whom we are at war. They are shariah-adherent jihadists who believe, in accordance with that doctrine, that it is God’s will that they destroy our way of life and subjugate us to theirs.

At the time, Sen. Feinstein strongly disagreed with my view that shariah’s dictates make it impossible to safely release its adherents from Gitmo or, alternatively, to incarcerate them in this country instead–where they might exploit rights foolishly conferred upon them to secure their freedom and wage jihad here. I hope that the clarity she expressed Sunday about the inexorable nature of the shariah doctrine and the supremacist hatred it impels will cause the senior senator from California to insist that such insights are once again inculcated in those responsible for our security and to reconsider her support for closing Guantanamo Bay.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/01/22/CBS-News-Exec-Claims-Pulverize-was-Analysis,2013-01-22 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],"CBS News Exec Claims 'Pulverize GOP' Was Analysis, Not Opinion","Saturday morning, Big Journalism ran the story of John Dickerson, a CBS News political director, who took to the online pages of Slate to suggest it was time for Obama to “destroy” and “pulverize” the Republican Party.

Today, Dickerson took to the online pages of Slate again, this time to insist we all misunderstood him. His new headline and subtitle say it all:

They Hate Me, They Really Hate Me Conservatives despise my analysis of Obama’s second-term options. But it was analysis–not advice.

He then writes:

Some people thought I was giving the president my personal advice. No. My goal was to make a compelling argument based on the facts. I used words like “war” and “pulverize,” and some have responded with threats to me and my family. (“Go for his throat!” some have counseled, echoing the headline.) These words have also liberated some correspondents (USUALLY THE ONES THAT TYPE IN ALL CAPS!!!!) from reading the piece or reading it in the spirit in which it was written.

All the left-wing bases are pretty much covered there: Oh, poor me; I’m the misunderstood victim who’s hated and receiving death threats from the wingers.

I honestly believe that one of the Lefts’ primary tactics is to endlessly exhaust us with this kind of relentless tactical nonsense.

If Dickerson was indeed writing analysis, he did an awfully good job ofdisguising it as naked advocacy. Here are the opening paragraphs of Dickerson’s original piece. Please tell me at which point this Obama cheer-leading distinguishes itself as anything nearing objective analysis: [emphasis added]

Go for the Throat! Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party. On Monday, President Obama will preside over the grand reopening of his administration. It would be altogether fitting if he stepped to the microphone, looked down the mall, and let out a sigh: so many people expecting so much from a government that appears capable of so little. A second inaugural suggests new beginnings, but this one is being bookended by dead-end debates. Gridlock over the fiscal cliff preceded it and gridlock over the debt limit, sequester, and budget will follow. After the election, the same people are in power in all the branches of government and they don’t get along. There’s no indication that the president’s clashes with House Republicans will end soon. Inaugural speeches are supposed to be huge and stirring. Presidents haul our heroes onstage, from George Washington to Martin Luther King Jr. George W. Bush brought the Liberty Bell. They use history to make greatness and achievements seem like something you can just take down from the shelf. Americans are not stuck in the rut of the day. But this might be too much for Obama’s second inaugural address: After the last four years, how do you call the nation and its elected representatives to common action while standing on the steps of a building where collective action goes to die? That bipartisan bag of tricks has been tried and it didn’t work. People don’t believe it. Congress’ approval rating is 14 percent, the lowest in history. In a December Gallup poll, 77 percent of those asked said the way Washington works is doing “serious harm” to the country. The challenge for President Obama’s speech is the challenge of his second term: how to be great when the environment stinks. Enhancing the president’s legacy requires something more than simply the clever application of predictable stratagems. Washington’s partisan rancor, the size of the problems facing government, and the limited amount of time before Obama is a lame duck all point to a single conclusion: The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat.

As you can see, any claim that this is analysis, and not opinion, is complete nonsense.

As the portions I’ve highlighted make clear, Dickerson’s entire piece was predicated on his obvious belief that Republicans are the problem, not Obama. All four of those paragraphs are loaded with criticism of the GOP, while Obama is presented as a reasonable man who tried his best to make things work only to find his noble intentions thwarted at every turn.

The love for Obama starts in the next paragraph, as the GOP bashing continues:

President Obama could, of course, resign himself to tending to the achievements of his first term. He’d make sure health care reform is implemented, nurse the economy back to health, and put the military on a new footing after two wars. But he’s more ambitious than that. He ran for president as a one-term senator with no executive experience. In his first term, he pushed for the biggest overhaul of health care possible because, as he told his aides, he wanted to make history. He may already have made it. There’s no question that he is already a president of consequence. But there’s no sign he’s content to ride out the second half of the game in the Barcalounger. He is approaching gun control, climate change, and immigration with wide and excited eyes. He’s not going for caretaker. How should the president proceed then, if he wants to be bold? The Barack Obama of the first administration might have approached the task by finding some Republicans to deal with and then start agreeing to some of their demands in hope that he would win some of their votes. It’s the traditional approach. Perhaps he could add a good deal more schmoozing with lawmakers, too. That’s the old way. He has abandoned that. He doesn’t think it will work and he doesn’t have the time. As Obama explained in his last press conference, he thinks the Republicans are dead set on opposing him. They cannot be unchained by schmoozing. Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence, other constraints will limit the chance for cooperation. Republican lawmakers worried about primary challenges in 2014 are not going to be willing partners. He probably has at most 18 months before people start dropping the lame-duck label in close proximity to his name.

“Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence…”

Whatevs.

A look at Dickerson’s previous Slate columns only bolsters the case that he has no business presenting himself on CBS News, or anywhere, as an unbiased political analyst.

But even if Dickerson’s DESTROY THEM! column is analysis, it’s ridiculously biased analysis, and biased only in favor of every premise Obama’s manufactured in his ongoing media/political war with the GOP.

Maybe that’s the problem… Maybe what the corrupt media now considers “objective analysis” is so comfortable in the tank with Obama, that those of us who live in the real world can no longer distinguish between the rantings of the politically bloodthirsty Left and the mainstream media’s idea of analysis.

Because there is no difference.

I'm saddened to report the collapse of my almost 17-year marriage to Mrs. TriSec. It was a great run while it lasted. We travelled, ran for public office, worked in a youth organization, worked for the school department, and built a small but comfortable life here in a Western suburb of Boston.

We had lots of sex, too. All great fun. But something curious happened. No babies ever came of it. We even managed to get ourselves de facto excommunicated from our religious community because we dared to seek the hand of man in our quest for a child. You know what we ended up doing, and our young son is turning twelve later this summer. [We adopted our son from the Philippines in 2002 - Ed.]

But all of that is for naught. Because my wife and I couldn't have children ""in the normal fashion"", our entire marriage is de-legitimized in some sections. So, I will be filing for divorce soon, on the grounds that we couldn't procreate and the entire thing was, and is, a sham.

The end of a marriage is a tragic thing. We survived said infertility problems, me getting laid off twice, bankruptcy, death of a parent, and even a major medical event that nearly took me. Normally, that which doesn't destroy you makes you stronger, but all of that pales in comparison to the lack of babies being produced. I suppose I need to blame somebody.

So...it's obviously my best man's fault. Here's a gentleman I have known since 8th grade. In some ways, he knows me better than my own flesh-and-blood brother. We grew up together, came of age together, and hell, even lived together for some 8 years after I finished college. (unfortunately, he never went.) Not very long before I was to be married, he rather sheepishly came out as gay, and wondered if this might change anything.

I recall telling him at the time that if it did, then everything we believed in was a lie.

Imagine my surprise in finding out some 17 years later that his being gay, and standing for me as my best man, was the sole reason for my marital demise. I figure that since God hates fags, He must have seen fit to punish us by denying us children, and condemning our marriage as illegitimate.

Now if I could only figure out how to divide all our possessions, the few remaining assets we have, and what to do with our son. I eagerly await the next instruction from the religious right. In the meantime, it seems easier for me to just stay living with my ex-wife and non-child for the duration."

Please vomit when you see me.,"Our mixed ancestral genesis, and demographics here on these shores, in the Caribbean, Latin America, and even in Europe, or in Africa itself (for example ""Cape Coloureds"" in South Africa) exhibits no inability on the part of ""whites"" to mingle sperm and ova with ""blacks"" or any other form of cross-ethnic fertilization and birth. We are homo sapiens sapiens, not different species. But it took until 1967 for the Supreme Court here in the U.S. to validate the right to marry across racial lines as the law of the land. The irony of Loving v. Virginia, which ended legal discrimination is in the surname ""Loving.""

I'm fed up with the denial about, and excuses made for Teapublican Christians who talk about Jesus's love on a Sunday morning out of one side of their mouth and excoriate ""race mixing"" out of the other. The path to the pews should carpeted in the vile retching of hypocrites.

Chief Justice Earl Warren ruled:

Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival. [...] To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State ... There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy.

Many couples across the U.S. now celebrate "" Loving Day .""

I know the history of so-called race mixing in the U.S. quite well. It has been standard practice since the pilgrims and colonists arrived on these shores with penises wielded as weapons of rape and ethnocide against Native Americans. Children were often born from these violent encounters. The rape statistics for Native American women do not abate, and those rapes are perpetrated mostly by white men.

What should be making us all puke is the continued abuse of women.

Hoax pamphlet whose author coined the tern ""miscegenation""

From the genesis of the hoax perpetrated by two news reporters which spawned the term ""miscegenation"" to the theories of the sterility and depravity of human ""mules"" or mulattoes, to the ideology of white supremacy that unleashed a reign of racial terror typecasting black men as rapists hell-bent on defiling the flowers of white womanhood, to the histories of many free people of color in southern climes due to sexual congress and often love between black men and mainly Irish indentured servant women, to the elite founders, like Thomas Jefferson who sired children with his white wife's half-sister Sally Hemings—race mixing has been as American as apple pie.

Black women were portrayed as demon temptresses exuding savage sexual heat, always available for white men's courser needs, when they were not cast as mammies providing a teat to nurse white babies. Some were ""privileged"" to be raised to be sold-off as concubines in elaborate quadroon balls of the plaçage system. Others were bred ""light"" or ""bright"" for the fancy trade and sold to bordellos.

As long as ""union"" was illicit, it proliferated. Yet it is the placing of a legal stamp of matrimony on this intercourse that so offended the sensibilities of the pious. Their bigotry has been bolstered by a long history of racialist pseudo science.

As genetic science has progressed in recent years, we accumulate more data on the geographical ancestry of those of us called ""African-Americans"" or blacks.

The popular PBS miniseries African-American Lives featured this data.

With the help of geneticists, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. put African-American ancestry in these terms:

• 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5 percent European ancestry (equivalent of one great-grandparent);

• 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25 percent European ancestry (equivalent of one grandparent);

• 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50 percent European ancestry (equivalent of one parent); and

• 5 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5 percent Native American ancestry (equivalent to one great-grandparent). Critics suggested the program did not fully acknowledge or inform guests (and the audience) that not all ancestry may show up in the tests. The genetic tests done on direct paternal or maternal line evaluate only a few ancestors among many. Ancestral information markers (AIM) must also be done to form a more complete picture of a person's ancestry. For instance, MtDNA testing is only of direct maternal ancestors. Unless other ancestry is evaluated, a person may miss a paternal line's connection to Europe. This gives a false impression that the person has little heritage of another ethnic group. AIM markers are not as clearly defined for all populations as suggested, and depend on data still being accumulated. Historic populations migrated, which also influences results. Particularly, critics note that genetic analysis is incomplete related to Native Americans, and new genetic markers for these populations may be identified.

We know that racialist pseudo science is not buried in the past. The internet has a sewer-full of sites that tout opposition to ""race-mixing"" and intermarriage. The comment sections of websites from Faux News, redstate, freerepublic, and even mainstream news agencies are chock-full of upchuck linking to, or quoting so-called ""authorities.""

Like this one: ""The health consequences of race mixing"" which has links to ""studies"" and throws in anecdotal observations, and ""data"":

It is commonly observed that a disproportionate number of white women who end up with black men are obese. Obese women tend to have elevated testosterone levels. Some portion of testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which amplifies the effect of testosterone at certain targets. DHT is also one of the culprits in the genesis of acne. Therefore, a higher incidence of, say, acne in black/white-mixed offspring with a white mother could simply reflect inheritance of the genetics of elevated androgens from the obese white mother rather than an effect of race mixing.

Pure claptrap and bigot babble.

When a Richard Cohen, or any other public pundit asserts ""today's GOP is not racist"" I admit I'm pleased to see the swift and immediate pushback. More important will be how GOP racism will translate into ballots cast against them in upcoming 2014 elections around the nation. They seem to be in denial that in spite of gagging bigots, we elected a black man of mixed ancestry to two terms in the White House.

Here's hoping we can retire quite a few more gagger-baggers from statehouses and the Congress.

Let them go home and vomit to their hearts content as private citizens, and while gagging invite Richard Cohen over to share a conventional meal.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/17/Second-Rubio-Staffer-Argued-American-Workers-Cant-Cut-It,2013-06-17 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Second Rubio Aide Argued Some Americans Not Cut Out for Workforce,"A second staffer for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) disparaged American workers during an interview with Ryan Lizza, a partial transcript of the interview the New Yorker reporter released Monday afternoon shows.

Originally, it appeared as though only one anonymous Rubio “aide” disparaged American workers and only did so in the context of speaking about low-skilled jobs in the U.S. However, the Lizza interview transcript shows two aides referenced low-skilled and high-skilled American workers.

Lizza asked the two staffers to respond to this statement: “Well their argument is, what, that they have American workers for these jobs, they don’t need this program.”

The thus-far unidentified “Rubio Aide 1” said that some workers either can’t or won’t make it in the work force anyway:

Yeah. I mean one of the problems you have with this, “Oh, there’s American workers who are unemployed.” There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it. There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you obviously can’t discuss that publicly because–

At that point, “Rubio Aide 2” interjected, “But the same is true for high-skilled workers.”

“Aide 1” then said, “Yes, and the same is true across every sector, in government, in everything.”

Lizza’s story had originally not specified that two Rubio aides made the argument, leaving a little room for Rubio’s staff to try to discredit the reporting.

As excerpted by Politico’s Mike Allen Sunday morning, Lizza’s story reported the exchange as follows:

Rubio sided with the Chamber against the construction workers. “There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it,” a Rubio aide told me. “There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you can’t obviously discuss that publicly.” In the end, the wage issue was settled to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s satisfaction, and the Building and Construction Trades union won a cap on the number of visas for foreign construction workers.

After National Review editor Rich Lowry picked up on how Rubio’s anonymous “aide” disparaged American workers, and published a piece on it, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant tried to argue Lizza’s reporting was inaccurate.

“We strongly objected to the magazine including that background quote in the piece because it’s not what Sen. Rubio believes or has ever argued,” Conant told Lowry. “In truth, Sen. Rubio has always said the reason we need a robust temporary worker program is to create legal avenues for US businesses to meet labor needs when not enough Americans apply for jobs… Sen. Rubio believes that American workers can compete against anyone in the world.”

Sen. Rubio himself gave a quote to The Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis publicly rejecting the comments. “The quote attributed to a member of my staff was a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program,” Rubio told Lewis. “It is not my view in any way. I could not disagree with it more.”

The transcript Lizza released casts doubt on whether the quote was simply “a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program.” Rather, it indicates the quotes were two Rubio staffers making the argument on their own, not in an abstract context. The transcript also shows that the two Rubio aides were talking about high-skilled and low-skilled American workers, not just those who would be part of a guest worker program.

After Lewis’s piece was published, Breitbart News reported that several immigration organization leaders and hill staffers have called on Sen. Rubio to publicly identify the aide who made those comments. NumbersUSA director of government relations Rosemary Jenks and Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian, as well as various hill staffers, called on Rubio to publicly identify the aide and terminate him or her.

On Twitter, National Review‘s Lowry asked Lizza, “i have no reason to doubt you but can you share any more of the context of that quote? rubio staff pushing bk hard.” He added that Rubio’s office’s pushback included Conant saying “the aide was describing some industries’ response to unions’ opposition to temp workers.”

When Lizza sent out the partial transcript of the interview, Lowry responded, “great, thank you. looks like you were exactly right unless im missing something.”"

Look up ""cat food"" in the index.

Release a budget with cuts to Social Security. The base pushes back: Um, we're Democrats. We don't cut Social Security! President Barack Obama gets defensive: But it's the Republicans' idea! Except that the Republicans didn't include Social Security cuts in their crazy draconian budget. Why? Because only a moron would step on that third rail. Re-read step #1. Republicans begin 2014 campaign, charging that Democrats want to cut Social Security.

Nobody could've predicted this, except everyone:

If there's any silver lining in this debacle, it's that it'll allow congressional Democrats the opportunity to distance themselves from this bumbling White House.

Unfortunately, they have to distance themselves from the party's leader, never a fun place for a politician to be. See 2006. And 2010.

What's craziest about this whole fiasco is how shellshocked the White House appears about it. It's as if they expected to be greeted with rose petals for ""making the tough choices"" or whatever bullshit they want to call it today."

When Barack Obama first took the presidential oath four years ago, his clan seemed poised to redefine the very contours of a first family, with a sprawling, international, multiracial, multireligious group. But the Kenyan family at the climax of his memoir, “Dreams From My Father,” has rarely been seen or heard from since the first inauguration, and instead the Obamas tell a far more conventional tale about a nuclear family.

In the student interview last week, Mrs. Obama shared a few updates from life at home, painting her usual portrait of a tightly knit, education-minded family. The president recently missed a parent-teacher conference for the first time, she told Maggie and the other student reporters. Malia and her parents are currently making a project of reading classic American novels together, from “Catcher in the Rye” to “Tender is the Night.” Now that Malia is getting older, she is recommending more music to her mother, recently introducing her to the pop singer Elle Varner.

As the Obama daughters filled television and computer screens in recent days, some commentators predicted that they would be more visible during their father’s second term, now that they were older. But the reverse could be true: the Obama girls are moving into the highly fraught realm of adolescence, with all of its social and academic demands.

“Now that my girls are getting older, they don’t want to spend that much time with me anyway, so I’ll be probably calling around, looking for somebody to play cards with me or something, because I’m getting kind of lonely in this big house,” the president said in a White House news conference last week.

The rituals of the teenage years — dates instead of play dates, college tours instead of ice cream stops — may require more privacy and protection, not less. Malia will not depart for college until the final months of her father’s term, and Sasha will be a 15-year-old high school student."
http://news.yahoo.com/conn-rifle-maker-end-aid-174057577.html,,[],"Conn., rifle maker end aid deal after killings","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Just days before 20 children and six educators were killed at a Connecticut school in December, state development officials offered the maker of the rifle used in the massacre a $1 million loan to bring new jobs to the state.

The offer, capping six months of negotiations between the Department of Economic and Community Development and Freedom Group, was dropped after private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management announced it would sell Freedom Group, manufacturer of the Bushmaster AR-15.

The deal was ended four days after the killings, according to a letter released in response to an open records request.

The Hartford Courant first reported the deal and its unraveling.

Deputy agency commissioner Ronald Angelo said Wednesday that Cerberus' announcement made the deal untenable. The announced sale led to several ""cordial, amicable"" phone conversations between the state and the company about the deal no longer being workable.

He said the killings also were a factor.

""It would be naive to think that that would not weigh on people's minds,"" he said, referring to the shooting deaths.

Freedom Group did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

In a Dec. 6 letter — eight days before the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School — the administration of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy offered a $1 million loan at 2 percent interest for 10 years to encourage Freedom Group to move its corporate headquarters to Stamford from North Carolina. The state would forgive $550,000 in exchange for the creation of 25 jobs.

Twelve days later — and four days after the massacre — the agency informed Freedom Group that the offer was withdrawn. Angelo said

Angelo said in an interview that Freedom Group approached state officials in June 2012 with a proposal to move the company's headquarters. The announcement by Cerberus that it would sell Freedom Group was ""an adverse financial condition,"" he said.

Days after the killings, investors started to avoid some of the nation's largest gun makers. Cerberus Capital Management announced it would sell the maker of the rifle used in the massacre, which it called a ""watershed event.""

Story continues

""We are investors, not statesmen or policy makers,"" Cerberus said at the time.

Stocks of other gun companies fell, and one sporting-goods chain said it would temporarily stop sales of military-style firearms.

As Malloy and Connecticut lawmakers were drafting gun control legislation, the governor wrote to manufacturers asking them to stay in the state despite what he said are differences over how to regulate firearms.

""Additionally, some of the issues related to gun violence prevention require the expertise of the manufacturing community and I welcome your involvement in crafting certain guidelines and strategies,"" Malloy wrote on March 6.

Wolf Blitzer Asks Tornado Survivor If She Thanked the Lord; Tells Him She’s an Atheist There was a moment of levity in Oklahoma Tuesday when CNN host Wolf Blitzer, concluding an interview with a woman named Rebecca and her 19-month-old son Anders who survived the devastating tornado, asked her if she thanked the Lord for a decision that saved her life. “I’m actually an atheist,” she replied, laughing. She added she wouldn’t blame other people for thanking the Lord, though. Rebecca left the house with Anders before it was destroyed by the tornado. She returned after it hit to see her husband Brian searching the remains of the home for her and their son, leading to a tearful reunion.

Update: Thanks to CS in AZ (among others) for pointing out the most irritating part of the exchange--Blitzer doesn't just make the off-hand ""You've gotta thank the lord, right?"" comment (which could be chalked up to one of those inane phrases that most of us say every day to random people we encounter, ala ""have a nice day""); when she failed to respond, he insisted on following it up with the more intrusive and insistent ""DO YOU thank him?""

I was half expecting him to keep going: ""DO ya? Huh? Do ya thank him? Huh? Huh? C'mon, do ya? Whatzamatter with you?""

Because perish the thought that she might not thank the lord for this bountiful gift that he's given to her entire community. Or, that is, the community that doesn't exist anymore..."

Instead, ""SNL"" took aim at itself.

The sketch, which opened on Jay Pharaoh's Barack Obama in the Oval Office, reeling from embarrassing political setbacks, quickly shifted gears with the arrival of Michelle Obama, then Oprah, then supposedly Beyonce. The catch? Kerry Washington was supposed to play all three of them, because ""SNL"" doesn't have any black women on its cast.

Cue the following mea culpa from the show's producers:

The Producers at ""Saturday Night Live"" would like to apologize to Kerry Washington for the number of black women she will be asked to play tonight. We made these requests only because Ms. Washington is an actress of considerable range and talent and also because ""SNL"" does not currently have a black woman in the cast. As for the latter reason, we agree that this is not an ideal situation, and look forward to rectifying it in the near future…unless, of course, we fall in love with another white guy first.

For all of ""SNL's"" staying power -- it has, after all, been on the air for most of four decades -- the one criticism it's never been able to escape is its startling lack of diversity. When ""SNL"" rolled out six new cast members in September, many voiced disappointment. Five of them are white men, and the one female addition, ""despite a heritage which includes Tunisian and Latina roots… has seemingly played just white characters onscreen,"" as NPR points out.

That criticism was renewed this week, as Kerry Washington, one of only a few leading black women on television, prepared to host.



Per the Associated Press:

The show has had four black women among its regular cast since coming on the air in 1975 with the last one, biracial Maya Rudolph, leaving in 2007. Both Pharoah and Thompson have recently addressed the situation in interviews, with Pharoah even lobbying for a specific comic to be added — Darmirra Brunson of the OWN sitcom ""Love Thy Neighbor.""

""It's not like it's not a priority for us,"" producer Lorne Michaels told the AP last week. ""It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.""

Good self-awareness, ""SNL."" Now do something about it!"

I have a new diary up with all the details at this link.

I'll continue updating this liveblog diary throughout the day. Updates will be posted below. General information can be found below the orange squiggle.

UPDATE 20: Dangerous rain-wrapped (completely obscured by rain) tornado moving through Okfuskee County into Creek County, Oklahoma.

UPDATE 19: News 9 helicopter showed many cars completely demolished after seeking shelter under an overpass on an interstate. NEVER SEEK SHELTER UNDER A OVERPASS. Wind accelerates under bridges.

UPDATE 18: ""Major, extensive damage"" from the tornado southeast of Oklahoma City near Shawnee along I-40.

Also, heads up Kansas City. The supercells have merged and formed a bow echo, moving east through eastern Kansas and into Missouri. The main threat here is 60+ MPH winds.

UPDATE 17: Half-mile wide tornado approaching north Shawnee OK along Interstate 40. KFOR keeps saying it's going to make a direct hit on the popular Shawnee Mall. Shawnee has a population of 30,000.

UPDATE 16: Large, violent tornado approaching Shawnee OK and the Shawnee Mall.

UPDATE 15: KFOR showing major damage to homes near Wellston OK. The helicopter pilot had to quickly move the camera off of damage due to injuries.

UPDATE 14: Tornado warning for Norman OK.

UPDATE 13: Mile-wide wedge tornado tearing through Carney, OK right now, population 649.

UPDATE 12: The mile-wide tornado approaching Carney OK just has an amazing radar presence. Textbook tornadic supercell.

UPDATE 11: Mile-wide tornado approaching Carney OK in Lincoln County.

UPDATE 10: Wellston OK is dangerously close to this very large, wedge tornado in Lincoln County OK. Over half a mile wide and growing.

UPDATE 9: Large, violent tornado on the ground in Luther, Oklahoma in Lincoln County, northeast of OKC. Not much of a condensation funnel but the tornado winds take up almost the whole width of the closed captioning.

UPDATE 8: Storm chaser Reed Timmer on KFOR just reported his intercept vehicle reported a 175 MPH wind when they drove into the tornado, which would make the Edmund tornado an EF-4.

UPDATE 7: Helicopter footage from KFOR-TV in OKC of a funnel cloud over I-35 in Edmund OK. This storm is cycling -- producing a tornado, lifts, produces another tornado, it lifts, etc. This is a dangerous storm.

UPDATE 6: Very large, confirmed tornado very near Edmund OK. The Weather Channel has live helicopter footage from KFOR.

UPDATE 5: Wichita is in the clear for now.

Here's a 3D volumetric radar display of the massive hail core in the thunderstorm that has moved northeast away from Wichita. Hail larger than golf balls is possible.

UPDATE 4:The rotation in Wichita has weakened somewhat, but the storm has a history of producing a large tornado.

UPDATE 3: From the NWS:

""A CONFIRMED LARGE AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TORNADO WAS LOCATED 7 MILES NORTHWEST OF HAYSVILLE MOVING NORTHEAST AT 30 MPH.

A LARGE WEDGE TORNADO WAS REPORTED ON THE GROUND 6 MILES NORTH OF CLEARWATER.

THIS IS A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION. MOBILE HOMES WILL BE DESTROYED. CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO HOMES, BUSINESSES, AND VEHICLES IS LIKELY AND COMPLETE DESTRUCTION POSSIBLE. FLYING DEBRIS WILL BE DEADLY TO PEOPLE AND ANIMALS. EXPECT TREES TO BE UPROOTED OR SNAPPED.""

UPDATE 2: The tornado is clearly visible on radar. It's going to come very close to Wichita, if not right through the city.

UPDATE 1: Confirmed tornado producing damage about to enter downtown Wichita, KS:"
http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2013/09/stop-or-theyll-shoot-a-video.html,,[],"Change of Subject: Stop, or they'll shoot (a video)","The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. recently installed a stop-sign enforcement camera at an intersection near a northwest side school. It was billed as a test of a system that will eventually include 32 such cameras district wide.



That’s right, a stop-sign camera – a device calibrated to detect and photograph all vehicles that don’t come to a complete halt before proceeding, as the law requires, then generate a $50 ticket to be mailed to the owner.



It’s an obvious idea. The Chicago Department of Transportation was reportedly considering it in 2004 as an alternative to speed bumps, intersection islands and other “traffic calming” devices in neighborhoods.



Talk about fishing where the fish are. Virtually no one comes to a full stop --- where the wheels lock and your head bobs back slightly --- at signs when there are no pedestrians, cross traffic or police officers present.



People say they do. They may even think they do. But they don’t. I’ve watched carefully for years.

They slow down. They pump their brakes. They perform what’s variously known as the “Rhode Island roll” or the “California stop.” And they’re safely on their way.



Police could write literally 100 tickets an hour for this violation at an intersection near my house every morning as drivers cut through the neighborhood on their way to the Kennedy Expressway. A ticket-cam would be the equivalent of a currency printing machine.



And perhaps because treating a stop sign as though it were a yield sign is so common --- and generally such a minor safety concern --- Big Brother with his photo enforcement cameras has largely chosen to ignore it.

The first and, until the D.C. rollout began Aug. 20, the only stop-sign camera program in the U.S. has operated since 2007 in the Santa Monica Mountains outside of Los Angeles under the auspices of the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority.



Sensors in the pavement detect when a car is traveling faster than 7 miles per hour as it approaches one of seven marked intersections. This activates a video camera, the images from which are later reviewed by park rangers .



And no, despite the location, the half-hearted “California stop” won’t get you out of a $100 ticket (formerly $175). The Authority has to share proceeds from the fines with the company that maintains the equipment.



When the program begin, officials insisted it was “100 percent about safety,” not revenue. Commuters were driving recklessly when using park roads as cut-throughs, said spokeswoman Dash Stolarz. Stop-sign camera revenue has actually fallen in recent years as drivers have gotten wise to them and as commuters have started avoiding the area, Stolarz said.



Washington D.C. police spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump also stressed safety last week when she said stop-sign cameras are planned only for “locations in the District near schools where flagrant stop sign running is a significant issue.”



Safety concerns are also supposedly why Chicago has 190 intersections monitored by red-light enforcement cameras and will have 50 camera enforced speed-zones by the end of the year, though this claim tends to be the cause of many local coughing fits.



What’s next?



“We don’t have any plans to do stop-sign cameras,” said city spokesman Tom Alexander.



Not yet. But you can bet that officials in cities and suburbs all across America will be monitoring the D.C. experiment closely. How much money will it make? Will a drop in accident statistics justify its expansion? Will the citizens rise up in revolt or, in the end, shrug it off as yet another inevitability in the surveillance society?

""We're hopeful that all of this portends a bigger improvement to the immigration system,"" said Lisa Koop, a managing attorney with the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center.

Several thousand people in the Chicago area stand to benefit from the new rule, which makes it easier for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens to apply for permanent residency by allowing them to sign up for a ""provisional unlawful presence waiver"" while still in this country.

Such waivers can be granted to people who have overstayed their visas or entered the U.S. illegally if they can prove that their families would suffer extreme hardship if they weren't allowed to stay in the country.

The waivers do not guarantee permanent residency status, but without one, illegal immigrants can be banned from the U.S. for 10 years or more.

The policy shift, which takes effect March 4, does away with a requirement that applicants return to their homeland to apply for the waiver. The process can take as long as a year, forcing even those who eventually get a waiver to endure long separations from their families, Obama administration officials said Wednesday.

With no guarantees that their waiver applications would be approved, many immigrants here illegally chose to remain in the shadows rather than be forced to leave their family during the application process, said Fred Tsao, policy director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

At the National Immigrant Justice Center, attorneys are preparing for an influx of cases after the policy goes into effect, Koop said.

Many clients who appear to be eligible for a waiver delayed their application after the new rule was proposed in April, she said.

The new rule still will require applicants to return to their native countries for an interview at a U.S. Consulate after a waiver is approved, Obama administration officials said.

Because an approved waiver application often means a successful immigration application, Koop said, the new rule allows applicants to hedge the risks they take in formally declaring their illegal status.

""If you have this waiver approved and then go down and have your visa interview, unless something else arises at that visa interview, there is a pretty high likelihood that your case will go through pretty smoothly at that point,"" she said.

After the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act on Wednesday, the restaurant chain's president and chief operating officer, Dan Cathy, apparently tweeted an anti-gay response to the ruling.

The court ruled Wednesday morning that DOMA, which barred the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, even in states where the union has already been legalized, is unconstitutional. Following the decision, the Supreme Court also dropped the case for Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban.

Upon hearing the news, some celebrated for equality while others complained about how society has changed for the worse. Cathy, who made headlines last summer for saying his company supports the ""biblical definition"" of marriage, stood with the latter camp.

The Wall Street Journal's Speakeasy reporter Charles Passy was the first to report that Cathy reportedly tweeted an anti-gay marriage statement following the DOMA verdict. A reader sent Passy the tweet, which said it was a ""sad day"" for the nation and that the ""founding fathers would be ashamed."" The post has been deleted.

The tweet is still available on Topsy, an online platform that can index and trackback tweets and web pages.

In a statement emailed to The Huffington Post on Thursday, a spokesperson for the fast-food restaurant discussed the company's stance, but wouldn't directly comment on Cathy's tweet. ""Dan Cathy, like everyone in this country, has his own views. However, Chick-fil-A is focused on providing great-tasting food and genuine hospitality to everyone,"" spokesman Jerry Johnston said.

Cathy's statement may not come as much of a surprise to some. The COO said in 2012 that ""we are inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, ‘We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,'"" the New York Times noted.

A backlash ensued after Cathy confirmed his anti-gay stance and his company was found to have ties to anti-gay groups, but Chick-fil-A claimed its only mission is to ""treat every person with honor, dignity and respect"" regardless of ""belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender."" The famed fried chicken joint has since tried to distance itself from any discrimination. Last September, it was reported that Chick-fil-A stopped donating to right-wing groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Cathy himself even seemed to progress, embracing a more open dialogue and befriending LGBT activist Shane Windmeyer, the founder and executive director of pro-LGBT college group Campus Pride.

UPDATE: 2:16 p.m. -- Chick-fil-A spokesman Jerry Johnston reached out to HuffPost Thursday afternoon to explain why Cathy decided to pull the tweet, saying, ""He realized his views didn’t necessarily represent the views of all customers, restaurant owners and employees and didn’t want to distract them from providing a great restaurant experience."""

John Hickenlooper this week blocked the execution of Nathan Dunlap, he called for a statewide conversation about the death penalty. His decision to reprieve the Chuck E. Cheese’s murderer came weeks after Colorado lawmakers killed a bill to abolish capital punishment on grounds that the topic needs more public debate.

But no such discussion has yet been planned yet by the politicians. In the meantime, civil rights watchdogs are hoping to advance the conversation in court by continuing to pursue a lawsuit tied to Dunlap’s execution.

“Up until two days ago, Colorado was scheduling an execution for this summer. The Governor has taken that execution off the calendar, but he has not taken the death penalty off the public agenda,” Mark Silverstein, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, said Friday. “The public has an interest in learning exactly what the state plans to do the next time an execution [lands on its calendar].”

Dunlap was convicted of killing four people in an Aurora Chuck E. Cheese’s restaurant in 1993. He exhausted legal appeals this spring and was scheduled for execution in August. The ACLU sued Colorado’s Department of Corrections on Tuesday seeking access to documentation that would detail how the state planned to put Dunlap to death.

Despite Dunlap’s reprieve and the fact that neither of the state’s two other death row inmates are scheduled for execution, the ACLU’s interest in state policies and procedures still stands. The group plans to pursue its legal battle to uncover details about the training, procedures and protocols the corrections department has put in place since executing its last inmate, Gary Davis, in 1997.

Of particular concern is how a lethal injection, the state’s method of execution, would be implemented. Davis was killed 15 years ago with three drugs, including a non-lethal dose of barbiturate or anesthetic, followed by a drug that caused paralysis and then a drug that caused death by cardiac arrest. The so-called three-drug cocktail, in which the anesthetic dosage sometimes is too low and doesn’t work, has drawn medical, legal and ethical criticism in several states for causing extreme pain while the prisoner is paralyzed and enduring a heart attack.

Colorado law specifically requires lethal injection be carried out by the continuous injection of just one drug.

Concerns about the methods to be used in Dunlap’s case heightened last month when corrections officials sent a letter to several pharmacists requesting “sodium thiopental, pentobarbital, pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride, or similar drug or drugs that the CDOC can purchase.” The drug list raised questions about whether corrections officials intended to abide by the one-drug statute, prompting the ACLU to seek copies of communications between the state and pharmacies and a secret document outlining DOC’s execution protocols.

Corrections officials refused to disclose those documents. They also declined to comment about the ACLU suit after Dunlap’s reprieve other than to say they intend to conceal the identities of the pharmacists willing to provide the drugs. Officials said they wanted to protect the pharmacists’ privacy and prevent “public pressures” such as protests and boycotts that, as spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson put it, “could interfere with our duty under the statute.”

Jacobson said her department is dedicated to carrying out the wishes of its former director Tom Clements, a death penalty opponent who was slain in March and who sought to improve relationships with the ACLU and other groups watchdogging the state prison system. She added that she “doesn’t disagree” that seeking the documents is a way to further the debate about the death penalty in Colorado.

“Still, our opinion is that the documents are restricted,” she added. “It looks like we’ll be discussing it in court.”

Continued conversation about how exactly Colorado would put inmates to death could affect the likelihood that the state’s two other death row inmates, Sir Mario Owens and Robert Ray, are ever executed. It could also affect sentencing decisions in cases in which the death penalty is being sought, cases such as the one against Edward Montour, whose guilty plea in the 2002 murder of a prison guard was tossed by a judge in April, and James Homes, the alleged shooter in last summer’s Aurora movie theater massacre.

The ACLU’s Silverstein says access to the DOC’s secret documents is as relevant as ever.

“We’re moving forward. More facts and more details about how executions are carried out will facilitate lots of conversations that need to take place about the death penalty.”

Hickenlooper’s announcement Wednesday to block Dunlap’s execution was applauded by dozens of social-justice groups, including the ACLU. Critics have derided Colorado’s capital punishment practices on legal and ethical grounds, including the fact that all three men on death row — Dunlap among them — are African American in a state with a population that’s less than 5 percent black.

“Colorado’s system of capital punishment is imperfect and inherently inequitable,” Hickenlooper said in announcing his decision. “Such a level of punishment really does demand perfection.”"

Bird’s new organization, “Battleground Texas,” will target Hispanic voters in the state to try to swing the Lone Star state in the direction of Democrats. Texas has for a long time been a Republican Party stronghold, and its 38 electoral college votes are crucial to any GOP presidential candidate’s run for office. If Texas becomes a battleground or Democratic Party state, Republican presidential candidates may be in dire danger. They’d have to spend time and money campaigning in the state, taking their focus off states that are already hotly contested.

Bird appears to understand this, and that’s why he’s targeting the state. “With its diversity and size, Texas should always be a battleground state where local elections are vigorously contested and anyone who wants to be our commander in chief has to compete and show they reflect Texas values. Yet for far too long, the state’s political leaders, both in Austin and in Washington, D.C., have failed to stand for Texans,” Bird told Politico. “Over the next several years, Battleground Texas will focus on expanding the electorate by registering more voters — and as importantly, by mobilizing Texans who are already registered voters but who have not been engaged in the democratic process.”

Politico quoted several anonymous Democratic consultants who said Bird plans to bring in top campaign talent and make a serious effort at competing in the state.

Republicans, on the other hand, are still regaining their footing after the beat down they endured in the last election cycle – and didn’t have a specific plan when Breitbart News asked for one.

Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told Breitbart News though that the GOP is “in the midst of the party’s winter meeting down here in Charlotte” where GOP leaders are crafting “the vision and role of the party going forward” including “specifically the ways that we can grow it and win more elections.”"

Gannett Washington Bureau

Proponents hope to attract 70 votes in the Senate to force the House to act

Opponents don%27t think the bill does enough to secure the border

Supporters aim to pass it before the July Fourth recess

WASHINGTON — As the Senate heads back into session Monday, it is poised to take up a sweeping immigration bill that would offer earned citizenship to many of the 11 million immigrants who entered the United States illegally before 2012.

Supporters of the bill crafted by the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" senators guided it to passage in the Senate Judiciary Committee last month while fending off amendments that would have broken apart their coalition of labor and business groups, Catholics and evangelical Christians, and law enforcement and civil rights' groups.

Now, proponents of the bill face an even tougher challenge: how to lure more Republicans to support the legislation without alienating Democrats and losing the support of key immigrant rights' groups.

""It's a balancing act,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration expert and professor of law at Cornell University Law School. ""The Gang of Eight has done a great job so far of walking that tightrope. Now we'll see whether they can continue to do so on the Senate floor.""

The Senate is expected to begin debating the bill by June 10. Supporters hope to pass it before the Fourth of July recess.

""The final bill won't be exactly what passed out of the committee,"" said Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who will manage the floor debate on the bill. ""The most important thing is to have a path to citizenship for the most people possible in a way that ultimately benefits and strengthens the United States of America.""

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who is one of four Gang of Eight Republicans along with fellow Arizona Sen. John McCain, said he is worried about whether the bill can be amended to pick up enough Republican votes to create a show of force to House GOP leaders. Supporters of the bill are hoping to attract about 70 votes from the 100-member Senate.

""We can pass this out of the Senate,"" Flake said. ""The question is, can we get enough votes to convince the House to vote.""

Flake said he expects amendments from Republicans on border security and on government benefits and tax breaks for immigrants who gain legal status.

""There is a lot of dissatisfaction among Republicans that the border stuff is not tough enough, that there are no real triggers,"" said Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a coalition of business groups. ""There certainly are going to be people who are pushing for more teeth, different standards and meaningful triggers.""

The bill requires a 90% effectiveness rate for security along the entire Southwest border and prevents undocumented immigrants who are granted provisional legal status from receiving any federal means-tested public benefits such as welfare or Medicaid.

But conservative critics don't like the fact that undocumented immigrants would gain temporary legal status before all of the border requirements have to be met. And some want to deny the newly legalized immigrants any federal, state or local aid or tax breaks, even when they earn green cards and become permanent legal residents.

""This is a tricky period,"" said Frank Sharry, America's Voice, an immigrant rights group that supports the reform bill. ""If they (Gang of Eight senators) go too far in trying to placate Republicans and undermine the parts of the bill that brought the progressive coalition to the table, they could lose us.""

Specifically, immigrant rights leaders say they don't want border security requirements that are so rigid they are impossible to meet. If those requirements are tied to citizenship, then millions of people would remain here with no hope of ever becoming citizens or even legal permanent residents, immigrant rights leaders say.

""We already have a path to legality in this bill that is quite narrow, quite hard and quite long,"" said Clarissa Martinez, director of civic engagement and immigration at the National Council of La Raza. ""We are going to be vigilant about opposing any amendments that intend to make that path even harder because that might make citizenship unattainable.""

Cutting off all federal aid to newly legalized citizens could have unintended consequences, such as denying them disaster aid in the event of a powerful tornado or hurricane, Martinez said.

""We just went through this horrific tornado in Oklahoma,"" Martinez said. ""What happens if your house has been leveled, your job has been obliterated, one of your family members ends up in the hospital as the result of a tragic event? People need to be able to survive while they work and wait to become citizens.""

Groups that oppose increased immigration say there is no way to salvage the bill and that conservatives should work to defeat it rather than amend it.

""If the bill were to be essentially torn up and replaced with one that required E-Verify and border security and an entry-exit visa system before legalization, it would be less bad, but the Gang of Eight couldn't support that,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. The center opposes increased immigration and is a strong supporter of mandatory E-Verify, the electronic federal database that allows employers to check whether new hires are legally eligible to work in the United States. Arizona law already requires employers to use the system.

Krikorian said it's possible that liberals could end up killing the bill if they offer a controversial amendment to allow gay Americans to bring in their foreign partners on family reunification visas.

""I could see Republicans voting for it as a poison pill kind of thing,"" he said. ""But I doubt that (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid will let it go that far. I think the Democrats have essentially told the gay rights groups that they need to hold off for now.""

Liberal Democrats also are expected to offer amendments that would continue to allow siblings and adult married children to immigrate to the U.S. on family reunification visas. Under the current bill, those family categories would be eliminated to allow for more employment-based visas sought by businesses and favored by many Republicans.

""What if your only family member is a sibling?"" Martinez said. ""We'd like to see more flexibility there before we do away with something that is tried and true and replace it with a new system.""

While many Democrats favor changes to help gay couples and reunite all family members, they are not expected to vote against the bill if those amendments fail.

""They see the larger goal of passing immigration reform as more important,"" Yale-Loehr said.

Jacoby said she doesn't think the bill will drastically change on the Senate floor, even though she and other business advocates would like to see an increase in the number of visas made available to lower-skilled workers. She cited the influence of the labor giant AFL-CIO, which seeks to protect American workers.

""There will be some drama, but I think a lot of it is locked in by the Gang of Eight,"" said Jacoby, whose organization is a national coalition of small- and medium-size-business owners that pushes for immigration reforms to benefit employers. ""They have a pretty protective approach, the Gang of Eight does, and they feel that if they change any of the labor stuff, the AFL will bolt, and that basically gives the AFL a trump card.""

The lobbyist for NumbersUSA, which opposes the bill, said she believes it will be defeated. The group is running TV ads nationwide saying the legislation would hurt U.S. citizens and legal residents at a time when 20 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed.

""I think the bill is in serious trouble,"" said Rosemary Jenks, government relations director for NumbersUSA, which opposes increased immigration. ""I don't think they have the 60 votes (needed to fend off a conservative filibuster). They are not going to get all 55 Democrats, especially the ones from red states. And I don't see them getting enough Republicans to make it to 60.""

But supporters of the bill say they don't see the strong anti-immigrant sentiment that they saw in 2007, when the last attempt at an immigration overhaul failed.

""This is totally different,"" said Jeff Hauser, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, which is part of the coalition supporting the bill. ""It's not just that Latino and pro-immigration groups are stronger, there's just nothing going on on the other side. We're not seeing the big anti-immigration protests that we saw before.""

Leahy said both sides realize that Americans are fed up with the current system.

""The American people don't believe the status quo is working,"" he said. ""If senators are serious about fixing the problem, this bill will pass."""

Amendment Introduced By Kansas Senator Faust-Goudeau,"This controversial action came as a result of a bill requiring citizens to take drug tests in order to be eligible for welfare and unemployment. If citizens fail, they are refused or cut off from the government assistance.

Faust-Goudeau believes the same should apply for government lawmakers; after all, they are beneficiaries of government funding, as well. Faust-Goudeau says the current bill unfairly targets the poor and...



There is a lot at risk for those who do not pass the drug test mandated by the new bill. The first failure would require drug treatment and job skills programs. That’s not too bad. If you fail a second test, however, you would lose benefits for a year. A third failure would cause you too lose welfare or unemployment benefits for life. Pretty steep, especially for someone caught in the grip of addiction. It might take several attempts to get on the road to recovery.

Senate Vice President Jeff King, R-Independence, said the basic bill is an attempt to help people with addiction to get help — and prevent state tax dollars from being used to buy illegal drugs. That sounds fair – as long as the same applies to lawmakers and government-assisted business owners. All for one, one for all. It’s the only fair thing.

I will do a happy dance if drug testing for Congress becomes a federal law. A lot of the country would celebrate, if anything, for the irony and fairness of it all. And how refreshing to see more and more mighty and brave politicians like Faust-Goudeau, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Al Franken buck the system and status quo, by taking on Goliaths like big banks and the U.S. government. Here’s to those rabble-rousers… this is what ‘for the people’ looks like.

http://ph.news.yahoo.com/us-shutdown-likely-house-republicans-amend-budget-bill-212424371.html,,[],US on brink of government shutdown,"The United States stumbled to within hours of a government shutdown, as a budget duel between President Barack Obama and Republicans threatened America with a self-inflicted economic wound. As a mood of crisis enveloped Washington, three hours before a midnight deadline (0400 GMT), there were no signs of compromise to head off the first such disaster in 17 years. Instead, the Democratic-led Senate and Republican House of Representatives played a futile game, sending funding bills between them that were doomed to fail. The US Senate late Monday swiftly killed the latest House measure to delay Obama's health care law. Obama accused Republicans of holding America to ransom with their ""extreme"" political demands, while his opponents struck back at his party's supposed arrogance. Around 800,000 government workers faced being sent home, government services were to be slashed and monuments such as the Statue of Liberty and national parks were to be closed. The crisis is rooted in an attempt by ""Tea Party"" Republicans in the House of Representative to make passage of a new government budget conditional on thwarting Obama's signature health reform law. The Democratic-led Senate and the president have repeatedly rejected this strategy and are urging Republicans to pass an extension to government funding to temporarily stave off the shutdown. In a deeper sense, the shutdown is the most serious crisis yet in a series of rolling ideological skirmishes between Democrat Obama and House Republicans over the size of the US government and its role in national life. ""One faction of one party in one house of Congress in one branch of government doesn't get to shut down the entire government just to re-fight the results of an election,"" Obama said, referring to his own re-election. ""Time is running out. My hope and expectation is that in the eleventh hour once again, that Congress will choose to do the right thing and that the House of Representatives in particular will choose the right thing. ""You don't get to extract a ransom for doing your job, for doing what you're supposed to be doing anyway,"" he said, in a stern televised statement at the White House. But on a day of accelerating brinkmanship, Republicans doubled down on their bid to gut Obamacare, as the health care law, the most sweeping social legislation in decades, is known. With just three hours to go, House lawmakers passed a bill that would delay the individual mandate, which forces all Americans to buy health insurance under the new law, for a year. ""It's a matter of fairness for all Americans,"" said Republican House speaker John Boehner, who has struggled to control the riotous anti-government Tea Party faction of his caucus. But the Senate, which must also sign off on budget measures, immediately rejected the bill. That left House leaders with perhaps a final decision on whether to pass the ""clean"" budget resolution stripped of all political riders that Democrats are demanding, before the government closes down. Democratic congressman Alan Grayson accused Republicans of ""playing charades"" and trying to deprive 40 million uninsured Americans of health care. But one Republican, congressman Lou Barletta believed that a last minute compromise could emerge. ""At the end of the day we'll vote for a clean (budget) ... to keep the government running."" Obama warned that a government shutdown could badly damage an economy which has endured a sluggish recovery from the worst recession in decades. ""A shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people, right away. Past shutdowns have disrupted the economy significantly,"" Obama said. Consultants Macroeconomic Advisors said the shutdown would slow growth, recorded at a 2.5 percent annual pace in the second quarter. A two-week shutdown would cut 0.3 percentage point off of gross domestic production. A shutdown would also have a painful personal impact on workers affected -- leaving them to dip into savings or delay mortgage payments, monthly car loan bills and other spending. Stocks on Monday retreated as traders braced for the shutdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 128.57 points (0.84 percent) to 15,129.67. Markets are likely to be even more traumatized if there is no quick solution to the next fast approaching crisis. Republicans are also demanding Obama make concessions in the health care law to secure a lifting of the current $16.7 trillion debt ceiling, without which the United States would begin to default on its debts for the first time in history by the middle of October. ""Congress needs to keep our government open, needs to pay our bills on time, and never, ever threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America,"" Obama said. But Boehner hit back, saying the health law, large tranches of which come into force on Tuesday, was ""not ready for prime time."" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer meanwhile likened Boehner to a priest in a Mayan ceremony, making ""a sacrificial offering to the right-wing gods."" The dispute is threatening Obama's plans to head to Asia for a week-long trip on Saturday to pursue his rebalancing of foreign policy towards the dynamic region. Polls show more Americans would blame Republicans for the shutdown than Democrats, leaving Boehner torn between his party's wider political interests and a vocal section of his own party."

President Barack Obama said media coverage could determine future of bipartisanship

Howard Kurtz: Fox News, Rush Limbaugh have influence, but White House has bigger voice

He says conservative media gained support because of belief established media leaned left

I never realized that the conservative media were so eye-poppingly powerful.

So mighty, in fact, that liberal politicians can't seem to stop talking about how they are running roughshod over the country.

My response: Can we please stop the whining?

Howard Kurtz

The latest to rant about the right is Al Gore. The former vice president told Charlie Rose that President Barack Obama had been cautious, and when the CBS anchor asked whether there was ""a very hostile environment for progressive ideas,"" Gore had his culprit ready:

""Fox News and right-wing talk radio. In Tennessee there's an old saying if you see a turtle on a fence post you can be pretty sure it didn't get there by itself. And the fact that we have 24/7 propaganda masquerading as news, it does have an impact.""

OK, Gore doesn't like Fox. So he started what he hoped would be a liberal counterweight in Current TV, spent millions on such stars as Keith Olbermann, and ... the channel flopped. It was such a failure that he just sold it to Al Jazeera for an estimated personal take of $100 million.

Leave aside the obvious contradiction of a climate change crusader selling to a network largely financed by the petrodollar kingdom of Qatar. Whatever you think of Fox, Rupert Murdoch's network has been a financial success and Current TV was anything but. Isn't that the free market at work?

Obama often invokes the conservative media, most recently in an interview with The New Republic. Asked about working with Republicans in his second term, the president said: ""One of the biggest factors is going to be how the media shapes debates. If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you'll see more of them doing it.""

Now it's true that Fox or Limbaugh can boost or batter any lawmaker, and that they can help drive a controversy into the broader mainstream media. But we're talking here about the president of the United States. He has an army, a navy and a bunch of nuclear weapons, not to mention an ability to command the airwaves at a moment's notice. And he's complaining about a cable channel and a radio talk-show host?

Limbaugh later offered this response: ""If Fox News and I are the only thing keeping the Republicans from caving to Barack Obama on every issue, I'm not paid enough.""

I have been through this before. It was on my ""Reliable Sources"" program, in the fall of 2009, that the White House declared war on Fox News. Anita Dunn, then the White House communications director, called Fox ""the communications arm of the Republican Party"" and said, ""It is not really a news network anymore.""

The resulting furor gave Fox months of fodder and was widely judged a tactical misstep that if anything elevated the network's role.

There are times when many Fox programs, including in the nonopinion hours, appear to be on a jihad against the administration. And these days, MSNBC can be counted on to defend the Democrats almost around the clock.

But let's face it: These are cable channels with relatively modest audiences, and their impact is sometimes exaggerated inside the Beltway echo chamber. After all, Obama handily won re-election despite the best efforts of Sean Hannity and Limbaugh.

What liberals sometimes forget is that the conservative media took root because many Americans felt the fourth estate was too left-wing. ABC, NBC, CBS, NPR, The New York Times and The Washington Post all strive for fairness, in my view, but there is little question that they have a social and cultural outlook that leans to the left. Collectively, they have far more weight than Fox, talk radio and The Wall Street Journal editorial page.

Right-wing pundits make a convenient foil, but at times Obama seems to magnify their importance. After all, he's got the biggest bully pulpit of all."

Blagojevich, earlier found guilty of lying to the FBI, stammered ""yes"" even as his lawyers shouted objections, which were summarily rejected by U.S. District Judge James Zagel. The judge later allowed the characterization repeated in the government's closing argument.

And that, contends the legal team for the now imprisoned Blagojevich, is just one of a litany of errors and one-sided rulings from Zagel that undermined a robust defense and now cries out for a higher court to reverse his convictions on 18 criminal counts.

Read the full text of the Blagojevich appeal

The formal name of the government's case was ""USA v. Blagojevich,"" but if defense appeals came with their own titles, the 153-page document filed late Monday with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals might be called ""Blagojevich vs. Zagel.""

Blagojevich was convicted of misusing his powers as governor in an array of shakedown schemes, including one to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the 2008 election of Barack Obama as president. His two trials, in 2010 and 2011, were marked by running battles between Zagel and Blagojevich's lawyers over motions, rulings, evidence and even the courtroom demeanor of the attorneys and the defendant himself.

And there was no letup in the appeal, which all but flatly declares that the veteran judge might as well have been sitting at the prosecution table.

""It would take too much space to catalog each erroneous evidentiary ruling by the lower court,"" asserted the appeal, prepared by a team of lawyers led by criminal-defense specialist Leonard Goodman of Chicago.

The filing accused Zagel of preventing Blagojevich from demonstrating through testimony or evidence that he believed he was acting lawfully and in good faith. Zagel, the lawyers charged, induced Blagojevich to take the stand in his own defense, then severely limited what he could say, allegedly making him look ""foolish"" rather than sympathetic.

They also attacked Zagel for seating a juror who the lawyers contend appeared predisposed to convict Blagojevich during questioning before testimony began. What's more, they accused Zagel of giving bad jury instructions and abusing his discretion over sentencing to hand out an unusually long 14-year prison sentence.

The scattershot nature of the legal arguments in some ways reflects the aggressive, slash and burn public style that Blagojevich long fashioned for himself. As governor, and even later as a criminal defendant, Blagojevich often portrayed himself as a champion of the little guy besieged by powerful political forces out to thwart him.

That theme plays out in his appellate filing. Blagojevich, it declared, was a sometimes frustrated champion of expanded children's health care trying to seize on his power to pick a Senate replacement to bring his advocacy to a new level. Had Blagojevich ""not sought a political benefit in return, he would have done a disservice to all of his supporters,"" the appeal claimed.

Some legal experts questioned whether such sweeping appeal tactics, especially attacks on Zagel, will hold much sway with appellate judges at the Chicago-based 7th Circuit which has one of the lowest criminal reversal ratings in the nation.

Joel Bertocchi, a veteran appellate attorney in Chicago, said an appeal that focuses on a few key issues is stronger when it comes time to argue. ""It's better to try to punch holes in the case rather than knock the whole thing over,"" he said.

Painting Zagel as biased could hurt more than help, said Bertocchi, who indicated the judge is well regarded by appellate judges as ""smart and very experienced."" He added that the appellate judges would be reluctant to reverse rulings over which Zagel has discretion, among them the scope of wiretapped recordings that could be played at trial or what testimony could be given.

Another hurdle for the defense is that, even if appellate judges can be convinced that Zagel erred, it needs to have been serious enough to invalidate a conviction.

""""You can always criticize a ruling, but the bottom line is did it really affect the outcome of the trial?"" said Mike Rathsack, another Chicago appellate specialist.

In Rathsack's view, perhaps the strongest argument laid out by Blagojevich's lawyers was their claim that Zagel gave an improper legal instruction to jurors, in effect lowering the bar for a finding of guilt.

The appeal contends that under the law, Zagel should have told jurors that to convict Blagojevich, they would have to be convinced that the evidence showed he had ""knowledge of wrongdoing."" Zagel jettisoned that wording at Blagojevich's second trial, informing jurors instead that ""the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew his acts were unlawful.""

Improper revision or not, the question for appellate judges will be ""did that really affect the jury's decision?"" Rathsack said.

Lauren Kaeseberg, one of Blagojevich's lawyers, said the appeal struck many themes, but the most predominant was that Zagel prevented the former governor from putting on an effective defense.

""Whether it was limiting Rod's testimony in improper and unconstitutional ways, not being able to play tapes that would corroborate his testimony ... there is so much the jury didn't hear,"" Kaeseberg said. She also said Zagel's ruling led the jury to be misinformed about where the line is between legitimate political horse-trading and criminal activity.

""The cornerstone of the defense is he always acted in good faith. Rod did not ever believe he was breaking the law,"" she said.

Blagojevich did not testify at his first trial, even though one of his lawyers promised jurors he would at the start of the proceedings. That trial ended with the jury hung on most counts and convicting him on only one — lying to the FBI about the level of his personal involvement in political fundraising.

Posner has made news again, this time by voicing second thoughts about his 2007 decision to uphold Indiana’s voter ID law.

The ruling was later affirmed by a 6 to 3 vote of the Supreme Court. But Posner says, in a new book, that the Indiana law was of “a type . . . now widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention.” In recent interviews, the judge chalked up his mistake to the plaintiff’s lawyers’ failure to present “strong indications that requiring additional voter identification would actually disenfranchise people entitled to vote.”

Some critics of voter ID laws may revel in Posner’s confession. I wish he’d kept his mouth shut. Not because I’m a fan of voter ID laws — I’m not — but because Posner’s casual mea culpa is improper behavior for a sitting federal judge.

The Code of Conduct for United States Judges discourages members of the bench from opining on the issues of the day. They may “speak, write, lecture, and teach on both law-related and nonlegal subjects,” as long as that doesn’t “detract from the dignity of the judge’s office” or “reflect adversely on the judge’s impartiality,” among other caveats.

Not the clearest line, to be sure — it has proved flexible enough to accommodate Posner’s vast opus, which, over the years, has included dozens of books and articles on subjects ranging from antitrust to sex, as well as a popular blog. HuffPost Live calls Posner “the premier American public intellectual” of our time.

Yet however blurry that line may be, by publicly recanting one of his decisions while still on the bench, Posner has finally crossed it.

His comments amount to intervention in a live political, and legal, issue, cloaked — whether or not he intends it — in the authority of his judicial office. Indeed, his comments carry the authority of someone who previously considered the matter in court and has now switched sides. It’s as if Harry Blackmun, the author of Roe v. Wade, came out against abortion rights while still a justice.

It doesn’t help matters that Posner’s confession of error contained a gratuitious slap at the losing lawyers or that it hinged on a vague notion of how the Indiana law, and others like it, are now “regarded.” As it happens, opinion polls consistently show that voter ID laws are popular among voters of both parties.

When I presented this data to Posner, he replied by e-mail, “That’s not my impression. I believe that all but one of the photo ID identification laws were passed by state legislatures that are Republican controlled.”

He and I could debate this forever. But that’s just the point — judges shouldn’t engage in the hurly-burly of political argument. It fosters the impression, corrosive to the rule of law, that there is no difference between a judicial process and a legislative one.

Posner isn’t overly troubled by such considerations. “I would like to see more realism about judges,” he said. Their rulings are not Olympian pronouncements but the products of factors ranging from black-letter law to personal opinion. He said he sees no reason for judges to be “bashful” about admitting mistakes.

This is a standard theme for Posner. Of course, it poses a contradiction: If it is realistic to be skeptical about judges’ capacity for deciding cases objectively, why should we trust their subsequent claims of error?

Posnerian realism is not quite the insight that he seems to think it is. As a wise philosopher said centuries ago, “Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.” And that includes the rule of law.

I suppose Posner’s constant commentary makes his court more transparent, in the sense that it gives lawyers and potential litigants more information about his thinking. It’s just not the sort of transparency traditionally associated with a legitimate judicial process.

Would federal courts enjoy a better reputation if every judge spouted his views as freely as Posner does? A worse reputation? Before you answer, consider this less-publicized selection from his recent comments: “I don’t really share the widespread concern with surveillance by the NSA,” he told the Huffington Post. “If they want to read my emails, they’re welcome.”

The best judges maximize their impartiality, actual and perceived, even at the cost of self-restraint in their public statements. They do so because the public is entitled to a judicial process that earnestly aspires to fairness and objectivity, however elusive those goals might be. They understand that there is a fine line between realism and cynicism.

They understand that the American people give them $185,000 a year, plus life tenure, power and prestige, to be public servants — not public intellectuals.

The Arizona Republic

Earlier%2C House GOP leaders rejected Senate package

Reformers say Boehner%2C Ryan making effort to find solutions

Reform critics say they also plan to make their voices heard at town hall meetings

PHOENIX -- Despite the missed goals, uncertain timetable and at-times heated rhetoric in the Republican-led House of Representatives, immigration-reform supporters remain cautiously optimistic that a game plan is emerging that will have lawmakers voting on the legislation this year.

Action in the House is on hold until after Congress returns from its August recess on Sept. 9. But the five-week break, during which representatives will hold town hall meetings and otherwise gauge the feelings of their constituents, could go a long way toward determining the legislation's fate.

Immigration-rights activists this month are planning to press their case with House lawmakers. Business, religious, law-enforcement and labor groups already have been lobbying aggressively for reform. Opponents of immigration reform — which many critics call ""amnesty"" for law-breaking immigrants — also are expected to make their voices heard, but the House's inaction so far has provided little to galvanize them.

The break comes as other developments offer renewed hope for supporters of immigration reform.

While House Republican leaders flatly rejected the comprehensive immigration package that the Senate passed June 27, making it seem as though immigration reform was destined to die a slow death,it appears likely that votes on a series of bills are possible in October and that a conference committee with the Senate could be completed in December or early next year, before midterm election-year politics paralyze Capitol Hill.

Reform advocates say they detect a sincere effort by Republican leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to come up with solutions for the most vexing problems associated with the nation's broken border system, including addressing the status of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants who have already settled in the country.

At a town hall meeting last month in Racine, Wis., Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee and a possible 2016 White House hopeful, told the audience that the group ofHouse immigration bills would include one ""to legalize people who are undocumented,"" the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

Hoping to avoid the broad pathway to citizenship included in the Senate-passed plan, many House Republicans are more open to legislation without a special path for most undocumented immigrants. They are more inclined tolimit citizenship to young undocumented immigrants, known as ""dreamers,"" and leave the majority of the 11 million who have no legal status without a certain path to citizenship. The idea would allow many to work toward citizenship through existing channels, such as having their children or employers sponsor them, which would be more difficult than allowing them to apply for citizenship on their own after they received permanent residency.

While many reform backers disagree with that concept, they say it at least would provide a starting point for House and Senate negotiations on bringing undocumented immigrants out of the shadows.

Even controversial remarks, such as those made by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa — who caused a furor recently by comparing dreamers with drug runners — might wind up helping the reform movement by reminding Republicans of the political damage that immigration hard-liners can do the GOP brand among Latino voters.

Boehner called King's comments ""deeply offensive and wrong"" and contrary to the values of the American people and the Republican Party.

Since President Barack Obama's 2012 defeat of Republican Mitt Romney, many Republican leaders have said that the GOP needs to make rebuilding its relationship with Latino voters a priority.

""My sense is ... that momentum is growing,"" said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., who is part of a bipartisan House group that for months has been working on a comprehensive immigration-reform bill. ""Even, to some degree, you're beginning to hear House Republicans change their tune. It's still got a lot of sour notes in it, but at least they are now singing a tune that is talking about possibly getting this done. But it is decision time. We are watching the clock run out.""

Frustrations mount

So far, the House immigration push mostly has been a series of disappointments for supporters.

Becerra's group has yet to produce a bill, and on a recent media conference call, he acknowledged that it has taken longer than expected.

""Many of us would have preferred to have done this before the August recess,"" he said.

Others similarly had hoped that the House would pass at least one immigration-related bill — border-security legislation was seen as the likeliest candidate — before the break, but that didn't happen, either.

Boehner's criticism of the Senate bill, which passed on a 68-32 vote, and insistence that any House immigration legislation have the support of a majority of Republicans, also has complicated matters.

August could prove pivotal. Reform supporters and immigration-rights activists aim to keep up the drumbeat for a pathway to citizenship and let Congress members know that they are not giving up.

""The August recess is very important because ... we're trying to make it clear to our Republican colleagues, including those in Arizona, that we'd like for them to pass the legislation that they think is best,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the lead GOP negotiator on the Senate bill. ""Then, we would look forward to a conference and trying to meet the concerns of both sides and come up with legislation. I believe we all share the conclusion that the status quo is unacceptable.""

Promise Arizona, a pro-reform organization founded in opposition to the controversial 2010 state immigration law known as Senate Bill 1070, and a coalition of 22 other groups this month plan to step up the pressure on Republican members of Arizona's House delegation.

In June, Promise Arizona sent flower bouquets to McCain and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., to thank them for writing and helping to pass the Senate bill.

""Republicans need to see (immigration reform) as an opportunity,"" said Petra Falcon, Promise Arizona's executive director. ""It's an opportunity for the GOP to turn around its image and get to working on other things. Immigration reform should be an easy answer.""

Critics of immigration reform say they intend to make their own points at town halls this month.

""We're planning on making all of the events of the congressmen and congresswomen,"" said Tim Rafferty, president of the group RidersUSA, a Phoenix-area organization that recently put up a billboard promoting Flake's role in ""the Flake-Obama amnesty."" The group is part of a coalition called ""Remember 1986"" for the year a previous law provided amnesty to nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants.

'It's not going to be pretty'

While the scope of the mobilization of immigration foes remains to be seen, one leading reform advocate said supporters have a ""tremendous amount of activity"" planned around the country.

""We're pretty confident that we'll come out of the summer with momentum and we're optimistic that the House of Republicans are going to find a way to get to 'yes,'"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based organization America's Voice. ""It's not going to bepretty and it's not going to be quick, but I really do think that they get that doing nothing is not an option ... that as a political party they can't deny that a majority of the people want reform and that a mobilized majority of Latinos want respect.""

Sharry noted that the blowback from King's derogatory comments about dreamers already was overshadowing the strides made by McCain, Flake and other Republicans who backed the Senate immigration bill. Sharry and Flake both said the controversy should provide House Republicans extra motivation to get immigration reform done.

""I don't think most Republicans want to be tarred with that brush, and most Republicans don't feel that way,"" Flake said. ""But when people like Steve King keep saying things like that it, unfortunately, kind of puts everybody in the same category. I think people want to resist that and want to do something to show that we want to move ahead.""

Other observers also said that there may be cause for cautious optimism about immigration reform's chances in the House.

The Senate took a top-down approach, with a group of influential senators leading the way, while the House is taking more of a bottom-up approach, but House Republicans are grappling with the issues and asking ""what can we do, how far can we stretch,"" said Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a coalition of business groups that backs immigration reform.

More Republicans are talking about a way to achieve legal status for undocumented immigrants without a special path to citizenship, Jacoby said. And from her perspective, the House's take on workplace enforcement, a lower-skilled worker program and border security might turn out better than the Senate's.

""The House could come through in ways that really would advance the ball and be helpful and be part of the solution,"" she said. ""It's not going to be the Senate way, but I don't think the question is going to be the Senate way or nothing.""

That's right, y'all, that Rick Perry lovin' state that has cut its public education budget to bits and pieces so while the number of students in public schools in Texas have exploded, costs haven't kept up.

In elementary school they teach you this nifty thing called ""cause and effect."" What's it look like when you live in a state where the cost per pupil gets cut? Well, you get a dive in graduation rates for one. Hey 42nd in the nation isn't too bad, everyone will always be better than Mississippi!

It's part of a much greater problem we have in the United States called governmental preeminence discombobulation. In south speak we'd say ""y'all, ain't right.""

This is a photo of President Barack Obama sitting at a Bar-B-Q joint in Austin, Texas after a speech he gave on Thursday to a crowd at Manor New Technology High School. See those folks sitting with him? That one woman... is Caroline Sweet an educator talking to the President about Charter Schools - photo by White House Photog Pete Souza and meme'd by Education Austin.

Our entire education system is so messed up and the President is just compounding the problem. At Manor New Technology High School the President said (these are excerpts of his speech):



""Every young person in America deserves a world-class education. We've got an obligation to give it to them. And, by the way, that helps the whole economy. Every business in America we want to draw from the world's highest-skilled and most educated workforce. We can make that happen. But we're going to have to put our shoulder against the wheel and work a little harder than we're doing right now as a nation. ""We've also got to start rethinking and redesigning America's high schools. That's part of what's happening here is there's innovation going on that equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. There's a lot of hands-on learning here. People aren't just sitting at a desk reading all the time."" ""And finally, we know that even with better high schools, if you want a good job and work your way into the middle class, most young people are going to need some higher education. Unfortunately, in recent years, college costs have skyrocketed and that's left too many students and their families saddled with a mountain of debt. So we've worked to make college more affordable for millions of students already and families through tax credits, grants; more access to student loans that go farther than before. We've reformed the student loan process by putting students ahead of big banks, providing options to make it easier for young people to repay these loans. ""

""Enacted largest reform of student aid in 40 years"" - Right so you basically didn't make education cheaper you just took over taking my payments. Cost didn't change, accessibility didn't change... just who I write my check to did. Ok. Check. ""Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010"" - Here's the description. The Affordable Care Act. So basically you won't have medical debt and student loan debt at the same time. Doesn't stop Philly from closing 47 schools or 50 in Chicago. Or college more affordable or create more jobs for new graduates or pay interns for their work. But, you don't have to file for bankruptcy at 23 if you're in a car wreck. ""Established President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability to assist in financial education for all Americans."" - Was Google down in the office or something? You gotta have a ""council"" to figure out about how much it sucks to try and pay for school? What's next a blue ribbon commission on how school doesn't prepare you for life? ""Increased funding for land-grant college."" - Which is awesome because that funding was about to get cut by their states who would rather give tax cuts. So did it really go up? Or just did we just shift responsibility to the federal budget? ""Provided means for students struggling to make college loan payments to refinance."" Sorry Timmy, you still own $120,000 for that Art History degree, but now we can refinance it so suicide doesn't look quite as appealing as it once did. ""Expanded Pell Grants for low-income students."" - Cost of college has increased 1120% in the last 30 years are these Pell Grants even keeping up needs? #JustSayin. Look, this is good, it really does help, but it's a band-aid on a blown off leg ten years too late. There is an entire generation of young people who needed help then and who are working more than full time and can't pay their bills. I work with some, I use to live with one. What can be done for those who graduated between 2000 and 2010.

Here's my question: What legislation has the White House come out in supportive of or actively lobbied for since 2009 that would achieve this rhetorical bloviation? Well... let's use ObamaAchievements.org under education:

Rhetoric is all well and good, but let's talk about the reality. The President has no power to control the budget for Texas high schools or state funding to higher education to decrease contributions required by students and/or their families. The only bills that can make it better come with a dead president's pictures on them. You gotta show me the money. Instead.... all we do is what Caroline Sweet pointed out. We create the Two Americas where if you can kick in some extra money for a charter school you have a fancier education even if it doesn't result in better test scores. Maybe that charter school can afford to pay a college prep person who can help students apply for the coveted public/private partnership so the 1% can bless us with their trickle down scholarships. Even Senator Elizabeth Warren's bill, which is awesome and wonderful and hey she's from my home state, really only seeks to reduce the interest rate on student loan payments, because she knows she's powerless to reduce the high cost of education or lack of education funding. What she's doing, is realistically all she can do, and bless her for it, but we need Elizabeth Warren's in state houses across America.

So, Mr. President, can we cut the BS and talk about truly reforming education? No. Actually, we can't. Because that reality would cost this country more than we're willing to spend and there is no way we'd ever get the 113th Congress to agree to prioritize young people over tanks and missiles defense contractors. So.... we give speeches and we talk about how we want to have high standards and don't want to pay for it, and then we blame the teacher and the student for complaining. We publicly humiliate educators who could make more working less at Starbucks and we punish the student who sees tests for what they are.

So what do we do? I actually think closing the school district in Michigan was a good idea. The students walking out in protest in Philly is a better one. I think regardless of which of these options is preferred we as students, teachers, parents, community allies we just stand up and walk out. We say stop. Until elected officials develop the political will to create lasting and meaningful education reform that works and prioritizes learning and not just facts and figures and ""sit down and shut up"" I think we stop school. Time for some tough love. Walk out of your class rooms and straight into state houses across the country and say no more."

Miss America from 2011%2C Teresa Scanlan%2C attends super-conservative Patrick Henry College

The school requires students to dress modestly and seek parental counsel when pursuing romance

Scanlan won the Miss America Contest at 17 representing Nebraska

PURCELLVILLE, Va. (AP) — It's a startling contrast to some observers — the glamorous, bikini-clad Miss America from 2011, Teresa Scanlan, finding her home at the tiny, super-conservative Patrick Henry College. The school requires students to dress modestly and ""seek parental counsel when pursuing a romantic relationship.""

But the match has been a good one. Scanlan returned to campus in late August to begin her sophomore year. Among the things she loves about her classmates and her campus: ""I've never had to sign an autograph, and I've never had to take a picture. Here, I can be just another student,"" she said.

Blending in is not always easy for Scanlan, who won the Miss America Contest at 17, representing Nebraska. The youngest Miss America in more than 70 years, she spent a year fulfilling her duties and enrolled at Patrick Henry in 2012. She says the school's workload matched the grueling schedule as Miss America.

The school was established in 2000 with the goal of giving home-schooled Christian conservatives a foundation to help them effect change in government, the law and journalism.

The school started with 90 students and a single major — government. It is still a tiny campus in the outer suburbs of Washington, D.C., but now has 320 students and five majors, including journalism, literature and history. The SAT scores of its students are comparable to top-tier state universities.

Scanlan, who came from a homeschooling family, says she wanted to go to Patrick Henry ever since she was 8.

She said she's frustrated by stereotypes that some hold about Patrick Henry students. She recalled a recent photo essay published about the school that she felt went out of its way to depict students as cloistered weirdos. The reality, she said, is that while the students are Christian, they come from a variety of backgrounds.

""There's this idea that we don't struggle with the same problems, that we don't understand real world problems ... that everyone comes from wonderful, happy families, that we're close-minded and brainwashed. That kind of pushes my buttons,"" she said.

The degree to which some people are willing to make snap judgments about her has occasionally taken her aback. As a teenager, she admits her schedule as Miss America and some of the accompanying expectations, wore on her. The negativity she faced from anonymous Internet critics was hurtful.

""To have someone look at a picture of you and decide just based on that picture that they hate you, and that they're going to tell the world that they hate you — that takes some getting used to,"" she said.

During her year as Miss America, she began to feel depressed and, at times, even suicidal. The depression continued during her freshman year, she said, when she found her coursework grueling, with a heavy emphasis on reading and writing. She earned a 3.75 grade-point average, but was disappointed because she had set a goal of a 3.9 or higher, which she feels she needs to get accepted into Harvard Law School.

She reached out to her parents for help during her spring semester, and she's now taking fewer classes and worrying less about others' expectations.

""I'm finally starting to let go of some of the stress, some of the responsibility,"" she said.

While she loves her school, she said she has occasionally received criticism from some there who feel the Miss America pageant, particularly the swimsuit competition, is not compatible with a Christian lifestyle because it shows too much skin or objectifies women. Scanlan respectfully disagrees.

""I have never violated my conscience. I was never compromising my morals,"" she said. ""For myself, I have never believed it's wrong for a female to wear a swimsuit that would show the same amount of skin a man. It's a bit of a double standard.""

The school's founder and chancellor, Mike Farris, also said he received sporadic complaints that Scanlan's status as a Miss America was supposedly contrary to the school's code and values.

""I don't view getting into the pageant world to be incompatible with Christian values,"" said Farris — who made his name as a lawyer defending homeschooler families.

Farris never had any doubts that Scanlan would be a good ambassador for the school. Farris sensed she could be a starter on Patrick Henry's Moot Court team, which Farris coaches and regularly wins national championships.

""She's very bright, a great communicator,"" Farris said, noting she placed third in a regional in Moot Court championships as a freshman. ""Yeah, no doubt I expect a national championship out of her.""

Kira Clark, a Moot Court teammate of Scanlan's and now a roommate, described Scanlan as ""a caring, incredibly ambitious, smart, compassionate person who puts her friends first.""

On the small campus, she said students don't dwell on the fact that Scanlan was Miss America.

""We see her as a sister we can be proud of, rather than a celebrity we can be taking advantage of,"" Clark said.

Despite her plans to reduce stress, Scanlan remains ambitious. On her LinkedIn profile, she lists herself, among other things, as ""2028 presidential candidate."" She would be 35, the constitutional minimum to serve as president.

Farris, who designed the school with the idea of launching Christian conservatives into the public sphere, said Scanlan and many other Patrick Henry students set such goals and he encourages them to aim high.

""If they mess up and only get to be governors and senators, I'll live with it,"" Farris said."

Some of you have read a lot of carping from me about ""the other 1% problem,"" the fact that about 1% of our population now fights our wars, and we don't hesitate to involve them in stupid and endless wars because, after all, they volunteered.

I cannot improve on a comment under the editorial signed by one Judy Allen from Beaumont, Texas, who in this comment makes me proud to claim her as a Texan:



My husband is a 33-plus year veteran who retired as a Master Sergeant from service in the U.S. Army and the Texas Air National Guard. Sure, cut our retirement, deny us benefits; who are we? We don't underperform fraudulent contracts and have a consistent record of cost-overruns, for which we are regularly rewarded with new contracts in 7 to 8 figures. We aren't or weren't working on a project which the military decided wasn't needed, but which Congressional representatives decided must continue anyway because it benefitted their district. Don't touch any of those expenses -- No, No, No. The ordinary serving military are ripe for the cuts; who cares what they think about getting kicked anyway? Some of them are still in harm's way. If I could speak to them, I would tell them: Put down your weapons, turn those ships around, demand immediate return to the states and walk away from whatever you were doing for the U.S. Those in this country with their hands on the till don't care about what you endure, just so long as they don't have to go or send their kids to serve. As a good friend said to my husband during Thanksgiving dinner, he resented that our medical care was paid for by his tax dollars. (We did nothing to deserve it, obviously.) That's a good tea-party Republican for you. My husband was aghast; he returned home disgusted. This country is being destroyed from within by partisan stupidity paid for by the 1 percent.

Ms. Allen is right. We have a 1% problem in who calls the political shots and another 1% problem in who gets to go to war. President Bush II started a new tradition that says now we can go to war without even paying for it on the books...or, rather, we'll put in on the cuff so there's no immediate pain and make it up later by cutting Social Security and Medicare.

http://news.yahoo.com/senators-closing-deal-reopen-government-072617244.html,,[],Senators closing in on deal to reopen government,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate leaders are closing in on an agreement to reopen the government and forestall an economy-rattling default on U.S. obligations.

Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky could seal an agreement on Tuesday, just two days before the Treasury Department says it will run out of borrowing capacity.

The emerging pact would reopen the government through Jan. 15 and permit the Treasury to borrow normally until early to mid-February, easing dual crises that have sapped confidence in the economy and taken a sledgehammer to the GOP's poll numbers.

""The general framework is there"" between Reid and McConnell, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. He said conversations with the House were continuing and he thought it would be midday Tuesday at the earliest before a plan was finalized.

President Barack Obama telephoned McConnell on Monday to talk about the emerging deal, a McConnell aide said. Congressional leaders had been scheduled to meet with Obama at the White House on Monday, but the meeting was postponed to allow more time for negotiations.

On Wall Street, futures were mixed early Tuesday, with investors somewhat optimistic over a potential deal.

Sen. Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who was part of the bipartisan group known as the Gang of 12 which labored over the weekend to end the stalemate, said Tuesday he was ""pretty confident"" the Senate leadership and the White House would announce an agreement some time later in the day.

Speaking of the House, Pryor told CNN that ""some Republicans are, quite honestly, they're acting childish about this. They almost want a shutdown. They almost want to see us break the debt ceiling.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., also a part of the Gang of 12, told ""CBS This Morning"" she believes an agreement is near that ""doesn't contain a lot of the partisan pills"" that sank earlier proposals. She said it's urgent that national leaders find solutions to vexing issues so that the country doesn't ""lurch from one financial crisis to another.""

Story continues

Many House conservatives were unhappy about the emerging framework, though it remained to be seen whether they would seek to change it.

""One of the things we want to test is just basic fairness,"" Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, an influential group of House conservatives, said on CNN Tuesday. He was asked how conservatives would respond to the plan taking shape in the Senate. ""One of the things we don't want to see is just another patch,"" he said.

""We're willing to get the government open. We want to get the government open,"" Scalise said. ""Hopefully they get something done that addresses the spending issue.""

The developing plan is a far cry from the assault on ""Obamacare"" that tea party Republicans originally demanded as a condition for a short-term funding bill to keep the government fully operational. It lacks the budget cuts demanded by Republicans in exchange for increasing the government's $16.7 trillion borrowing cap.

Nor does the framework contain any of a secondary set of House GOP demands, like a one-year delay in the health law's mandate that individuals buy insurance. Instead, it appeared likely to tighten income verification requirements for individuals who qualify for Obamacare subsidies and may repeal a $63 fee that companies must pay for each person they cover under the big health care overhaul beginning in 2014.

Democratic and Republican aides described the outlines of the potential agreement on condition of anonymity because the discussions were ongoing.

But with GOP poll numbers plummeting and the country growing weary of a shutdown entering its third week, Senate Republicans in particular were eager to end the shutdown — and avoid an even greater crisis if the government were to default later this month.

Any legislation backed by both Reid and McConnell can be expected to sail through the Senate, though any individual senators could delay it.

But it's another story in the House, where it wasn't winning a lot of fans among conservatives.

Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, signaled that conservative members of the House were deeply skeptical. He said any bill had to have serious spending cuts for him to vote to raise the debt ceiling and said he thought Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had more flexibility than they had said publicly.

""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" Barton said.

Asked whether the emerging package contained any victories for Republicans, Rep. James Lankford, R-Okla., a member of the House GOP leadership, said, ""Not that I've seen so far, no.""

McConnell briefed House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Monday on the status of the Senate talks. Both House and Senate GOP leaders scheduled closed-door meetings of their respective memberships for Tuesday.

In addition to approving legislation to fund the government until late this year and avert a possible debt crisis later this week or month, the potential pact would set up broader budget negotiations between the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate. One goal of those talks would be to ease automatic spending cuts that began in March and could deepen in January, when about $20 billion in further cuts are set to slam the Pentagon.

Democrats were standing against a GOP-backed proposal to suspend a medical device tax that was enacted as part of the health care law.

Democrats also were seeking to preserve the Treasury Department's ability to use extraordinary accounting measures to buy additional time after the government reaches any extended debt ceiling. Such measures have permitted Treasury to avert a default for almost five months since the government officially hit the debt limit in mid-May, but wouldn't buy anywhere near that kind of time next year, experts said.

Some lawmakers are frustrated that defusing the immediate standoff simply sets up another fight next year.

""It's punting because no one, Democrats, Republicans wants to face up — and the American people — to the tough reality that we're in,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. ""It's all a temporary fix.""

http://www.nytimes.com/news/fiscal-crisis/,,[],Fiscal Crisis,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. — Bonnie Clarfield spent Thursday morning carrying out detritus from the government shutdown at the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area: park closure signs, caution tape, and armfuls of trash.

Ms. Clarfield, a supervisory ranger at the park, north of Los Angeles, spent the first three hours of her workday taking down the signs — 16 of them, some torn in shreds — and cleaning up after vandals who had expressed their frustration with the shutdown, in some cases posting their own messages. One read, “Congress Can’t Shut Down the Park.”

Three gates were also broken during the two-week shutdown. And an old redwood sign, a fixture for decades, was stolen.

Yet, Ms. Clarfield was all smiles, happy that she could open the park to the public again. “It’s been a rough two weeks,” said Ms. Clarfield, who was one of the few rangers left on duty to police the area while it was closed.

“We had a lot of vandalism of infrastructure,” she said. “People were frustrated, and they were taking it out on the rangers. We were doing our jobs, and they were taking it out on the messengers.”

“I feel great today,” she added. “No one’s been mad at me. Everyone is happy to be back. There was a flood of people this morning, all coming to their favorite park to walk, and there were just smiles across people’s faces because they were happy to be back.”

Jahna Bochte, 28, was one of them. She lives nearby and says she runs the park’s trails several times a week. “When it was closed, I couldn’t come up here, so I didn’t run at all,” Ms. Bochte said. “I feel like a fatty.”

“I learned this morning at 5 a.m. that an agreement was made, and I knew it would be open,” she said. “The first thing I did today was come here.”

Barbara Stanifer, 46, who said she had been coming here for 20 years, returned for a hike. “This place is busy all the time,” she said. “To have it closed down — there are plenty of other places to hike, but this one is so great, and so many people come here to hike all the time.”

“I was angry about the whole thing, more than just this park,” she added. “I love coming out here where it’s quiet, and you can get inside your head a little bit more. I think it’s such a shame that they couldn’t get things together enough that they’re not shutting down basic things. This is a wonderful place, and we should be able to come utilize it.”

Ms. Stanifer said she was a Republican for a long time, but had switched parties. “I think the politicians in Washington hold some equal responsibility, but I do think the right-wing conservatives are a little out of control, and need to be sort of reined in,” she said.

Rob Lind, 69, biked to the park from his home about a mile away. He said he rides about four times a week.

“Last week I was shocked to see it closed. I rode up to the entrance, and it was barricaded,” said Mr. Lind, who added that he had not known that the park was federal property. “This is one of the more majestic areas anywhere to bike, so it was disappointing to see it.”

“I’m really discouraged with the government on this,” he said. “I think I probably speak for about 99.8 percent of the population when I say it’s disgraceful. I’m delighted it’s back open. I’m glad they got it open so quickly. I think that’s really a tribute to the park rangers.”

Mr. Lind said he had been a registered Republican for most of his life, but is now an independent. “The Republican Party is not what I knew it to be now,” he said. “The shutdown really epitomizes it. As far as a moderate Republican goes, there’s no such thing anymore. That’s what I considered myself, and I think a lot of other people do too.

“The party has really swung to one extreme,” he added. “But I believe in the pendulum swing, and I believe it will swing back to the mean.”"

First lady Michelle Obama speaks at a luncheon at The Chicago Hilton while visiting Chicago for a discussion with Mayor Rahm Emanuel and civic leaders on ways to combat youth violence. She will also make a stop afterward at Harper High School, where students and alumni have been hit hard by gun violence.

First lady Michelle Obama’s remarks to a luncheon meeting at the Hilton Chicago on Tuesday to address ways to combat youth violence: MRS. OBAMA: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you so much. Thank you. It’s good to be home. It is. (Applause.) Even though it’s freezing cold in April, it’s good to be home. (Applause.) It is certainly a pleasure to be here with all of you today. I want to start by thanking Rahm for that very kind introduction and that very powerful statement of what our kids in this city need, and also for his outstanding leadership here in this city. I also want to acknowledge Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Thank you all for being here. It’s good to see you. You’re all looking good. It’s very good. (Applause.) And of course, I want to recognize Jim Reynolds as well as Tom Wilson for taking the lead as co-chairs of the Public Safety Action Committee. Thank you both for your leadership, for your words, for your service. We are so very proud of you. And most of all, I want to thank all of you for coming here today on behalf of this city’s young people. I want to thank you for your commitment to their safety, their wellbeing, and their God-given potential. And I know that many of you aren’t new to this work. For years, you have been sponsoring sports leagues, afterschool programs, summer jobs and more. So you in this room know firsthand the impact that we can have when this city truly invests in our children. And that’s something I know from my own experience, which is why it was so important for me to be here today. I’m here today because Chicago is my home. I was born and raised here. I built my career here. Several of my bosses are here -- former bosses are here. (Laughter.) I met and married the love of my life here. I raised my children here, who, by the way, still refer to Chicago as home. They believe it gives them a little more credibility. (Applause.) So let me tell you, when it comes to ensuring the health and development and success of young people in this city, for me, this is my passion, it is my mission. And for me, this is personal because my story would not be possible without this city. And that’s where I want to start today -– by talking about our city and the neighborhoods that make us who we are. As you all know, Chicago is truly a city of neighborhoods, separated by parks and boulevards. It’s a city where walking just a few blocks can put you into an entirely different world of experiences. Cut through a park, and you go from English to Spanish, black to white, Puerto Rican to Polish. Cross a few streets, and you go from historic homes and manicured lawns to abandoned buildings and dark street corners. So the opportunities available to a child growing up in one neighborhood in this city might be vastly different than a child growing up just five blocks away. And that difference can shape their lives and their life prospects from the moment they’re born. That was certainly the case for me. As Rahm said, I was born and raised in South Shore. Our neighbors were teachers and secretaries, city workers; also a few professionals, doctors, lawyers, business owners. Most folks weren’t wealthy. A lot of people never went to college. And we generally couldn’t afford things like private music lessons or tutoring. But thanks in part to this city, our lives were still rich with opportunities. We had decent public schools. I am a product of our public schools. We attended the Chicago Park District summer camps. Got a lot of ribbons from those camps I’m quite proud of. (Laughter.) Played basketball on city courts. Our churches ran programs to expose us to music and the arts. So we didn’t have to be children of privilege to get the opportunity to enrich ourselves. And back then, our parents knew that if they loved and encouraged us, if they kept us off the streets and out of trouble, then we’d be okay. They knew that if they did everything right, we’d have a chance. But today, for too many families and children in this city, that’s simply no longer the case. Today, too many kids in this city are living just a few El stops, sometimes even just a few blocks, from shiny skyscrapers and leafy parks and world-class museums and universities, yet all of that might as well be in a different state, even in a different continent. Because many of our children have never been to the Art Institute or Millennium Park. Many of them don’t even know that the University of Chicago exists, let alone dream of attending that university -– or any university for that matter. They haven’t strolled along Navy Pier. Some of them have probably never even seen the lake. Because instead of spending their days enjoying the abundance of riches this city has to offer, they are consumed with watching their backs. They’re afraid to walk alone, because they might get jumped. They’re afraid to walk in groups, because that might identify them as part of a gang and put them at risk. At Harper High School in Englewood, where I’ll be visiting later on today, a newly-hired teacher noticed that when classes ended in the afternoon, kids would leave the building and walk right down the middle of the street. Now, at first, she thought this was just typical adolescent misbehavior. But one student explained that it’s actually safest that way, even with all the cars whizzing by, because it gives them the best view of any fights or shootings, and they have more time to run. Thousands of children in this city live in neighborhoods where a funeral for a teenager is considered unfortunate, but not unusual; where wandering onto the wrong block or even just standing on your own front porch can mean putting yourself at risk.

Those are the odds that so many young people are facing in this city –- young people like Hadiya Pendleton, whose funeral I attended back in February. And we all know Hadiya’s story. She was 15 years old, an honor student at King College Prep. And she came from a good family -– two devoted parents, plenty of cousins, solid godparents and grandparents, an adoring little brother. The Pendletons are hardworking people. They’re churchgoing folks. And Hadiya’s mother did everything she could for her daughter. She enrolled her in every activity you could imagine -– cheerleading, majorettes, the praise dance ministry -– anything to keep her off the streets and keep her busy. And as I visited with the Pendleton family at Hadiya’s funeral, I couldn’t get over how familiar they felt to me. Because what I realized was Hadiya’s family was just like my family. Hadiya Pendleton was me, and I was her. But I got to grow up, and go to Princeton and Harvard Law School, and have a career and a family and the most blessed life I could ever imagine. And Hadiya? Oh, we know that story. Just a week after she performed at my husband’s inauguration, she went to a park with some friends and got shot in the back because some kid thought she was in a gang. Hadiya’s family did everything right, but she still didn’t have a chance. And that story -– the story of Hadiya’s life and death –- we read that story day after day, month after month, year after year in this city and around this country. So I’m not talking about something that’s happening in a warzone halfway around the world. I am talking about what’s happening in the city that we call home, the city where we’re raising our kids, the city where your businesses operate. This kind of violence is what so many young people like Hadiyah Pendleton are dealing with every single day. And those two boys charged with her shooting -– this is the violence they were facing as well. And you have to wonder: What if, instead of roaming around with guns, boys like them had access to a computer lab or a community center or some decent basketball courts? Maybe everything would have turned out differently. Maybe they would be doing their homework, or taking jump shots, or learning a new program instead of looking for trouble. Maybe if these kids saw some kind of decent future for themselves, instead of shootings, there would just be fistfights, some angry words exchanged. And then maybe -- just maybe -- today, more of our young people would be in classrooms and at jobs, instead of in custody, facing even worse odds than they started out with. See, at the end of the day, this is the point I want to make -– that resources matter. They matter. That what it takes to build strong, successful young people isn’t genetics, or pedigree, or good luck. It’s opportunity. And I know from my own experience. I started out with exactly the same aptitude -– exactly the same intellectual, emotional capabilities -– as so many of my peers. And the only thing that separated me from them was that I had a few more advantages than some of them did. I had adults who pushed me. I had activities that engaged me, schools that prepared me to succeed. I had a community that supported me and a neighborhood where I felt safe. And in the end, that was the difference between growing up and becoming a lawyer, a mother, and First Lady of the United States, and being shot dead at the age of 15. And that is why this new fund that you’ve created here in Chicago is so important. It is so important. As you’ve heard, this fund will help create those ladders of opportunities for all of our kids. It will give our children mentors who push them and nurture them. It will teach them the life skills they need to succeed. It will give them alternatives to gangs and drugs -- safe places where they can learn something and stay out of trouble. Because we know that every single child in this city has boundless promise no matter where they live. And whether we give them the chance to fulfill that promise and grow into productive adults who lead meaningful lives -– see, that’s on us. That’s our job. And our kids know when we’re fulfilling that obligation. They know. They know the difference between lip service and reality. They see it and feel it every single day. So we can host all the luncheons and make all the announcements we want. But at the end of the day, if our kids keep waking up in neighborhoods where they don’t feel safe on their own front porches, if they’re still attending schools with crumbling ceilings and ripped-up textbooks, if there’s nowhere safe for them to go when that afternoon bell rings, then nothing speaks louder than that. Nothing. So let’s be clear. This is going to take a serious and sustained investment over a very long period of time, people. This is forever. And I am here today to join the call to all of you -– Chicago’s most distinguished business and community leaders -– to take up this challenge with fervor. And I hope that communities across America will follow Chicago’s lead to get our young people off the streets and back on track to successful lives. (Applause.) Right now, my husband is fighting as hard as he can, and engaging as many people as he can, to pass common-sense reforms to protect our children from gun violence. (Applause.) And these reforms deserve a vote in Congress. (Applause.) As he has said, we can’t stop all the violence in the world. But if there is even one thing we can do, even one step we can take to save another child, or another parent from the grief that’s visited families like Hadiya’s and so many others here today, then don’t we have an obligation to try? But we all know that these reforms must be just one part of a comprehensive effort to rebuild our neighborhoods and build a better future for our children. And if anyone can make that happen, it’s all of you. You all are some of the most creative, innovative, influential people not just in this city, but in the entire country. You have brought together folks from all across Chicago to do great things for this city, like build Millennium Park, host the NATO Summit -- quite well, by the way -- make the lakefront the cultural jewel of the Midwest."

""Benghazi, Benghazi, you let them die!"" the man shouted, referring to Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans -- including two members of the CIA's security team -- who were killed in the attack.

Clinton spoke over the heckler, drawing cheers from the crowd.

(CNN) – Republicans continued to put Hillary Clinton at the center of their inquest into last September's attack in Benghazi, claiming Sunday the former secretary of state wasn't assigned enough blame in an independent probe of the incident.

But in singling out the top Democratic presidential prospect for 2016, Republicans find themselves balancing their quest for answers with charges of being overly aggressive in a bid for political gain.



Speaking Sunday, the Republican lawmaker leading the charge in Congress to investigate the Benghazi attack said his goal was not to tarnish Clinton's presidential chances.

""Hillary Clinton's not a target. President Obama is not a target. The target is how did we fail three different ways,"" Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

His remarks came after week of renewed interest in the Benghazi saga, and fresh charges of politicization from Democrats. On Wednesday, Issa's oversight panel heard an account of the Benghazi siege from a former top diplomat in Libya, who described a harrowing night that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to the country.

The hearing, which lasted five hours, drew loud protests from the White House and Congressional Democrats, who accused Republicans of rehashing a case that has already been investigated by an independent review board.

Witnesses in Wednesday's hearing, including the former Deputy Chief of Mission in Libya Gregory Hicks, questioned the legitimacy of that board's report on the Benghazi attack, suggesting it did not include accounts from key witnesses to the assault who were on the ground as it happened.

On Sunday, critics also questioned why Clinton herself wasn't assigned more blame in the report.

""Obviously she was the decision maker at the State Department,"" Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, said on CBS ""Face the Nation,"" adding she was ""surprised"" Clinton wasn't probed further.

The co-chair of the review board, former Ambassador Thomas Pickering, defended his work on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" arguing his panel was charged specifically with investigating security decisions, which he said were not made at Clinton's level.

""She has already made clear the buck stopped with her,"" former Ambassador Thomas Pickering said. ""But we were interested in where the decisions were made. And she did not make the security decisions.""

Pickering's report, released late last year, found ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" at the State Department in the lead-up to the attack in Benghazi, which left four Americans dead. As a result, four State Department officials were disciplined immediately after the report's release. One resigned, while three others were placed on administrative leave and relieved of their duties.

Those actions were deemed insufficient by some Republicans, including Sen. Rand Paul, who told Clinton during a hearing in January he would have ""relieved you of your post"" had he been president.

He made similar remarks on Friday, telling a crowd of Iowa Republicans that Clinton's actions were ""inexcusable"" and should ""preclude her from holding higher office."" Paul is openly considering a bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.

His remarks in front of potential Iowa caucus-goers only fueled Democratic accusations Sunday that the Benghazi focus is a veiled bid to discredit Clinton.

""Unfortunately, this has been caught up in the 2016 presidential campaign-this effort to go after Hillary Clinton,"" Sen. Dick Durbin said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" He called Republican scrutiny of Clinton a ""witch hunt.""

""When Hillary Clinton's name is mentioned 32 times in a hearing…a point of the hearing is to discredit the secretary of state who has very high popularity and may well be a candidate for president,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein added on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

On Sunday, Sen. John McCain also linked Clinton to a bungled administration response to the Benghazi attack, which he amounted to a ""cover-up"" of information designed to protect the White House.

His accusations were fueled a set of internal e-mails from September that were released this week, which showed top administration officials changing a set of talking points used to describe the Benghazi attack. The talking points were meant for members of Congress, and for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice during appearances on Sunday talk shows.

McCain and other Republicans allege the changes to the talking points – which eliminated references to al Qaeda being involved in the attack, which came less than two months before the presidential election – were politically motivated, since President Barack Obama had campaigned using his administration's handling of national security issues.

Clinton herself isn't shown receiving or sending any of the e-mails herself. But McCain alleged it was impossible for her not to have been involved.

""I think that the secretary of state has played a role in this,"" the Arizona Republican said on ABC's ""This Week.""

""She had to have been in the loop some way,"" he continued. ""But, we don't know for sure."""

If signed by the governor, it would be the most restrictive abortion law in the nation.

The vote comes about one week after Arkansas legislators overrode a governor’s veto to become the first state to ban abortions involving fetuses 12 weeks or older.

The North Dakota legislation is among a string of antiabortion bills that the state’s lawmakers have been considering this session. A bill that bans abortions because of genetic defects or for gender selection also passed the Senate on Friday.

“We all know the significance of a heartbeat. It is the universally accepted biological proof of life,” said Sen. Spencer Berry, a sponsor of the bill, in a brief discussion before the vote. No one spoke in opposition and it passed 26 to 17.

The law is certain to face legal challenges. Earlier this month a federal judge struck down a 2011 Idaho law prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks, saying the law violates U.S. Supreme Court decisions which prohibit unduly impeding abortions before a fetus is able to live outside the womb.

Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a research institute that advocates for reproductive rights, said some states are in a “race to the bottom” to ban abortion as early as possible.

“These bills ban abortion at a very early point in pregnancy, a point at which many women may not realize they are pregnant.”

The bill provides an exception to protect the life of the mother. Doctors who perform abortions if a heartbeat has been detected could face prison time and a fine. Women who undergo abortions will not be punished.

The Red River Women’s clinic in Fargo is the only abortion clinic in North Dakota. The offices were closed Friday afternoon but a message in bold red letters on its website read: “Abortion is STILL legal in the state of North Dakota -- despite legislators’ attempts to restrict access to abortion. Red River Women’s clinic is OPEN, available for appointments and LEGALLY performing abortions in the state of North Dakota.”

A Lake County Judge has ruled Indiana's Right-To-Work Law Unconstitutional.

This is unbelievably huge news and a victory for Labor.

Judge John Sedia ruled the law unconstitutional last week because the state constitution calls for just compensation for services, according to an order. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed in February 2013 on behalf of members of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150 AFL-CIO, who argued the law violated the constitution.

Here's the legal conflict: The so-called ""right to work"" law makes it a criminal offense for unions to receive compensation for services federal law requires them to provide to workers even if they are not dues paying members.

HOWEVER, the Indiana Constitution mandates that no one's services can be demanded without just compensation.

The Indiana Attorney General's office has said they will appeal directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, calling the judgement incorrect because Judge Sedia dismissed four other counts in the suit.

Here is a .pdf copy of the 7-page decision for your perusal.

All eyes are now on the Indiana Supreme Court. If successful, this could mean the first step in tearing down the ""right to work"" laws all over the country."

House indicated it will end its term without voting on Sandy relief

A vote on a $60.4 billion aid package had been expected Wednesday

GOP and Democratic House members from N.Y. and N.J. are outraged

WASHINGTON -- House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio indicated late Tuesday the 112th Congress would end its term without voting on federal emergency aid for victims of Superstorm Sandy.

""The speaker is committed to getting this bill passed this month,"" Boehner's spokesman, Brendan Buck, said in an email.

Buck also emailed a news article reporting that Craig Fugate, head of the the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said his agency will not need additional money until spring.

FEMA money will not cover everything needed by states hit by Sandy. Other needs include claims filed under the National Flood Insurance Program, repairs to mass transit and Community Development Block grants needed to help localities rebuild.

Lawmakers from Northeast states had hoped the House would vote Wednesday on the $60.4 billion aid package that passed the Senate on Friday.

If the House leaves the aid package to the next Congress, the new Senate will have to vote on the package again.

News that a House vote would not come this Congress drew outraged responses from Republican and Democratic House members from New York and New Jersey, many of whom went to the floor around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday to express their dismay.

House Democratic Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Boehner declined to discuss plans for the Sandy aid vote during Tuesday night's House floor vote on the ""fiscal cliff.""

Hoyer said House Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia told him immediately after the vote he was ""99.9 percent confident"" the Sandy aid package would go the floor, but he was waiting for word from Boehner.

Soon after that, a Boehner aide told Cantor's staff there would be no vote. The message was conveyed to Republican Rep. Peter King of Long Island, who represents the shore communities hard hit by Sandy.

King described the decision to walk away from a Sandy aid vote as inexcusable and wrong.

""I think it's unprecedented for the United States Congress to walk away from a natural disaster,"" King said, adding that he was not given a reason for the postponement. ""This to me is just walking away from responsibility.""

King and Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of Staten Island, who represents some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods, joined Democrats at an impromptu news conference to publicly plead for Boehner to reconsider.

Grimm described himself as ""somewhat in disbelief and almost ashamed,"" adding that he's ""not proud"" of the decision his party has made.

Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of New York said victims of Sandy shouldn't suffer because of congressional dysfunction.

Democratic Rep. Rush Holt of New Jersey said he wishes he could speak eloquently on the issue, ""but I'm afraid my anger is going to get the better of me.""

""Why would we not help each other as this House has always done?"" he said.

Democratic Rep. Rob Andrews of New Jersey said House leaders have failed the people of New Jersey.

""Our people are in great need of assistance,"" he said. ""Every time we have been called upon to help other areas of the country, we have responded. It is outrageous that our needs are being pushed aside tonight.""

The 113th Congress will be in session Thursday and Friday and then recess for a week."

Davidson Previously Was An Assistant City Editor At The Washington Post', 'A Washington', 'Foreign Correspondent With The Wall Street Journal', 'Where He Covered Federal Agencies', 'Political Campaigns.']",House panel moves to fire workers with overdue tax liens; union protests budget cuts,"During a period when federal employees face a third year of the freeze on their basic pay rates and furloughs that could swipe up to 20 percent of their pay, a House committee is going after the tiny percentage of feds with federal tax liens.

With a voice vote, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved legislation Wednesday that could result in the firing of some federal employees who owe taxes and block job candidates in the same fix.

Democrats objected to the bill, saying it unfairly and unnecessarily focuses on federal workers and also could be counterproductive.

“This legislation simply seeks to demonize federal employees rather than ensure their compliance with tax obligations,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the committee. “By requiring agencies to fire employees for not paying their taxes on time, the measure actually undermines the ability of the government to collect the unpaid taxes. It is much more difficult to recoup delinquent taxes from someone who is unemployed.”

With bipartisan support, the committee also approved legislation that would require tax compliance for federal contracting companies.

“The very least an individual on the federal payroll can do is pay their taxes,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the chief sponsor of the bills. “If you are thumbing your nose up at the American taxpayer by not paying your taxes, you should be fired or not awarded a federal contract.”

Those with “seriously delinquent tax debt” would not be eligible to be federal employees, under the legislation. Just 3.62 percent of federal civilian employees were tax-delinquent in 2011, which is far better than the rate for the general public, according to Internal Revenue Service data. The legislation, however, would not apply to all federal employees who are delinquent, only those with a federal tax lien.

The IRS said that liens generally are placed against about 12 percent of those who are delinquent. That means less than 0.4 percent of federal employees could be fired, under the legislation. Further, the bill exempts certain tax debt, including that being paid off under a payment agreement or when there is taxpayer hardship.

“If someone is trying to do the right thing,” Chaffetz said, “of course, we want them to continue to be employed.” Citing the IRS, he said that seriously delinquent federal employees owe more than $1 billion.

“I hope that number [of delinquent employees] gets driven down to zero,” he said in an interview. “The intention is not to fire people, but to motivate them.”

Rather than motivating compliance, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) suggested that the legislation could make it more difficult for the debtors to pay. “If they [federal employees] are fired,” she said, “we lose the ability to collect on the debt.” Speier co-sponsored the bill on tax-delinquent contractors.

D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) complained that the employee legislation holds “federal employees up for special targeting.”

That targeting is unnecessary, Cummings said, because “under current law and regulations, agencies can take disciplinary action against employees for failing to meet their tax obligations, ranging from counseling to outright removal. I don’t see how the exemplary compliance rate among federal employees justifies the adoption of a new law that would apply only to federal employees.”

Union rally

About the same time the House committee was meeting in the Rayburn House Office Building, members of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and other unionists rallied outside the Labor Department against sweeping budget cuts knows as the sequester.

More than a million federal workers face unpaid furlough days because of the cuts.

“Who should be furloughed?” shouted Alex Bastani, president of AFGE Local 12 at Labor.

“Congress,” came the crowd’s reply.

“When should they be furloughed?”

“Now.”

The Labor Department rally was one of more than 100 the union said were organized across the country to protest cuts that would lead to reduced government service. The sequester, Bastani said, affects “not just federal employees. It affects the community.”

“We’re not just a bunch of bureaucrats sitting around,"" he added. “We do real work that affects real people.”

The D.C. rally drew international attention. Video journalists from Japanese and French news organizations were on the scene.

Meanwhile, the AFGE is temporarily homeless.

Its national headquarters in downtown Washington has been closed since Monday because of a fire that left its building without electricity.

“We’re telecommuting for the week,” said Brian J. DeWyngaert, an AFGE official at the rally.

Veterans such as U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth — the first woman injured in combat to be elected to national office when the Democrat ousted former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh in November — applauded the move as a broadening of opportunities for women and said it will improve the nation's armed forces. But several older veterans said most women are not physically strong enough to participate directly in combat.

Duckworth fought in Iraq with the Illinois Army National Guard as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot, one of the few combat positions available to women at the time. She lost both her legs when a rocket-propelled grenade hit her helicopter in 2004.

The Pentagon's decision overturns a 1994 ruling that banned women from being assigned to smaller ground combat units.

""The decision to allow women to serve in combat will allow the best man or woman on the front line to keep America safe,"" Duckworth said in a statement Wednesday. ""As a combat veteran, I know the inclusion of women in combat roles will make America safer and provide inspiration to women throughout our country.""

Lizette Rhone, president of the Chicago chapter of the Women's Army Corps Veterans' Association, served during World War II. She joined in 1943 hoping to be stationed overseas. But being African-American in the then-segregated military prohibited that and she instead filled an administrative role in Missouri, she said.

Rhone said some women would have jumped at the opportunity to serve in combat, even during World War II.

""I think it's the type of career some women would look forward to,"" said Rhone, 86. ""Now, they have the opportunity to really just soar.""

Rhone and Duckworth said women have been serving in combat zones, unofficially, for years.

""You can't believe that these women were in combat areas and never fired a gun and tried to protect themselves,"" Rhone said. ""We knew that (women) had been doing this.""

Two other female World War II veterans, however, said they aren't comfortable with the idea of women serving in combat.

Yolanda Imhoff, 94, of Evanston, served as a sergeant in the Army Air Forces as a high-speed radio operator in Europe. She worries that women generally are not as strong as men and that women might be more vulnerable if captured.

""They did teach us how to practice shooting a gun,"" Imhoff said about her time in service. ""We did have that. But as far as any combat, I'm, being my age, and what I saw and went though, I'm not sure I think women should be in combat.""

Doris Dina, 88, of Chicago, also a World War II veteran, said she doesn't think it's a good idea for most women, but that it could work for some.

""I appreciate the fact that some women are strong and they can handle combat,"" Dina said. ""I think it would be good for them. But not for people like myself.""

David McArtin, of Round Lake, a 30-year Navy veteran, said it's about time women serve in combat. He understands that some, like Imhoff, fear women will be subjected to abuse.

""That's happening today,"" McArtin said. ""I think we need to accept these things will happen in combat. ... And not every woman is going to say, 'This is for me.' Not everyone in America serves.""

There’s no question. It’s the mayor.

Kevin Johnson — K.J. as he became known during his pro basketball playing days — is indisputably the right mayor at the right time.

Advertisement

It’s impossible to imagine any other mayor anywhere — let alone from Sacramento — who would have such entree into the National Basketball Assn. as the city struggles to keep Seattle from pilfering its beloved Kings.

Johnson recently concluded a successful whale-hunting expedition — whale being the synonym for billionaires willing to buy the team and invest in a new downtown arena.

“Whales are not indigenous to Sacramento,” says Chris Lehane, a political consultant who has worked with the mayor on the arena project.

Yes, that has been a huge Sacramento dilemma in its efforts to keep the Kings from bolting — the scarcity of very rich people and lack of a strong corporate base.

Advertisement

But Johnson, 47, a former all-star point guard for the Phoenix Suns, has used his star power and competitive tenacity to keep the Kings alive in the city where he grew up.

“I’m a Sacramentan,” he says. “You don’t ever like to see a team leave a city where you’re from. As a player, I traveled around to 29 other cities and saw how much basketball meant. It was about civic pride and economic development. I saw public-private partnerships work. This can be a game-changer.”

Johnson has recruited an impressive pod of whales:

Beverly Hills investor Ron Burkle, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team; 24-Hour Fitness founder Mark Mastrov, who once tried to buy the NBA’s Golden State Warriors; Silicon Valley software tycoon Vivek Ranadive, a part owner of the Warriors; and the Jacobs family of San Diego, founders of Qualcomm.

“We have a dream team of investors,” Johnson says.

Ranadive, who emigrated from India with $50 in his pocket, apparently would write the biggest check and be the lead owner. The bidding price hasn’t been announced. But presumably it’s close to Seattle’s offer: $341 million for 65% of the team, placing the franchise’s overall value at $525 million, an NBA record sale price.

Burkle would focus on developing the $448-million, 18,500-seat arena and surrounding office space, housing units, stores and a hotel. The city would contribute $258 million, mostly from parking fees.

At the mayor’s urging, the City Council voted 7 to 2 for the arena deal last week, culminating a decade-long effort to replace the crumbling old barn where the Kings have played for most of their 28 seasons in Sacramento.

The Seattle poachers are led by multibillionaire hedge-fund manager Chris Hansen and Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer. Seattle has been without an NBA team since the SuperSonics fled to Oklahoma City in 2008 and became the Thunder.

The Seattle group already has a signed agreement with the Kings owners — the locally despised Maloof family — to buy the team and ship it. But it’s subject to NBA approval.

Advertisement

“We want the folks of Seattle to get a team,” Johnson told the City Council. “We wish them well. But we want to keep what’s ours.”

Crucial meetings are scheduled in New York on Wednesday between a committee of NBA owners and the two sides. Then all the owners will vote April 18.

Johnson will lead the Sacramento delegation, as he did two years ago when the Maloofs tried to move the Kings to Anaheim. Johnson then was able to persuade the NBA to back down the Maloofs — helped by the fact that the Lakers and Clippers didn’t want more competition for L.A. fans.

“I’ve never seen a more organized, articulate and compassionate speech” than Johnson’s to the NBA owners, says lobbyist, investor and sports junkie Darius Anderson. “He played on every owner’s heartstrings.”

Advertisement

Anderson, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, originally solicited Burkle to buy the Kings two years ago. But the Maloofs angrily insisted the team wasn’t for sale.

The Maloofs then negotiated an arena agreement with the city, aided by NBA Commissioner David Stern. One Maloof brother, Gavin, even wept as the family made a long-term commitment to Sacramento. But later, the Maloofs backed out.

Advertisement

Soon afterward, they began negotiating with Virginia Beach, Va., to move the team there. But Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell rejected the town’s request for a $150-million subsidy.

Enter Seattle.

Advertisement

Those weren’t the only times the Maloofs back-stabbed Sacramento. In 2006, they negotiated a sales tax increase to pay for a new arena. But they reneged on the deal just as the ballot measure campaign kicked off.

In fact, they were suspected of sabotaging the measure. The Maloof brothers appeared in a Carl’s Jr. TV ad, washing down burgers with a $6,000 bottle of wine — a display of extravagance that infuriated voters.

Advertisement

In the early years of the Maloof ownership, starting in 1999, the Kings were very competitive and played some thrilling playoff games with the Lakers. The Kings sold out every game for 19 seasons.

But in recent years, the team has become crummy. It now ranks at the bottom of NBA attendance. And there’s little effort to maintain an arena that’s falling apart.

Advertisement

In fact, the last time I attended a game a few years ago my $115 seat collapsed. Ushers couldn’t find me another. They provided a couple of cushions to sit on. That’s when I decided not to renew my partial season ticket plan.

It’s the kind of neglect that makes a sports franchise vulnerable — and a city and mayor crying out for new owners.

If Johnson can pull this off, it will be the biggest come-from-behind win of his career.

Republicans seem determined to change the rules so Democrats will no longer be able to stop judicial nominations with the threat of a filibuster. If they're acting out of frustration, it's understandable. In the past we've been frustrated when legislators tried to stop important bills from passing by resorting to the same tactic. The filibuster, which allows 41 senators to delay action indefinitely, is a rough instrument that should be used with caution. But its existence goes to the center of the peculiar but effective form of government America cherishes.

Since George W. Bush first became president, Democratic senators have used the filibuster 10 times to block the confirmation of nominees for federal court judgeships. They chose their targets cautiously -- more than 200 other nominees were confirmed, some of them men and women whose records were extremely conservative. But surely it is not a matter of life and death to the White House if, for instance, a former lobbyist for mining interests with a reputation for anti-environmentalism cannot get a seat on the federal bench out West. The president might have taken this opportunity to fulfill his long-deferred promise to be a uniter, and replaced the rejected nominees with other candidates from the very large pool of competent people available. Instead, Mr. Bush has drawn a line in the sand and resubmitted some of the same unworthy nominees. If the Democrats resist, the Republican leaders have vowed to change the rules and eliminate the right of filibuster for judicial nominations.

They may not have the votes to make this happen. Many of the wisest Republicans are well aware that their leaders are playing a dangerous game and that they are doing it for frivolous reasons. The judicial nominees can easily be replaced. But the sense that there are certain rules that all must play by, whether to their advantage or not, is something that cannot be restored. Senators need only to look at the House to see what politics looks like when the only law is to win at any cost.

The Senate, of all places, should be sensitive to the fact that this large and diverse country has never believed in government by an unrestrained majority rule. Its composition is a repudiation of the very idea that the largest number of votes always wins out. The members from places like Rhode Island, Maine or Iowa know that their constituents are given a far larger say than people from New York simply by virtue of the fact that each state has two votes, regardless of population. Indeed, as a recent New Yorker article pointed out, the Democratic senators who have blocked that handful of judicial nominees actually represent substantially more Americans than the Republican majority that wants to see them passed."

Last week, in the tony Detroit suburb of Birmingham, U.S. Rep. Kerry Bentivolio had an exchange with one of his constituents that was probably not that unusual. It’s the kind of thing that happens all the time in conservative Republican circles when talk turns to Obamacare and the president’s agenda.

Conveniently forgetting that the healthcare law championed by the president was passed by Congress in 2010, that the president trounced his political rival, Mitt Romney, in 2012, and that the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act, angry conservatives believe that but for a bootlicking mainstream press, Obama would be on his way back to an early retirement in Chicago, if not to prison for the terrible “crimes” he has committed against the American people.

The exchange that Bentivolio had with his constituents last week is instructive.

It shows the free-floating angst that’s out there among conservatives who have the sense that they are “losing” their country. But it also shows the delicate line that conservative politicians must walk; telling their constituents what they want to hear while grasping how nutty they’d look if they actually pursued impeachment.

Toward the end of Bentivolio’s 30-minute meeting, which you can see online, a woman asks him something that is more a plea than a question: “I need to know … who is going to stop Obama from everything that he is doing against our Constitution? He needs to be stopped.”

A man’s voice interjects: “Articles of Impeachment!”

The woman continues: “It should have been started a long time ago, and I’m getting very nervous and I need to know who and when is somebody going to finally draw up something that is going to stop this runway train that we have in the White House.”

Presumably, the runaway train she is referring to is the implementation of the president’s Affordable Care Act, though it’s not entirely clear, as Bentivolio’s response also refers to the IRS admission that it flagged groups with political-sounding names that were applying for tax-exempt status.

“If I could write that bill, it would be a dream come true,” Bentivolio said. “I feel your pain. I stood 12 feet away from the guy and listened to him, and I couldn’t stand being there, but because he is president I have to respect the office, that’s my job.”

The congressman, a former car designer and teacher, said he returned to his office and consulted with attorneys and historians: “Tell me how I can impeach the president of the United States.”

His experts were dubious, he said. “What evidence do you have? You’ve got to have the evidence. ... Until we have evidence, you are going to become a laughingstock if you submitted a bill to impeach the president.”

Sunday on “Meet the Press,” Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who did not endear himself to many of his brethren when he told the GOP in January to “stop being the stupid party,” urged Republicans to cool it on impeachment.

“The reality is, one of the great things about this country is we do have a peaceful transfer of power,” said Jindal, chairman of the Republican Governors Assn. “I disagree with this president’s policy. And stop talking about impeachment. Let’s go out there and let’s have a legitimate debate.”

A legitimate debate in this Congress, where Republicans would rather beat their heads against the wall trying to repeal the healthcare law than work on, say, meaningful immigration reform legislation?

That will happen when reindeer fly.

NOGALES, Ariz. — The top Democratic and Republican Senate negotiators on forthcoming immigration-reform legislation toured the Arizona-Mexico border Wednesday, watching as U.S. authorities apprehended a woman who had scaled a border fence.

They reiterated their commitment to strengthen security along the international line.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., are leading the ongoing bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" talks that many hope will result in the introduction of a sweeping bill when the Senate returns to session after a two-week spring break.

The two veteran lawmakers were joined on the tour, which included a helicopter ride, by two other Gang of Eight members: Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo. The senators have been struggling to come to terms on big issues such as the future flow of foreign workers into the country, but the message from the quartet in southern Arizona was that the bill is moving forward.

Schumer, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's immigration subcommittee, was making his first visit to the border and said his observations will make it easier for him to persuade colleagues about the need for additional border measures.

""What I learned today is we have adequate manpower but not adequate technology,"" Schumer said. ""And John has been saying that all along.""

At one point during the border tour, the senators witnessed a woman scaling an 18-foot fence a few yards from the entourage. McCain tweeted about the incident, telling his Twitter audience that the Border Patrol took the woman into custody.

""One of the sad things about all of this is that most of those people who jump over the fence are doing that because they want a better life, and I understand that,"" McCain said to reporters later. ""So we separate the drug cartels from individuals who are simply trying to cross over so that they can improve their lives, but at the same time, we have to have a legal way of doing that.

""And we will be setting up legal ways of applying for visas, green cards, etc. — not through a border that is porous, which only favors those who live closest and disfavors those who live further away,"" he said.

Under a framework of principles announced by Schumer and McCain's group Jan. 28, the measure would link a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country to enhanced border security. According to the framework, the senators contemplate a commission of governors, attorneys general and other ""community leaders living along the Southwest border"" to gauge border-security progress, but how much authority the panel would have has never been made clear.

President Barack Obama supports comprehensive immigration reform and has encouraged the bipartisan Senate group, which is racing the calendar. The senators have a limited time to pass immigration legislation before Capitol Hill is overtaken by 2014 midterm politics, which could start taking hold as soon as this fall.

Despite continuing deliberations and ""a few little problems to work on,"" Schumer said the Gang of Eight is ""90% there"" and ""we believe we'll meet our deadline."" Schumer declined to identify lingering points of contention, saying the senators won't negotiate in public.

""We have to determine the future flow: How do we determine who comes into this country in the future?"" he said. ""We have to make sure the system, not only at the border, but internally is tighter, so that employers will not hire people who are not here legally. And we have to provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million who are in the shadows.""

Schumer said he hopes the legislation can stay revenue neutral, even though more money will be spent to bolster the border. He said the bill will include new ""specific metrics"" to measure border-security progress but wouldn't go into detail.

""Once the border is secured by specific metrics ... people can become citizens,"" he said. The legislation ideally would generate enough revenue to pay for itself through, for example, fees high-tech firms would pay to bring in foreign employees.

Bennet said the nation's broken immigration system is having ""all kinds of negative effects"" in his home state of Colorado, mentioning that he has heard concerns from peach growers, cattle ranchers, the immigrant-rights community and school officials.

""Not everybody is going to get everything they want in this bill,"" Bennet said. ""Not one person is writing this by themselves. But if we can get the kind of bipartisan cooperation that's been demonstrated by the negotiators in this group of eight, I think we can be successful, and I think we can fix a lot of the issues that ail us.""

The senators' visit to the border drew reaction from immigration-reform activists.

A group called the Dream Action Coalition countered that the border already is effectively secured.

""We hope that Senator Schumer, who has been calling himself a 'friend' to the immigrant and Latino community for many years, stops focusing on what is happening at the southern border and calling for more enforcement,"" the group said in a statement. ""Instead, we ask for his leadership on the real problem we are facing in this country. The reality is that there are more than 1,000 deportations every day and atrocious family separation that is hurting children, parents and our community as a whole.""

Outside McCain's Phoenix office, about 30 people gathered as part of an event organized by the Arizona Worker Rights Center to spotlight the abuse of immigrant workers, such as unsafe working conditions and ""wage theft."" Advocates called on McCain and Flake to addresses those problems in the legislation.

""If you legalize workers, it will raise wages for all workers,"" said Nick de la Puente, of the Arizona Worker Rights Center, a non-profit labor-rights organization. ""We need to be in favor of immigration reform, regardless of your immigration status.""

De la Puente said his group has documented more than $2 million in unpaid wages in the past four years stemming from 320 cases involving undocumented workers.

Unscrupulous employers who exploit undocumented workers lower wages for all workers, including legal immigrants and U.S. citizens, he said.

The protesters also delivered letters to McCain's staff opposing a guest-worker program, which they said could lead to further exploitation of workers. De la Puente said he opposes the program unless it allows immigrant workers to move to other jobs and also gives them the option to apply for permanent residency.

Schumer suggested the Arizona visit was particularly rewarding for him. The ""amazing tour"" let the senators see the often rugged terrain that the Border Patrol must cover, Schumer said, and how the officials use manned and unmanned aircraft and forward operating bases. But he and McCain said there is a need to upgrade technological surveillance capabilities.

""We saw the various different types of fencing, and then we saw that there were lots of areas where a fence wouldn't be practical,"" Schumer said. ""It would be hugely expensive to build and not practical. ... Then we saw an urban area like Nogales. And so there's not one size that fits all.""

McCain said the bipartisan group has ""not had any differences on this (border security) issue.""

McCain jokingly called the other members of the Gang of Eight — Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Robert Menendez, D-N.J.; and Marco Rubio, R-Fla. — who did not tour the border on Wednesday ""jerks.""

He then added that the other four have told him that they, too, would like to inspect the border for themselves in the future.

An attorney for rodeo announcer Mark Ficken said Tuesday that his resignation from the group is not an acknowledgment of wrongdoing on his part but rather a protest that the association has not banned the rodeo clown from its membership.

Ficken's resignation from the rodeo group comes as he tries to hold on to his job as superintendent of the Boonville School District. The school system announced Monday that it is hiring an investigator to look into whether Ficken was involved in any ""inappropriate conduct"" during Saturday's bull riding event at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia.

Missouri's elected officials have denounced the rodeo clown act as disrespectful to Obama.

The event featured a man wearing an Obama mask with an upside down broomstick attached to his backside who was positioned on the arena's dirt floor as if he were a dummy. Another clown drew cheers from the audience as he asked if they wanted to see ""Obama run down by a bull"" and made comments about the bull coming to get Obama.

More On This...

Ficken's attorney said a rodeo clown wearing a microphone -- not Ficken -- orchestrated the act and made most of the comments about a bull charging after Obama.

The Missouri State Fair said Monday that it has permanently banned the clown from performing at the fair.

The rodeo association, which was responsible for the event, has not publicly said what -- if any -- action it has taken against participants.

""When he found out that the association had no plans to remove the rogue clown from its membership ranks, (Ficken) felt that the better part of valor - given what was said - was to resign from the association,"" said his Ficken's attorney, Albert Watkins.

Neither the State Fair nor the rodeo association has identified the rodeo clown who made the comments about Obama. But a friend and relative both identified the clown as Tuffy Gessling.

""He was at our house the next day for Sunday dinner and told us that he thought people took it wrong - that it was supposed to be a joke,"" said his cousin, Chrissy Gessling, of Slater, Mo.

Tuffy Gessling has not responded to Associated Press requests for an interview made through Facebook, his cousin and a friend."

Appearing before the House Judiciary Committee on May 15, Holder insisted that ""the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material"" is not something he was involved in or knew about.

But days later, it emerged that the Justice Department obtained access to the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen -- after filing an affidavit that accused him of being a likely criminal ""co-conspirator"" in the leak of sensitive material regarding North Korea.

Rosen was never charged, and never prosecuted. But he was effectively accused of violating the federal Espionage Act.

Asked about potential problems with Holder's testimony, a House Judiciary Committee aide told FoxNews.com that the committee is ""further investigating this matter."" The committee later clarified they are ""looking into"" Holder's testimony.

J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department attorney who in recent years has emerged as a prominent conservative critic of his former employer, said Tuesday that Holder seems to have misled Congress.

""Holder said it's not something I'm involved with, don't know anything about it -- he lied on both counts,"" Adams told Fox News.

The top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Michigan Rep. John Conyers, said Tuesday, though, he thinks Holder ""was forthright and did not mislead the Committee.""

""Certainly, there are policy disagreements as to how the First Amendment should apply to these series of leak investigations being conducted by the Justice Department, and that is and should be an area for the Committee to consider. However, there is no need to turn a policy disagreement into allegations of misconduct,"" he said.

For his part, Holder is planning to open a review of the department's policies on investigations involving journalists. This includes a discussion with representatives from the media. Holder said Tuesday he hopes to have the meeting this week.

""I'm not satisfied,"" he said, when asked whether he had regrets about the course of the investigations so far.

Holder addressed the leak probes during a House hearing two weeks ago, under questioning by Democratic Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson. Johnson voiced concern that the Espionage Act of 1917 allows the prosecution of anyone who discloses classified information.

He said: ""But we certainly need to protect the privacy of individuals, and we need to protect the ability ... of the press to engage in its First Amendment responsibilities to be free and to give us information about our government so as to keep the people informed.""

Holder answered: ""Well, I would say this. With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I've ever been involved in, heard of or would think would be a wise policy. In fact, my view is quite the opposite.""

At the time, Johnson was referencing reports that the Justice Department secretly obtained the phone records of Associated Press journalists.

A few days later, it would emerge that the Justice Department in 2010 also sought the private emails from Rosen's account, as part of a case against accused leaker Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. An FBI agent cited the Espionage Act in seeking those documents.

And on Friday, the Justice Department acknowledged that Holder was looped in on the decision-making in that case.

""The Department takes seriously the First Amendment right to freedom of the press. In recognition of this, the department took great care in deciding that a search warrant was necessary in the Kim matter, vetting the decision at the highest levels of the department, including discussions with the attorney general,"" the department said.

Jesselyn Radack, an attorney who works with the Government Accountability Project and has represented accused leakers, told FoxNews.com that Holder's statement to the House committee was ""at best hypocritical and at worst perjury.""

Holder, though, could argue that, in fact, Rosen was never prosecuted -- and so his testimony was not misleading.

A federal law enforcement official said last week that the department had to establish probable cause in the affidavit in order to obtain the search warrant, per the terms of the Privacy Protection Act.

""Saying that there is probable cause to believe that someone has committed a crime and actually charging the person with that crime are two very different things,"" the official said. ""No reporter has been charged in this case. And, at this time, we do not anticipate bringing additional charges against anyone in this matter.""

Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush and a Fox News analyst, argued in a FoxNews.com opinion piece last week that, at the least, Holder has ""a lot of explaining to do to Congress.""

Meanwhile, there are conflicting accounts involving a Justice Department claim that it notified Fox News' parent company, News Corp., of the investigation. Lawrence ""Lon"" Jacobs, News Corp.'s general counsel at the time, said they never got the apparent fax from the Justice Department that contained the information about Rosen.

""If the Justice Department wanted Fox to be advised, I think they would have sent the notification to Fox News, not News Corp.,"" he said. ""I don't know what fax number it went to, but if it was faxed to my office it would have been received by my assistant and she would have notified me.""

He said he would have notified Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes had he received it.

Story highlights NEW: Some websites down, others up; Antarctic research program iced Rangers are ticketing people who try to sneak into the Grand Canyon Crabbers can't fish without federal permits Homeowners on federal land have been kicked out

(CNN) —

You know about the obvious impacts of the government shutdown: federal workers idled, offices closed, funding disrupted for all sorts of activities.

But some of the impacts are less obvious, more outrageous, or a little bit of both.

Here’s a sampling of some of the spinoff effects of the shutdown showdown in Washington:

State Department defends $5 million for high-end glassware

Shuttered Websites

In the digital equivalent of throwing a sheet over unused furniture, many federal agencies have replaced their websites and all the information on them with static pages announcing the government shutdown.

Whether a website will be up or not, however, is something of a guessing game.

The National Parks Service site is down. It sends visitors to the Department of Interior’s website, which is up but not being updated.

The Department of Justice website is up, but the website for its subordinate agency, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, greets visitors with a stark white page reading, “Due to the lapse in federal funding, this Office of Justice Programs (OJP) website is unavailable.”

That you can still reach the websites mean the computers that serve the data are still up and running, and the government is either paying a private company to operate them or they’re using taxpayer-funded power to continue running.

But it doesn’t matter if running the sites with big “closed” sign draped across the front costs the same or even more than letting them run, the White House said in a September 17 memo to federal employees.

“The determination of which services continue during an appropriations lapse is not affected by whether the costs of shutdown exceed the costs of maintaining services,” according to the memo.

Icing Antarctic research

While NASA has the okay to keep supporting U.S. astronauts at the International Space Station, the same apparently isn’t true of scientists at what may be the United States’ next most desolate outpost: Antarctica.

The National Science Foundation said Wednesday that it would run out of money to keep the U.S. Antarctic Program going by October 14.

So it’s putting the program into “caretaker status,” leaving research stations and other facilities staffed with only the bare number of people necessary to “ensure human safety and preserve government property,” the agency said.

That means many of the scientists who would be heading to the program’s Antarctic research stations to work over the Southern Hemisphere’s summer, which begins in December and runs February, are in limbo.

The agency says it will try to restart the research program once funding resumes, but says that it could be tough once seasonal workers are let go and the seasonal window to do some of the work has passed.

Emptiest catch

The shutdown also could make its way to your seafood dinner plate.

Without federal employees to set rules and quotas for the fishing season, crab fleets in Alaska are in limbo – unsure whether they’ll be able to head out in pursuit of lucrative crab that bring in millions of dollars each season.

A delay of even a few days could be costly, Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Washington, said in a House speech last week. Her district includes the home port for some of the fleets that fish for Bering Sea crab.

What you need to know today

“A delay could mean they’ll miss out exporting to the all-important Asian holiday market when demand is at its highest and most lucrative,” she said.

That could cost the industry millions, dealing it what she called a “crippling blow.”

One fishing captain told CNN affiliate KIRO that the delay threatens what they call the “Super Bowl of crab fishing.”

“We think of a lot of other things besides the government affecting our fishing – weather, boats, crew,” said Capt. Moore Dye of the fishing vessel Western Mariner. “This has really caught us off guard.”

No shutdown for House gym rats

Move along, nothing to see

No, the Obama administration has not deployed helicopters to hover in front of Mount Rushmore National Monument with a giant, view-obscuring sheet, as the rumor-busting site snopes.com debunked last week.

But federal officials did – for a time at least – put traffic cones up at a pull-off where people stop to view the carving from a distance. Depending on whom you ask, the cones were either to block motorists from pulling off or to guide them into viewing areas.

“They won’t even let you pull off on the side of the road,” the Argus Leader newspaper in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, quoted state Tourism Department Secretary Jim Hagen as saying. “I just don’t know what they’re trying to accomplish.”

The newspaper said park officials told the state the cones were meant only to channel motorists into viewing sites. They went up October 1, the day the shutdown began.

Federal officials removed the cones for at least a while after a snowstorm hit and crews needed to plow the roads, the newspaper reported.

“Once the snow’s off the ground, we’re going to be keeping an eye on how the cones go up,” the newspaper quoted the governor’s chief of staff, Dusty Johnson, as saying.

On shutdown’s 9th day, survivors of fallen troops take center stage

Don’t go in there

The area around the Grand Canyon is a ghost town. It’s no different inside, and park rangers are working to keep it that way, according to The Republic newspaper in Arizona.

Park officials have written about two dozen citations for people trying to sneak into the park. Some have been caught at the canyon’s South Rim, others on trails or attempting hikes, the newspaper reported.

Shutdown leaves ranchers in the cold, blizzard kills their cattle

Don’t ‘recreate’

According to the Eagle-Tribune newspaper of North Andover, Massachusetts, tourist Pat Vaillancourt said National Park Service Guards held her tour group under armed guard in a Yellowstone National Park hotel and brusquely told tourists who had filed off their bus to take pictures of bison that they weren’t to “recreate.”

The tour guide argued to rangers that the tourists – some of them from overseas – weren’t “recreating,” just taking pictures.

“She responded and said, ‘Sir, you are recreating,’ and her tone became very aggressive,” the newspaper quoted Vaillancourt as saying.

Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash, who despite being furloughed was asked by park officials to respond to some media inquiries when available, said hotel guests were never held under armed guard.

He acknowledged that tourists were frustrated by limitations imposed by the shutdown – he said parks officials were, as well.

Ted Cruz: Democrats’ new bogeyman

And stay out!

A Nevada couple said they were kicked out of their home in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, CNN affiliate KTNV reports.

Retirees Joyce and Ralph Spencer own a cabin on federal land, and were told last week they had 24 hours to clear out and stay out until the government reopens.

Park officials gave KTNV a statement saying overnight stays are not allowed in the park until funding is restored, but said owners can visit their properties to retrieve belongings.

While the decision has angered some commenters on KTNV’s story – some of whom suggested the decision to kick out property owners was made out of spite and encouraged the couple to sue – Joyce Spencer said they’re taking the situation in stride.

While they’d like to be allowed back in their home, the worst impact has been that she had to buy her husband new clothes they forgot while packing up to leave their cabin.

“We’re not hurt in any way except it might cost me if I have to go buy more pants,” she told KTNV.

For years they could shout down any attempt to point out the extent to which their policies favored the elite over the poor and the middle class; all they had to do was yell “Class warfare!” and Democrats scurried away. In the 2012 election, however, that didn’t work: the picture of the G.O.P. as the party of sneering plutocrats stuck, even as Democrats became more openly populist than they have been in decades.

As a result, prominent Republicans have begun acknowledging that their party needs to improve its image. But here’s the thing: Their proposals for a makeover all involve changing the sales pitch rather than the product. When it comes to substance, the G.O.P. is more committed than ever to policies that take from most Americans and give to a wealthy handful.

Consider, as a case in point, how a widely reported recent speech by Bobby Jindal the governor of Louisiana, compares with his actual policies.

Mr. Jindal posed the problem in a way that would, I believe, have been unthinkable for a leading Republican even a year ago. “We must not,” he declared, “be the party that simply protects the well off so they can keep their toys. We have to be the party that shows all Americans how they can thrive.” After a campaign in which Mitt Romney denounced any attempt to talk about class divisions as an “attack on success,” this represents a major rhetorical shift."
http://news.yahoo.com/rubio-cpac-too-many-liberal-arts-grads-not-142023183.html,,[],"Rubio at CPAC: Too many liberal arts grads, not enough plumbers","Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio gave a short speech on Thursday’s first day of the Conservative Political Action Conference, avoiding the sensitive topic of immigration reform and instead emphasized his pro-life stance, traditional marriage and his belief that many Americans can no longer attain the American Dream.

Education was a main focal point of the speech. Rubio urged the friendly CPAC crowd to focus on the concerns of middle class and blue-collar Americans, saying that vocational career pathways are both admirable and necessary.

“We should encourage career education,” Rubio said, presenting the idea during his speech as something of an aside. “Not everyone has to go to a four-year liberal arts college. We still need plumbers. We still need carpenters.”

Rubio suggested that there three million unfilled jobs in the United States because Americans don’t have the skills to do those jobs.

“Why aren’t we graduating more kids not just with a high school diploma but with an industry certification and a career — a real middle class career?” he also asked.

The first-term senator focused considerably on the $1 trillion student-debt crisis, noting that American college graduates in massive numbers are failing to find jobs that match their costly degrees — or pay enough so that recent grads can pay back their student loans.

Rubio warned the crowd about the rising number of young Americans who are unable to pay their student-loan debt.

“It is the next big bubble in America,” he predicted. “I know something about it. I graduated with over $100,000 in student loans.”

Bentsen Jr., a former House lawmaker turned financial industry lobbyist, whose organization Sifma has urged Mr. Gensler to compromise on the cross-border rules.

Some of the strongest objections have come from foreign regulators, including officials from Britain, Russia, Japan and Germany, who complained about the plan last month in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. Global markets, they said, “will not be able to function under such burdensome regulatory conditions,” advocating instead that the United States agree to respect rules each nation adopts, assuming they are reasonably compatible.

Mary L. Schapiro, who recently stepped down as chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said she admired Mr. Gensler for his doggedness. But, she noted, “he believes very strongly in the positions he takes — that does not always lend itself to compromise quickly.”

The S.E.C., which has jurisdiction over a much smaller share of derivatives trading than Mr. Gensler’s agency, is scheduled to consider a narrower cross-border requirement on Wednesday. With American regulators in disagreement, the industry could have more leverage.

The role of Mr. Gensler’s agency greatly expanded under Dodd-Frank, which called for significantly tighter regulation of derivatives, used by a broad array of companies to help manage risk. An airline, for instance, uses them to hedge against the fluctuating cost of jet fuel. One form of derivatives, credit-default swaps, helped topple the giant insurer American International Group in 2008, deepening the financial crisis.

In the fight over the law’s provisions, the commission has been outmatched, said Bart Chilton, one of three Democratic appointees on the panel. “They have really unlimited resources,” he said of industry officials. Rules expected to take one year in the making have stretched out to three.

“It has created what I call dysfunction junction,” he added.

Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were among the first to weigh in. Kenneth M. Raisler, a former general counsel at the commodity commission and now a partner at the New York-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, said the plan would damage his clients in overseas markets, as foreign customers would start to avoid American banks. JPMorgan Chase alone had $70 trillion of derivatives outstanding at the end of last year, a large portion of which were booked overseas."

The new provision is a result of the latest addition to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which is essentially an entirely new version of the bill.

The Washington Examiner‘s Byron York uncovered the new Obama stimulus program that Gang of Eight members and other Senate Republicans inserted into the bill as a sweetheart deal for liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). The left leaning Senator was previously critical of the legislation.

“The original Gang bill ended with a section designated Title IV, which was headlined REFORMS TO NON-IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAMS,” York wrote on Sunday. “The Hoeven-Corker version of the bill added a Title V, with the headline JOBS FOR YOUTH. The measure would provide $1.5 billion in the next two years to provide jobs for Americans between the ages of 16 and 24. It was originally pushed by Democratic Sen. Bernard Sanders, who wanted to come to the aid of young workers who were ‘hard hit by the Wall Street-caused recession.’ Now, Sanders says immigration reform will further damage youth job prospects.”

A provision under that new stimulus program title allows for the use of spending the taxpayer money on the program to provide transportation for youth to and from their jobs.

“(f) USE OF FUNDS.–

(1) IN GENERAL.–The funds made available under this section shall be used–

(A) to provide summer employment opportunities for low-income youth, with direct linkages to academic and occupational learning, and may be used to provide supportive services, such as transportation or child care, that is necessary to enable the participation of such youth in the opportunities;”

The total appropriation for this new stimulus program would be $1.5 billion that would be divvied up among states that applied for the money. According to the proposed statute as written, all the money would need to be spent in a year-and-three-months period.

“The amounts appropriated under this title shall be available for obligation by the Secretary of Labor until December 31, 2014, and shall be available for expenditure by grantees (including subgrantees) until September 30, 2015,” the part of the provision detailing how long the money would be available for reads.

A GOP senate aide told Breitbart News that for the country to be able to spend $1.5 billion on such a program so fast, it would need to buy, lease or rent motor vehicles for beneficiaries of the new government handout. The provision that outlines how the money can be legally used for providing “supportive services” like “transportation,” the aide said, could easily be interpreted to mean the money could be spent buying or leasing or renting vehicles for the beneficiaries.

“This appears to give states authority to buy, lease or rent motorcycles, cars and scooters or anything kids want to buy to get to and from a job,” the GOP aide said."

“Only about a third of the public (32%) approves of the job Obama is doing on immigration policy; 60% disapprove,” Pew wrote. “Obama’s ratings for this issue among Democrats are mixed: About half (53%) approve of his handling of the issue while 42% disapprove.”

Obama’s 60 percent disapproval rating on immigration from the American people is an all-time high for him on the issue and puts him on par with former President George W. Bush’s immigration polling numbers. Obama’s immigration disapproval rating has skyrocketed as he has ramped up his efforts to lobby Congress for the passage of an amnesty–particularly the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.

As the American people have learned more and more about the Gang of Eight bill and the effects which amnesty and a drastic influx of millions of new workers would have on the hurting economy, they have grown more and more outraged with what Washington, D.C., is doing regarding immigration reform. In February–before Obama and lawmakers like Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and DIck Durbin (D-IL) began their push for immigration reform–the President’s immigration policy approval rating among the American people, according to Pew, was higher than his disapproval rating. His approval rating on immigration then was 44 percent, whereas his disapproval rating was 43 percent.

Over the next several months, the Obama administration worked with the Senate Democrats and a handful of Senate Republicans to develop the more-than-thousand-page-long Gang of Eight bill. The administration helped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rush the bill to the floor with hardly any substantive review from members, staffers, the media, and the American people.

In mid-June, before the Senate bill passed and as its ultimate passage became questionable, Obama’s Pew Research disapproval rating on immigration spiked up to 47 percent, and his approval rating on the issue dropped to 43 percent. With the public beginning to turn against amnesty, the Senators pushing for it cobbled together a series of amendments designed to win over extra votes in the Senate–like the Corker-Hoeven plan for their votes, casino kickbacks for Sen. Dean Heller’s vote, “Lobster Bait” for Susan Collins’ vote, and a seafood processing deal for Lisa Murkowski’s vote, among others–and rammed the bill through to final passage in the Senate.

Since then, Obama’s immigration disapproval rating, according to Pew, has skyrocketed to 60 percent. That disapproval rating is higher than George W. Bush’s ever was, according to a Pew chart on page 12 of the report, save one exception: in April 2006, Bush’s immigration disapproval rating reached 62 percent.

As Obama’s disapproval ratings reach all-time highs because of his support for amnesty, Republicans keep the issue alive. While House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) says the issue will not receive any votes in the House in 2013, which is probably true, the effort to grant amnesty from House GOP leadership is alive and well–and likely to continue in early 2014.

Officials like Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) keep offering Obama cover by continuing to push for some kind of immigration package. In an interview this week with Bloomberg’s Al Hunt, Priebus continued pushing for amnesty.

“I think it can happen, and I think people like Paul Ryan and others still want something like that to happen,” Priebus said this week. “It could happen next year, I don’t think there’s any sort of midnight hour here.”

Ryan is in the process of drafting a bill that would grant America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants legal status. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said this summer at a town hall event in Racine, Wisconsin. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”

Priebus and Ryan, if they keep pushing down this road, face the fate of what happened to Senator Rubio after he pushed for amnesty. Rubio has since backed off the push and publicly undercut the efforts of House GOP leadership to pass any group of piecemeal bills with the goal of getting to a conference committee negotiation with the Democratic Senate–from which a comprehensive immigration reform conference report like the Senate bill would arise. Rubio’s backtracking on the issue, and complete reversal of support for his own bill, came after the American people turned on him for supporting such a plan. Polling data over the past several months showed the once-promising presidential candidate tanking among Republican voters.

House GOP leadership could technically kill this once and for all by promising publicly what Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) has advocated: that there will never be a conference committee with the Senate bill. However, they have left the door open, as pressure from lobbyists and groups funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to pass an amnesty.

If such legislation as the Gang of Eight bill were ever to become law, it would be considered President Obama’s signature second-term legislative achievement, much like Obamacare is his first term’s signature achievement. The difference from Obamacare is that Republicans like Priebus and Ryan are helping him achieve it, at least for now–largely because the donor community on Wall Street wants this policy.

Despite all the pressure from donors and special interests to do what Ryan and Priebus are doing, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, offers a different pathway forward for the GOP: flip this whole debate on its head, undercut amnesty, and make the Democrats wear the blame for having fought against the interests of American workers.

“In changing the terms of the immigration debate we will not only prevent the implementation of a disastrous policy, but begin a larger effort to broaden our appeal to working Americans of all backgrounds,” Sessions wrote in a memo to his GOP colleagues this summer."

Jerry Brown and legislative leaders broke an impasse Monday over how to reduce prison crowding, agreeing to seek more time for that effort from federal judges but preparing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to relocate inmates if the jurists say no.

With only four days left in this year’s legislative session, the deal resolves a dispute over the best way to abide by an order to shed more than 9,600 inmates from California’s packed lockups by Dec. 31.

Under the compromise, the state would ask a panel of three federal judges for time to expand rehabilitation programs aimed at reducing the number of inmates who, after serving their time, commit new crimes and return to prison.

If the judges reject an extension, the state will implement Brown’s original plan to spend $315 million this year moving inmates to private prisons, county jails and other facilities. The money for the extra housing would come from the state’s $1.1-billion reserve.

The price tag is expected to increase to $415 million for each of the following two years.

Officials have already begun preparations to move prisoners, and the governor has pledged to comply with the court without releasing any inmates early.

Brown stood with Democratic and Republican leaders outside his office Monday morning — a rare display of bipartisan unity since he took office — saying he wants the judges to “recognize our commitment to longer-term solutions and to consider modifying their order.”

He did not specify how much extra time the state would seek.

The Legislature still must vote on the new plan, which incorporates key elements of a proposal from Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). Steinberg initially had called Brown’s plan inadequate, insisting on more programs to address drug abuse and mental illness.

Steinberg had proposed asking inmates’ lawyers and the judges for a three-year reprieve of the Dec. 31 deadline. The senator had said his plan eventually would reduce the prison population by about 9,600 inmates.

The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office had found flaws in the original proposals from both Brown and Steinberg. The governor’s plan was only a short-term fix, the analyst said, and the senator’s program would take effect too slowly.

On Monday, Steinberg reiterated his view that California needed more time to “invest in a more durable and sustainable solution to our overcrowding problem.”

Lawyers for inmates, who sued the state over prison conditions in a series of cases that led to the current court order, were not included in the negotiations that resulted in Monday’s plan.

“The governor hasn’t built up a lot of trust here,” said attorney Michael Bien, who is handling a lawsuit over mental healthcare in the prisons.

Right now, he said, the lawyers are skeptical of allowing the state more time to meet the court order to shrink inmate numbers, issued originally in August 2009 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2011. The judges already moved back the deadline from June 30 to Dec. 31.

“We are supportive of the effort to reduce the total burden on prisons by changing California laws,” Bien said, “but we have not agreed to [a] length of time.”

Advertisement

The judges, for their part, have previously expressed little interest in backing down from their latest deadline. They have repeatedly accused state officials of abusing any leniency given them in the decades-long legal battle over the prisons.

“Defendants have consistently sought to frustrate every attempt by this court to achieve a resolution to the overcrowding problem,” they wrote in June.

Brown, however, asserted Monday that there was a “reasonable chance” the judges would go along with the state’s revised plan.

“We’re not acting … just with no foundation,” he told reporters. “There are little smoke signals emanating from the mountaintops.”

The Arizona Republic

Zirbel has written two self-published books on the assassination

He believes Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates in Texas were behind killing

Zirbel says public beginning to lose interest in assassination

PHOENIX -- LBJ did it.

He didn't pull the trigger, but he was in the thick of the conspiracy, according to a Scottsdale attorney who has written two books on the subject.

President John F. Kennedy was shot dead in Dallas 50 years ago Friday, and the attorney is certain that Lee Harvey Oswald's only involvement was as the fall guy.

On a recent morning, Craig Zirbel is sitting at a nondescript office in the Scottsdale Airpark, behind a desk that he says once belonged to Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin senator famous for his claims that Communists had infiltrated the government.

Zirbel has written two books on the Kennedy assassination, and, McCarthyesque government conspiracies aside, he says the public has but two choices on deciding what to believe about that November day: Either Lee Harvey Oswald, a man with no motive did it, or another theory must be devised.

A majority of people, according to polls, believe the conspiracy idea and have for a long time.

Zirbel delivers his conclusions with enthusiasm, waving his arms and raising his voice.

""I don't believe Oswald pulled the trigger,"" Zirbel says.

The attorney has been interested in the assassination for a long time.

Zirbel was in third grade when Kennedy was killed. He got a copy of the Warren Commission report on the assassination a year later, shortly after it was published. He says he did not understand much of it at the time, but he maintained his interest over the years.

The report, based on an investigation by a select government committee, concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy. That has been the official finding ever since.

But that has not stopped conspiracy theories from persisting.

Zirbel has self-published two books on the subject, ""The Texas Connection"" in 1991 and ""The Final Chapter on the Assassination of John F. Kennedy"" in 2010. The titles have been well-received by some people, criticized by others — typical of the contentious and eccentric world of Kennedy conspiracy theorists.

One of them, political strategist Roger Stone, is the author of ""The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case against LBJ,"" which came out this year.

""Craig Zirbel did some of the earliest and most important seminal work on LBJ's involvement in the murder of JFK,"" Stone said in an email. ""I have used his book, 'The Texas Connection,' with attribution. I have tried to build on the solid foundation built by Zirbel.""

Not all assassination buffs agree. It is easy to find numerous commentators who believe Zirbel misinterpreted some of the data.

The title of the book gives away Zirbel's position: that Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates in Texas were behind the assassination.

If Oswald did not pull the trigger — and Zirbel provides a list of reasons he believes he did not — then the explanation becomes more elusive.

Those who have interest in the case know the scenarios:

-- The Central Intelligence Agency, perhaps upset by changes in the agency that followed the failed Bay of Pigs invasion aimed at ousting Fidel Castro from leadership in Cuba.

-- The Mafia, arguably because of law-enforcement moves against organized crime by the Kennedy administration.

-- Anti-Castro Cuban exile groups, upset by the Bay of Pigs failure, perhaps working closely with the previous two groups.

-- Others, including the military industrial complex, a government agency such as the FBI, Southern segregationists, the Soviet Union or American conservatives.

Zirbel makes the case that Johnson, and only Johnson, had the motive, the means and the opportunity to mount a conspiracy against the president.

The motive: political gain. There were political differences, personal issues, Johnson's involvement in several scandals and his desire to become president before he got too old.

The opportunity: Kennedy's visit to LBJ's home turf in Texas. Johnson and his associates controlled many of the trip's details.

The means: shots by multiple gunmen firing from the direction of the now infamous grassy knoll. Hired perhaps by Johnson associates in the oil business, who had ties to the Mafia, Zirbel insists, there were at least two shooters.

He also emphasizes that as president, Johnson had the means to block any serious investigation.

And Oswald? His movements, his statements and his background make no sense if he was the lone gunman, Zirbel says. Even the site of the fatal shots was out of whack: Oswald would have had a much easier target several seconds earlier, as the motorcade slowed to turn twice, Zirbel notes.

It's the awkward turns, rather than the otherwise direct route the motorcade took, that strikes Zirbel.

""It's the thing that blows my mind away,"" he says. ""It's the first time a route ever was changed from what the Secret Service had established.""

The revised route took the motorcade directly past the Texas School Book Depository building and Dealey Plaza, site of the grassy knoll, from which many theorists believe the shots were fired.

Zirbel says John Connally, then Texas governor, had insisted upon the arrangement. Connally was an ally of Johnson. He, in fact, lost a fight over motorcade seating arrangements, was forced to ride with Kennedy and was wounded in the shooting.

Zirbel also points to statements by two known participants in his conspiracy: Oswald, who shouted, ""I'm a patsy!"" to nearby reporters at the Dallas jail, and Oswald's killer, Jack Ruby, who was quoted as saying, ""If you knew the truth, you'd be amazed.""

But it has been 50 years, and no conclusive evidence has emerged. Zirbel says the public is beginning to lose interest in the assassination. He says he never had interest in the ""minutae,"" and is losing interest generally.

He has begun to sell off his assassination memorabilia, including his replica of the car the president was riding in that fateful day. Media calls have slowed down, too, bumping back up only because of the significance of the anniversary.

He still wants the public to see the case for what it is.

""All I want to get out,"" he says, ""is that there was no lone assassin, and there was a conspiracy.""

He and his like-minded investigators in the field have to be gratified with their efforts, although the numbers have slipped over the last decade.

According to a recent survey from the Associated Press, conducted in mid-April, 59 percent of Americans think multiple people were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president, while 24 percent think Oswald acted alone, and 16 percent are unsure. A 2003 Gallup poll found that 75 percent of Americans felt there was a conspiracy.

The Oswald-acted-alone results, meanwhile, are the highest since the period three years after the assassination, when 36 percent said one man was responsible for Kennedy's death."

The resumption in talks does not signify any change in the Obama administration’s Cuba policy, the official said, stressing that the discussions are taking place in the context of the Cuba Democracy Act of 1992 and are consistent with the U.S. interest “in promoting the free flow of information to, from and within Cuba.”

U.S. and Cuban diplomats and postal representatives will meet in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday for technical talks aimed at ending a 50-year suspension in direct mail between the United States and the communist island. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the matter publicly before Congress is notified. Lawmakers were to be notified of the meetings starting Monday morning, the official said.

The State Department confirmed the talks will take place this week. “This is something we feel is good for us,” Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, “But it’s not meant to be a signal of anything or indicate a change in policy.”

When asked if the bankrupt Postal Service is in any position to provide these kind of services, Psaki said she “assumed” that “more revenue” would be generated because more stamps would be used.

USPS lost $16 Billion in 2012 and announced at the beginning of this year a change of services that are set to begin this summer.

Read the transcript from the State Department below:

QUESTION: All right. And then if there’s nothing else on North Korea, I just want to nail down the postal talks with Cuba.

MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.

QUESTION: Do you expect anything out of this round or is this really not – is this just – in other words, if these two days of talks are a success, there won’t be direct mail service immediately, I presume, but maybe I’m wrong, so could you —

MS. PSAKI: That’s a good question on the timeline. Just to give you a little bit of history here, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 states that, quote, “The United States Postal Service shall take such actions as are necessary to provide direct mail service to and from Cuba.” So this is – as you mentioned, on June 18th and 19th – well, you didn’t mention the dates, but so everybody knows, representatives from the Department of State and the United States Postal Service will meet with representatives from the Government of Cuba for a technical discussion on reestablishing direct transportation of mail. The reason we’re doing this is because it’s, of course, good for the Cuban people. This is something we feel is good for us. But it’s not meant to be a signal of anything or indicate a change in policy.

QUESTION: Syria?

QUESTION: Are those talks here or in —

MS. PSAKI: In terms of the exact location, I’m not sure if they’re at the Department of State or if they’re just somewhere else in the —

QUESTION: Could we go to Syria?

QUESTION: Well, can we —

MS. PSAKI: Well, let’s finish Cuba.

QUESTION: Are those talks exclusively on the mail service?

MS. PSAKI: That is with the United States Postal Service. That’s their purview.

QUESTION: But I’m saying is it mainly about the – is there anything going to come up about Mr. Gross?

MS. PSAKI: I don’t want to predict. There are issues that are, of course, raised on both sides. As you know, this is an issue that has been raised at the highest levels from the United States, but given these are talks with the Postal Service, I would expect that will be the focus.

QUESTION: You don’t consider that the highest level?

MS. PSAKI: Well – Brad, having fun on your last day? (Laughter.)

QUESTION: Just one more. I mean, is the U.S. Postal Service in any kind of position to make any kind of deals or agreements with Cuba? I mean, this is an organization that is essentially going broke, and I’m just curious. Is —

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think that’s combining two different things, in my opinion. This has been – we have had – I read off the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992.

QUESTION: Right.

MS. PSAKI: So they’re simply allowing mail to travel, which is – I would assume provides them with more revenue, with more stamps used.

QUESTION: Considering that – well, all right, exactly. So in other words, this could actually help the Postal Union’s budget if they are able to —

MS. PSAKI: I don’t want to go too far on it, but – I don’t want to go too far, Matt, but it’s more people using their services.

Jill.

QUESTION: Jen, a clarification on that too. What is the genesis of this? I mean, how did these talks actually come about? Who asked for them?

MS. PSAKI: Well, this is something that the U.S. has felt would be a positive step for the Cuban people. We felt it was in our interests. In terms of who specifically asked for it, I don’t have that level of detail, but it’s just something that we felt it was – it would be positive moving forward.

QUESTION: But basically, the U.S. asked for it?

MS. PSAKI: I would have to check on that for you, but it’s something, again, that we are very supportive of and we are, of course, helping direct here.

QUESTION: Isn’t it a continuation of the talks from 2009 that were on the same subject?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I don’t know if I’d call it a continuation because it’s been a number of years, but yes, it’s on the same subject, and we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to move things forward."
http://news.yahoo.com/advocates-press-obama-act-immigration-080816471--politics.html,,[],Advocates press Obama to act on immigration,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Frustrated with the failure of House Republicans to tackle immigration, advocates are demanding that President Barack Obama use his powers as chief executive to stop deportations or provide some relief to many of the 11 million immigrants living here illegally.

Obama insists that the nation's laws limit his ability to act unilaterally, even though his administration acted on its own last year to suspend deportations of some immigrants brought illegally into the country as children and more recently decided some relatives of U.S. service members living here illegally could remain.

The administration has also quietly changed the rules for immigrants from Visa Waiver Program countries, people who arrived in the U.S. legally but stayed longer than the 90 days the program allows. Now people from the 37, mostly European, countries in the program who are immediate relatives of U.S. citizens can apply to stay in the United States legally.

The moves stand in sharp contrast to the actions of Obama's Homeland Security Department, which has deported a record 1.47 million people during the president's nearly five years in office, according to internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement data. Heckling of the president during California appearances Monday underscored the dissatisfaction with the Democratic president, not only over the stalled immigration overhaul but the administration's policies.

""Stop deportations! Stop deportations!"" audience members yelled at Obama during a speech in San Francisco that was interrupted by a young man who said his family has been separated for 19 months.

""Executive order"" was the rallying cry at a separate Democratic fundraiser Monday. Obama, the former instructor in constitutional law, responded to the criticism with a brief lesson in the nation's rules.

""If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,"" Obama told the first group. ""But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition. And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws.""

Story continues

House Republican leaders have rejected the Democratic-controlled Senate's comprehensive immigration bill, which passed on a bipartisan vote in June. The far-reaching measure would provide new visa and workplace enforcement programs and billions of dollars for border security, along with a path to citizenship for millions.

Small, stand-alone bills from the House Judiciary Committee have languished for months, and leaders signaled that votes are unlikely in this year's remaining legislative days even though Obama recently embraced the piecemeal approach. Prospects for immigration legislation in 2014, with congressional elections looming, are slim despite the issue's political drag on the GOP.

Advocacy groups have been as loud as the California protesters in calling for Obama to act while they maintain pressure on House Republicans with protests and acts of civil disobedience.

""House Republicans are infuriating, and legislation is the permanent solution, and we're going to keep fighting for legislation. But that doesn't let Obama off the hook,"" Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigrant group, said Tuesday. ""He continues to be the president who presides over record deportation.""

What angers the advocacy groups is that many of those deported are immigrants who would qualify for legal status or citizenship under the Senate-passed legislation, which Obama supports.

The organizations argue that Obama could expand his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which dealt with some of the children brought illegally into the country, to their parents. He also could delay action against workers who have helped in the prosecution of employers who have broken the law or immigrants who don't represent a threat to national security, the groups say.

""The president does have the authority and the ability to ease the crisis on the ground while the legislative process continues to play out,"" Ana Avendano, director of immigration and community action at the AFL-CIO, said in an interview.

Advocates point to a June 2011 memo from Immigration and Customs Enforcement that provided guidance on using prosecutorial discretion in carrying out the nation's immigration laws. The discretion applied to a range of steps that could be taken in enforcing the laws, such as deciding whom to stop and arrest, or whom to release, and applied to officers, agents and lawyers.

""Prosecutorial discretion is the authority of an agency charged with enforcing a law to decide to what degree to enforce the law against a particular individual,"" the memo said.

Advocates contend that the memo gave agents, officers and lawyers flexibility in pursuing immigrants living here illegally, with priority given to criminals. But the Obama administration, they say, continues to strictly implement deportations.

About 370,000 people were removed last year, down from more than 409,000 people last year. The Homeland Security Department received money to remove about 400,000 a year, but the government decides who those people are. Hirsoshi Motomura, a law professor and immigration law expert at UCLA, said Obama could decide, for instance, to provide deferred action to groups of people described as low priorities in previous discretion memos issued by former ICE Director John Morton.

Meantime, several advocacy groups continue to fault the administration.

Pablo Alvarado, executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said in a statement that Obama has a ""credibility gap"" on immigration, imploring Congress to pass legislation while his administration implements its deportation policy.

""The president can do more, and he knows it,"" Alvarado said.

Traveling with Obama in California, a White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, did not rule out some sort of executive action. That possibility unnerves Republicans who point to Obama's unilateral changes to the health care law, such as delaying some requirements and enrollment deadlines.

Glendale residents who didn’t have a chance to meet the president shouldn’t have to pay for the DreamWorks staff who did, Councilman Zareh Sinanyan said during a council meeting this week.

“Is it not fair for [DreamWorks] to foot at least part of the bill?” Sinanyan said. “It’s not like the president came and met with the residents of Glendale.”

Sinanyan’s request came as Glendale continues to climb out of financial distress prompted by the recession and the loss of the city’s prominent redevelopment program.

The approximately $61,000 price tag for Obama’s visit covered the cost of 92 city personnel, ranging from SWAT officers to traffic control authorities, said city spokesman Tom Lorenz.

Although Councilwoman Laura Friedman said Thursday that she agreed with Sinanyan, she said Friday that she had changed her mind.

“I think that when the president comes to your city, it’s an honor and we have to take responsibility for his safety,” said Friedman, who was unable to attend the president’s speech. “As much as it would be great if DreamWorks paid, I’m not going to demand that they do.”

DreamWorks spokeswoman Allison Rawlings said the animation company had not been contacted directly by the city about the cost of security at the Obama event.

“DreamWorks is honored that the president chose to speak at DreamWorks and in Glendale,” Rawlings said.

City Manager Scott Ochoa said it’s traditional for cities to pay for the extra security that comes with a presidential visit.

“At the end of the day, it’s really just something we do,” Ochoa said.

http://news.yahoo.com/jersey-sen-lautenberg-dead-age-89-135834018.html,,[],New Jersey Sen. Lautenberg dead at age 89,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The next time a flight attendant reminds you there's no smoking on the plane or you witness a teenager getting carded at a liquor store, think of Frank Lautenberg.

The Democratic senator from New Jersey left his mark on the everyday lives of millions of Americans, whether they know it or not. In the 1980s, he was a driving force behind the laws that banned smoking on most U.S. flights and made 21 the drinking age in all 50 states.

Lautenberg, a multimillionaire businessman who became an accomplished — if often underestimated — politician, died after 4 a.m. EDT on Monday at a New York hospital after suffering complications from viral pneumonia.

At 89, he had been the oldest person in the Senate and the last remaining World War II veteran.

He served nearly three decades in the Senate in two stints, beginning with an upset victory in 1982 over Republican Rep. Millicent Fenwick, the pipe-smoking, pearl-wearing patrician who was the model for the cartoon character Lacey Davenport in ""Doonesbury.""

Possessed with neither a dynamic speaking style nor a telegenic face, he won his last race in 2008 at age 84, becoming the first New Jersey person ever elected to five Senate terms.

""People don't give a darn about my age,"" Lautenberg said then. ""They know I'm vigorous. They know I've got plenty of energy.""

Over the years, Lautenberg worked to secure hundreds of millions of dollars for mass transit projects in New Jersey and became an ardent defender of Amtrak.

He was the author of a 1984 law that threatened to withhold federal highway money from states that did not adopt a drinking age of 21, a measure that passed amid rising alarm over drunken driving. At the time, some states allowed people as young as 18 drink.

By 1988, every state was in compliance with the law, which has been widely credited with reducing highway deaths.

A former smoker, Lautenberg was one of two prime sponsors of the 1989 law that banned smoking on all domestic flights of less than six hours, one of several anti-smoking laws he championed and one that helped pave the way for today's numerous restrictions on where people can light up.

Story continues

Lautenberg had announced in February that he would not seek a sixth term. A longtime advocate of gun control, he returned to the Senate in April despite being in poor health for several votes on gun legislation favored by President Barack Obama, most Democrats and a handful of Republicans. He voted in favor of enhanced background checks for gun purchases and to reinstate a ban on assault-style weapons. Both measures failed.

Wheelchair-bound, he received warm greetings from several colleagues on the Senate floor. He also voted to move along the nomination of a new EPA commissioner, Gina McCarthy.

""Frank was a passionate public servant who was not afraid to fight and vote for what he believed in. He loved the Senate,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. ""He retired once but service called him back, and until the very end of his life, Frank made the trip from New Jersey to D.C. to fight for the issues he believed in and the people he represented. He gave everything he had to public service.""

Republican Gov. Chris Christie, whom the Democrat Lautenberg frequently criticized, will appoint a successor and a special election will determine a replacement. Newark Mayor Cory Booker had announced his intention to run and had raised some $2 million.

Along with Lautenberg's legislative accomplishments, he had a string of electoral coups, including his upset over Fenwick, whom he called ""the most popular candidate in the country,"" and a victory in a strange, abbreviated, back-from-retirement campaign 20 years later.

He initially retired in 2000 after 18 years in the Senate, saying he did not have the drive to raise money for a fourth campaign. He served on the boards of three companies, two graduate schools and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

But New Jersey Democrats recruited Lautenberg out of retirement in September 2002 as an 11th-hour replacement for Robert Torricelli, Lautenberg's longtime rival, who had abandoned his re-election bid just five weeks before Election Day.

Republicans went to court to prevent what they called the Democratic Party's ballot ""switcheroo."" When that failed, they attacked Lautenberg as a political relic ill-suited for dangerous times.

But Lautenberg surged to an easy win over Republican Douglas Forrester and returned to the Senate in 2003 at age 78, resuming his role as a leading liberal, and he made it clear that his return to office was no mere cameo.

When the Democrats regained a Senate majority in 2007, he returned to the powerful Appropriations Committee, on which he had served for 15 years. Then, in the fall of 2008, he beat back a Democratic primary challenge.

He was back in the headlines in December that year — this time as an apparent victim.

After Wall Street money manager Bernard Madoff was accused of running a $50 billion fraud scheme, Lautenberg's family foundation said the bulk of its investments were managed by him. A lawyer for the foundation declined to discuss the amount of any possible losses, but tax records in 2006 indicated Madoff managed more than 90 percent of the foundation's nearly $14 million in assets.

Lautenberg first gained prominence as chairman and CEO of Automatic Data Processing, a New Jersey-based payroll services company he had founded with two friends in 1952. It became one of the largest such companies in the world.

He was first elected to the Senate in 1982, during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Working his way up the seniority ladder, Lautenberg managed to carve out influence on the environment and transportation, two issues that matter greatly to New Jersey, the nation's most densely populated state.

Before Republicans won control of the Senate in the 1994 elections, Lautenberg was chairman of key subcommittees responsible for transportation appropriations and the Superfund pollution cleanup program. He became the ranking Democrat on those panels after 1994.

From those posts, he worked to secure hundreds of millions of dollars for mass transit projects in the state, which he said would reduce pollution and traffic congestion. He also was a leading defender of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail system.

In 1984, as a novice lawmaker and member of the minority chamber in the Senate, Lautenberg wrote a bill to withhold federal highway funds from states that did not set 21 as a minimum age to buy and possess alcohol.

After the federal voting age was lowered to 18 in 1971, many states followed suit by setting minimum drinking ages at 18 to 20.

By the early 1980s, the problem of drunken driving by teenagers was getting widespread attention. Reagan signed the bill, and by 1988, every state had a legal drinking age of 21.

Lautenberg often attacked tobacco companies' advertising tactics. During a 1989 debate over smoking, when tobacco-state lawmakers asked what would become of tobacco farmers, Lautenberg scoffed, ""Grow soybeans or something.""

Another frequent target was the gun industry. ""Common sense tells you that there are more than enough dangerous weapons on the streets,"" said Lautenberg, who sponsored numerous gun-control measures, a few of which were enacted.

He also spent much of his political career pushing for funding for Superfund, a program that pays for cleanup of environmentally hazardous sites.

Lautenberg was a reliable vote for traditional Democratic policies, though he bucked President Bill Clinton in 1993 on the budget because he said it raised taxes and didn't cut spending enough. He also voted against Clinton on the North American Free Trade Agreement, opposed by the staunch labor allies Lautenberg had come to depend on.

Later in his career, he became a foil for Christie.

In 2012, Christie called Lautenberg a ""partisan hack"" and an ""embarrassment"" and said it was time for him to retire. Lautenberg called Christie ""the name-calling governor"" and, in one speech, ""the king of liars.""

Lautenberg had health problems in recent years. He had the flu and missed the Senate's Jan. 1 vote to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff of rising taxes and falling government spending, then missed several votes two months later because of leg pain. A chest cold kept him from attending a May 29 tribute in New York honoring him for his contributions to the Jewish community and Israel.

He had been diagnosed in February 2010 with B-cell lymphoma of the stomach and underwent chemotherapy treatments until he was declared in June 2010 to be free of cancer. He worked between the treatments.

The diagnosis came just days after the death of Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, making Lautenberg the oldest member of the Senate.

For his first 14 years in the Senate, he was often in the shadow of New Jersey's other, better known senator, Bill Bradley, a former pro basketball player and 2000 presidential candidate. But he proved a formidable and bruising foe.

Running for an open Senate seat in 1982, Lautenberg won 51 percent of the vote against Fenwick. The win, financed largely with $3 million of Lautenberg's own fortune, was a shocker.

Fenwick was 72 when Lautenberg questioned her capacity to serve in the Senate. On the campaign trail, he criticized her ""capability"" to be a senator, but some observers seemed to think he was going after her age — a fact that was noted 26 years later when he ran for re-election at age 84.

""It's hard when your own words come back to haunt you, isn't it, Mr. Lautenberg?"" said an ad for his Democratic primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Robert Andrews, whom he defeated handily before beating former U.S. Rep. Dick Zimmer in the general election.

After Lautenberg won the 1982 election, Nicholas Brady, who had been appointed to serve the remainder of the previous term, resigned early to give Lautenberg valuable seniority over other new senators. He was sworn in Dec. 27, 1982, by a federal judge from Denver while he was vacationing in Vail, Colo.

In 1988, Lautenberg faced Pete Dawkins, a handsome Heisman Trophy winner who attended the U.S. Military Academy and went on to become a brigadier general and successful executive. Lautenberg's campaign assailed Dawkins as an out-of-touch carpetbagger and ran ads urging Dawkins, ""Be Real, Pete."" Lautenberg won with 54 percent of the vote.

He won a third term in 1994 against Republican Garabed ""Chuck"" Haytaian, despite the GOP gains nationwide that overturned Democratic majorities in the Senate and House and Haytaian's criticism of Lautenberg as a ""silent senator.""

In his unusual five-week return to campaigning in 2002, Lautenberg persevered with a steady, risk-averse campaign that portrayed him as a ""serious senator"" for ""serious times"" a year after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Republicans focused on Lautenberg's liberal voting record, notably his opposition to the death penalty, development of a missile defense system and the 1991 resolution authorizing force against Iraq.

Born in urban Paterson, N.J., the son of Polish and Russian Jewish immigrants, Lautenberg never forgot his roots. He often recounted what government did for him — and what it could have done to help his widowed mother as she struggled to pay his father's medical bills.

""We want to help. That's government's role,"" Lautenberg said during his successful bid for re-election in 1994.

He was educated at Nutley High School and served in the Army Signal Corps during World War II. With the help of the G.I. bill, he received an undergraduate degree in economics from Columbia University.

Lautenberg, who lived in Cliffside Park, N.J., is survived by his wife, Bonnie, and four children from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1988.

In what seems to be yet another bitterly ironic attempt by God to teach noisy religious fundamentalists what-for, the church has thus become the epicenter of a small but worrisome outbreak that has so far infected 10 and resulted in the Department of State Health Services issuing an alert spanning North Texas.

That has megachurch pastors doing a bit of fancy dancin', with Pastor Terri Pearson (Copeland's daughter) walking back their leader's anti-vaccination stance to explain to the congregation that no, God does not really want your children to contract a potentially dangerous disease that vaccinations have all but licked because duh.



""There are a lot of people that think the Bible -- we talk about walking by faith -- it leaves out things such as, I don't know, people just get strange. But when you read the Old Testament, you find that it is full of precautionary measures, and it is full of the law. Why did the Jewish people, why did they not die out during the plague? Because the Bible told them how to be clean, told them how to disinfect, told them there was something contagious. And the interesting thing of it, it wasn't a medical doctor per se who took care of those things, it was the priesthood….""

See there? Even back in the before-times, people were smart enough to know that if you could do a very simple thing in order to Not Die, you probably ought to do that thing and not just trust that all of God's various plagues and viruses had built-in piety detectors that would run away when they got a taste of the likes of religious you.

Helpfully, the church now states that it was an unclean outsider that brought this evil into their midst, which is a bit of a cop-out:



Eagle Mountain International Church, about 50 miles northwest of Dallas, released a statement Tuesday that said a visitor attended a service who had been overseas and was exposed to measles. “Therefore the congregation, staff at Kenneth Copeland Ministries and the daycare center on the property were exposed through that contact,” the statement said.

Which is, of course, how epidemics work. Somebody goes somewhere and brings back a something that none of the other somebodies have an immunity to, infecting them all and allowing the something to spread ever-further. By vaccinating yourself and your children, you are not only making sure your family does not get the disease in question, you are also making sure that your family is not a disease-riddled pus vector oozing easily preventable plague onto all the other people in your community, causing you to be scorned as an ""outsider"" and the state department of health to issue up bulletins specifically naming you and your community as the disease-riddled pus vectors in question and warning your fellow human beings to wash their hands a lot if they have to come in contact with you.

And that, children, is why the church run by an anti-vaccination crank is now holding free vaccination clinics in apparent contradiction to the beliefs of said crank. Curiously, there doesn't seem to be any word from Copeland himself; barring other evidence we can only assume that the rest of the church leadership locked him in a nice, sturdy cupboard for a while?

Since April, about a third of the Air Force's combat flying fleet has been grounded due to federal spending cuts. The Air Force won a temporary reprieve from the cuts, which will allow the jets to begin flying again.

Congress gave the Air Force and other agencies the power to re-allocate money within their budgets. The Air Force on Monday decided to reinstate $208 million to restore the flights.

Related: 650,000 defense employees start furloughs

The move also affects the grounded Thunderbirds. They resume training with hopes of performing aerial shows next year. There will be no Thunderbird shows this year.

Air Force leaders called the move a step in the right direction but warned that budget cuts have left the military agency less prepared for crisis, especially since federal funding for next year is also precarious. The latest move only restores the flights until Oct. 1, when the current fiscal year ends.

""Budget uncertainly makes it difficult to determine whether we'll be able to sustain a fully combat-ready force,"" said Gen. Mike Hostage, commander of Air Combat Command.

The Pentagon is the largest federal employer, with a budget of $680 billion. It has faced the lion's share, or $40 billion of the $85 billion in federal spending cuts, that kicked in on March 1.

Some 650,000 civilian defense workers have started taking furloughs, or one unpaid day off each week, since early July.

The move has no effect on the Navy's Blue Angels aerial performance, which has also been grounded and will remain so for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Republican Sen. John McCain, from Arizona, called the solution a ""band-aid"" that ""cannot be sustained."" McCain called for the president and lawmakers to find a way to end forced spending cuts.

""The Air Force is cutting hundreds of millions of dollars from important programs so that it can continue to fund the minimum acceptable amount of training for combat squadrons,"" he warned."

Napolitano will be the next president of the University of California system

President Obama praises her response to threats%2C from hurricanes to terrorism



Napolitano will stay at her post until September

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who has handled hot-button issues ranging from immigration to counter-terrorism, said Friday she is resigning to run the University of California and its system of colleges.

""I thank President Obama for the chance to serve our nation during this important chapter in our history,"" Napolitano said in a statement. ""And I know the Department of Homeland Security will continue to perform its important duties with the honor and focus that the American public expects.""

Obama praised Napolitano's performance during four-and-a-half years at the Department of Homeland Security, noting that its responsibilities during her tenure ranged from the Joplin tornado to Hurricane Sandy, as well as efforts to thwart terrorism.

""Since day one, Janet has led my administration's effort to secure our borders, deploying a historic number of resources, while also taking steps to make our immigration system fairer and more consistent with our values,"" Obama said. ""And the American people are safer and more secure thanks to Janet's leadership in protecting our homeland against terrorist attacks.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney noted that Napolitano will stay at her post until September, and that Obama will be ""very deliberate"" in selecting a successor.

A prominent senator -- Democrat Charles Schumer of New York -- has already floated one name, New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

Her resignation caught many in Washington by surprise -- Napolitano has often been mentioned as a potential successor to Attorney General Eric Holder.

Some Republicans and others criticized Napolitano over immigration policies, citing a de-emphasis on prosecutions against suspects believed to be in the United States illegally. Napolitano also backed a plan to end deportations against young people who lacked legal status.

Napolitano and supporters said limited law enforcement resources should focus on threats to public safety and national security.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said Napolitano's tenure has been marked ""by a consistent disrespect for the rule of law,"" and that ""the most significant obstacle to immigration reform remains President Obama's selective enforcement of the law.""

Others, however, pointed to record numbers of deportations on Napolitano's watch. Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said, ""we are pleased to see her go.""

Sessions and other critics have also faulted Napolitano's department for failing to be transparent about border security and the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun running investigation.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he and his fellow Arizonan ""have had our share of disagreements"" over the years, ""but I have never doubted her integrity, work ethic, or commitment to our nation's security.""

Napolitano, a former governor of Arizona, is only the third person to lead the Department of Homeland Security, created a decade ago in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. She held the job throughout Obama's first term.

DHS employees ""serve on the front lines of our nation's efforts to protect our communities and families from harm,"" Napolitano said, and working with them ""has been the highlight of my professional career.""

She said her department ""has improved the safety of travelers; implemented smart steps that make our immigration system more fair and focused while deploying record resources to protect our nation's borders; worked with states to build resiliency and make our nation's emergency and disaster response capabilities more robust; and partnered with the private sector to improve our cybersecurity.""

The University of California regents who run a 10-campus college system confirmed Napolitano's new appointment in a statement, praising her as someone who has run large public agencies and has a deep interest in improving higher education.

Chosen over more than 300 other potential candidates, Napolitano will be the 20th president of the University of California.

""While some may consider her to be an unconventional choice, Secretary Napolitano is without a doubt the right person at the right time to lead this incredible university,"" said a statement from Sherry Lansing, the regent and former film industry executive who headed the search committee.

Added Lansing: ""She will bring fresh eyes and a new sensibility — not only to UC, but to all of California. She will stand as a vigorous advocate for faculty, students and staff at a time when great changes in our state, and across the globe, are presenting as many opportunities as challenges.""

In her statement, Napolitano said that in her new job she wants ""to play a role in educating our nation's next generation of leaders."""

(CNN) —

U.S. President Barack Obama will travel to Mexico and Costa Rica in May, officials said Wednesday.

The trip, scheduled to take place May 2-4, “is an important opportunity to reinforce the deep cultural, familial and economic ties that so many Americans share with Mexico and Central America,” the White House said in a statement.

Economic and trade ties will be topics of discussion in Obama’s scheduled meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the White House said.

Mexico’s foreign ministry said a wide range of issues would be on the table.

“The agenda between both countries is broad and directly affects both societies,” the statement said. “During the visit, competitiveness, education and innovation will be addressed, as well as border infrastructure, trade, immigration and citizen security, among other issues of shared interest.”

Pena Nieto met with Obama at the White House in November, just a few days before taking office in Mexico.

In Costa Rica, Obama will meet with President Laura Chinchilla and with the heads of state of other Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, the White House said.

“The trip will be an important chance to discuss our collective efforts to promote economic growth and development in Central America and our ongoing collaboration on citizen security,” the White House said.

In the past, the United States has pledged to increase security aid to Central America to help combat violence in the region."

Boehner declined to answer whether he supports what many on the left have come to term a “pathway to citizenship” for illegal immigrants during his appearance on CBS News’ Face The Nation on Sunday morning. For conservative lawmakers, that does not assuage fears that he and his deputies House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Whip Kevin McCarthy, and Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan could be working behind the scenes cut a deal with Reid and President Barack Obama to achieve amnesty for illegal immigrants in America.

“We are scared to death of what we figure is already Boehner’s end game,” a senior congressional GOP aide told Breitbart News. “There are so many forces within the GOP establishment pushing for their interests that it’s hard to conceive that Boehner will not cave to them.”

Boehner could “conference” any bill or group of bills the House passes related to immigration with the Senate’s controversial immigration bill. In conference, representatives for House GOP leadership would negotiate with Senate Democratic leadership, and potentially the White House, on what they would call a “compromise” on immigration reform.

Conservatives do not trust Boehner and his team to stand up to Senate Democrats in conference, so they are advocating the House refuse to pass any legislation for fear it could be molded into a “compromise” that looks just like or is identical language to the Senate bill.

Many conservatives fear that such a compromise would only get a short amount of time for actual review, and votes would be whipped up and sold using talking points just like how the Senate bill passed. They point to comments from Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), whose amendment with Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) made a series of massive changes to the bill, where he argued that it is acceptable for senators to work with because they “will have more than 72 hours to read and review the proposal before any votes.”

“The worry among Capitol Hill conservatives was that Boehner would take any House-passed bill with the word ‘immigration’ in it and set up a conference that would produce a bill with the trappings of compromise that would be politically difficult to oppose,” conservative journalist Neil McCabe, a former senior reporter for Human Events, wrote in a recent column for Town Hall magazine.

McCabe’s column, titled “Stockman calls out Boehner gambit to save amnesty agenda,” focuses on efforts Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) has led to uncover how the Senate immigration bill is unconstitutional on the grounds that it raises revenue. As Breitbart News reported last week, House Ways and Means Committee chairman Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), the House authority on tax and revenue issues, agreed with Stockman’s analysis and similarly labeled the bill unconstitutional.

However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid can protect the bill, and a future deal with House GOP leaders, by using a procedural trick in which he holds on to the bill in his chamber of Congress and does not send it over to the House. Though the bill passed the Senate several weeks ago now, Reid has not yet delivered it to the House.

Boehner has not agreed to refuse to salvage the Senate bill, as conservatives like Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) have requested. All indications are that such a conference would not happen until sometime after the August recess, as the opposition to amnesty has slowed proponents of the effort.

Conservative columnist and best-selling author Ann Coulter, who has been warning for months about such a conference strategy by amnesty advocates, believes the House should not pass any immigration bills, regardless of their individual merit. She argues that pro-amnesty lawmakers may use a conference as a vehicle to get the Senate bill or something like it to President Barack Obama’s desk, where he can sign it into law.

“Right now, people who don’t want amnesty have to call the House and say they don’t want any immigration bill until we have a Republican Senate,” Coulter said in a late-June appearance on Fox News Channel’s Hannity. “If they pass a bill that does nothing but enforce e-verify, does nothing but enforce the fence, it will go into conference with the Senate and it will come out an amnesty bill.”

Coulter added that she suspects Boehner “secretly wants” amnesty for illegal immigrants:

Nothing will happen with a vote to enforce E-verify, which by the way is a one-page simple bill; they could do that right away if they were serious about enforcing the border. But I don’t trust and perhaps I’m wrong, I hope he will prove me wrong. I think John Boehner secretly wants the amnesty and he want as fig leaf to make it took like, “Oh, no we just voted on the fence.” No, a vote on the fence in the House is a vote for amnesty.

“Ann Coulter got it exactly right,” added that senior GOP congressional aide who warned that Republicans are “scared to death” about what Boehner could do."

Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism, April 25, 2013

In the four months since the Newtown, Connecticut shootings, the tone of the conversation about gun control on Twitter has shifted sharply several times in apparent response to ongoing events, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of nearly 21 million tweets from December 18 through April 21.

“I think the opposition is counting on mistrust of government, hatred of Obama and the idea that Congress can’t get anything right to combine as the pathway to no,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group.

Politicians counting on Americans to forget about Newtown when they go to the ballot box next year may be in for a surprise. A pair of recent PPP polls shows that “no” votes from Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Jeff Flake(R-AZ, NRA rating=A), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK, NRA rating=A), Mark Begich (D-AK, NRA rating=D),Rob Portman (R-OH, NRA rating=A), and Dean Heller (R-NV, NRA rating=A) have dropped them into varying degrees of hot water with voters. Another poll from Pew showed that, while overall dissatisfaction with the vote did not match the 90% approval of background checks, many more Americans were disappointed or angry about the Senate’s failure to pass background checks than those who were relieved or happy. A pair of new polls shows that even in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, the public’s interest in the gun control debate has actually increased, and the number of Americans who identify guns as the most important problem facing this country is equal to the number who answer “terrorism” to the same question.

NY Times talks immigration reform prospects, but could be talking about gun laws or anything else:Interest waning? No. Mediaite Gun safety advocates are not going away. Intensity is not on the side of gun rights. It does not hurt politiclans to vote for background checks. 5 y.o.s should not have guns , even in Kentucky. And what other myths do you want addressed?

How about the deep paranoia of Republicans that the media who tut-tut Obama's record are afraid to tell you about?

Poll: 29% Think Armed Rebellion Might Soon Be Necessary The eye-opening findings serve as a reminder that Americans’ deeply held beliefs about gun rights have a tendency to cross over into outright conspiracy theories about a nefarious government seeking to trample the Second Amendment — paranoia that pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association have at times helped stoke. The data help explain why even the most modest gun safety laws face tremendous, intense opposition.

“I’m for stricter gun laws, but the reason I favor the Republicans over the Democrats and the liberals on gun laws is because they have always been against the Second Amendment and the right to own guns,” said Jim Hensley, 69, a Republican from Grandville, Mich., in an interview after the poll was conducted. “Yes, I believe the Republicans should have voted for background checks, and they should not legalize automatic weapons,” Mr. Hensley added. “I was against the repeal of the ban on automatic weapons, and I don’t support the N.R.A. But it’s like marriage. You stick with your wife no matter what, and you don’t just ditch your political party on one issue.”

Two weeks after a bipartisan measure that would have expanded background checks for gun buyers was defeated in the Senate, nearly 9 in 10 of those surveyed said they favored background checks on all gun buyers, and 6 in 10 said they were disappointed or angry with the vote.

Voting is tribal, not logical. Sometimes you simply need to win rather than worry about convincing everyone of the whys and wherefores.Want intensity? You're looking at it."

Organizers are using Facebook to promote the gathering, which is expected to begin about 1 p.m.. They expect about 6,000 people to attend the rally at the site of the fiery car crash that took the life of Walker and his friend, Roger Rodas.

Officials from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department are preparing for a large crowd, moving items placed at an informal memorial at the scene of the accident.

Nearby North Park Community Church is urging its members to consider parking Sunday farther from the church than usual because of the expected crowd. The church has also made arrangements for free coffee and water for people attending the event.

Walker and Rodas were killed Nov. 30 when a 2005 Porsche Carrera GT driven by Rodas, 38, crashed into a pole and a tree on Hercules Street near Kelly Johnson Parkway. Walker, 40, was a passenger in the vehicle.

The two had decided to go for a ride in the 600-horsepower car after attending a charity event sponsored by Reach Out Worldwide, Walker’s nonprofit organization that provides assistance for disaster victims around the globe.

Walker died from a combination of injuries and burns suffered in the crash, according to coroner’s officials. Rodas’ death was the result of “multiple traumatic injuries.”

Sheriff’s officials said speed was a factor in the crash, but there was no evidence the pair were involved in a street race.

Investigators are still trying to determine exactly what caused the crash and whether there was a possible mechanical failure, causing Rodas to lose control.

The results of toxicology tests are not expected for six to eight weeks.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/18/military-hardship-furloughs/,2013-07-18 00:00:00,['Joseph Weber'],Military communities brace for 'hardship' as defense furloughs take effect,"Military communities across the country, after listening to the warnings about steep budget cutbacks for months, are now bracing for impact as furloughs for roughly 650,000 civilian Defense Department employees kick in this month.

Officials at military bases and other DoD facilities will have some flexibility in scheduling days off. But the furloughs will nevertheless result in non-essential civilian workers missing one paid workday a week -- a roughly 20 percent pay cut -- over the next three months.

Virginia’s Hampton Roads, which encompasses the massive Naval Station Norfolk, is expected to be among the country’s hardest-hit communities -- considering it has 14 military and Coast Guard facilities. Roughly half the regional economy is tied to the Defense Department.

“There no question we’ll feel the impact and it will pervasive across the entire region,” said Ira Agricola, a government affairs official with the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce.

However, he and other regional experts said the full effect will not be known for months because the furloughs just started and economists need time to collect and analyze the data.

“I’m certain it will impact the community,” said retired Adm. Craig Quigley, now executive director of the Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance.

“People will be spending less across the board. They’ll postpone a family vacation, fix the car instead of getting a new one. … But it’s difficult to put a dollar figure on. It’s all over the map,” Quigley, a former deputy assistant secretary of Defense, told FoxNews.com.

The civilian defense employees -- about 85 percent of the department’s civilian workforce -- must take off 11 days without pay through September, the end of fiscal 2013.

Furloughed workers are already talking about canceling vacations and other efforts to trim household budgets, while military families express concerns about cutbacks in services, including their children’s schooling, considering fewer civilian providers will be on the job.

“I have been hit by the furloughs, and they're inconvenient and difficult,” Claire Riggle, a civilian employee and military spouse, told Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Monday. “But what bothers me more is the effect it has on our children.”

Hagel, speaking at a town hall-style meeting at Fort Bragg, N.C., said civilian teachers are being furloughed just five days and that officials are trying to schedule their furloughs on non-school days.

“Most of the family programs are exempt,” he said. “I know this is difficult. And I know it's difficult for children.”

Hagel’s comments echoed those he made May 14 in announcing the furloughs, saying cuts to training, maintenance and other operations were not enough to reduce a $30 billion shortfall.

“The department has been doing everything possible to reduce this shortfall while ensuring we can defend the nation,” he said at the time. “I recognized the significant hardship this places on you and your families.”

The furloughs are part of the so-called “across the board” cuts to the federal government that are known as sequester and started in March -- after Washington failed to agree on less drastic budget reductions. As much as $85 billion will be cut this year as part of the large effort to trim the federal deficit by roughly $1.2 trillion over 10 years.

The furloughs are expected to save the department about $1.8 billion this year, but Hagel warned again Monday about an uncertain future, saying the potential for more cuts are “casting a very dark cloud over our institution.”

Part of the reason for the wide-ranging impact is that furloughs affect everybody from a senior-level civil servant to lesser-paid workers supporting their families on one salary.

Among those to first raise concerns about the furloughs were advocates for wounded combat soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center -- the country’s top facility for wounded warriors.

Roughly 2,400 workers at the suburban Washington facility – including doctors and therapists -- were notified in May about being furloughed, which advocates say could jeopardize the quality of care.

A spokeswoman for National Capital Regional Medical said in response that wounded warrior care remains Walter Reed’s “top priority” and “will not be compromised.”"

Americans want the government to re-open. Speaker Boehner is telling us that is not possible at this time and that our government must remain shuttered because the votes simply aren't there for a clean CR to pass.

I personally hate to believe that the Speaker of the House of Representatives is an actual liar and yet, I have to believe that he is. I understand that the votes are there.

Here's a Tally Of Which Republicans Are Ready To Fund the Government With No Strings Attached

The only way to resolve this issue - Is the Speaker of the House of Representatives Being Truthful to the American Public is for him to PROVE IT.

Offer up the clean CR with the same budget numbers you agreed to last month then count the votes.

The Speaker indicated that it's a waste of time. We do know that the Republicans don't really mind wasting time since they have pointlessly repealed the ACA 42 times, so that wouldn't be the real reason for not presenting it.

In fact, the only reason I can come up with for not presenting the clean CR is the obvious one:

Because it will pass and expose the Speaker of the House as the weak, unreliable, prevaricating politician that he has been throughout these negotiations.

If Mr. Boehner does not want the American public to think these are the underlying reasons for not presenting the CR, he should act swiftly to counter this impression.

So Speaker Boehner, you say the votes aren't there -I ask again for you to

Yesterday on The O'Reilly Factor, Bill O got into a discussion with Megyn Kelly about the Prop 8 hearing. In just under two minutes they managed to alienate a large segment of their viewers by not sufficiently hating the gays and our desire to be treated just like everyone else.

Oh, and a pig just flew past my window.

MEGYN KELLY: I mean, I think the country's views on this issue are changing, they're changing dramatically.

O'REILLY: But why are they changing?

KELLY: Well, because I think the same-sex marriage advocates have done a credible job in getting out there and making their case. I mean, for years those who opposed gay marriage -- take the religion piece out of it for this, because there is no arguing that. The Christian religion teaches what it teaches. The Bible says what it says, I mean about marriage.

O'REILLY: But our policy shouldn't be made by that.

KELLY: I know, so take that out of it.

O'REILLY: Right.

KELLY: What I'm saying is that when you ask -- for example, I had an interview with Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. What is it about calling a marriage -- calling a gay union a marriage that offends you. How does it hurt a traditional, or a heterosexual marriage? And I didn't hear anything articulated that was particularly persuasive. What people go back to --

O'REILLY: And I agree with you 100-percent. A 100-percent! … I agree with you a 100-percent. The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals. That's where the compelling argument is. 'We're Americans, we just want to be treated like everybody else.'

That’s a compelling argument. And to deny that, you’ve got to have a very strong argument on the other side. And the other side hasn’t been able to do anything but thump the Bible.

KELLY: Their best argument, thus far, has been, 'well, marriage is an institution that for 2,000 has been about a man and a woman creating babies.'

O'REILLY: That's right.

KELLY: Procreation. But look at how society has changed. I mean, people, they talk today about would we be okay passing a law saying people over 55 can't get married because they're not likely to have babies.

O'REILLY: I support civil unions, I always have. Alright. The gay marriage thing, I don’t feel that strongly about it one way or the other. I think the states should do it. Right.

KELLY: I think the Supreme Court is going to come down on the side of letting the democratic process play out in the states.

O'REILLY: New York has it now. I live in New York, New York has it, I'm fine with it. I want all Americans to be happy, I do."

http://news.yahoo.com/2016-looms-clinton-keeps-supporters-135836058--election.html,,[],"As 2016 looms, Clinton keeps up with supporters","CHICAGO (AP) — Whether she runs for president or not in 2016, Hillary Rodham Clinton is making sure she stays connected to important Democratic constituencies, from college students and black women to the gay and lesbian community.

Clinton has spoken to a women's institute in Pennsylvania, a prominent black women's sorority in the nation's capital, the American Jewish University in Los Angeles and an organization called Chicago House that helps people with HIV and AIDS.

Her fall itinerary includes speeches before college students at three universities in New York, which she represented in the Senate, an award from the Elton John AIDS Foundation, a speech at a Minneapolis synagogue and an event involving a Mexican-American initiative at the University of Southern California.

For all the talk that the former secretary of state intended to slow down after two decades in national political life, Clinton is keeping a busy schedule that amounts to a training camp for a second presidential campaign, if there is one.

In many of her speeches, Clinton talks about America's role in the world and weighs in on national issues on her own terms. Her words often seem to be aimed at maintaining a connection to the party's base of women, black and Hispanic voters, young people and gays and lesbians.

While her speeches avoid partisan politics, they put her before admiring audiences that relish the notion of a woman leading the country.

""We broke the great race barrier with President Obama but it's time that we also really ask ourselves deep down what it's going to take to elect a woman president,"" Clinton said Thursday in response to a question during a Miami address to travel agents. ""And I will certainly do what I can when that time comes to elect somebody — whoever that somebody might be.""

Clinton's advisers note that she has avoided the circuit of Democratic dinners and events in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and focused on issues about which she long has been passionate — the status of women and girls around the globe, early childhood education and the trafficking of wildlife in Africa.

Story continues

She is expected to limit her in-person political activity this year to fundraisers and events for Terry McAuliffe, a friend who's running for Virginia governor.

The former first lady regularly deflects questions about her future, telling audiences there is plenty of time for those considerations. But the significance of a female president is never far from the surface. In a speech Wednesday to Chicago House, for example, nearly 2,000 attendees stood and cheered for a full 40 seconds after Clinton, who narrowly lost the nomination to Barack Obama in the 2008, was asked whether she would try again for the White House.

Clinton's speeches are showing many of her admirers a side they craved to see in 2008 and one they hope will be on display should she run in 2016.

In one of her first public acts after leaving government, Clinton endorsed gay marriage, putting her in line with members of her own party. In July, Clinton told about 14,000 members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, the nation's oldest black college sorority, that the not guilty verdict in the death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin had brought ""deep, painful heartache"" for many families.

Her speech to the Delta convention and a separate address to the American Bar Association in San Francisco focused on her critique of the Supreme Court's decision to invalidate parts of the Voting Rights Act, a decision that angered many liberals. Clinton said the ruling could make it more difficult for the poor and elderly to vote, words that were embraced with shouts of ""Run, Hillary, Run,"" at the end of her speech.

""She's doing all the right things to become a candidate, certainly, she's done nothing antithetical to that,"" said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who rejected the notion that Clinton should avoid speaking about policy issues for fear of alienating potential voters. ""She's solidifying the enthusiasm of people in the Democratic base who are looking for strong leadership. So I think she's on the right track.""

Clinton most recently backed Obama's threats to use force in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria and has said it was the reason Russia urged Syria to get rid of its stockpile.

In Chicago, Clinton echoed her husband's recent speech in support of Obama's health care law, saying the overhaul should be implemented and improved where necessary. ""Nobody has a better idea,"" she said.

She also expressed hope that Congress would avoid defaulting on the nation's debt. ""I just hope they realize this could be a terrible self-inflicted wound that would have implications for everything we care about,"" she said.

Clinton's travels also help burnish her centrist credentials. During a June address at the Economic Club of Grand Rapids, Mich., she talked about the characteristics of leadership and sat next to Richard and Helen DeVos, both longtime Republican financial donors and activists. Her private, paid speeches have put her before industry groups that represent financial interests, housing developers and the tourist industry.

Earlier this month, Clinton received the Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The group's chairman, former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., credited Clinton's ""lifelong career in public service."" Famous friends and supporters, including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and tennis star Billie Jean King, praised her in video testimonials.

Her childhood development initiative with the Clinton Foundation, called Too Small to Fail, features a leadership council that includes former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Cindy McCain, the wife of Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee.

Her travel can often resemble a victory lap, filled with awards and acclaim. In addition to speeches at three New York universities, in the heart of where she built her first campaign for Senate, Clinton will be honored by Yale Law School, where she earned her law degree, and the Children's Defense Fund, where she started her work in the 1970s as an advocate for women and children.

Clinton is fielding offers to teach at universities, including Yale, Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and New York University, where her daughter, Chelsea, is co-founder of a multifaith center.

Hillary Clinton is writing a book, due out next spring, about her time as the nation's top diplomat, and will discuss her work on health and economic issues related to women and children during this coming week's Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York.

But some of the events show a lighter side. During a question-and-answer session, Chicago journalist David Viggiano wrapped up his interview by asking Clinton ""five frivolous questions,"" including a request that she pose with him for a ""selfie"" on stage.

After the quick photo, she smiled as she revealed her childhood celebrity crush (1950s teen idol Fabian), her love of the Home and Garden Television Network and the ""therapeutic"" enjoyment of cleaning and organizing closets. But when Viggiano told her a Chicago bar wanted to create a ""Hillary"" cocktail, she was speechless.

""I have been asked nearly everything but I have to tell you, David, nobody ever asked me that and I'm at a loss for words,"" Clinton said, ""which you know is not a common trait for me.""

Most recently, the Honolulu Police Department announced a ban on any visible tattoos, piercings or “dental ornaments.” Existing tattoos must be covered with a long sleeve uniform or with makeup. (Yes, makeup.)

The new ban raises multiple concerns. Tattoos are a huge part of Hawaii culture, Polynesian tattoos in particular. Many see tattoos not as a fashion statement but as a statement of heritage. Similar issues were raised last year when the London Metropolitan Police banned some tattoos, since a portion of their force came from Pacific islands.

The New Orleans police department is in the process of reviewing its proposed tattoo ban in light of this concern. ""As we reach temperatures close to 100 degrees on some days, it just seems like cruel and unusual punishment, just because you are proud that you served in the U.S. Navy or you put the name of your child on your arm,"" a Fraternal Order of Police spokesman said during this summer’s debate over the ban.

Finally, on an island where every branch of the military has at least one base, no doubt the Honolulu PD will also face the problem of a large portion of their officers having military backgrounds. The military has a strong tattoo culture, and veterans wear their ink with pride. Retired military members provide one of the best pools from which police departments could and should recruit.

Baltimore, Los Angeles and New York all have tattoo bans of varying degrees, and smaller departments are clearly trying to follow suit. But what effect do tattoo bans have on the success of the officers? “The absence of visible tattoos gives a more professional appearance to law enforcement officers,"" an NOPD spokesperson argued.

Some officers agree, believing a tattoo-less police force will aid in their community interactions. Jeffrey Yzquierdo, who has a full-sleeve tattoo on his arm, had been with the Phoenix Police Department for 11 years when he told the New York Times that he had no problem with a tattoo ban. “Some people want nothing to do with me,” Yzquierdo said, indicating he was frustrated with the public’s negative response towards him because of his tattoos.

But many police departments’ bans involve an incredible amount of bureaucracy and nitpicking that possibly takes focus away from much more important concerns. Department bans specify the size of the allowable tattoos, “no greater than 3"" X 3"" size each” and only one on each arm for new hires in Palm Beach County. (For veterans, a little leeway: “No larger than a notecard.”) In Phoenix, tattoos could not be larger than a “3x5 index card.”

In departments where the ban only applies to new hires, like Des Moines, current officers had to document by photograph and report every tattoo they already had so that no new tattoo went unnoticed -- or unpunished.

As Honolulu moves forward with its tattoo ban, NOPD continues to reconsider its ban. It may be one of the few departments heeding the argument that the police have bigger fish to fry. According to The Advocate, New Orleans loses an average of one police officer every three days.

“I think it’s bad for the city,” Police Association of New Orleans President Mike Glasser said. “It accomplishes nothing. I don’t know if it makes for a more professional appearance, but it doesn’t make for more professional policing.”

In fact, when the Des Moines Police Department banned tattoos in 2009, police union president Stewart Barnes argued that his tattoos actually helped him do his job. Then 48 years old, Barnes said his ink helped local youth relate to him. “""They come up to me and talk to me about tattoos.”"

USA TODAY

BINGHAMTON, N.Y. — Just another high school soccer practice in New York state in August — except for when the president dropped in.

President Obama and his bus, en route to a town hall at Binghamton University on Friday, stopped to chat with soccer players at Tully Junior-Senior High School in Tully, N.Y.

""I was driving by and I thought, you know, I need to kick around a ball a little bit,"" said Obama, who proceeded to do just that for a few minutes.

Three teams of Black Knights spoke with the president: girls junior varsity soccer, girls varsity soccer and boys varsity soccer.

""How's it going everybody?"" Obama asked. ""How long ago did practice start?"" (8 a.m.)

""How are you guys feeling?"" he said. ""Did you practice during the summer? ... What grade are most of you in?""

Obama, who will spend Friday wrapping up a two-day bus tour of New York and Pennsylvania, cited the reason for the trip: promoting his latest education plan.

""I'm traveling around the area talking about college, making sure that young people can pay for it,"" he said. ""I'm assuming everybody here's gonna want to go to college? So part of what we want to do is make sure that whatever school you decide to go to that you can afford to do it, get grants, loans and don't end up having too much debt.""

At the prodding of a coach, one girl told Obama that meeting the president had been on her ""bucket list.""

When Obama asked the girl how old she is, she said 9.

Obama said, ""Here's the general rule: When you're 9, you don't need a bucket list. When you get to be 52, then you might start wanting to draw one up. But you've got a lotta stuff going on ahead of you.""

Obama asked the girls' teams, ""Can you beat the boys?""

Yes, came the reply.

""If I go over there and tell them you said that, would that be OK?"" Obama asked.

One of the girls replied, ""Bring it!""

While visiting the boys' team, Obama said, ""Can I just say though, I hate to stir up trouble, but the girls said they could beat you. ... I'm just saying. That's what they said.""

The boys disputed that assessment.

When Obama repeated the comment about ""bring it,"" one of the coaches said, ""That was probably my daughter.""

On his way back to the bus, Obama greeted some school administrators and parents, one of whom asked about his soccer skills.

""They were trying to recruit me!"" Obama said. ""I told them I was too old.""

He added, however, ""I've got some game."""

Read This And You'll Feel Much Better!,"What I'm about to suggest works. I know it does because I'm well beyond getting angry, dismayed, upset, troubled, or even perplexed by the rapid-fire amalgamation of what is slowly (but surely) turning into a fascistic system.

What helped me get here? Becoming aware of exactly what's happening, and who is behind it. That realization is extremely powerful! It's actually liberating.

Why? Because now that I know the nature of the challenges we are facing, instead of being distracted by decoys, lies, misinformation and smokescreens, I can focus my attention like a laser beam at the real culprits behind the horrendous crimes being committed against the citizenry.

Folks, the political system in the final analysis is a farce... No, don't worry, I'm not going to suggest that people stop exercising their right to vote and engage in the political process. We can't never give up on that front.

But it is essential that we understand at this point, given the circumstances, and again, in the final analysis, the entire system is rigged.

Here's the actual situation: For many reasons (which I'm not going to cover here), the ""system"" here in the U.S., and the U.K., and Greece, and Italy, and Spain, and other countries, has evolved into a plutocratic corporatocracy.

This has brought about a governance ethos based on the shared interests of a ruling elite composed of powerful moneyed/financial/corporatists actors and the political class here in the U.S., and in France, the U.K., Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Germany, and other countries. The latter is paid off by the former.

Everything else is pure noise, distractions, smokescreens, kabuki theater.

Here's the problem: If you think that the Democrats are the good guys and the Republicans are the bad guys, and you base your world view on that premise, then you're going to have the tendency to judge most issues using a partisan or tribal prism with a totally distorted understanding of the actual situation at hand.

Psychologically, that is very harmful because the things that are actually happening are totally incongruous with your flawed understanding of the supposed reasons.

The Democratic party establishment is under the total control of the same forces that are in control of the Republican party establishment.

They are both fucking you over, and are answering to the same masters. There is a difference, of course. You can think of it as a good-cop-bad-cop situation, but both having the same objectives: to serve their corporate paymasters.

The Republican party is like the loud-mouthed thug, overtly fascistic, content with putting a jackboot on your face, pressing it hard. The Democratic party is more subtle, pretending to be your friend, greets you nicely, hugs you, back-slaps you, but when you turn around, it tells the same thugs to work you over, throw you inside the trunk of a car, drive you to a cliff, and push you over it.

They are both working for the same people: and it ain't you.

Why is having this understanding healthy? It's not because now all of the sudden I, or anybody else, can take on the corrupt system. It is because now I have a clear understanding of why the outrageous things I see happening (as we move further and further into fascism) are taking place.

The necessary condition for fixing this situation would be the acknowledgement of this truism (I'm describing here) by millions and millions of people, here in the U.S., and in the U.K., and France, and Spain, and Italy, and other countries under the control of the same nefarious forces.

And thus, at least to me, that's where I spend most of my activist energy on: trying to wake people up to this reality.

Will I (and countless others trying to do the same thing) be successful at it? Nobody can say for sure, but in my heart of hearts I believe it is possible; otherwise I would not waste my time in the effort.

Again, and regardless of how long of a process is going to be before enough people wake up to this simple reality, knowing the true nature of what's going on is indeed therapeutic. And that's why I don't get angry anymore by the dastardly things I see happening, from our institutions. What else would one expect from a government on the take. It's only natural; normal. The system is rigged, and corrupt.

Finally, no amount of petition drives or complaining will ever make any difference. The corrupt ruling class will only relent if they are forced to do so, with overwhelming power from the people.

But one thing at a time... First, we need to wake TFU. The rest will manifest itself.

Let's get to it!"

Pollak'],Ten Facts Conservatives Must Know on Immigration Reform,"Border security is the only basis for Republican unity. Republicans are divided on all other particulars–path to citizenship, guest worker program, deportation, anchor babies, etc. As I’ve argued before, Republican strategy in the House should be to say “no” on issues where there is consensus, and “no, unless” on issues where there is not. In this case, the House should reject any reform unless it puts border security first.

Law enforcement is the only true bipartisan policy. Conservative Republicans have something in common with unions: a common enthusiasm for enforcing immigration law against employers, particularly through the use of e-verify databases for new hires. In addition, working-class voters are less than enthusiastic about legalizing immigrants who would create instant competition in non-farm sectors of the low-skills labor market.

We have tried amnesty before, and it failed. The reason we have some 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States is that a 1986 amnesty enacted by the Reagan administration failed to improve law enforcement (thanks in part to liberal interest groups) and merely created new incentives for illegal immigration. Enforcement is to amnesty as spending cuts are to tax hikes; unless they come first, they do not happen.

Democrats do not want to “resolve” illegal immigration. If they did, it would have been done already. They do want to pass big legislation: back in 2006-7, Democrat strategist (and ex-con) Robert Creamer prescribed immigration reform as the second step in a series of radical changes (after health care). Yet as Daniel Horowitz writes at RedState, Democrats need new immigration-related grievances to fuel their outrage.

Barack Obama began his community organizing career with a radical immigrants’ group. One of Obama’s first organizing assignments in Chicago was with an Alinkyite group called UNO, the “Mexican-American ACORN.” As Stanley Kurtz has exposed, “Obama personally helped plan” some of the group’s most thuggish activities. He has used this issue his entire career to divide Americans and intimidate political opponents.

Regardless of what passes, Obama will take–and receive–credit. Voters will not remember that Obama blocked immigration reform in the Senate, or that he failed to introduce new legislation in his first term, breaking a solemn campaign promise. They will simply remember that they voted for him in 2012 and he signed immigration reform afterwards. Republicans will continue to average 30% of the Hispanic vote regardless.

Regardless of what passes, Republicans will still be labeled bigots. The president has already attempted to delegitimize opposition to immigration reform as motivated by racism; he will likely do so again. He will do so more often, not less, if Republicans give up their insistence on border security first, because then there will seem to be no other basis for opposition to immigration reform. The media will support him enthusiastically.

Immigration is neither the sole Hispanic issue, nor solely a Hispanic issue. Issues such as education and economic opportunity also top the agenda for Hispanic voters. In addition, as Tony Lee has pointed out, Asian immigrants are the fastest-growing group, even outpacing Hispanics in California. Republicans perform equally poorly among Asian-American voters–not because of immigration but likely because of other issues.

The Obama administration has little interest in law enforcement. Last year, the president used executive action to create a “Dream Act” by fiat, circumventing Congress and creating new incentives for illegal immigration. The administration has also done little over the past four years to patrol the borders beyond perfunctory gestures, and strenuously opposed efforts by the state of Arizona to take matters into its own hands.

Immigration does need to be reformed–for skilled immigrants. The area in which U.S. immigration policy is most lacking concerns skilled immigrants, who are choosing other destinations. The Obama administration has not made it easier for skilled students to stay in the country when finished their degree, nor has it removed the cap on H1-B visas. The Democrats’ primary concern is not the economy, nor justice, but new votes."

For Jimmy Carter, it was when a group of students seized the American Embassy and took more than 60 American diplomats hostage in November 1979. Carter could do nothing right after that. His attempt to rescue the hostages was a pathetic, feeble failure. During the oil crisis Carter went around the White House in a cardigan sweater turning down the thermostat and turning out the lights, while the American people endured gas rationing and long lines at the pumps because some third-rate petro powers decided to punish us.

America was humbled and humiliated, and Jimmy Carter was the poster child.

[pullquote]

Edward Snowden is Obama’s turning point. While Obama was at the Brandenburg Gate delivering a speech to a mere 4,000 Germans, part-time computer programmer Edward Snowden made off with some of the most highly classified US intelligence documents, supposedly because he was disappointed in President Obama.

Snowden then leaked the goods to the Washington Post and Britain’s Guardian newspapers, and began a hide-and-seek game that has taken him to Hong Kong and Russia so far, and perhaps to Cuba and Ecuador next. Even if the information Snowden released is something the American people need to know, the way he did it belies his claim to be a hero. Whistle-blowers and patriots don’t go to these countries, spies and traitors do. And when they go they have to pay the price of admission -- by turning over information that country wants.

After Snowden arrived in Hong Kong, the Chinese government claimed the US was hacking into text messages on Chinese cellphones. That was music to their ears, since the single most contentious issue between the US and China today is cyberhacking. I was in China last month and met with the vice foreign minister. He bristled when I asked him about China’s cyberspying and cybertheft and claimed China was the victim of US cyberattacks. Now he’s got Snowden’s “proof” to back up that claim.

China might have been content to let Snowden stay in Hong Kong, but the minute the US charged him with espionage and asked China to extradite him home, they sent him packing to Moscow. Their excuse? The US didn’t fill out the paperwork request properly.

So, off to Moscow! The Russians claim to have had no advance notice of Mr. Snowden’s arrival, which is hard to believe since Russia imposes a complicated visa process on anyone hoping to visit, even if they only touch down in transit. They’ve also refused Obama’s extradition request, saying it’s none of Moscow’s business. So much for that reset with Russia. So much for President Obama’s goodwill gesture canceling the missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. So much for his offer to cut the US nuclear arsenal unilaterally. Putin is thumbing his nose at us while palming that Super Bowl ring he ‘borrowed’ from the New England Patriots owner.

Two of the world’s most powerful countries have just humiliated the United States of America and our President has offered lame excuses that rank right up there with “the dog ate my homework.” An NSC spokeswoman said the US had registered strong objections to Chinese and Russian authorities. Too bad they don’t care. Even worse, we aren’t likely to do anything about it.

The immediate damage of Snowden’s actions is that he has likely turned over highly classified information to our two greatest competitors. But the long-term damage is incalculable. This may start with the Chinese and Russians thumbing their noses at us, it will soon be the Irans and Venezuelas of the world, and eventually even the Cubas and Ecuadors.

And President Obama is strangely silent, or busy making speeches about climate change.

Some of us have been warning for years that “leading from behind” will have grave consequences. Now we have demonstrable evidence that if you try to lead from behind, eventually the guys up front will stop looking back for instructions."

As recently as 2003, the president of the Greater Fort Bend County Tea Party had a very different title: director of propaganda for the American Fascist Party. James Ives, a prominent Tea Party activist who has hosted statewide rallies and political debates and has been a regular contributor on conservative radio, was the AFP's fourth in command, commenting about the party’s principles on a fascist message board. An image of Ives in what appears to be a black uniform with yellow shoulder patches can be seen in a 2006 promotional video for the party. Ives tells a more nuanced story; the Richmond, Texas, resident says he stumbled across the fascist party — which supports extreme right-wing authoritarian regimes — online in the early 2000s as an “amateur political science student and frustrated novelist” and was merely curious.

Emily Ramshaw at the Texas Tribune writes Just curious. Uh-huh. Thought he would ""blow the lid off of this"" by getting involved, he told the Tribune. He said it was just a ""funny story.""

In the promotional video, which I won't link but can be found at youtube.com/watch?v=9aqXEN5iDpQ, you can see Ives in a black uniform at the 36-second mark. He claims the uniform was Photoshopped on.

The group's founder, Seth Tyrssen, ran for president in 2004 and self-published a book, The New Fascism, in 2009.

Ives admitted to the Tribune that he was, in fact, the group's propaganda director because nobody else volunteered for the post. But he claimed that the fascist group was just ""a chat room with a fancy title."" I also won't link it, but the message board can be found at //groups.yahoo.com/group/americanfascistparty/messages/340. One of Ives's sprinkling of messages there begins:



Gentlemen, first let me say that I am proud to be a member, no, VERY proud to be a member of the American Fascist Party. In the growth of this group over a short time, there can truly be said to be signs of light in the tunnel of recent national history. THE VERY FACT THAT SUCH A GROUP CAN GET TOGETHER AT ALL, AND FLOURISH, SAYS THAT THERE IS STILL LIFE IN THE FURROWS AND HILLS, THE BAYOUS AND GLENS OF OUR AMERICA!

State Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, whose radio station has regularly hosted Ives’ political commentaries in recent years, said that if his past connections to the American Fascist Party were legitimate, the station would no longer put him on air. Patrick said Ives had “never been on our payroll, never been an employee.” He called the promotional video and online postings “very disturbing, no matter how far in the past it is.” [...] Debra Medina, a well-known Tea Party activist who ran against Gov. Rick Perry in the 2010 Republican primary, said she isn’t familiar with Ives and isn’t in a position to judge his dealings with the fascist group. But she said part of the challenge of working with the grassroots is that it’s “so hard to know who you’re working with sometimes.”

While what apparently was a brief connection to a short-lived organization nearly a decade ago might not bother some people, not everyone feels that way:Yep. Hard to avoid rubbing elbows with wackos when you're one yourself"

Alex Johnson', 'Staff Writer']",Public input limited as Texas anti-abortion bill comes back up for debate,"Texas Republicans began trying again Tuesday to pass one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the U.S. as thousands of people jammed the state Capitol in Austin for the first public hearing since a chaotic Democratic filibuster killed the measure two weeks ago.

More than 2,000 people signed up to testify before the House State Affairs Committee on the renewed measure, which is being considered again in Austin because Gov. Rick Perry called a second special legislative session after the bill failed June 25.

But the committee chose a room with only 64 seats for the day of public testimony, which began at 3:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) and was scheduled to end at midnight. The limited space meant few members of the public could attend, and only about 100 would be able to speak, even with the brief time limit of 3 minutes.

Public testimony ended just after midnight, and the committee voted 8-3 to approve the measure, the Texas Tribune reported early Wednesday.

The enormous crowd stayed inside the Capitol despite the selection of the small room, threatening to overwhelm police, before nine other rooms were set up so they could watch the hearing on closed-circuit TV, NBC station KPRC of Houston reported from Austin. One woman fainted amid the crush.

Supporters and opponents alike said they weren't going anywhere.

""My boys are adopted. They could have been aborted,"" Lori Lett of Crosby, northeast of Houston, told KPRC.

""That's why I wanted to come,"" she said.

The Rev. Steve Washburn, pastor of First Baptist Church in Pflugerville, north of Austin, told NBC station KXAN of Austin that he and his supporters were ""here to stay as long as we need to stay in order to have our voices heard.""

""We're fighting for the lives of individuals,"" Washburn said. ""They're tiny, but they're still individuals.""

The full House is expected to take up the bill next week. The Senate has yet to take up the bill, but it's also expected to approve it.

Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat from Houston who opposes the measure, acknowledged that Republicans have the votes to pass it, but he vowed that his side would keep fighting.

""Regardless what happens on this particular bill, I think this discussion, this debate, this exercise is not over,"" Turner said.

It appeared that Republicans, who control both houses of the Legislature, were in position to do that late last month. But Sen. Wendy Davis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, launched an 11-hour filibuster against the bill in a final-day debate that delayed a Senate vote until after the deadline to end the legislative session.

Davis' epic speech was watched live by hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S. on streaming video, turning her into a national figure who's already being touted as a possible future candidate for governor.

In a move that opponents said disregarded the will of the people, Perry, an ardent opponent of abortion, called the Legislature back for another special session this week to try again.

Speaking Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Davis said that ""even if this bill passes, obviously there will be other challenges to it going forward.""

A similar battle could be brewing in North Carolina, where the Senate gave preliminary approval to a measure Tuesday night that would require abortion clinics to meet the same standards as walk-in surgical centers to get licenses.

It's believed that only one clinic in the state meets that requirement, The Charlotte Observer reported.

During a Judiciary Committee meeting Tuesday afternoon, several anti-abortion proposals were attached to a bill that would ban Islamic Sharia law in the state. Suzanne Buckley, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina, accused lawmakers of ""trying to pull a Texas.""

""It seems to me that they're trying to pass under cover of darkness legislation that would not otherwise be passed,"" she said.

The measure must still be approved again by the Senate before it goes to the House.

(CNN) – Longtime Alaska Rep. Don Young, 79, attempted to clarify Thursday his use of the derogatory term ""wetbacks"" to describe immigrant workers in an interview earlier this week.

""I used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California,"" the Republican congressman said in a statement issued to a local television station in Anchorage. ""I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays and I meant no disrespect.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Young, Alaska's sole congressman, originally made the comment during a sit-down interview with Ketchikan Public Radio earlier this week. Talking about how technology is affecting the economy, he referenced an anecdote from his family's farm in California.

""My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,"" Young said. ""It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It's all done by machine.""

The word is widely considered an ethnic slur and generally refers to those from Mexico who come to the United States illegally by crossing the Rio Grande River.

The 21-term congressman later issued the statement, which didn't come as a full apology but sought to explain his reasoning behind using the word. The word was used by the U.S. government in the 1950s for ""Operation Wetback,"" a massive crackdown on illegal immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Young's comments come at a time when the Republican Party is attempting to rebrand itself and expand its outreach to various minority groups, chief among them are Latinos.

Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, blasted Young in a statement, saying migrant workers come to the country for work and opportunities, not to ""hear ethnic slurs and derogatory language from elected officials.""

""The comments used by Rep. Young do nothing to elevate our party, political discourse or the millions who come here looking for economic opportunity,"" he continued.

GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana focused on the impact of damaging comments earlier this year, when he said at the Republican National Committee winter meeting that the GOP has ""to stop being the stupid party"" and should start talking ""like adults.""

""It's no secret we've had a number of Republicans this year damage our brands with bizarre and offensive comments,"" he said. ""I'm here to say we've had enough of that.""

The growth in the so-called entitlement programs, especially for health care, is a main driver behind projections of mounting federal debt as baby boomers age and medical costs rise.

Mr. Obama’s budget was due in February but administration officials said it was delayed by the year-end fiscal negotiations and resulting tax changes. It will arrive on Capitol Hill hours before the president dines on Wednesday evening with a dozen Senate Republicans — his second such parlay in recent weeks.

While the group is likely to also discuss gun-safety and immigration legislation, the timing of Mr. Obama’s budget release is all but certain to make it a prime topic.

Some Senate Republicans have been urging the president to speak out more to Americans about his ideas for reducing the growth of entitlement programs. While the White House posted the offer to Mr. Boehner on its Web site this year, aides previously said that Mr. Obama would not include its provisions in his official budget documents. To do so, some said, would expose him to Democrats’ criticism that he is too quick to compromise and allow Republicans to embrace the proposals for spending cuts, in particular the C.P.I., but ignore those for tax increases.

Neither the president nor senior aides privately hold much hope that Republican leaders — Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader — will compromise. So Mr. Obama’s strategy of reaching out to other Senate Republicans reflects a calculation that enough of them might cut a budget deal with the Democratic Senate majority. If that happens, the reasoning goes, a Senate-passed compromise would put pressure on the House to go along.

According to administration officials, the president’s budget plan would reduce projected annual deficits by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, even with the select spending increases. To offset the initiatives’ cost and avoid adding to deficits, Mr. Obama will propose the tobacco tax increase, a limit of $3 million on how much people can accumulate in tax-preferred savings accounts and repeal of a loophole that allows people to collect both disability and unemployment benefits.

Together with the $2.5 trillion in deficit reductions that Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans have agreed to since 2010, that would bring the total deficit reduction to more than $4.3 trillion over 10 years by the administration’s computations — just over the goal that both parties have set for stabilizing the growth of the national debt."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/21/1195898/-Elizabeth-Warren-Too-Big-to-Fail,2013-03-21 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Elizabeth Warren: Too Big to Fail,"David Bernstein, longtime political reporter for the Boston Phoenix, scored a rare sit down interview with Senator Warren recently. He met with her on the day of her now infamous questioning on the minimum wage during a hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which was notably diaried here (video at the link).

There's been a lot of (imo, trollish) talk in the mainstream media about how Senator Warren should follow the Hillary Clinton path for new Senators -- keep your head down, don't make waves, ingratiate yourself to your colleagues, wait your turn, etc. There's been a lot of coverage -- national press and local press -- implying that Warren has taken this path. But it's a more mixed picture than that, and has been from the beginning. The reporting has seemed very lazy in my view (I know, shocking!!) and frankly like wishful thinking. A few reporters have noticed this and called out the trollish media coverage for what it is -- an attempt to neutralize Warren.

The profile in the Phoenix, in contrast to much of the recent MSM coverage of Warren, gets it just about right, I think, and also provides an interesting window on the balance Warren is attempting to strike as she learns to navigate the parochial terrain of the US Senate. Warren has been very strategic, but she has by no means kept a low profile or failed to speak out loudly and forcefully on her key issues (the plight of the middle and working class, and the criminality of the big banks).

Part of her strategy has been to prioritize local issues and local media; she has gotten near constant (and overall very positive) press in local media throughout Massachusetts over the past few months since being sworn in -- and most of that coverage has been a result of extensive local events and work on local issues (business development and job creation in regions throughout the state, the fisheries crisis in Massachusetts, how the sequester will adversely hit Massachusetts, etc.).

But the other part of her strategy, which Bernstein notes at length, is the polar opposite of the Hillary Clinton strategy. Warren has made waves -- deliberately. She has been outspoken. She has been warm and polite and solicitous of her colleagues (the piece is full of glowing reviews from her colleagues), but not at the expense of staying quiet. And she has not shied away from criticizing the Obama Administration, a move that a freshman Senator would normally avoid at all costs, ""the kind of behavior that would get a lot of new lawmakers smacked down hard, or marginalized into ineffectiveness.""

But, as Bernstein notes:



""Warren has an independence and authority that frees her to be outspoken without getting alienated.""

She is, in her own way, too big to fail. (...) And that might be what scares her Wall Street enemies the most. There is no amount of money, or scurrilous attacks, likely to cause her downfall at the polls. That will only make them more eager to find other ways to halt her efforts. They will counter-attack at every opportunity — as with the current attempt to derail Cordray's re-nomination — and undoubtedly plan longer-term strategies to limit her sway.

She can also react with righteous outrage when I asked about Obama's recent support of ""chained Consumer Price Index (CPI),"" which liberals view as a cut to Social Security benefits. When I suggest that most brand-new senators would not undercut their own party's president that way, she responds: ""Better I should say this now, than wait to have anybody surprised about it later on.""

""I don't want to wake up in six years and say: 'I scattered my fire across a wide range and changed nothing.' No. For me, that's a nightmare. It's something I've thought about every single day.""

I've excerpted a few of my favorite bits from the Phoenix article below but you really should just go read the whole thing Finally, so that this diary has a real driving purpose, please join me in signing up to donate or volunteer to elect Ed Markey to the US Senate so Elizabeth Warren has a strong partner going forward!"

The first was his handshake with Cuban leader Raul Castro; the second was the “selfie” he posed for with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and British Prime Minister David Cameron.

Taking the second one first, critics said it was disrespectful for the president to be clowning around with the two PMs in the middle of a funeral. Well, it wasn’t a funeral; it was a memorial service that, for much of its long duration, was filled with laughter and crowds of dancing South Africans celebrating the life of their departed leader. Agence France-Presse photographer Roberto Schmidt, who took the photo of the three leaders snapping an iPhone picture of themselves, was appalled at the reaction to his image.

Schmidt said: “The world leaders were simply acting like human beings, like me and you. I doubt anyone could have remained totally stony faced for the duration of the ceremony, while tens of thousands of people were celebrating in the stadium.... I see nothing to complain about, and probably would have done the same in their place.”

The handshake with Castro was even less remarkable. If one watches the video of the moment, it can be seen that Obama is making his way to his seat past a line of already-seated dignitaries. Castro just happened to be first in the row. It would have been exceedingly awkward and truly significant if Obama had refused to shake the man’s hand.

Nevertheless, the usual cranks on the right were appalled.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) even made the wildly off-base, but predictable, comparison to pre-World War II British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain shaking hands with Adolf Hitler. This is the same McCain who gave a handshake and a slight bow to Libya’s now-deposed and deceased crackpot dictator Moammar Kadafi a few years ago.

Raul Castro is an old man running a fading regime. He’s not even the Castro anybody cares about - Fidel. More than half a century of boycotting Cuba has not brought the communist government down or freed many political prisoners. In the meantime, presidents have been shaking plenty of dictatorial hands with blood on them - most notably a long line of Chinese leaders.

Maintaining a belligerent stance against Cuban commies is no longer an issue with staying power for conservatives. Even in Florida’s Cuban community, the young people do not care anymore. They would prefer more handshakes and a plan for Cuba’s future.

Actually, the most remarkable thing about the handshake was the lack of reaction. Most Americans were not disturbed. Most are ready for the kind of reconciliation Mandela preached. It’s another indication that militant conservatives are lagging way behind in understanding that the times they are a-changin’."

“They are cheap. They don’t want to pay taxes because they have already raped this country and gotten everything out of it they possibly could,” Penn continued. “They don’t want to pay for your tuition because who are you? Well to me, you are somebody.”

Penn, who has won a distinguished faculty award, added, “I’m a college professor. If I find out you’re a closet racist, I’m coming after you. OK. This country still is full of closet racists.”

In the video, uploaded by a conservative collegiate news outlet called Campus Reform, Penn then describes Republicans as “dead white people, or dying white people,” and then disparages former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann.

“I absolutely don’t mean to offend you,” Penn said. “Even if you are a Republican, I don’t mean to offend you in this class.”

On Thursday -- two days after the video’s publication and a review by the campus provost -- Michigan State University officials announced that Penn’s “teaching duties have been reassigned to others.”

“Michigan State University is committed to creating a learning environment that is characterized by mutual respect and civility where diverse ideas can be explored,” university spokesman Kent Cassella said in a statement.

Cassella added that, in a meeting with university officials, Penn “acknowledged that some of his comments were inappropriate, disrespectful and offensive and may have negatively affected the learning environment.”

Penn didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman told the Los Angeles Times that he had not been otherwise suspended or fired.

According to his academic bio, Penn writes under the name “W.S. Penn” and has published seven books of fiction and essays.

http://news.yahoo.com/compromise-among-senators-eyed-border-security-225125834.html,,[],Compromise among senators eyed on border security,"WASHINGTON (AP) — After secretive talks, key senators expressed optimism Wednesday night that they were closing in on a bipartisan agreement to dramatically toughen the border security requirements in immigration legislation that also offers a path to citizenship to millions living in the country illegally.

Lawmakers and aides alike said the goal was to assure passage of the sweeping legislation by a large bipartisan vote within a matter of days.

Under the emerging compromise, the government would grant legal status to immigrants living in the United States unlawfully at the same time the additional security was being put into place at a cost of tens of billions of dollars. Green cards, which signify permanent residency status, would be withheld until the security steps were complete.

Several officials said late Wednesday the Border Patrol would roughly double in size with the addition of 20,000 agents over a decade as part of a so-called border surge. The government also would complete hundreds of miles of new fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border and purchase new surveillance drones to help apprehend would-be illegal border crossers. The cost of the additional agents alone totals $30 billion over a decade.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.

If agreed to, the change has the potential to give a powerful boost to the immigration bill that is at the top of President Barack Obama's second-term domestic agenda.

The developments came as Democrats who met with House Speaker John Boehner during the day quoted him as saying he expects the House to pass its own version of an immigration bill this summer and for Congress to have a final compromise by year's end. Boehner, R-Ohio, has already said the legislation that goes to the House in the next month or two will not include a pathway to citizenship for those in the United States illegally.

Precise details of the pending agreement in the Senate were unavailable, but Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said it involved a major increase of resources to the border, including more manpower, fencing and technology. The underlying legislation already envisions more border agents; additional fencing along the U.S-Mexico border; surveillance drones; a requirement for employers to verify the legal status of potential workers; as well as a biometric system to track foreigners who enter and leave the United States at air and seaports and by land.

Story continues

""Our whole effort has been to build a bipartisan group that will support the bill,"" said Hoeven, who has not yet stated a position on the legislation. ""That's what this is all about, and it's focused on border security.""

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the bill's most prominent supporters, said discussions with Republicans ""have been really productive. We've made a lot of progress in the last 24 hours. Now we have some vetting to do with our respective allies.""

The potential compromise came into focus one day after the Congressional Budget Office jolted lawmakers with an estimate saying that as drafted, the legislation would fail to prevent a steady increase in the future in the number of residents living in the United States illegally.

The estimate appeared to give added credibility to Republicans who have been pressing Democrats to toughen the border security provisions already written into the bill. Schumer and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., met at midday with Hoeven, and Republican Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The Democrats, McCain and Graham are part of the so-called bipartisan Gang of Eight that drafted the bill.

If ratified, the compromise would mark concessions on both sides.

Some Republicans have been unwilling to support a bill that grants legal status to immigrants in the country illegally until the government certifies that the border security steps have achieved 90 percent effectiveness in stopping would-be border crossers.

On the other hand, Democrats have opposed Republican proposals to make legalization contingent on success in closing the border to illegal crossings. Under the legislation as drafted, legalization could begin as soon as a security plan was drafted, but a 10-year wait is required for a green card.

One plan to change that was sidetracked during the day on a vote of 61-37.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said his proposal would require Congress to vote annually for five years on whether the border is secure. If lawmakers decide it is not, ""then the processing of undocumented workers stops until"" it is, he said. The decision would be made based on numerous factors, including progress toward completion of a double-layered fence along the U.S.-Mexico border and toward a goal of 95 percent capture of illegal entrants. A system to track the border comings and goings of foreigners is also required.

Only a day earlier, the CBO had cheered supporters of the bill with an estimate that it would help the economy and reduce deficits in each of the next two decades.

Now it was the skeptics' turn to crow.

""Illegality will not be stopped, but it will only be reduced by 25 percent,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., referring to the prediction by the non-partisan CBO.

While the public debate was taking place, lawmakers involved in the private talks expressed optimism.

""We're on the verge of doing something dramatic on the border,"" Graham told reporters. ""What we're trying to do is put in place measures that to any reasonable person would be an overwhelming effort to secure our border. This is a key moment in the effort to pass the bill.""

Across the Capitol, House Republican leaders sought to present a friendlier face to Hispanics — a group that gave Obama more than 70 percent support in last year's presidential election.

Boehner met with the Democratic-dominated Congressional Hispanic Caucus, while rank and file members of his party reviewed areas of agreement with faith-based Latino leaders.

""It's a conversation Republicans want to have,"" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said later at a news conference outside the Capitol.

At the same time, though, anti-immigration protesters moved across the Capitol plaza into range of television cameras, raising signs that said, ""Do Not Reward Criminals"" and ""No Amnesty for Illegal Aliens.""

Separately, the House Judiciary Committee worked on legislation creating a program allowing farm workers to come to the United States to take temporary jobs in the United States.

The measure is one of several that the panel is considering in the final weeks of June as part of a piece-by-piece approach to immigration rather than the all-in-one bill that Senate is considering.

In addition to border security measures and a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally, the Senate bill provides more visas for highly-skilled workers prized by the technology industry, a guest worker farm program and a new program for lower-skilled workers to come to the United States.

The former first daughter clearly has increased her public profile since that race. She has quit full-time, private-sector work and assumed more responsibilities in the family’s foundation -- a staging ground for a likely 2016 Clinton presidential campaign.

Yet the larger, emerging questions are whether the 33-year-old Clinton is ready for a bigger campaign role or a campaign of her own someday.

Clinton is indeed better prepared this time, having one presidential race, Wall Street experience and a side-gig as an NBC-TV special correspondent under her belt. However, Clinton’s ability to move among those worlds has also raised questions about her professional commitment and whether her last name carries more clout than her qualifications.

“She doesn’t have the charisma,” Tim Graham, a director at the conservative-lean Media Research Center, told FoxNews.com. “That doesn’t means she’s not smart. She just doesn’t have that soaring, transcendent oratory.”

The younger Clinton struggled at times as a family surrogate during the 2008 race. Though she was a grown woman, seasoned reporters were denied access to her. She once even told a child reporter: “I’m sorry, I don’t talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately, even though I think you’re cute.”

Though dispatched to college campuses, the effort had limited impact, as the youth vote helped catapult Barack Obama to victory. Though Obama won nearly 70 percent of that vote, Clinton supporters argue Chelsea helped cut into Obama’s percentages and that Hillary improved among younger votes as the campaign progresses, essentially matching Obama in California and Massachusetts.

The younger Clinton estimates making roughly 400 campaign stops, include at least 100 college-campus visits over five months, after being on the sidelines for essentially the first year of the campaign.

However, that role this time could be even more challenging, in part, with Hillary Clinton turning 66 in October.

And Chelsea might not get a pass from the press. Graham said Chelsea Clinton became fair game for reporters the day she took the NBC job and that she has always been used to soften her parents’ sharper edges -- despite their attempts to appear to do otherwise.

With an increased role would almost certainly come the responsibility of taking questions from reporters and otherwise moving even further beyond her fiercely protected earlier life, which included Secret Service agents in her Stanford University dormitory and a 1993 New York Times letter to the editor from Margaret Truman telling the press that too much Chelsea coverage could be damaging.

Whether she stumps for her mother or pursues some higher calling, Chelsea inevitably faces a thorny mess of previously off-limit questions that could range from the infamous Monica sex scandal to her ambitions to continue the Clinton political dynasty to an uneven professional resume that bounces between Wall Street, academia, journalism and philanthropy.

“You at least have to admire her resilience and desire to remain in the political process,” a Democratic strategist told FoxNews.com. “She has lived through the worst of politics and clearly evolved. The bigger question might be whether Hillary Clinton has learned from her mistakes in 2008.”

Chelsea has recently suggested she is keeping her options open about running for elected office.

""Not now,"" she told CNN this month. ""I'm ... grateful to live in a city and state and a country where I really believe in my elected officials, and their ethos and their competencies. Someday, if either of those weren't true and I thought I could make more of a difference in the public sector ... I'd have to ask and answer that question.""

The Clinton Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.

Chelsea’s first job after graduate school at University College, Oxford, was in 2003 at the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. in New York City.

“Partly, I had no idea what I wanted to do at that time,” she said last year, according to an interview taped by Bloomberg News. “I felt there were people there I could learn a lot from.”

Three years later, she joined the Wall Street firm Avenue Capital Group, a hedge fund cofounded by Marc Lasry, who has given more than $600,000 to mostly Democratic candidates since 1995, including $11,500 to Hillary Clinton’s successful 2000 bid to win a New York Senate seat, according to the website InfluenceExplorer.com.

The firm declined to reveal Chelsea’s job, citing company policy. But last year, she said she joined Avenue Capital to learn about the business of making money and identified her boss as Matthew Kimble, listed on the company website as a portfolio manager.

“I didn’t want to grow up to be my boss,” Clinton said. “After a few years, I just thought I had to go figure out what I do want to do.”

She also revealed in a 2011 interview with Time Magazine that she left Advance Capital without advance notice after her mother won the 2008 New Hampshire primary.

“I called my boss and I was like, ‘I’m really sorry. I think I need to quit my job because I don’t know how long I’m going to be gone,” Clinton recalled saying.

Yet her job at NBC has drawn the most criticism, largely because she had no real journalism experience and turned in some less-than-spectacular performances.

“This one-dimensional, under-reported, naive celebration of a charter school in Rhode Island was just as much of an empty-headed puff job as Clinton's first report on an after-school program in Little Rock,” David Zurawik, a media critic for the liberal-leaning Baltimore Sun, wrote last year, after Clinton’s second on-air report.

Still, NBC renewed Clinton’s contract this year, as she begins to “play a significant role in shaping the foundation’s future,” according to a New York Times story this month about the financial challenges facing the newly renamed Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

Clinton also has begun to “assert herself as a force” within the organization, according to The Times story, which suggested her motivation has in part been to save the foundation she stands to inherit.

Meanwhile, Clinton will keep her board positions at the Clinton Health Access Initiative, the School of American Ballet, Common Sense Media, and the Weill Cornell Medical College and remains active in Of Many Institute at NYU, according to the foundation.

She also continues to work on her doctoral thesis at Oxford and teach part-time at Columbia University from which she received a master’s in public health in 2010.

If Clinton has found her mark, it appears to be at the foundation and its related works.

During a recent trip to Nigeria, she spoke passionately about her effort to curb the preventable deaths of 1 million women and children annually in that country.

""I couldn't imagine not doing work like this,"" she told Reuters. “I define success in my life by how much of a difference have I made in a given day, whether that is being a good wife to my husband, a good daughter to my parents, a good friend to my friends, or helping push forward our work at CHAI or the Alliance for a Healthier Generation or any other facet of the foundation."""

Marco Rubio and Dianne Feinstein among key senators

Ex-candidate Paul Ryan carries weight on budget issues

Justice Anthony Kennedy could be pivotal on gay marriage

WASHINGTON — When he delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Obama not only will be speaking to the 40 million or so TV viewers across the country. His words also will be aimed at a few people sitting right in front of him.

A junior Republican who is key to an immigration deal. A senior Democrat who may need coaxing to compromise on gun control. A member of the GOP ticket Obama vanquished in November. And a Supreme Court justice likely to be the swing vote on same-sex marriage.

What the president says and how he says it can set the stage for cooperation or confrontation on an issue. He can boost an ally or lay down a marker. Though his inaugural address last month was soaring and thematic, the specificity of a State of the Union means it can be a sort of political dog whistle, with messages only some in the audience will be able to discern.

""Every word in a State of the Union address has multiple audiences,"" says Michael Waldman, who as chief White House speechwriter for President Bill Clinton worked on several of them. ""You care about what the sponsor of the bill hears. You care about what the rank-and-file of the Democrats or the Republicans hear. You care about what the country hears. And the notes may ring differently to different people.""

On big issues, will Obama laud the provisions that unite Republicans and Democrats or spotlight the ones that divide them? Will he mention by name his top allies and the important figures on the other side? If he does, will that make it easier or harder for them to deliver?

The annual speech to a joint session of Congress is a ""giant Wurlitzer organ for presidents,"" Waldman says, capable of playing many tunes. Here's a rundown on the key players Obama hopes will be listening to the music.

Immigration: The junior Republican

After two years in the Senate (and at age 41 a generation younger than most of his colleagues), Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has emerged as the single most crucial ally for Obama's hopes of signing a comprehensive immigration bill this year.

Rubio, who will give the Republican response to Obama's speech Tuesday, is a member of a group of four Republican and four Democratic senators that outlined the framework for a bill that would manage the flow of legal immigrants and provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants now in the USA. The group includes other important figures, among them Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and John McCain, R-Ariz. A bipartisan group of House members is also at work.

It was Rubio, the son of Cuban emigres, who launched into fluent Spanish at a news conference announcing the group's broad principles — underscoring the imperative many Republicans feel to reach out to Latino voters, who overwhelmingly backed Obama in November.

And it was Rubio, a favorite of the Tea Party movement, who is doing much of the selling job to conservative critics. Radio host Rush Limbaugh, who had bashed the bipartisan framework, had only praise for Rubio after he appeared on his show, calling his efforts ""admirable and noteworthy."" Rubio is a crucial emissary to House Republicans, many of them from solidly GOP districts where most voters oppose providing a path to legal status for illegal immigrants.

Winning passage in the House almost certainly will be more difficult than the Senate.

""Rubio is viewed by some Republicans as doing on the Republican side what Obama did on the Democratic side: Get into office for a nanosecond and start to run for president,"" says Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. ""At the same time, he's absolutely essential to the problem they have with Latinos. He clearly has the Tea Party credibility, and he's the younger generation.""

That makes him a valuable commodity for the GOP — and, potentially, for Obama. Meissner says she'll be listening for the president's approach in his speech. ""Does he frame this in a way that signals he and the Democrats will do this in a way that it is a win-win for Republicans also, and not an 'I-win-you-lose?'""

Guns: The senior Democrat

The repercussions of gun violence propelled Dianne Feinstein's career. She was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1978 when Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated in City Hall by a gunman. She discovered Milk's body that day. She succeeded Moscone as mayor.

Two years after she was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992, Feinstein was the author of an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. After last year's shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., killed 20 children and six educators, she filed a bill that would impose a stricter version of the ban.

Some key fellow Democrats haven't rallied behind her, at least not yet. Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., hasn't endorsed the proposal, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., warns that it would be hard to get it through the Senate, much less the House. Feinstein bristled at the list of witnesses at the first Senate hearing on gun legislation as tilted against the ban and says she will call her own hearing.

At 79, Feinstein is in her fifth Senate term. When it comes to guns, the issue for Obama is not her support but her willingness to compromise. Will she help push a bill if the assault weapons ban isn't part of it?

Negotiations with some senators, including Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have focused on expanding background checks for gun buyers and other less divisive issues.

""It's a very difficult rhetorical challenge,"" says Matt Bennett, formerly of Americans for Gun Safety but now at the centrist think-tank Third Way. ""He doesn't want to say, 'We may not get the assault weapons ban done.' But he can put a lot of emphasis on universal background checks, on a firearms trafficking statute, on the kind of things Manchin and Coburn are ready to make deals on.""

In the State of the Union, the president not only can draw a line in the sand for his opponents on what must be done but also send a message to his allies on the limits of what can be done. Bennett asks, ""Is he going to be telling Democrats on guns, immigration and on fiscal issues, 'You have got to be willing to make some concessions?'""

Budget: The wannabe veep

Obama tried to reach a ""grand bargain"" with House Speaker John Boehner last year that would raise tax revenue and cut spending, including changes to Medicare and Social Security.

The talks failed and soured relations between the two. The issues haven't gone away, gaining urgency as automatic spending cuts are poised to take effect March 1, and the resolution that funds government operations expires March 27.

Out front for the GOP on these issues is House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who was Mitt Romney's 2012 running mate.

Ryan didn't make it to the vice presidency, but since the election, he helped pass a compromise plan on taxes and devise the party's strategy to delay dealing with the debt ceiling until spring.

He is drawing up a budget plan he says will balance the books in 10 years. He'll be at the center of the looming fiscal negotiations.

He was critical and deficit hawks were disappointed when Obama mentioned only in passing the need for hard choices to address the federal deficit and the national debt in his inaugural address. They expect to hear more in this address.

""I don't think that, given the fiscal picture of the country, he can possibly talk about the state of the union without addressing it,"" says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""The parts that have been done are the easy parts and not the parts that are really going to fix the budget. The hard parts are still sitting there.""

They would include dealing with the exploding costs of Social Security and Medicare. ""Now the rubber is hitting the road,"" Ryan told reporters at a breakfast hosted by The Wall Street Journal. ""Our strategy is to engage the Democrats on issues where we think we can improve policy, to oppose them where we don't.""

Same-sex marriage: The swing justice

The most dramatic words in Obama's inaugural address last month may have been those embracing same-sex marriage, likening the struggle for equal rights by gay men and lesbians with those once waged by African Americans and women. At the moment, though, the battle over same-sex unions is being fought not with federal legislation but in the courts.

In two cases being argued before the Supreme Court next month, Justice Anthony Kennedy is likely to be the swing vote, as he has been on nearly all the important issues that have come before this court.

In Hollingsworth v. Perry, justices will debate the constitutionality and other issues surrounding California's Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. In U.S. v. Windsor, they will consider challenges to a 1996 federal law that denies Social Security survivor payments and other benefits to same-sex partners who were married in states that permit gay unions.

Kennedy, 76, is a Catholic appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan. Sometimes he sides with the court's consistent conservatives (Samuel Alito, John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas) and sometimes with its consistent liberals (Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor).

Supreme Court justices are invited to the State of the Union, though some choose not to attend. Kennedy was in the chamber last year.

He would hardly take instructions from Obama on this issue — he voted against the administration's position on the health care law and on campaign finance, to name two high-profile cases — but the president's rhetoric, and the societal changes it represents, could have an impact.

The administration is weighing whether to file a ""friend of the court"" brief backing the challengers in a pair of gay rights cases that will be argued before the Supreme Court in March. The Justice Department's brief would be due this month.

On previous cases involving the death penalty for juveniles and other issues, Kennedy's opinions suggest he is conscious of being on the right side of history, says Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law School professor. And there's this: Kennedy wrote the court's only two decisions supporting gay rights, in 1996 and 2003.

""The fact that the president is calling attention to same-sex marriage is a powerful iteration that society is changing and it's changing quickly,"" says Klarman, author of From the Closet to the Altar: Courts, Backlash, and the Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage, published last year. ""The president wouldn't have done it two years ago. He wouldn't have done it one year ago. The fact that the president is now making it very prominent illustrates how much society's views have changed, and that is relevant to Justice Kennedy."""

That estimate incorrectly assumed that all 300 interns work 52 weeks per year.

The White House may not be able to afford to pay its interns.

While pressure has been mounting for President Obama to pay his interns, there could be a reason why the White House hasn't ponied up: It would cost more than $2.5 million a year.

That's about what the White House paid to give tours of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., which were infamously halted in March due to forced spending cuts.

Related: White House urged to pay interns

The figure assumes Obama would pay his interns $9 an hour, the number he suggested the minimum wage should be raised to during his State of the Union address in January.

The White House has said it employs more than 300 interns each year, with 150 this summer alone, and ""more than 100"" in the fall and spring semesters. Each intern is expected to work 45 hours per week.

We assumed the White House would be paying 125 interns at $9 per hour for 50 weeks per year.

The figure can be taken two ways. On the one hand, it means the White House is getting $2.5 million of free work each year. On the other, it is a relatively large amount of money to shell out at a time when the White House is being forced to cut back on many expenses.

Related: Spending cuts likely deeper in 2014

That may give pause to the interns who are calling on Obama to set an example by paying them.

The Fair Pay Campaign, a grassroots lobby set to launch around Labor Day, has said that not paying interns creates a situation where only a privileged few can afford to work there -- it can cost several thousands of dollars to cover rent and other living expenses while not getting paid.

""If you want to break into these industries, you have to work for free,"" said Mikey Franklin, the leader of Fair Pay's charge. ""That's not a reality for a lot of people who aren't upper middle class.""

Gen. Kamala Harris as “by far the best-looking attorney general in the country” at a public appearance has divided even some of his strongest supporters.

Some found the comment sexist, others harmless.

On Friday, the president apologized for the remark. “He called her to apologize for the distraction created by his comments,” spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.

The president “did not want in any way to diminish the attorney general’s professional accomplishments and her capabilities. He fully recognizes the challenges women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance,” Carney added.

Harris has not commented. But, according to the Times’ PolitiCal blog, her communications director, Gil Duran, issued a statement saying “the attorney general and the president have been friends for many years. They had a great conversation yesterday and she strongly supports him.”

Willie Brown, the former head of the California Assembly, said critics are wrongly jumping on the comment.

“They can’t criticize him for budget, they can’t criticize him for taxes on the rich, they can’t criticize him for medical care, they got to say something,” he told CBS News.

Liberal columnist Joan Walsh said her “stomach turned” when she heard the remark.

“I doubt Obama knew any of the lurid history of Harris’s opponents smear attempts,” she wrote. “I assume he thought he was just paying someone he admires a compliment. But most women in public life have a complex relationship with their appearance, whether they’re as attractive as Harris or not.”

The Times’ Robin Abcarian weighed in on the controversy Thursday, saying: “Does merely stating the obvious make the president sexist? More wolfish than sexist, I’d say. And this may be a little problem he needs to work on .... Obama got into some hot water a while back when he addressed a reporter as ‘sweetie.’ That was obnoxious, and demeaning, and Obama rightfully apologized. In 2008, he told Hillary Clinton she was ‘likable enough’ during one of the primary debates, which turned off God knows how many women, who heard the smug judgment of an arrogant upstart.’ ”

The controversy began Thursday when Obama was at a California fundraiser. Here are the remarks:

“You have to be careful to, first of all, say she is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you’d want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake.

“She also happens to be by far the best-looking attorney general in the country -- Kamala Harris is here. [Applause.] It’s true. Come on. [Laughter] And she is a great friend and has just been a great supporter for many, many years.”

He fulminates about people who are allegedly ""unwilling to work"" sucking off the government teat with impunity. This is a patently dishonest representation of the SNAP program. Most people who receive food stamps cannot be dismissed as losers who are ""unwilling to work."" Nearly half (47%) of all food stamp recipients are children. Another 8% are 60 years of age or older. The ""working poor"" - people who live in a household with income from work - represent another 41%. Between children, the elderly, the working poor, and people who want a job but cannot find one - someone should tell Fincher that there are still more than 3 unemployed job seekers for every 1 opening - that leaves very few people who can be accurately described as being ""unwilling"" to work. It's also worth noting that the average monthly SNAP benefit is a whopping $287. It takes a deeply disturbed person to crusade against providing this class of people with food to eat, when the economy is this battered, and when the broad economic benefits of the program have been so well established (at least in the reality-based community).





Now, this would not normally be worthy of mention. Hardly a day goes by without some Republican sadist expressing fury that poor people have it so good. Devising new ways to make the peasants suffer is what makes Republicans wake up in the morning. What's fascinating about this particular case, though, is Fincher's background.





millions - The reason this is even more egregious than the usual Republican class warfare is that Fincher himself is a poster boy for government dependency. It's not just that he's benefited here and there from some government help. That sort of low-level hypocrisy is almost to be expected from these types. But Fincher has received $3.2 million as of June 2010 - in federal crop subsidies. The people who refer to themselves as Tea Partiers threatened to derail his candidacy over this, but then they realized that they have no principles, and supported him anyway. He's now a member of the ""Tea Party Caucus,"" which, amazingly, is something that actually exists. Fincher's brother and father also snatched another $6.7 million in subsidies as Stephen geared up to run for Congress on a platform of eliminating ""wasteful government spending."" The ""wasteful spending"" that he had in mind, of course, was that which serves policy aims with which he disagrees, such as keeping poor people alive.





House Republicans are on a mission to slash the SNAP program by $20 billion over the next decade. A Senate committee, just last week, voted to cut it by ""only"" $4 billion. If some sort of vicious ""compromise"" is reached between the sociopaths in the House who are demanding human sacrifice on a massive scale, and the ""moderates"" in the Senate who are only comfortable with letting some people starve, it will not be pretty. This is not hyperbole, either. SNAP really does keep poor people, including millions of children, from going hungry, and it's under attack from ultra-right-wing ideologues. This program deserves the support and activism of progressives as much as any government program in existence."

Obama poked fun at himself as well as some of his political adversaries during the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner attended by politicians, members of the media and Hollywood celebrities.

Entering to the rap track ""All I Do Is Win"" by DJ Khaled, Obama joked about how re-election would allow him to unleash a radical agenda. But then he showed a picture of himself golfing on a mock magazine cover of ""Senior Leisure.""

""I'm not the strapping young Muslim Socialist that I used to be,"" the president remarked, and then recounted his recent 2-for-22 basketball shooting performance at the White House Easter Egg hunt.

But Obama's most dramatic shift for the next four years appeared to be aesthetic. He presented a montage of shots featuring him with bangs similar to those sometimes sported by his wife.

More On This...

""So we borrowed one of Michelle's tricks,"" Obama said. ""I thought this looked pretty good, but no bounce.""

Obama closed by noting the nation's recent tragedies in Massachusetts and Texas, praising Americans of all stripes from first responders to local journalists for serving the public good.

Saturday night's banquet not far from the White House attracted the usual assortment of stars from Hollywood and beyond. Actors Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Claire Danes, who play government characters on series, were among the attendees, as was Korean entertainer Psy. Several Cabinet members, governors and members of Congress were present.

And despite coming at a somber time, nearly two weeks after the deadly Boston Marathon bombing and 10 days after a devastating fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, the president and political allies and rivals alike took the opportunity to enjoy some humor. Late-night talk-show host Conan O'Brien headlined the event.

Some of Obama's jokes came at his Republican rivals' expense. He asked that the GOP's minority outreach begin with him as a ""trial run"" and said he'd take his recent charm offensive with Republicans on the road, including events with conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Michele Bachmann.

""In fact, I'm taking my charm offensive on the road -- a Texas barbeque with Ted Cruz, a Kentucky bluegrass concert with Rand Paul, and a book-burning with Michele Bachmann,"" Obama joked.

Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson would have had better success getting Obama out of office if he simply offered the president $100 million to drop out of last year's race, Obama quipped.

And on the 2016 election, the president noted in self-referential irony that potential Republican candidate Sen. Marco Rubio wasn't qualified because he hasn't even served a full term in the Senate. Obama served less than four years of his six-year Senate term before he was elected president in 2008.

""I mean, the guy has not even finished a single term in the Senate and he thinks he's ready to be President,"" Obama joked.

The gala also was an opportunity for six journalists, including Associated Press White House Correspondent Julie Pace, to be honored for their coverage of the presidency and national issues.

The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza won the Aldo Beckman Award, which recognizes excellence in the coverage of the presidency.

Pace won the Merriman Smith Award for a print journalist for coverage on deadline.

ABC's Terry Moran was the winner of the broadcast Merriman Smith Award for deadline reporting.

Reporters Jim Morris, Chris Hamby and Ronnie Greene of the Center for Public Integrity won the Edgar A. Poe Award for coverage of issues of national significance."

According to aides familiar with the closed-door negotiations, the bill would require illegal immigrants to register with Homeland Security Department authorities, file federal income taxes for their time in America and pay a still-to-be-determined fine. They also must have a clean law enforcement record.

Once granted probationary legal status, immigrants would be allowed to work but would be barred from receiving federal public benefits, including food stamps, family cash assistance, Medicaid and unemployment insurance.

RELATED: Is the border secure?

The group’s current draft is largely in line with President Obama’s call to set a pathway to earned citizenship as part of a broader immigration reform package, as well as with recent efforts by prominent Republican lawmakers to resolve an issue that hurt GOP candidates in November’s election.

Though the draft is a long way from becoming law, immigration advocates expressed guarded optimism about a possible breakthrough.

“Nine months ago, people would have thought you were nuts to say that four Republicans and four Democrats were working on a way to legalize 11 million people,” said Angela Kelley, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a think tank with close ties to the White House. “It’s a Rubik’s Cube, but more sides are matching in color than ever before. That’s significant.”

Still undecided is how long illegal immigrants would need to wait before they could apply for permanent resident status and eventually become citizens. The delay for a green card probably would be 10 years or longer, the aides said.

Also unresolved are such politically charged topics as how many visas to issue to high-tech specialists and other guest workers; how to keep track of when visitors leave the country; and how to pay for more Border Patrol officers, fencing and other security measures in an era of shrinking budgets, the aides said.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

The eight senators met Tuesday and Wednesday, alternating between a private office in the Russell Senate Office Building and a marble-floored ceremonial room off the Senate chamber.

The group had hoped to deliver a completed bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration before the Senate leaves for Easter recess on March 22. But aides said remaining issues required more technical advice and cost estimates that could delay delivery until early April.

The group includes Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona. The Democrats are Sens. Charles E. Schumer of New York, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado.

The draft bill will be several hundred pages long when finished. For now, the unfinished pieces are peppered throughout the draft.

“We’re working through them. I’m not sure we’ll get them all done,” McCain said in an interview. “Some of these issues are very controversial.”

Business groups and Silicon Valley companies have pushed for more H1B visas for software engineers and other high-skilled employees, for example, while labor unions have warned that too many immigrants would undercut qualified Americans seeking high-tech jobs in a weak economy.

Advertisement

Unless the group designs a visa program that ensures a robust labor force, Rubio told reporters, “What you’re going to have is people coming into the country illegally or overstaying visas.”

Immigration overhaul bills floated in 2006 and 2007 were sunk by disagreements between labor and business leaders over how many workers to allow into the country. Some senators are skeptical that the current group can find a solution.

“The country can absorb only so much low-skilled labor without significantly impacting the prospects of working Americans to get jobs and get higher pay,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a member of the judiciary panel who has been critical of previous efforts to expand the visa program.

In an effort to resolve the issue, negotiators from the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have worked with Senate staffers to set a formula so the number of visas for both high-tech and low-skilled workers can fluctuate. They have agreed that the tally would move up or down based on job demand, unemployment rates and other data.

Advertisement

“We’re really trying to fill in the details,” said Ana Avendano, an AFL-CIO negotiator.

The two sides have agreed that a work visa need not be tied to a specific employer and that foreign workers would be allowed to change jobs. Unions want assurances that foreign workers have the same rights as Americans to report mistreatment to the Labor Department and to sue employers for unpaid wages.

Unlike in the past, both business and organized labor want an immigration bill to pass, said Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million workers.

“No one wants to be responsible for deep-sixing the effort,” Medina said.

Advertisement

Negotiators also have hit a roadblock on whether the government should keep track of who is leaving the country and how to do so.

Under current law, U.S. immigration authorities do not keep a record when tourists and other foreign visitors leave the country. So the government doesn’t know whether they have overstayed their visas, as thousands do each year.

Advertisement

The Senate group has tentatively agreed to create a system to check visas against an immigration database at international airports and seaports but have not determined whether it is feasible at much busier border crossings. The task is potentially huge: U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada are the most highly trafficked in the world, with 250 million crossings each year.

Some lawmakers warn that checking visas as people leave the country would be expensive to implement, further clog busy border crossings and slow crucial commerce.

Advertisement

Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute at New York University School of Law, said the real legislative battle over immigration would come after the bill was made public.

“We haven’t even begun to see the opposition to the bill,” Chishti said. “Because there isn’t meat on the bone.”

HOUSE CLERK: Further consideration of H.R. 761....

Now this week, we crowned a new Miss America, a Nina Davuluri, who happens to be the first of Indian descent, and the Twittersphere exploded with so much racist hatred, you'd have thought that President Obama just made a reasonable remark. (audience laughter)

I mean, listen to some of this nonsense.



JAKE AMICK: How the fuck does a foreigner win miss America? She is a Arab! #idiots

Congratulations Al-Qaeda. Our Miss America is one of you.

AUDREY GRAHAM: Miss America is a terrorist. Whatever. It's fine.

Of course, you can understand why these people are so upset. Miss America, after all, is a very powerful position — she signs all of our laws and treaties. That's why the crown should only go to a white girl from Texas with big horse teeth.

But Nina Davuluri just won a beauty contest. She didn't do anything truly evil, like giving people health insurance. But her parents are from India, so she's an Arab. (audience laughter)

You know, it's funny, I used to think that my Twitter feed was so hate-filled, because I deal in controversy. But I found out it's everybody! I mean, I understand:



Fuck you. Die in a fire. @billmaher

@JonahHill why don't u kill yourself u unfunny fat piece of #trash #commitsuicide you fucking lame ass #pieceofshit that u are #diedieDIEDIE

Well, I guess it's a nice break from writing:

You know, Abraham Lincoln said Americans were a people ""with malice toward none, and charity for all"". But if he had said it online, the first comment would be:



@AbrahamLincoln blow me, Jewbeard

And the second would be:



@AbrahamLincoln Go to the theatre and die!

I mean, look at this one.



fuck you cheesecake factory

Really? Even cheesecake? What's next, calling apple pie a cunt? (audience laughter) So, my question is why, why, why has hate become the national pastime? Yes, the technology does have something to do with it, but to those who say, ""Oh, people were always horrible, we just have Twitter and Facebook now,"" no. No, not like this.

The Greatest Generation had celebrities. No one would have thought to have sent Myrna Loy a telegram that said, ""Fuck you Myrna Loy! I hope Clark Gable gives you herpes!""

(audience laughter)

No, I think the problem is this. We just found out that the percentage of Americans who describe themselves as ""poor"" has doubled in the last five years. Which is very significant, because in the past, the poor consistently — and erroneously — described themselves as middle class. Because they had hope. Because they still believed in that Ponzi scheme formerly known as the American dream. But now they're starting to get it, that the fix is in, and that the ""two Americas"" thing is kinda true. And they're in the wrong one.

Apple just released two new iPhones, an expensive gold one for the haves, and for the serfs, a shitty plastic lime-green one that looks like your phone is wearing Crocs. (audience laughter)

But here's the good news. Wages may not go up again, and good jobs may never come back, but you can now get an iPhone for $99 bucks. And you can use it to tell Betty White to go fuck herself!!

http://news.yahoo.com/rutgers-alumni-call-probe-coachs-firing-061128108--spt.html,,[],Rutgers alumni call for probe on coach's firing,"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) — Mike Rice was fired as the Rutgers men's basketball coach after a video surfaced showing him shoving players and berating them with gay slurs, but critics said New Jersey's flagship public university still has more explaining — and maybe some more firing — to do.

A group of 13 faculty members Wednesday demanded that university President Robert Barchi resign for his ""inexcusable handling"" of the situation.

Alumni, lawmakers and a gay-rights group are among those calling for an investigation into why university officials took months to fire Rice after getting the video from a former basketball program employee in a scandal that touches on two long-standing issues on campus: the role of sports and the treatment of gays.

""If the roles were reversed and this was a professor and not a coach and this was a student in the classroom as opposed to a collegiate player this would be completely different. You wouldn't say, 'This was a first offense,'"" said Glenn Articolo, a radiologist who lives in Marlton and a 1991 Rutgers graduate. ""There's not a single employee at Rutgers University from the president to the janitor who wouldn't be dismissed immediately. It seems there's a double standard when it comes to the basketball coach or the football coach.""

Some alumni say athletic director Tim Pernetti should also be dismissed and some are questioning what Barchi knew, and when.

In a statement Wednesday, Barchi, who took office in September, said he was told of the video in November and agreed that it would be appropriate to suspend Rice, fine him and send him to anger management counseling. But he said he saw the video for himself only this week, and it was then that he decided Rice should be fired.

Pernetti also issued a statement Wednesday, but he and Barchi were not made available to answer reporters' questions.

Because he lasted the season, Rice is due a $100,000 bonus on top of his salary. He was paid $622,500 in 2012. Athletic Department spokesman Jason Baum said he'll get the bonus for coaching the final game of the 2012-13 season last month because it's contractually obligated.

Story continues

Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, a Democrat who spoke about the topic on several radio and television shows Wednesday, is calling for legislative hearings on the details.

The gay-rights group Garden State Equality also called for an investigation.

Much of the anger over the university's handling of the situation came because Rice was not fired until after the public saw the video.

""Why did they fire him? Just because the tape came out?"" asked Jim Walton, a 1980 Rutgers graduate who is now a compliance and ethics manager in Philadelphia. ""They already knew the truth. If he should have been fired today, he should have been fired a long time ago.""

Some at Rutgers, a long-time also-ran in major sports, have been debating for years whether it's been worth it to spend more money and put more focus on trying to elevate the university's football and men's basketball programs.

The university has also dealt with how gay students are treated since Tyler Clementi, a freshman there, killed himself in 2010 days after learning his roommate had used a webcam to see him kissing another man. The roommate spent 20 days in jail last year after a jury convicted him of bias intimidation and other crimes in a case that sparked policy changes to try to make Rutgers friendlier to gay students.

""After the suicide of Tyler Clementi, I thought my alma mater would take the use of gay slurs by any member of the Rutgers community — students, faculty, administrators, or coaches — seriously,"" said Debbie Hadley, a 1991 Rutgers graduate who is a naturalist in Jackson. ""Clearly, Tim Pernetti did not. And yes, I believe he should be fired, too.""

Some students agreed that the coach needed to be ousted.

Alison Coopersmith, an 18-year-old first-year student majoring in political science said that if gay slurs are not tolerated by students, they shouldn't be tolerated by professionals, either.

""It's worse when they're in a position of power,"" she said.

But on campus, not everyone was up in arms Wednesday.

Taylor Akers, a 19-year-old sophomore pre-med major, said Rice should not have been fired. ""That happens all the time,"" he said.

The child survived. John Minchillo/AP

Federal agents trying to stop the black Infiniti speeding between the White House and the U.S. Capitol fired seven shots at its unarmed driver, who had a toddler in the car with her, an uncommon tactic that occurred during a highly unusual chase.

Investigators believe that a Connecticut woman who was fatally shot by police Thursday after a car chase from the White House to the Capitol had grappled with mental illness and may have believed she was surreptitiously being monitored by President Obama.

Miriam Carey, 34, a dental hygienist living in Stamford, Conn., “may have thought President Obama was stalking her” when she steered her black Infiniti, with her 1-year-old daughter sitting in the back, onto some of the nation’s most highly guarded territory, according to a law enforcement official.

Carey had received a diagnosis of postpartum depression with psychosis, her sister Amy Carey-Jones said in a Friday interview on “Anderson Cooper 360°,” and had been treated with counseling and medication, but was reducing her use of medication under a doctor’s supervision. Carey-Jones said her sister “didn’t appear to be unstable.”

“We will never know what Miriam was thinking in those last hours before she died,” her sister told Cooper. “We can only speculate, and our real concern is why and were things done properly. Was there some other way that she could have been helped so that it didn’t end tragically?”

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the investigation has uncovered “a picture of a mentally disturbed woman.” Carey had been treated for schizophrenia, he said, but two of her sisters disputed his characterization.

This 2011 photo provided by Dr. Barry Weiss, from the website of Advanced Periodontics in Hamden, Conn., shows former employee Miriam Carey. (AP)

McCaul said her condition may have been exacerbated by a recent head injury and that her boyfriend had called police to say she believed her apartment was bugged and Obama was behind it. Carey’s sisters, however, said in their CNN interview that they had never heard her say anything of that nature. Valarie Carey called the boyfriend’s account “very questionable.”

For now, the biggest mystery is whether the incident that spun out 265 miles from Carey’s home was the culmination of a long, downward spiral or was sparked by some precipitating event.

Carey’s mother, Idella Carey, told ABC News that her daughter had not shown any violence in the past. She said she thought Miriam Carey was taking her toddler to a doctor’s appointment in Connecticut on Thursday.

Authorities are trying to trace Carey’s movements in Connecticut and Washington, where she apparently arrived only shortly before she approached a White House entrance and drove her car into a metal barricade just after 2 p.m. Thursday, then struck a uniformed Secret Service officer.

After speeding down Pennsylvania Avenue, she crashed at the Capitol grounds. Police scurried to carry the child to safety after her mother was shot several times.

In the New York City suburb of Stamford, about 100 law enforcement personnel from the U.S. Secret Service, FBI, Connecticut State Police and Stamford police searched Carey’s apartment in the Woodside Green complex overnight Thursday. They removed boxes, bags and at least one computer from the sprawling complex where a neighbor had seen Carey wheeling her daughter in a stroller.

The search involved hazardous-material teams, a bomb squad and a robot, Stamford Police Chief Jonathan Fontneau said. Under the assumption that something inside the apartment might pose a threat, police sent a robot through a window first and meticulously decontaminated people who went in and out of the unit, Fontneau said. In the end, they found just a “typical” first-floor two-bedroom apartment with “nothing out of the ordinary,” Fontneau said, and allowed evacuated residents to return to their units.

Until Thursday, the police chief said, Carey, too, “was nothing out of the ordinary that would draw attention to herself.”

Police had been called to the apartment once before, in December, but not for a criminal matter, Fontneau said. He did not have further details. A neighbor who declined to give his name said the tires were stolen from Carey’s car in the late spring or early summer and that Carey was somewhat upset at apartment officials about it.

“She was a little [irritated] about we’re paying all the taxes and common charges we pay and no security cameras,” the neighbor said. The encounter was the first and only time he met Carey. The neighbor said he found Carey fairly likable. “Very well-spoken,” he said. “She was obviously educated.”

People who were interviewed in the neighborhood Friday said they were still digesting the news that the woman at the center of the U.S. Capitol shooting was from their neighborhood. Charlie Clark, a 76-year-old crossing guard who chats regularly with Woodside residents, said that he was surprised that he did not recognize Carey’s photo when it was shown on television. “I kept looking at her, looking at her, I said, ‘See, that’s a beautiful lady,’ ” Clark said. “Hey, anything can happen. I’m just glad they didn’t kill that little baby.”

Mark Rosenbloom, who lives at Woodside, said he recognized photos of Carey’s car. It was always parked in an end spot in the complex parking lot and was especially well cleaned, he said. “You just notice sometimes cars that are shiny, especially when yours isn’t,” said Rosenbloom, 52. “I don’t think she wanted to get it scratched. Kept it in pretty good shape.”

Carey’s death also reverberated throughout several neighborhoods in Brooklyn, home to sisters Amy and Valarie, their mother, and other relatives.

On Thursday night, Carey’s friends and relatives congregated at the home of Valarie Carey, who lives in a two-story brick building on Marion Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.

Family members traveled to the District on Friday to identify Miriam Carey’s body and later returned to Brooklyn where they spoke with reporters.

“My sister was not a criminal,” Valarie Carey said. “My sister did not deserve to have her life shortened at an early stage. She had aspirations, she had dreams . . . she has a family that loved her.”

Maureen O%27Connor admits she took %242.1 million



She won and lost more than %241 billion

O%27Connor pleaded not guilty to a money laundering charge

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Maureen O'Connor was a physical education teacher who won a seat on the San Diego City Council when she was only 25 years old, later winning two terms as the city's first female mayor as she charmed voters with a populist flair.

But her rapid rise was matched by her fall, culminating Thursday when she acknowledged in federal court that she took $2.1 million from her late husband's charitable foundation during a decade-long gambling spree in which she won — and lost — more than $1 billion.

O'Connor pleaded not guilty to a money laundering charge in an agreement with the Justice Department that defers prosecution for two years while she tries to repay the foundation and receives treatment for gambling.

O'Connor, 66, once had a personal fortune that her attorney estimated between $40 million and $50 million, inherited from her husband of 17 years, Robert O. Peterson, founder of the Jack in the Box Inc. fast-food chain. She is now virtually broke, living with a sister.

O'Connor walked across the courtroom with a cane, appearing frail and struggling to maintain composure at one point as her attorney wrapped his arm around her shoulder and placed his hand on her head.

At a news conference, she said she always intended to repay the foundation and appeared to blame her behavior on a brain tumor that was diagnosed in 2011.

""There are two Maureens — Maureen No. 1 and Maureen No. 2,"" said O'Connor, who declined to take questions. ""Maureen No. 2 is the Maureen who did not know she had a tumor growing in her brain.""

O'Connor's game of choice was video poker at casinos in San Diego, Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J. Her attorney, Eugene Iredale, said she played for hours at a time.

She won about $1 billion from 2000 to 2009, according to winnings that casinos reported to the Internal Revenue Service, but lost even more. Iredale said her net gambling losses topped $13 million.

News of O'Connor's gambling troubles and financial ruin elicited sympathy in her hometown. Magistrate Judge David Bartick told her that she left ""a very strong legacy in the city of San Diego.""

The U.S. attorney's office said O'Connor's medical condition influenced the decision to strike a deal, saying it may have been impossible to bring the case to trial. The tumor was removed but doctors submitted letters detailing significant ailments.

""Maureen O'Connor was a selfless public official who contributed much to the well-being of San Diego,"" said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy. ""However, no figure, regardless of how much good they've done or how much they've given to charity, can escape criminal liability with impunity.""

O'Connor, the eighth of 13 children whose father was a boxer and nightclub owner and mother was a registered nurse, was elected to the City Council three years after graduating from San Diego State University. She was mayor from 1986 to 1992, San Diego's only Democratic leader over a four-decade span. She promoted community policing, championed the arts and oversaw completion of a downtown convention center.

O'Connor began gambling around 2001 as she struggled with pain and loneliness from the death of her husband from leukemia in 1994 and the passing of several close friends, said Iredale, who called it ""grief gambling"" in a court filing. Within four years, she was betting heavily.

O'Connor acknowledged taking $2.1 million from the R.P. Foundation between September 2008 and March 2009 to pay gambling debts, wager more and cover living costs.

He is using Craigslist and white power message boards to entice others in the movement to take refuge in Leith, about two hours southwest of Bismarck. On one board, he detailed his vision for the community — an enclave where residents fly “racialist” banners, where they are able to import enough “responsible hard core” white nationalists to take control of the town government, where “leftist journalists or antis” who “come and try to make trouble” will face arrest.

The revelations have riveted this community and the surrounding area, drawing a range of reactions from disgust to disbelief to curiosity.

“If that man wanted to live in Leith and be a good neighbor and be decent and not push his thoughts on the people, then he could live there,” said Arlene Wells, 82, a farmer and local historian. “But to come in and want to change everything and be the big dog — no. I don’t like bulldogs.”

It is all people are talking about, in bars and in their homes, at funerals and at church. They are poking around on the Web to read Mr. Cobb’s positions for themselves.

For Mr. Obama, who has picked his shots in the immigration debate to avoid stirring partisan anger on Capitol Hill, it was a moment of promise and peril. While he threw his weight behind the bill, he conceded that it would not satisfy all sides and said he anticipated a bruising fight over issues like border security and the path to citizenship.

The president, however, may have more leverage than in previous battles, not least because many Republicans believe rewriting the immigration laws is critical for the long-term viability of their party given the nation’s demographic shifts, even if doing so risks alienating parts of their base.

Republican willingness to weigh significant changes in immigration policy was evident in the 84-to-15 vote to begin what is expected to be a monthlong debate on the bill, a lopsided majority that comprised 52 Democrats, 2 independents and 30 Republicans. The opponents were all Republicans."

Joe Scarborough joined Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC after Obama's speech on Wednesday. He criticized Republicans for being what he said was out of touch with Americans, an assertion he has made before, as well as the NRA.

He laid out what he saw as the GOP's two choices in the House of Representatives. ""They can either pass a comprehensive gun control package right now and shape it under Speaker Boehner, or they can wait two years when they lose the majority and have Nancy Pelosi write that bill,"" Scarborough said. ""There are no other choices.""

He went on to hammer Republicans for living in an ""echo chamber"" for the past year. Scarborough issued the same warning to his party immediately after the Newtown shooting. In December, he said ""we will lose"" if Republicans continued to defend Glocks and Bushmasters."

Daley has kept a low profile since leaving office in 2011.

That doesn't mean he has lost interest in urban issues. The former mayor has turned his attention in a surprising direction, beyond Chicago's borders to one of the most intractable urban tragedies in America: the collapse of Gary, Ind.

""I always believe no part of America should be forgotten, and I think Gary has been forgotten,"" Daley said.

Daley is using his influence at the University of Chicago, where he is a distinguished senior fellow, to push a modest but growing amount of manpower toward Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson.

With guidance from Daley and Freeman-Wilson, University of Chicago graduate students are trying to figure out what to do with Gary's abandoned buildings and how to promote greater use of technology to help the city accomplish more with less, among other projects.

The hope is that the students will go on to help other cities after graduation. If successful, the U. of C.-Gary partnership could be replicated in other industrial towns grappling with decline.

Gary spans about 55 square miles, nearly a quarter of the size of Chicago. Yet the steel town's population has plummeted to an estimated 80,000, meaning the city has lost about half its people since 1960. The city's problems have mounted, including abandoned buildings and homes, sagging infrastructure and a declining budget to pay for services.

Outsiders have tried to fix Gary since at least the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Freeman-Wilson, a former Indiana attorney general, judge and Harvard College and Harvard Law School graduate, has reinvigorated Gary's renewal efforts. And she's unafraid to ask for help.

Immediately after winning the 2011 Democratic primary, Freeman-Wilson called Daley for advice. They met, and Daley invited her to be the first guest speaker at his lecture series at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy, where Daley has a five-year appointment.

This quarter, 11 students from the university's public policy, business and social services schools are getting course credit for working on projects for Gary.

""It was Mayor Daley's idea,"" Freeman-Wilson said as she rode from a meeting on Chicago's West Side to Gary. ""I had always envisioned getting the support and work from (University of Chicago Law School) alums, because there were issues around codes and things of that nature. It was not until the mayor came up with the idea of using students from the (Harris) School of Public Policy that I said, 'Oh yeah, that would work. That would work very well.'""

Daley does not teach a class at the University of Chicago. He runs an occasional lecture series.

Carol Brown, his last policy chief at City Hall, leads the program and the class, which is called the ""Urban Revitalization Project: City of Gary, Ind."" Grants from the Chicago-based Joyce and MacArthur foundations help pay administrative costs, including Brown's salary and that of a part-time assistant.

Last quarter's class was divided into three project teams. One team is cataloging Gary's abandoned buildings, which are magnets for crime and eyesores that further depress surrounding property values. Another is trying to recruit pro bono legal and consulting services for the city. And a third is trying to craft a strategy to clean up front stoops and empty lots one block at a time. This quarter's class also is tackling untapped funding opportunities and economic development.

Freeman-Wilson said a major benefit of the partnership is the fresh ideas from students ""who aren't jaded by the limitations of government, whereas a 20-year employee might say, 'Oh, no, we can't do that in government because we don't have X, Y and Z.'""

Already their work has prompted more widespread use among Gary employees of a technology that stores and analyzes geographic data. City workers are now using the technology to map potholes, fallen tree limbs and illegal dump sites. That way work crews can be dispatched to neighborhoods where the problems are most severe.

""This partnership encourages urban planners to think broadly about regions instead of cities — greater Chicago instead of the city of Chicago,"" said Stephen Paul O'Hara, a historian at Xavier University who wrote a book about Gary.

The students operate as consultants. They gather best practices and ideas from cities around the country and then recommend a course of action. At the end of each 10-week quarter, students present their recommendations to Daley, Freeman-Wilson and their staffs. Their grades are based on those presentations and supporting reports.

""I will tell you, it never stops getting nerve-wracking,"" second-year graduate student Jocelyn Hare said of presenting to Daley. ""But it gets easier.""

Last spring, Hare, 32, responded to an email seeking student volunteers to conduct preliminary research to test the idea of a partnership. Hare then interned for the city of Gary during the summer. The Harris school paid her $15 an hour. She then enrolled in the first class in the fall and again this winter, when it was opened to graduate students outside of Harris for the first time.

An Oak Park native and former Chicago Public Schools employee, Hare knows most of Freeman-Wilson's senior staff, from the zoning chief to the director of constituent services.

""Coming into Harris, the first year of course work was incredibly rigorous and incredibly quantitative-heavy,"" Hare said. ""But I didn't get a lot of practical experience. And there's a big gap between policy work in real life and the policy tools I was learning in school.""

So why isn't the project focused on Chicago's most impoverished neighborhoods?

""Because of Mayor Rahm Emanuel,"" Daley said in a Jan. 31 speech to several hundred wealthy University of Chicago supporters and their guests. ""He has a leadership quality. He is our mayor. For somebody to say, you know, 'Yeah, I just retired, and I'm going to do something in the city,' I felt that"" was inappropriate."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-church-bill-20130715,0,5709596.story",2013-07-15 07:00:00,[],Catholic Church lobbies to avert sex abuse lawsuits,"At the height of the clergy sex-abuse scandal in 2002, Catholic leaders stayed silent as California lawmakers passed a landmark bill that gave hundreds of accusers extra time to file civil lawsuits. The consequences were costly.

California dioceses paid $1.2 billion in settlements and released thousands of confidential documents that showed their leaders, including Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, had made plans to shield admitted molesters from law enforcement.

Now, state legislators are considering a bill that would give some alleged victims more time to sue. But this time, the church is waging a pitched battle in Sacramento to quash it.

A group affiliated with the church has hired five lobbying firms and spent tens of thousands of dollars fighting SB 131. Opponents argue that the bill unfairly opens the church, the Boy Scouts, and other private and nonprofit employers to lawsuits over decades-old allegations that are tough to fight in court. Two bishops have visited the Capitol to argue their case to the bill’s chief author.

In the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the campaign extends to the very top. Archbishop Jose H. Gomez warned parishioners last month in the church newspaper that the proposal “puts the social services and educational work of the Church at risk” and urged them to press their lawmakers to scuttle it.

The church, Gomez said, “faces deep challenges from the government” and cited the proposal as an example without explaining what it would do. “Let’s pray for our religious freedom … and let’s exercise that freedom by contacting our legislators about SB 131,” he wrote.

The current battle has roots in 2002, when lawmakers were searching for a way to respond to the unfolding clergy scandal. At the time, California’s civil statute of limitations — or the time limit for plaintiffs to file lawsuits — was relatively strict for child sex-abuse claims.

Plaintiffs could sue alleged abusers or their employers until age 26. After that, they could sue within three years of finding links between past molestation and present psychological problems, but they could no longer sue employers who may have failed to protect them from known molesters.

The 2002 bill extended the three-year discovery rule to employers and lifted the statute of limitations on lawsuits against them for all of 2003, allowing a slew of claims related to decades-old abuse. Church leaders didn’t mount a campaign against the bill. They didn’t testify at hearings. They didn’t write a single letter in opposition. The legislation zipped through both chambers of the Legislature — not one lawmaker voted against it.

“At the time it didn’t seem like too unfair of a response to the sexual abuse of children,” said Edward Dolejsi, executive director of the California Catholic Conference, the church’s political arm. “I don’t think anybody anticipated the exposure that would be there.”

In 2007, the L.A. Archdiocese alone settled with more than 500 plaintiffs for $660 million. Church officials were also forced to make public a trove of confidential papers in January of this year. In an acknowledgment that the documents had sullied the church’s reputation, archdiocese attorneys tried this year to get upcoming sex-abuse trials moved to another part of the state, saying the media firestorm had tainted the Southern California jury pool.

Since the California law took effect, lawmakers in other states have introduced similar bills, arguing that civil lawsuits are a key way for abuse victims to seek justice. But only three states — Delaware, Hawaii and Minnesota — have passed such laws, said Marci Hamilton, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York and an expert on child sex-abuse statues of limitation.

That’s partly because of the Catholic Church’s opposition efforts, she said, which have included hiring lobbyists and dispatching bishops to try to sway legislators. “The 2002 bill caught the church off-guard,” said Hamilton, who supports lengthening the time child sex-abuse victims have to sue. “Now the Catholic bishops are bringing their A-game to California.”

Their target is a bill introduced by Sen. James Beall Jr. (D-San Jose). Its key provision would again lift the statute of limitations for one year, but only for a group who were 26 or older and missed the previous deadline because they more recently discovered abuse-related psychological problems.

Advertisement

Advocates say loosening time limits is crucial in sex-abuse cases because it often takes decades for victims to admit that they were molested and seek legal recourse. Supporters of SB 131 include the National Center for Victims of Crime and the California Police Chiefs Assn.

“There are victims out there who deserve justice and accountability,” said Joelle Casteix, western regional director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. Casteix sued the Diocese of Orange during the 2003 window, alleging abuse at the hands of a lay choir director at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana.

Advertisement

Casteix not only won a $1.6-million settlement, but she also received documents that showed administrators knew about — and ignored — the abuse. “It gave me my dignity back,” she said.

Opponents argue that it’s hard to mount a defense against decades-old accusations because key witnesses are often dead or infirm and evidence may have vanished. They also say that legislation that temporarily suspends the statute of limitations encourages people to make false claims in hopes of walking away with a settlement check.

Advertisement

Because Beall’s bill doesn’t apply to schools and other public agencies, church lobbyists also say they’re being scapegoated. The California State Alliance of YMCAs and the California Assn. of Private School Organizations, whose members include Catholic dioceses, oppose the bill as well.

“We’re not going to open up a window again. We have done that once,” Dolejsi said. “Are you going to open another window five years from now? When does it end?”

Advertisement

A group linked to the church, the California Council of Nonprofit Organizations, spent $75,000 in the first three months of the year to oppose SB 131, according to papers filed with the secretary of state. The ties between the group and the church, including Dolejsi’s affiliation with both, were first reported by the Orange County Register.

Beall said two high-ranking church officials told him that the bill could financially hobble schools and parishes: Auxiliary Bishop Gerald E. Wilkerson of the L.A. Archdiocese and Bishop Jaime Soto of the Diocese of Sacramento, who are president and vice president of the California Catholic Conference. Other bishops have urged their flocks to help defeat the bill.

In Southern California, at least one parish, St. Timothy in West Los Angeles, rounded up letters signed by parishioners to send to Sacramento. An archdiocese spokeswoman did not respond to questions about whether other churches did the same.

It’s unclear what effect the campaign has had, though a posting on the California Catholic Conference’s website said that it persuaded some lawmakers to either vote against the bill or abstain from weighing in.

The bill recently squeaked through the Senate and passed the Assembly Judiciary Committee. It goes to the lower house’s Appropriations Committee next. Because of the church’s lobbying efforts, Beall said, he was concerned about its survival.

“If people don’t like a bill, they kill it in appropriations,” he said.

At least Mitt Romney won something in 2012.

According to the Tyndall Report, the most covered news story of 2012 on evening news programs was the former Republican presidential candidate's campaign. Romney campaigned for 11 out of the 12 months of 2012.

The second most-covered news story of 2012 was the ongoing conflict in Syria. The violent uprising has become the most dangerous conflict zone for reporters to cover with 28 journalists killed in 2012, including famed war correspondent Marie Colvin and the New York Times' Anthony Shadid. Of the three broadcast networks, CBS aired the most stories on the uprising.

Major news events including Hurricane Sandy, Trayvon Martin's death, the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado, and the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School also made the list. Major political stories including the unemployment rate falling below 8 percent and the contentious negotiations about the federal budget also made the top 20 news stories of 2012.

The list demonstrated evening news broadcasts' focus on domestic stories. Five out of the top 20 stories focused on international topics including the uprising in Syria, the war in Afghanistan, the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, the 2012 London Olympics, and the British royal family.

ABC News' David Muir was the most used reporter of 2012, appearing on air for a total of 426 minutes. NBC News' Andrea Mitchell was second, with a total of 269 on air minutes.

On the eve of his second inaugural, President Obama appears smarter, tougher and bolder than ever before. But whether he is also wiser remains a key question for his new term.

It is clear that he is consciously changing his leadership style heading into the next four years. Weeks before the November elections, his top advisers were signaling that he intended to be a different kind of president in his second term.

Tom Fitzsimmons David Gergen

“Just watch,” they said to me, in effect, “he will win re-election decisively and then he will throw down the gauntlet to the Republicans, insisting they raise taxes on the wealthy. Right on the edge of the fiscal cliff, he thinks Republicans will cave.”

What’s your Plan B, I asked. “We don’t need a Plan B,” they answered. “After the president hangs tough – no more Mr. Nice Guy – the other side will buckle.” Sure enough, Republicans caved on taxes. Encouraged, Obama has since made clear he won’t compromise with Republicans on the debt ceiling, either.

Foreman: My last letter to the president

Obama 2.0 stepped up this past week on yet another issue: gun control. No president in two decades has been as forceful or sweeping in challenging the nation’s gun culture. Once again, he portrayed the right as the enemy of progress and showed no interest in negotiating a package up front.

In his coming State of the Union address, and perhaps in his inaugural, the president will begin a hard push for a comprehensive reform of our tattered immigration system. Leading GOP leaders on the issue – Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, for example – would prefer a piecemeal approach that is bipartisan. Obama wants to go for broke in a single package, and on a central issue – providing a clear path to citizenship for undocumented residents – he is uncompromising.

After losing out on getting Susan Rice as his next secretary of state, Obama has also shown a tougher side on personnel appointments. Rice went down after Democratic as well as Republican senators indicated a preference for Sen. John Kerry. But when Republicans also tried to kill the nomination of Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense, Obama was unyielding – an “in-your-face appointment,” Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, called it, echoing sentiments held by some of his colleagues.

Will Obama’s second inauguration let America turn the page?

Republicans would have preferred someone other than Jack Lew at Treasury, but Obama brushed them off. Hagel and Lew – both substantial men – will be confirmed, absent an unexpected bombshell, and Obama will rack up two more victories over Republicans.

Strikingly, Obama has also been deft in the ways he has drawn upon Vice President Joe Biden. During much of the campaign, Biden appeared to be kept under wraps. But in the transition, he has been invaluable to Obama in negotiating a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on the fiscal cliff and in pulling together the gun package. Biden was also at his most eloquent at the ceremony announcing the gun measures.

His new style is paying off politically. But in the long run, will it also pay off in better governance? David Gergen

All of this has added up for Obama to one of the most effective transitions in modern times. And it is paying rich dividends: A CNN poll this past week pegged his approval rating at 55%, far above the doldrums he was in for much of the past two years. Many of his long-time supporters are rallying behind him. As the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to score back-to-back election victories with more than 50% of the vote, Obama is in the strongest position since early in his first year.

Smarter, tougher, bolder – his new style is paying off politically. But in the long run, will it also pay off in better governance? Perhaps – and for the country’s sake, let’s hope so. Yet, there are ample reasons to wonder, and worry.

Avlon: GOP’s surprising edge on diversity

Ultimately, to resolve major issues like deficits, immigration, guns and energy, the president and Congress need to find ways to work together much better than they did in the first term. Over the past two years, Republicans were clearly more recalcitrant than Democrats, practically declaring war on Obama, and the White House has been right to adopt a tougher approach after the elections.

But a growing number of Republicans concluded after they had their heads handed to them in November that they had to move away from extremism toward a more center-right position, more open to working out compromises with Obama. It’s not that they suddenly wanted Obama to succeed; they didn’t want their party to fail.

House Speaker John Boehner led the way, offering the day after the election to raise taxes on the wealthy and giving up two decades of GOP orthodoxy. In a similar spirit, Rubio has been developing a mainstream plan on immigration, moving away from a ruinous GOP stance.

One senses that the hope, small as it was, to take a brief timeout on hyperpartisanship in order to tackle the big issues is now slipping away.

Zelizer: Second-term Obama will play defense

While a majority of Americans now approve of Obama’s job performance, conservatives increasingly believe that in his new toughness, he is going overboard, trying to run over them. They don’t see a president who wants to roll up his sleeves and negotiate; they see a president who wants to barnstorm the country to beat them up. News that Obama is converting his campaign apparatus into a nonprofit to support his second term will only deepen that sense. And it frustrates them that he is winning: At their retreat, House Republicans learned that their disapproval has risen to 64%.

Conceivably, Obama’s tactics could pressure Republicans into capitulation on several fronts. More likely, they will be spoiling for more fights. Chances for a “grand bargain” appear to be hanging by a thread.

Two suspicions are starting to float among those with distaste for the president. The first is that he isn’t really all that committed to bringing deficits under control. If he were, he would be pushing a master plan by now. Instead, it is argued, he will tinker with the deficits but cares much more about leaving a progressive legacy – health care reform, a stronger safety net, green energy, and the like.

Politics: Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company

Second, the suspicion is taking hold that he is approaching the second term with a clear eye on elections ahead. What if he can drive Republicans out of control of the House in 2014? Then he could get his real agenda done. What if he could set the stage for another Democrat to win the presidency in 2016? Then he could leave behind a majority coalition that could run the country for years, just as FDR did. Democrats, of course, think the real point is that Obama is finally showing the toughness that is needed.

We are surely seeing a new Obama emerge on the eve of his second term. Where he will now lead the country is the central question that his inaugural address and the weeks ahead will begin to answer.

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: Return of the real Obama,"The rout was complete, the retreat disorderly. President Obama got his tax hikes — naked of spending cuts — passed by the ostensibly Republican House of Representatives. After which, you might expect him to pivot to his self-proclaimed “principle” of fiscal “balance” by taking the lead on reducing spending. “Why,” asked The Post on the eve of the final fiscal-cliff agreement, “is the nation’s leader not embracing and then explaining the balanced reforms the nation needs?”

Because he has no interest in them. He’s a visionary, not an accountant. Sure, he’ll pretend to care about deficits, especially while running for reelection. But now that he’s past the post, he’s free to be himself — a committed big-government social democrat.

As he showed in his two speeches this week. After perfunctory nods to debt and spending reduction, he waxed enthusiastic about continued “investments” — i.e., spending — on education, research, roads and bridges, green energy, etc.

Having promised more government, he then promised more taxes — on “millionaires” and “companies with a lot of lobbyists,” of course. It was a bold affirmation of pre-Clintonian tax-and-spend liberalism.

Why not? He had just won Round 1: raising rates. Round 2 is to raise yet more tax revenue by eliminating deductions. After all, didn’t John Boehner offer him $800 billion of such loophole-closing revenuejust a few weeks ago?

To paraphrase Churchill on the British Empire, Barack Obama did not become president of the United States to preside over the liquidation of the welfare state. On the contrary, he is dedicated to its expansion. He’s already created the largest new entitlement in half a century (Obamacare). And he has increased federal spending to an astronomical 24.4 percent of GDP (the postwar norm is about 20 percent), a level not seen since World War II.

But this level of spending requires a significantly higher level of taxation. Hence his hardball fiscal-cliff strategy of issuing an ultimatum to Republicans to raise tax rates — or be blamed for a massive across-the-board tax increase and a subsequent recession.

I’ll get you the money by eliminating deductions, offered Boehner. No, sir, replied the president. Rates it must be.

Why the insistence?

(1) Partisan Advantage

As I wrote last month, the ultimatum was designed to exploit and exacerbate internal Republican divisions. It worked perfectly. Boehner’s attempted finesse (Plan B), which would have raised rates but only for those making more than $1 million, collapsed amid an open rebellion from a good quarter of the Republican caucus.

At which point, power passed from the House to the Senate, where a deal was brokered. By the time the Senate bill reached the House, there was no time or room for maneuver. Checkmate. Obama neutralized the one body that had stymied him during the past two years.

(2) Ideological Breakthrough

Obama’s ultimate ambition is to break the nation’s 30-year thrall of low taxes — so powerful that those who defied the Reaganite norm paid heavily for it. Walter Mondale’s acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic convention, promising to raise taxes, ended his campaign before it began. President George H.W. Bush’s no-new-taxes reversal cost him a second term.

On this, too, Obama is succeeding. He not only got his tax increase passed. He did it with public opinion behind him.

Why are higher taxes so important to him?

First, as a means: A high-tax economy is liberalism’s only hope for sustaining and enlarging the entitlement state. It provides the funds for enlightened adventures in everything from algae to Obamacare.

Second, as an end in itself. Fundamentally, Obama is a leveler. The community organizer seeks, above all, to reverse the growing inequality that he dates and attributes to ruthless Reaganism. Now, however, clothed in the immense powers of the presidency, he can actually engage in unadorned redistributionism. As in Tuesday night’s $620 billion wealth transfer.

Upon losing the House in 2010, the leveler took cover for the next two years. He wasn’t going to advance his real agenda through the Republican House anyway, and he needed to win reelection.

Now he’s won. The old Obama is back. He must not be underestimated. He has deftly leveraged his class-war-themed election victory (a) to secure a source of funding (albeit still small) for the bloated welfare state, (b) to carry out an admirably candid bit of income redistribution and (c) to fracture the one remaining institutional obstacle to the rest of his ideological agenda.

Not bad for two months’ work.

But in the city that gave rise to Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra, a once-unthinkable prospect now looms. A die-hard fan of the Boston Red Sox, the kind of enthusiast reviled across the five boroughs, could soon rule the city.

Bill de Blasio, the city’s public advocate and a leading Democratic contender for mayor, has a confession: He is a Red Sox fan, tried and true. He was raised in Cambridge, Mass., becoming a devotee of the Red Sox at 6, and he is unabashed in his disdain for anything having to do with that team from the Bronx.

“I have my loyalty to the team of my youth,” he said in an interview, calling his tie to the Red Sox a “deep devotion.”"

That is in part because the federal minimum wage is too low.

Currently, an individual with a full-time job at the minimum wage and a family of three to support will fall below the federal poverty line. These workers, despite putting in regular hours, are struggling to provide basic necessities for themselves and their families. By allowing the minimum wage to remain at a nearly unlivable level, we have deemed certain jobs not worthy enough to meet even our country’s minimum standard of living.

How have we been able to keep wages so low without significant social discord? By using tax revenue and a complicated government bureaucracy to subsidize low-wage employers and supplement minimum-wage salaries. Rather than firms paying a worker’s true cost and customers paying an appropriate price for the services provided by those firms, the government provides workers with “income transfers” to help them meet basic needs. These include such programs as the earned income tax credit, food stamps and Medicaid.

These government supports mask a job’s true value and set an artificially low wage. They also represent the height of inefficiency. Raising the minimum wage means that the income required for basic needs is delivered in a one-step approach, via the paycheck directly from firm to worker, rather than requiring additional government expenditures.

Beyond efficiency, there is also the matter of human dignity. Think about it: After a long day on the clock, you come home knowing that despite your hard work, you can’t feed your family, cover their medical insurance or pay your rent without government support. What message does that send about the dignity of your work and the pride of taking personal responsibility for your family? Low wages push workers into shadow labor markets where they get paid under the table, avoid reporting income and evade tax responsibilities. Artificially low wages teach workers that their work is not valuable — a disastrous policy outcome.

In his State of the Union speech, President Obama called for raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour. That would be a start toward restoring dignity and value to low-wage work. But it isn’t enough. We propose raising the minimum wage, in stages, to $12.50 an hour, an amount that would allow an individual supporting a family of three to live modestly, at about 138% of the federal poverty line. That level offers workers a way to escape poverty, a chance to feed their families, buy basic medical insurance and live in secure housing without significant government support.

The most common objection to raising the minimum wage is that it destroys jobs. But a slew of recent studies have pointed out that although raising the minimum wage does increase earnings and reduce poverty, it has a limited, almost negligible, effect on employment. Studies have also illustrated that restoring the dignity of work through higher wages reduces worker turnover and increases productivity.

Some make the overstated claim that increasing the minimum wage would accelerate companies’ off-shoring of jobs. But most low-wage jobs today are geographically fixed, or as economists call them, “non-tradable.” A janitor or home-care worker’s job, for example, can’t be outsourced to China.

What is sometimes understated is the likelihood of low-wage jobs being automated, a real and growing threat. But if a small growth in the minimum wage is enough to move an industry to automation, it is likely that automation was coming in short order anyway. Technological progress is inevitable and further automation unavoidable. If raising the minimum wage leads to productivity gains through investment in automation, so be it. In the meantime, we need to reward American workers for their efforts.

Some argue that raising the minimum wage offers benefits to those who may not need them. This argument is also flawed. The Economic Policy Institute’s latest analysis shows that most low-wage workers live in low-wage households, and 84% of the workers in low-wage jobs are at least 20 years old. But, regardless of age or need, anyone who shows up to work and puts in hard hours deserves a wage that keeps him or her out of poverty.

Finally, critics of raising the minimum wage often suggest raising the earned income tax credit instead. But that would simply perpetuate the cycle of devaluing work. It also takes money out of the pockets of taxpayers rather than from the businesses that benefit from the credit, creating, in effect, a federal subsidy for low-wage employers. A higher minimum wage would help ensure that the earned income tax credit works more effectively and efficiently.

Raising the minimum wage is about reducing inequality, but it is also about restoring the true value of work. Every American’s hard work should be rewarded.

Bipartisan group outlined proposals to overhaul immigration system they hope to pass this spring

Critics say a pathway to citizenship would amount to amnesty

President Obama delivers a major speech on immigration in Las Vegas

The selling of the bipartisan Senate immigration principles began in earnest Tuesday, as key GOP supporters John McCain and Marco Rubio fanned out on TV and radio to promote their proposal's merits.

Florida Sen. Rubio, a Tea Party favorite, appeared Tuesday afternoon on Rush Limbaugh's show, a day after the conservative talk show host criticized the bipartisan proposal as a form of amnesty.

""Things are often demagogued and described in a way that are not accurate,"" Rubio said on the syndicated radio program. ""I think the more people are aware about what we're for and what we're not for, the more empowered we are ... to make a better argument for our position versus theirs.""

A group of eight senators -- four Democrats and four Republicans -- on Monday announced they had reached agreement on four broad categories to be addressed in sweeping legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration system.

The principles include a path to citizenship, revamping the way immigrants come to the United States legally, boosting ways employers can verify the legal status of workers, and allowing more low-skill workers to come into the country. President Obama on Tuesday outlined his immigration proposal in a speech in Las Vegas.

McCain, R-Ariz., pushed back in CBS and MSNBC interviews on the idea that the proposal to create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the United States -- after border security is tightened and these migrants meet a strict set of conditions -- is not amnesty.

""Border enforcement and border security is a pre-requisite,"" McCain said on CBS This Morning. ""And obviously that makes sense since we don't want to have a repeat again some years from now of another group of people coming to this country illegally.""

McCain said a pathway to citizenship will be established for people already in the USA who have not committed crimes, pay fines and back taxes, and get in line behind those who have already applied legally for a green card.

""They will have to meet a lot of criteria,"" McCain said on CBS. ""I hope that as more Americans see this proposal that they will understand that we cannot have forever 11 million people living in the shadows in this country.""

Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a leading Democrat in the bipartisan group, said Tuesday on MSNBC that there is nothing ""easy"" in the proposed path to citizenship. ""There'll be some admission of wrongdoing. It is not amnesty in any sense of the word,"" Schumer said.

Rubio's appearance on Limbaugh's radio show could be critical. Limbaugh's syndicated show reaches millions of radio listeners, and the talk show host helps shape opinion among conservatives.

On Monday, as the senators unveiled their immigration principles, Limbaugh blasted the proposal and the idea that it is a way for Republicans to improve their standing with Latino voters.

""The Republican participation in this is taking place largely because they believe if they don't do it, they will never win the presidency again because they will never get Hispanic votes,"" Limbaugh said Monday.

Rubio said Tuesday that it is a ""false argument"" to characterize Republicans as anti-immigrant and anti-immigration. He stressed that legislation based on the Senate principles still needs to be written -- and he vowed he would not support the final product unless it contained border security and workplace enforcement ahead of a pathway to citizenship.

""If this bill does not have real triggers in there, if there is not language in this bill that guarantees that nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place, I won't support it,"" Rubio said.

Rubio also challenged the president to work with the bipartisan group of senators, and not advance an immigration plan that is politically to the left of the framework that has been outlined.

""He can either decide that he wants to be part of a solution, or he can decide if he wants to be part of a political issue and try to trigger a bidding war,"" the Florida senator said, vowing not to get caught in a fight ""to see who can come up with the most lenient path forward.""

After the interview with Rubio, Limbaugh heaped praise on the senator as a ""guy who does not fear talk radio."""

Before Becoming An Editor', 'She Was A Reporter Covering U.S. Economic Policy']",Congressional Republicans rush to develop plan to reopen government,"Congressional Republicans rushed late Friday to develop a new plan for reopening the government and avoiding a first-ever default in hopes of crafting a strategy that can win the support of the White House before financial markets open Monday.

Talks on Capitol Hill advanced with a new urgency after President Obama rejected House Speaker John A. Boehner’s (R) offer to raise the debt limit through late November to give the parties time to negotiate a broader budget deal.

Briefing reporters after financial markets closed for the week, White House press secretary Jay Carney praised a “new willingness” among Republicans to end the government shutdown — now in its 12th day — and to acknowledge that default on the national debt “would be catastrophically damaging.”

But with the Treasury Department due to exhaust its borrowing authority in just six days, Carney said the president would not agree to go through another round of economy-rattling talks in six weeks, just before the Christmas shopping season.

“It at least looks as if there’s a possibility of making some progress here,” Carney said. But, “we have to remove these demands for leverage essentially using the American people and the American economy.”

Where U.S. is feeling the shutdown

Read about people's experiences with the shutdown across the nation.

Before Carney spoke, Obama telephoned Boehner and the two men agreed to keep talking, aides said. Afterward, GOP senators marched into Boehner’s office and counseled him to adopt an approach they had presented to Obama earlier in the day, during their own meeting at the White House.

With Republicans getting battered in public opinion polls over the shutdown, Senate GOP leaders urged Boehner to join them in supporting a single, big-bang measure that would open the government and raise the debt limit in one fell swoop.

“I laid out some of those ideas, and the question is, can the House find a center of gravity to open the government up around those ideas,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said after exiting the speaker’s office with Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.). The two men, former House members, have been close friends with Boehner for almost 20 years.

Details were still fluid late Friday, but the latest 23-page draft of the emerging measure would immediately end the shutdown and fund federal agencies for six months at current spending levels. It would maintain deep automatic cuts known as the sequester, but give agency officials flexibility to decide where the cuts should fall.

In addition, the proposal would also raise the debt limit through Jan. 31, 2014. Lawmakers were considering whether to include a provision that would direct the House and Senate Budget committees to immediately enter negotiations over broader budget issues and to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2014. If an agreement could be reached, it would clear a path for another increase in the debt limit later that month, without additional drama.

In exchange, Republicans were seeking what they called a few “fig leafs” — minor adjustments to Obama’s new health-care initiative. The first would delay for two years a 2.3-percent tax on medical devices that is unpopular in both parties. The second would require internal auditors to ensure that people who get tax subsidies to buy health insurance are in fact eligible.

Another option under consideration but not included in the latest draft would reduce the number of workers required to receive health coverage from an employer, by changing the definition of a full-time worker from 30 hours a week to 40 hours a week.

In an interview with a Kentucky newspaper Friday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signaled that he was helping to shepherd the effort to reach a compromise with Democrats.

“We’re in one of those situations right now where it’s going to require some sort of coming together here to get past the current impasse. And I’m going to continue to work on that,” McConnell told the Herald-Leader of Lexington.

By late Friday, talks over the measure were proceeding on multiple tracks. In the Senate, negotiations had advanced far enough that Senate Republicans — led by Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — sent draft language to their Democratic counterparts, including Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), a trusted ally of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

Meanwhile, Boehner was huddled with his top lieutenants in a hideaway on the first floor of the Capitol, reviewing his options over Chinese carryout and cigarettes.

The Senate proposal differs in critical ways from the approach Boehner sold earlier this week to his rank and file, who had insisted on using the threat of the shutdown to try to undermine the Affordable Care Act.

Given those demands, Boehner had offered to lift the debt limit for six weeks to clear space for negotiations over overhauling the tax code, trimming federal entitlement spending and reforming the health care law. The government would remain shuttered unless Obama agreed to those talks.

House Republicans also proposed to roll back a portion of the sequester cuts, a top Democratic priority. But those cuts would have to be replaced with equal reductions to Medicare spending, such as Obama’s proposal to make well-off seniors pay more for coverage.

It was unclear how long the House offer would have kept the government open without further negotiations. But House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) quickly blasted the Senate plan to extend temporary funding for six months, calling it “disastrous.”

“It is a punt to the executive branch for the Congress not to exercise judgement about where money is spent,” Rogers said in a statement.

Boehner has scheduled a meeting of the entire GOP conference for 9 a.m. Saturday, but it was unclear whether he would present details of the proposal emerging in the Senate. Senate Republicans were hopeful that Boehner could build support for the plan and push it through the House first.

That could not only help get it to Obama’s desk faster, but also preserve Boehner’s political standing by avoiding a repeat of the New Year’s Day deal over the so-called “fiscal cliff.”

Then, a Senate-passed measure to stop scheduled tax hikes for the vast majority of Americans won the support of only 85 Republicans in the House. More than 150 GOP lawmakers opposed the bill, including some of Boehner’s top deputies, and the humiliating loss emboldened conservatives to vote against his re-election as speaker.

Senate Republicans cautioned, however, that Boehner doesn’t have much time to work things out. GOP senators are eager not only to get the government back to work but to raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit before Thursday, when the Treasury Department has said it would exhaust its ability to conserve cash. Without an increase in the debt limit, independent analysts say the Treasury would begin missing payments by Nov. 1.

GOP senators and aides said Boehner has been told that Senate Republicans will negotiate their own pact with Senate Democrats if he fails to act.

“From my point of view, it’d be better for the country if the House led,” Graham said. “It’s important that we continue to talk among ourselves as senators,” he added, but “if it came out of the House, it would be better.”

Even as negotiations progressed rapidly in the Senate, the uncertainty over procedure cast a shadow of doubt over their ultimate success.

“It’s encouraging to me that the president is now negotiating with both the House and the Senate, after saying that he wouldn’t,” Collins said. “But it is very uncertain to me what the outcome is going to be.”

Story highlights Some tense moments not long into the 21-hour speaking marathon; then Rubio showed up Cruz had mental breaks, but couldn't leave the Senate floor to use the restroom or eat Texas Republican put aside his Ostrich boots and wore sneakers; staff supplied speaking material Cruz drank ""very little water""; Other marathon Senate speeches featured colorful stories, too

(CNN) —

The critical moment for Sen. Ted Cruz and his allies came around 7 p.m. on Tuesday night.

The Texas Republican’s suit was still crisp, despite more than four hours into what would become a rhetorical marathon of more than 21 hours on the Senate floor aimed at derailing Obamacare.

But until that point, the brunt of the speaking had been done by Cruz and his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Without more help, Lee’s aides weren’t sure how long the effort could continue.

Then Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, arrived. It was a sign that they’d get the bodies they needed for the long haul.

“When he showed up, we had a feeling that we could go until noon (the next day),” said Lee spokesman Brian Phillips.

Lee was on or near the floor all night. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who held the floor for 12 hours in March, jumped in. Even ideological opponent Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, shouldered some speaking time while trying to refute Cruz’ points.

That gave Cruz some time for mental breaks even though he couldn’t leave the floor to eat, use the restroom or do anything else.

For material, staff pulled together binders of articles, talking points and documents that could be used to fill time. And as social networks heated up, aides ferried in a stream of tweets for Cruz to read.

Bryan Perry/CNN Facebook users mentioned 'Obamacare' 300,000 times in the U.S. and 360,000 times globally, according to data from the site. Here is a breakdown of those Facebook users.

But to the big and less comfortable question: How did he manage physically?

Good, pliable shoes, for a start. Cruz left his trademark Ostrich boots behind and told the chamber that he picked up some sneakers in preparation for the long hours of standing.

No food. Senate rules ban anyone from eating on the chamber floor. So that is easy.

Dehydration. CNN Senior Congressional Producer Ted Barrett asked Cruz how he stood for more than 21 hours without having to use the men’s room.

“Drinking very little water,” he replied.

That surely is part of it. But we do not know if anything else was involved, as has been the case in the past.

Bryan Perry/CNN 'Green Eggs' and Facebook users

The Senate’s marathon speech record-holder, the late Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, reportedly set up a bucket in the Senate cloakroom next to the chamber and used it while keeping one foot on the Senate floor, so as to retain his speaking position.

Former Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee used some kind of bag during his portion of a filibuster, according to an oral history from former parliamentarian Floyd Riddick. It did not end well.

“That’s always a defining issue, how much stamina a person has,” said Senate Historian Don Ritchie, who recorded the oral history with Riddick and says there is a tradition of senators using a contraption for bodily functions during speech-a-thons.

Cruz was on the Senate floor just 1 hour and 41 minutes short of a day.

“I don’t know of any special thing he used,” said Phillips. “And he didn’t indicate there was anything.”

Then he paused.

“That’s one of those things that is so personal that there are only a couple of people who know. And they will probably take it to their graves.”

Cruz’ office did not respond to CNN’s request for more details."

The little-known agency, the Community Relations Service, is described by the Justice Department as their ""peacemaker"" for community conflicts over race.

The protests last spring over Martin's death certainly qualified as such a conflict. But while the department claims its ""peacemaker"" agency does not ""take sides"" in such disputes, Judicial Watch said the documents and public accounts show otherwise.

""These documents detail the extraordinary intervention by the Justice Department in the pressure campaign leading to the prosecution of George Zimmerman,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said.

The documents the group received -- and has since published online -- show the CRS agency filing a series of expenses incurred during the late March and early April demonstrations.

One filing from late March recorded $674 in expenses for their deployment to Sanford, Fla., to ""work marches, demonstrations and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.""

That description could only apply to the Trayvon Martin killing, for which Zimmerman is currently on trial. The heated protests and national media attention helped build the pressure last year for Zimmeran's arrest -- he was not initially charged after claiming self-defense.

When reached for comment, DOJ spokesperson Dena Iverson said, ""The Community Relations Service was in Sanford, Florida fulfilling their mandated mission.""

A DOJ official also told Fox News that the unit was only in Sanford to support local efforts aimed at ""reducing tensions and the potential for violence.""

""For more than 49 years CRS has done significant work in a variety of conflicts, disputes, demonstrations and protests in communities across the country,"" the official said.

The filings by the Justice Department agency detailing their involvement are all similar. They mostly cite work on ""support"" and ""technical assistance"" for organizers and law enforcement agencies, as well as ""onsite mediation.""

Judicial Watch, in claiming the agency crossed a line by aiding the anti-Zimmerman events, points to an April 2012 article in the Orlando Sentinel.

That article detailed the role the CRS unit played during the protests. In one case, the Sentinel said they helped ""set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee.""

In another, the article said they arranged an escort for college students for a 40-mile march to ""demand justice."" One church leader was quoted as saying, ""They were there for us.""

But it's not clear from the article whether the unit's involvement crossed the line from mediation to advocacy. The article generally described their role as teaching civil-rights organizers how to manage crowds and easing tensions. An agency official said their goal was to ""build local capacity to deal with these issues.""

The Justice Department did not respond Wednesday to requests from Fox News for comment on the Judicial Watch documents.

The CRS unit was established under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

""For more than 45 years, CRS has been asked to provide its experienced mediators to help local communities resolve conflicts and disturbances relating to race, color, or national origin,"" the department says on its website.

“People immediately started making fun of me in their own way,” he said. ‘Why are you wasting your time? No. 1, most of them are illegal. And even if you get some to register, they never vote.’ ”

As he made inroads, Mr. Reid said he reminded Hispanics that the only way to gain political power was to vote. Through his efforts to encourage greater political participation, Mr. Reid said he developed deeper personal ties and a new affinity for the community as he regularly attended local festivals and Christmas and Cinco de Mayo celebrations.

“They were kind of fun,” he said of the events. “They had music and food and people were happy.”

When it came to the music, Mr. Reid saw a way to help. Never one to shy away from pushing an earmark through the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Reid in 2004 secured a $25,000 grant for Clark County schools in Las Vegas to begin a mariachi program. The federal spending was ridiculed by Citizens Against Government Waste as “La Pork-a-Racha,” but it was immensely popular with Hispanic students and their parents.

“That is one of the best things I have ever done in my political life,” said Mr. Reid, who still cannot help smiling about the earmark.

For Mr. Reid, the true test of growing Hispanic political might in Nevada came in 2010, when he was deemed to be in jeopardy of losing his seat.

With Nevada among the states with the highest concentration of unauthorized immigrants, Mr. Reid’s opponent, Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favorite, moved aggressively to undercut Mr. Reid on his immigration stance with ads and mailers that described him as “the best friend an illegal alien ever had.”"

Gary Brown's laughing and derision is offensive. Here's a partial transcript:





Fox 2 reporter Alexis Wiley: Did any of the customers get any notice that the power would be cut? Gary Brown: We did start calling our customers prior to taking them down and asking them to turn off air conditioners, but they weren't responding as fast as we would like them to so we had to send them a strong message by turning the power off. The 'message' has Judge Craig Strong fuming. Strong works at the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice, which was shut down on Monday after a prisoner knifed a Wayne County Sheriff's deputy to escape. The event started a man hunt that left many people in the downtown area stressed. Strong says,""We're in a building that's already on high alert after what happened on Monday, we don't need any more mistakes. If they we're going to do this they should have given us notice so we could plan around it."" Wiley to Brown: What do you say to the people who were stuck in elevators in 90-degrees? Brown: I say we're working very hard to get them out of the elevators. I've turned the power on the building we're standing in front of (City County Building) to get people out of the elevator. I made sure people got out of the City County Building, turning the power back on.

Of course, they wouldn't have had to work so hard to get the people out of the elevators if they had given them notice the power was being cut ahead of time so they could have avoided using them in the first place.

Gary Brown is a former Detroit City Council meeting who resigned when Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr offered him a job as Chief Compliance Officer and an increase in salary from $73,000 as a Council member to $225,000 as a member of Orr's staff. His patronizing attitude fits in perfectly with the attitude that has been displayed toward Detroit by the Snyder administration from Day One. Patriarchal officials treat Detroiters as if they are naughty children who deserve everything they have coming to them. That includes, it appears, the completely innocent citizens who were trapped when the power went off without any warning whatsoever.

Months later, instead of offering sympathy and promises of a full and fair investigation, Jean Quan made another stunning pronouncement. This time to Adam and Jeralyn Blueford, not long after their son had been executed by an Oakland Police Officer on May 6th, 2012. She said

""You're probably going to sue me, right?""

Now she's at it again.



Scott Olsen, the Occupy Oakland protester and Iraq War veteran who suffered brain injuries after police shot a tear gas canister at his head, says Oakland Mayor Jean told him he had ""a chip on his shoulder"" at the conclusion of Wednesday night's community meeting on public safety.



J.Quan told me she realizes I have a chip on my shoulder. Insulting, more like a broken skull and brain trauma. — Scott Olsen (@OlsenVet) March 7, 2013



The same Scott Olsen who received a quilt from Daily Kos peeps ? The Scott Olsen who selflessly helped stage a protest in support of Bradley Manning this summer ? The Scott Olsen who stood in peaceful protest beside his buddy on October 25th, 2011, nearly losing his life as a result of actions by Quan's thugs?Really?

Mayor, you are a pathetic, disgusting individual. No, you are below that. You are a sad excuse for a turd. No wonder 60% of Oakland residents say they disapprove of your job performance.

Here we see Mayor Quan in action, at said public safety meeting Wednesday last.

Scott Olsen, the person whose brutalization at the hands of her police outraged a nation and was partially responsible for sending 50,000+ people into the streets of Oakland on November 2nd, 2011, is asking a rather important question of Bob Wasserman. He's the man at the podium who is being paid $250,000 to ""solve"" the violence problem in Oakland.



Olsen... asked what sort of example it sends to the community when police are not prosecuted for crimes they allegedly commit.

Wasserman didn't answer the question. (No police officer has yet or likely will ever be indicted in the assault on Olsen).

Quan, shown in the background sitting next to the metal guide rail, is playing with her smartphone or tablet; she probably didn't even hear the question.

A government that a majority views as a threat is a government with legitimacy problems.

The more powerful the government becomes%2C the more people are willing to do in order to seize control.

When voters lose hope%2C a Constitutional Convention is the last stop before something far worse.

Americans are out of sorts, and increasingly they're unhappy with the government. According to a Pew poll released last week, more than half of Americans view government as a threat to their freedom.

And it's not just Republicans unhappy with Obama, or gun owners afraid that the government will take their guns: 38% of Democrats, and 45% of non-gun owners, see the government as a threat.

Add this to another recent poll in which only 22% of likely voters feel America's government has the ""consent of the governed,"" and you've got a pretty depressing picture -- and a recipe for potential trouble. Governments operate, to a degree, by force, but ultimately they depend on legitimacy. A government that a majority views as a threat, and that only a small minority sees as enjoying the consent of the governed, is a government with legitimacy problems.

I suspect that these issues also have something to do with the increasing bitterness and polarization of today's politics, but not the way you might think. As science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle wrote in 2008, ""We have always known that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom. It's worse now, because capture of government is so much more important than it once was. There was a time when there was enough freedom that it hardly mattered which brand of crooks ran government. That has not been true for a long time -- not during most of your lifetimes, and for much of mine -- and it will probably never be true again.""

That captures an important point. The more powerful the government becomes, the more people are willing to do in order to seize the prize, and the more afraid they become when someone else has control. So it was after the 2004 election when liberals talked revolution, and so again after 2012, when secession petitions flooded the White House.

There are two possible ways to address this problem. One is to elect people that everyone trusts. The problem with that is that there aren't any politicians that everyone trusts -- and, alas, if there were, the odds are good that such trust would turn out to be misplaced.

The other option is to place less power within the political sphere. The less power the government has, the less incentive for corruption, and the less that can go wrong when the government misbehaves. The problem with this approach is that the political class likes a powerful government -- it's one of the reasons that the Washington, DC, area, where much of the political class lives, is beginning to resemble the Capital City in The Hunger Games, prospering while the rest of the country suffers.

The political class usually gets its way, because it thinks about politics -- and its own position -- every waking moment, while the rest of America thinks about these things only in fits and starts, in between living everyday life. But if there's an upside to the increasing unhappiness that most Americans feel toward the political class, it's that maybe it means people are paying closer attention.

What's next? In my constitutional law class the other day, most of my students took the position that they would be unlikely to see a Constitutional Convention in their lifetimes. I'm not so sure. Last year I spoke at a Harvard Law School conference on holding a new Constitutional Convention, one which had participants from all sorts of ideological positions ranging from the Tea Party to the Occupy Wall Street movement. (People got along surprisingly well.)

In the American system, a Constitutional Convention -- which has never been held since the Constitution was adopted -- is the last stop before revolution. It was intended as a way for the people to end-run the political establishment; if enough states request a convention, Congress has no choice but to call it, and the resulting proposals go straight to the states for ratification, bypassing Congress. It's a way to make drastic changes when the political class has blocked smaller ones.

Are we there yet? I don't think so. But we're getting closer all the time. Political class, take note.

http://news.yahoo.com/state-fire-chief-got-550k-002911659.html,,[],State: Fire chief got $550K in extra pension money,"SEATTLE (AP) -- Auditors are seeking to collect more than $550,000 from DuPont after concluding Friday that improper reporting led to excess pension payments for the city's fire chief.

The Department of Retirement Systems concluded that the city should not have classified Fire Chief Greg Hull as an independent contractor when he was hired after retiring from a position at another fire department. Hull's pension payments would have stopped if he had been labeled as a regular employee, so the state is now seeking to have the city repay the extra $550,000 in retirement money he received over the last few years.

""We feel the city is responsible for that overpayment,"" said Dave Nelsen, the legal and legislative services manager at the Department of Retirement Systems. It's a substantial amount of money for the city, accounting for roughly one-third of DuPont's annual fire department budget.

State officials recently notified Hull that his pension payments would be stopped, and city leaders said this week that Hull is resigning for ""personal reasons."" Hull will be able to apply for pension payments again starting next month, Nelsen said.

The retirement system began examining DuPont's procedures after an Associated Press investigation showed how some firefighter and law enforcement workers got late pay raises that helped increase their pensions. At about $184,000 a year, Hull had one of the largest pensions in the state.

DRS officials were still reviewing details of a raise that Hull received shortly before he retired in 2010 from Lakewood Fire District 2 to determine whether that pay bump was improperly included in his pension calculations. Nelsen said Hull's pension will also be influenced because he will have more service credits for his years working in DuPont, but he will lose cost-of-living adjustments he had received over the same period.

Auditors also dinged DuPont for improperly classifying two other workers as contractors, and they are seeking to have the city pay $45,000 to the pension system for those workers.

DuPont has the option of appealing. The city wrote in a brief response to the final audit that it believed all three people were properly labeled as contractors.

Mayor Michael Grayum did not return a call seeking comment."

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Sen. Ted Cruz proving a talkative headache for GOP leaders,"Is there nobody who can tell Ted Cruz to shut up?

The young senator from Texas has been on the job for about 100 days, but he has already turned the Senate’s ancient seniority system upside down and is dominating his senior Republican colleagues. He’s speaking for them on immigration, guns and any other topic that tickles his fancy; Republican leaders are seething at being outshone yet are terrified of challenging him.

Consider his news conference this week to promote the Republican alternative to gun control. With Cruz on the stage in the Senate TV studio: the bill’s primary author, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a 32-year Senate veteran and longtime chairman or ranking member of the finance and judiciary committees; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina (10 years in the Senate and eight in the House); and Dan Coats of Indiana (12 years in the Senate and eight in the House).

But Cruz took over the lectern and refused to relinquish it. He spoke 2,924 words for the cameras, more than Grassley (904), Graham (1,376) and Coats (360) — combined. Factoring in his dramatic pauses to convey sincerity and deep thought, Cruz’s dominance was even more lopsided. The others shifted uncomfortably and looked awkwardly around the room. At one point, Graham requested a chance to speak. “Can I?” he asked Cruz.

Cruz is 42, the same age Joe McCarthy was when he amassed power in the Senate with his allegations of communist infiltration. Tail-gunner Ted debuted in the Senate this year with the insinuation that Chuck Hagel, now the defense secretary, may have been on the payroll of the North Koreans. Cruz also wrote in Politico that “Hagel’s nomination has been publicly celebrated by the Iranian government.” He later alleged that Democrats had told the Catholic Church to “change your religious beliefs or we’ll use our power in the federal government to shut down your charities and your hospitals.”

1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.

Now Cruz is turning his incendiary allegations against fellow Republicans. On immigration, he has described as amnesty the compromise that Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and three other Republicans negotiated with Democrats. Cruz said such a plan would make “a chump” of legal immigrants. On guns, he said the background checks Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) negotiated in a bipartisan compromise would lead to a national gun registry — an outcome the doomed proposal explicitly prohibited.

Democrats see a potential bogeyman in Cruz because of his outrageous pronouncements, and reporters love his inflammatory quotes. Republican leaders, however, don’t know how to control this monster they created.

GOP lawmakers encouraged the rise of the tea party, which now dominates Republican primaries and threatens the same leaders who nurtured it. Cruz’s fellow Texan, John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, could face a primary challenge next year and therefore can’t afford to cross Cruz, who beat an establishment Republican in the 2012 primary. Likewise, the Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is up for reelection and has to keep on the good side of tea party favorites such as Sen. Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, and Cruz.

I’ve argued before that Cruz is more cunning than ideological. He’s Ivy League-educated and a skilled debater who has perfected a look of faux earnestness that suggests his every pronouncement is the most important oration since Gettysburg. Cruz has correctly calculated that the way to power among Senate Republicans is through attention-grabbing accusations.

On immigration, his Latino credentials have helped him undermine Rubio’s bipartisanship. When Rubio made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows April 14, he was confronted with Cruz’s criticism by both NBC’s David Gregory and ABC’s Jon Karl.

On guns, Cruz’s high profile required Grassley to give the upstart a premium chunk of floor time for his trademark falsehoods. Cruz claimed that his bill was the “result of multiple hearings in the Judiciary Committee.” (It was never brought before the panel.) He claimed the opposing legislation would extend “background checks to private transactions between private individuals.” (The bill applied to only advertised sales.) Off the floor, he made the patently false claim that the “so-called ‘gun show loophole’ ” doesn’t exist.

If Republicans are willing to look the other way when Cruz assaults the facts, they may find it increasingly grating to endure his assaults on their dignity. At their news conference on guns, Grassley was made to stand silently for half an hour while Cruz gave an eight-minute opening statement (more than twice the length of Grassley’s) and fielded six questions before yielding to his senior colleague. “I’m just going to say one thing,” Grassley said, “and then I’m going to have to go.”

Thousands of Delta Sigma Theta sorority members descended on Washington for an annual convention. The sorority’s members including leading lights in the nation’s political, academic, business and entertainment sectors. Here are a few prominent Deltas.

President Obama has invited the president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority to the White House for a Tuesday afternoon meeting, ending months of hope and speculation by leaders of the nation’s largest African American sorority who have been gathered in Washington this past week for their 100th anniversary celebration.

White House spokesman Kevin Lewis confirmed that Obama will meet with Cynthia Butler-McIntyre. The conversation will come about two hours before an appearance at the convention by former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will speak during the second-to-last day of the convention, which has brought more than 40,000 members to the District.

Although sorority leaders said they are pleased that Obama will meet with Butler-McIntyre, many members had hoped that Obama would visit one of the largest conventions in D.C.’s history. Many members of the sorority expressed disappointment that neither the president nor first lady Michelle Obama would be making an official appearance.

On Monday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. spoke to the Deltas. In addition to talking about the recent Supreme Court ruling striking down parts of the Voting Rights Act, Holder spoke about the shooting of Trayvon Martin and subsequent trial and acquittal of the shooter, George Zimmerman.

“They suffered a pain that no parent should endure,” Holder said of Martin’s parents. Holder said the Justice Department has already launched an investigation as to whether or not Martin’s civil rights were violated.

The Rev. Al Sharpton and group of pastors from across the country held a news conference outside the Justice Department on Monday to announce that Florida will be the “battleground,” for a new civil rights movement.

The Deltas’ conference began last week and will continue through Wednesday. Events have included a step show, an ecumenical service, a social-action luncheon, a gospel concert and the dedication of a stained-glass window — depicting African American women — at Howard University’s Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel."

Looking like a winner!

President Obama, sick and tired of constantly being that 'adult in the room' and constantly giving things up to bullies and getting little to nothing in return, has turned a corner in his presidency. He's done with winning niceness points with schoolmarms and Miss Manners types. Now he's ready to kick some goddamn ass and by god he's doing it. Fuck being an adult in a room. Its time to be a politician in Washington.

Rightly, both morally and politically, President Obama has fixed himself in position and isn't moving or bending. He offers nothing. He commends nobody for doing their ordinary jobs. Republicans are surprised by his sudden burst of strength. So much so, they are backtracking, divided, and negotiating with themselves. Big business is scared. The GOP establishment is confused. Ted Cruz and the nutcase fringe that started all this have no idea how this ends. The one thing Republicans know is that they want out of this mess, in a way that isn't completely humiliating.

Let me be clear (as the President would say): The result will be humiliating. Republicans shutdown the government to stop ObamaCare. ObamaCare isn't stopped. They failed and that will be apparent just as soon as this ends. President Obama can bank this victory plus a few others: a divided, beaten GOP; a rump Speaker headed towards oblivion; and a perfect foil for the next six months, newly minted GOP leader Ted Cruz.

So, to finish this in a flourish, here is all President Obama needs to do next:

1. Throw the GOP a life jacket riddled with Smallpox.

No budget negotiations at all, but a minor concession would be appropriate. Something that includes a bit of a poison pill. My idea would be small corporate tax cut. They don't pay any taxes now anyway, so cutting them wouldn't cost us anything. But more importantly, it allows us to say that the GOP brought us to the brink of the default and shut down the government all on behalf of Big Corporations and Wall Street. That should be enough to allow a stupid face saving, piss off the Tea Party nutcases into turning on their own leadership, and get Big Business to keep some of their cash on the sidelines for a while.

2. Frame the reopening of the government and approval of the debt increase for the 2014 elections.

The last thing President Obama should do is give the kind of ridiculous speech he gave at the end of the 2011 mess. He was absolutely right to clear the decks among his senior staff after that fiasco. Instead, he should make it clear that this kind of governing can only be resolved by the American people next year. That only they can put a stop to this foolishness by throwing Republicans out. Repeat what he said the other day in Maryland: this is going to keep happening until the American people get rid of Republicans. He should offer absolutely no praise for Boehner or any of the Republicans who help re-open government. Instead, they should be told in no uncertain terms that the 2014 election begins NOW and their behavior is whats on the ballot.

Finally, I want to commend Washington Democrats and the White House for finally acting like a majority party that has the right to rule. When the Republican Party is down, you don't offer them the hand of the Good Samaratan. Instead, you see them lying in the gutter, you go ahead and kick them in the teeth and stomp repeatedly on their sternum. Then throw them a wet towelette and tell em 'Now clean yourself up.'"

Not going far enough for Texas Republican legislators.

The bill will also issue a $10,000 fine to any doctor who knowingly provides abortion services after 6 weeks, unless it is dubbed a medical emergency.

This subchapter is not enforceable until the 91st day after the date of publication in the Texas Register of a finding of fact made by the attorney general that:

(1) the United States Supreme Court has issued a decision overruling Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973);

(2) any other state or federal court has issued an order or judgment restoring, expanding, or clarifying the authority of states to wholly or partly prohibit or regulate abortion under the United States Constitution; or

(3) an amendment to the United States Constitution that restores, expands, or clarifies the authority of states to wholly or partly prohibit or regulate abortion has been adopted.

That didn't take long. The very same day that Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed a sweeping anti-abortion bill that would close most of the state's clinics, forcing many women to travel hundreds of miles for care, Republican legislators introduced an even more restrictive anti-abortion bill . The new bill would ban abortion from the moment something resembling a fetal heartbeat could be detected, usually at six weeks. It has teeth, too:Here's something to know about ""fetal heartbeat"":If passed—and there's limited time in the current special session of the Texas legislature to do that— the bill wouldn't go into effect right away:The big question there is what (2) means, because the Supreme Court overturning Roe is a very different thing than ""any other state or federal court"" saying a six-week ban is fine.

Regardless of whether this bill is passed and, if passed, when it would go into effect, it's clear that Texas Republicans are not done—closing most of the clinics in the state and banning abortion after 20 weeks was not enough for them when it comes to restricting women's right and access to abortion."

Immigration Divide Weighing the economic claims in the Congressional debate.

But 10 years is a short time when you consider that a vast majority of the new and newly legalized immigrants would be paying into the system during that period and drawing out their Social Security benefits later. That is the problem with attempts to determine the effect of immigration on Social Security in the long haul — every study is going to have some sort of end point, after which people who have paid in are going to start drawing out.

The Social Security Administration’s chief actuary, Stephen C. Goss, says he believes that even 75 years out, there will be a net gain from immigrants, as he wrote in May. That is because their withdrawals will be offset by their children’s contributions.

Such estimates are based on a lot of assumptions, says Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, like how many children the newcomers are likely to have (higher birth rates among immigrants taper off with time), how many are low-skilled versus high-skilled (low-skilled workers tend to cost the system more, while high-skilled workers pay in more than they get out) and just how many new immigrants are admitted under the bill, all of which are open questions.

“It’s amazing that the actuaries have said it would be positive in the long run,” Mr. Van de Water said. “It’s a lot of moving parts.”

Economists who have studied the issue tend to agree that more immigration is better, but that the effect is small. “There are other better reasons to be for or against more immigration, besides its effect on Social Security,” Mr. Van de Water said.

James P. Smith, an expert on labor markets at the RAND Corporation, added that it was misleading to consider the effect of immigration on Social Security alone. “Immigrants contribute on net to Social Security and health care,” he said. “They’re a drain on state and local budgets, largely because of education. So isolating one program is always a mistake.” (Again, it is hard to estimate the long-term effects even of a drain on education budgets because having more educated workers helps the economy.)

There are also two separate pools to consider — unauthorized immigrants who are here already, about a third of whom pay Social Security taxes, according to government estimates, and the additional immigrants who will arrive through new legal channels. The Center for American Progress, a supporter of immigration reform, says if 70 percent of illegal immigrants are eligible for legal status under the bill, they will contribute $500 billion on net in 36 years — the period that the baby boomers will put a strain on the system.

It does not include the period in which those immigrants themselves begin to draw more heavily on the system. But Adriana Kugler, a former chief economist at the Labor Department and the lead author of that study, said it did not take into account projections that an influx of immigrants would result in higher wages for everyone, nor did it calculate the contributions of offspring. “You could look at a longer horizon, but then the benefit is even greater,” she said.

Republicans have tried to clamp down on the amount that illegal immigrants who paid into the system will be able to withdraw. The Social Security Administration estimates that in 2010 illegal immigrants paid a net contribution of $12 billion, either by working under a fraudulent Social Security number or by using a legitimate Social Security number after overstaying a visa or otherwise losing permission to work. Currently, if such immigrants obtain legal status and can prove their earnings with pay stubs or W-2 forms, they can get credit for those contributions. But the Corker-Hoeven amendment to the Senate bill, which paved the way for passage, would bar them from getting credit for the previous decade’s worth of payments even if they obtain legal status.

“To some extent, it’s a taking by the federal government,” said Marielena Hincapié, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. “The people who are going to be most severely impacted by this are going to be low-income immigrants.”"

The new measure is one of an estimated 40,000 new laws, regulations and resolutions approved by state legislatures in 2013, many of which take effect Jan. 1. Among them:

• Arkansas voters must now show a photo ID at polling places, while Virginia voters for the first time will be able to register online.

• In Colorado, 16-year-olds will be able to pre-register to vote, but must still wait until they're 18 to vote.

• California students must be allowed to play school sports and use school bathrooms ""consistent with their gender identity,"" regardless of their birth identity.

• In Oregon, new mothers will now be able to take their placentas home from the hospital — some experts say ingesting it has positive health benefits. Another new state law bans smoking in motor vehicles when children are present.

Minimum-wage increases take effect in four northeastern states: Connecticut's rises to $8.70 an hour; New Jersey's to $8.25; and New York's and Rhode Island's to $8. In nine other states, the minimum wage rises automatically because it's indexed to inflation.

Perhaps most significantly, Colorado adults age 21 or older will be able on Wednesday to buy up to an ounce of marijuana for recreational use from a state-licensed retail store. Marijuana advocates expect many of the new stores to be up and running by then, and observers say the new Colorado regulations are a sign of things to come.

""I think state legislatures will be faced with the marijuana issue"" in 2014, says Jane Carroll Andrade, NCSL's spokeswoman.

In Washington state, regulators are combing through more than 2,000 applications for similar stores after voters approved a similar measure in 2012, says Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). He expects the first Washington stores to open in a few months.

""Other states are watching Colorado and Washington because it will continue to come up,"" Andrade says.

Armentano, who likens these developments to the state-led reversal of Prohibition in the 1930s, says a dozen states are due to debate marijuana legalization measures in the coming year or so. ""The genie's out of the bottle and it's simply not going back in.""

Many new state laws take effect 90 days after they're signed, but a few states, like California, Colorado, Illinois and Oregon, get extra attention this time of year because traditionally many laws in these states take effect on Jan. 1.

As a result, life changes a bit more radically for Illinois residents each new year: On Wednesday, in addition to the tanning measure, they'll find that they can now return a pet or be reimbursed for veterinary costs if an illness was not disclosed by the seller. So-called ""lemon pets"" laws already exist in 21 states, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Also in Illinois: Anyone who flicks a cigarette butt on a street or sidewalk could be fined at least $50 for littering; police must receive training on the psychological and physiological effects of stun guns, and penalties are now tougher for inciting a violent flash mob or riot via social media.

Illinois also becomes the 13th state to prohibit handheld cellphones while driving. Meanwhile, school districts on Jan. 1 will be able to install cameras on school buses to photograph drivers who pass them when buses are stopped. And school-based sex education must include information about both abstinence and contraception.

Illinois is also home to tough new laws prohibiting unmanned aerial drones. Come Wednesday, it'll be illegal to use a drone to interfere with hunters or fishermen — and police must get a warrant to use a drone for surveillance, except in cases of terrorism or if a suspect is fleeing a crime scene. Even with the warrant, police must destroy information gathered within 30 days unless it's linked to a crime, says Ed Yohnka of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois.

Lawmakers in both parties overwhelmingly passed the new surveillance prohibition, he says. ""They understood that it was something that could occur in the relatively near future, and so there was a desire to get on top of it.""

What's new Jan. 1

A sample of other state laws taking effect Jan. 1:

Colorado: Drivers will see a new annual $50 fee for plug-in electric cars. Colorado is one of several states looking to capture revenue from alternative fuel, electric and hybrid vehicles.•

Connecticut: New gun-control laws in the aftermath of the school shooting in Newtown include mandatory registration of all assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines bought before April 2013, and creation of a statewide registry that will track parolees whose crimes involved weapons.•

Delaware: Sale, possession or distribution of shark fins prohibited.•

Florida: Expanded early voting.•

Maine: Becomes the 48th state to require a check-off for organ donation on driver's licenses to promote organ donation.•

Oregon: Privately run websites that feature police mug shots must take down photos for free if subjects can show they were not guilty or that charges were dropped.•

Rhode Island: Becomes the eighth state to enact a so-called ""ban the box"" law that prohibits prospective employers from inquiring into an applicant's criminal history on written job applications.

“We’re not going to pay a ransom for America paying its bills,” President Obama said Tuesday, sticking to his demand that Congress pass a spending bill and raise the federal debt ceiling without conditions. “I’m not budging.”

Instead, Obama doubled down on his favorite metaphor for Republicans’ demands: the GOP as a band of terrorists.

He described their strategy as “hostage-taking” and “extortion.” Breaching the debt ceiling, he warned, would be “insane, catastrophic, chaos,” the fiscal equivalent of using a nuclear weapon. And he dismissed Republican proposals for a new “supercommittee” as a nonstarter unless the GOP reopened the government first.

In other words, the standoff over federal spending and the debt ceiling doesn’t look headed for a quick resolution.

There were sound reasons for the president’s over-the-top rhetoric. Substantively, he’s right about the debt ceiling; once Congress has voted to spend federal money, it has an obligation to allow the Treasury to pay the bills.

But Obama is also trying to solve a problem that’s partly his own fault. In 2011, the president negotiated with Republicans over a similar rise in the debt ceiling and agreed to a bargain that gave the GOP some of the spending cuts it demanded in return.

That deal taught Republican leaders that the debt ceiling could be used as leverage to win concessions on other issues. To borrow the president’s metaphor: In that case, terrorism worked.

Republicans would put it differently: They bargained hard, and Obama blinked. As recently as last week, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) was assuring colleagues that Obama would fold in this showdown, just as he did before. White House aides say one big reason for Obama’s adamancy this time is that he doesn’t want the precedent he set in 2011 — reluctantly, at the start of a presidential campaign — to become, well, an entitlement. And he needs to convince skeptical Republicans like Ryan that this time, he won’t negotiate.

There are tactical reasons as well that are pushing Obama to dig in his heels. For one thing, public opinion polls suggest he’s winning; more voters blame Republicans for the standoff than blame either congressional Democrats or the president. That may not last; if a debt ceiling crisis causes real economic harm, voters will blame everyone involved. But for the moment, it gives Obama added leverage, and he’s using it.

Pressure is rising from the business community too. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spent millions last year to support mostly Republican candidates, issued a statement Tuesday asking Congress to act quickly on the debt ceiling “to avoid inflicting substantial and enduring damage on the U.S. economy.”

Equally important, Republicans in Congress are divided, while Obama and his Democrats are uncharacteristically united. House Republicans have rolled out a series of changing (and steadily diminishing) demands, from defunding Obamacare to delaying its implementation to launching the Keystone XL oil pipeline to, well, anybody’s guess.

On Tuesday, when House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) made a new proposal for negotiations, he didn’t even try to describe what the GOP was hoping to win. “There’s nothing on the table, there’s nothing off the table,” Boehner said. He just wanted “to have a conversation.”

Meanwhile, several House and Senate Republicans said they’re ready to vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling with no conditions. The lesson for Obama is that the other side may be crumbling and the Democrats’ best course is to stand back and watch them crumble.

So how does the standoff end?

As Oct. 17 approaches — the date on which the Treasury says it will run low on cash — the pressure on both sides to stop playing chicken will increase. At that point, despite his uncompromising rhetoric, Obama may find it in his interest to negotiate with the same people he’s now calling hostage-takers — something almost every government does, even when it’s real terrorists they’re talking about.

The deal that’s negotiated is unlikely to satisfy the tea party. The president might, for instance, agree to a short-term increase in the debt ceiling in tandem with a commitment to negotiate later over long-term spending cuts.

And it also won’t solve the problem in the long run.

“We’ll kick the can down the road again,” a Republican strategist predicted — meaning a short-term spending bill and a short-term debt ceiling increase.

Both sides will claim victory; they always do. But the long-term problems of the federal budget won’t be solved, and the next round of the fiscal standoff will begin the next day.

President Obama wants the debt limit raised without conditions

The government will reach its borrowing authority between mid-February and early March

House Speaker John Boehner and the GOP are insisting on spending cuts in a budget plan

House Republicans said Friday they intend to extend the nation's borrowing authority for three months, but will not agree to a long-term increase on the debt limit until both chambers of Congress approve a budget.

President Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, said the White House is ""encouraged"" and repeated a call for an increase in the nation's borrowing authority without any restrictions.

A three-month extension would ensure the federal government does not default on its obligations. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congress the nation will reach its debt limit sometime between mid-February and early March.

A vote on the temporary debt limit extension will take place next week, the Associated Press reports.

At a House GOP closed-door retreat in Williamsburg, Va., Speaker John Boehner told lawmakers that they will insist members of Congress don't get paid until a budget is passed. Republicans are angry that the Democratic-controlled Senate has not passed a budget plan in four years.

""Before there is any long-term debt limit increase, a budget should be passed that cuts spending,"" Boehner said, according to excerpts of his remarks released by his office. ""We are going to pursue strategies that will obligate the Senate to finally join the House in confronting the government's spending problem. The principle is simple: no budget, no pay.""

House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California, the GOP's No. 3 leader, said the three-month extension will ""meet our immediate obligations and ensure a responsible budget passes both chambers of Congress.""

Obama has asked Congress to increase the debt limit without any conditions, as a way to calm financial markets. The fights over raising the debt limit and automatic spending cuts that take effect March 1 will be among the toughest facing Obama as he begins a second term.

""The president has made clear that Congress has only two options: pay the bills they have racked up, or fail to do so and put our nation into default,"" Carney said in a statement. ""We are encouraged that there are signs that congressional Republicans may back off their insistence on holding our economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare, education and programs middle-class families depend on.

""Congress must pay its bills and pass a clean debt limit increase without further delay,"" Carney said.

A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., also welcomed the overture on the debt limit.

""It is reassuring to see Republicans beginning to back off their threat to hold our economy hostage,"" said Adam Jentleson, Reid's spokesman. ""If the House can pass a clean debt ceiling increase to avoid default and allow the United States to meet its existing obligations, we will be happy to consider it.""

The House GOP retreat in Williamsburg concluded Friday."

The New York Times on Wednesday published an in-depth report detailing the move, as well as some of the behind-the-scenes tensions within the Clinton Foundation, which is about to accommodate the work and ambitions of all three members of the immediate Clinton family -- Bill, Hillary and their daughter Chelsea. It is also being renamed the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

The Times reports that Hillary Clinton plans to move her staff into offices at the foundation's Manhattan headquarters in the coming weeks. The new digs will be just blocks from most major news organizations, including across the street from NBC News, which gave daughter Chelsea a job and is planning to run a controversial miniseries on Hillary Clinton's life.

Clinton reportedly will focus on new initiatives covering women, jobs and other areas. The foundation, should she choose to run for president in 2016, would provide a high-profile perch for Clinton to stay in the public eye in the interim.

Among the staffers expected to move from Washington to New York are long-time aide Huma Abedin, wife of New York mayoral candidate and former congressman Anthony Weiner.

But the foundation itself is grappling with internal debates and problems concerning the group's finances and the role of long-time Clinton aides, the Times reports.

The foundation ran a $40 million deficit in 2007 and 2008. While some blamed the recession, it still ran a deficit of more than $8 million last year.

The Times reports that some in the organization have also raised concerns about the role of Clinton ally Douglas Band, who was helping run a consulting firm while also working on the Clinton Global Initiative. The firm and the Clintons' world reportedly were deeply intertwined, with Bill Clinton previously working as a paid adviser at the firm, while the firm brought in clients who also donated to the foundation.

The article also reported on tension regarding the prominent role in the foundation of Ira C. Magaziner. Band reportedly wanted Magaziner fired, but Bill Clinton refused."

Bush, who presided over one of the most tumultuous periods in modern American history. Among liberals, Bush is considered a uniquely awful president, having led the United States into the ill-fated invasion and occupation of Iraq and having passed into law deep tax cuts that contributed to America’s present-day fiscal crunch.

Conservatives are more conflicted. Some dismiss him as a big-government conservative who failed to heed the wisdom of Goldwater and Reagan. Others, including many who served in the Bush administration, believe that as time passes, he will be lauded for his achievements. The complicated truth is that for all his flaws, George W. Bush had a better understanding of the challenges facing Republicans than most Obama-era conservatives. His rocky tenure is best understood as a testament to how difficult it will be to modernize the GOP.

Many hero-worshipped Bush during the early days of the war on terror, seeing him as a humble Christian leader who was always willing to take the hard road rather than the easy one. But as the public turned against the Iraq War, and as his efforts on behalf of Social Security reform and immigration reform engendered a fierce political backlash, a growing number of conservatives came to see Bush as an apostate who expanded Medicare and the federal role in education while failing to roll back the growth of government. The Bush administration’s response to the 2008 financial crisis alienated conservatives even further, as the ominously named Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), engineered by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, struck many as a hardly-any-strings-attached Wall Street bailout. The Tea Party movement arose in no small part as a repudiation of Bush and his fitful efforts to transform the GOP.

Bush administration veterans, meanwhile, remain convinced that their president has gotten a bum rap. Keith Hennessey, who served as director of the National Economic Council during Bush’s second term, recently described Bush’s keen intelligence, and in doing so worked the former president’s liberal detractors into a frenzy. Among my friends and acquaintances who served in the Bush White House, the general view is that while Bush had solidly conservative instincts on domestic policy matters, he was hemmed in by the demands of the war on terror and the recalcitrance of Republican lawmakers. When the administration pressed for reform of Medicaid and, later on, changes in the way employer-sponsored health insurance would be treated in the tax code, congressional Republicans hardly ever gave him in inch. President Bush had little leverage, as he needed congressional Republicans to approve military spending and to defend his administration in the endless controversies over enemy combatants and surveillance that sapped its strength.

One of the ironies of the Bush presidency is that for all its failures, it was rooted in a clear-eyed diagnosis of the challenges facing Republicans. The end of the Cold War and the success of the Clinton-era Democrats’ centrism had badly undermined the GOP, which by the late 1990s risked irrelevance. Newt Gingrich’s efforts to shrink government were successfully countered by President Bill Clinton’s protean progressive centrism, and so George W. Bush, as governor of Texas, identified an alternative way forward.

During his first presidential run, Bush famously lambasted congressional Republicans for “balancing their budget on the backs of the poor,” and he touted his various efforts to raise literacy and math scores for black and Latino students in Texas. Bush recognized that Republicans needed to be seen not as opponents of government but rather as its reformers, and his moderation was essential to his razor-thin, hotly contested 2000 victory.

This is not to suggest that Bush had the right policy prescriptions all or even most of the time. There is a strong case that the Bush administration should have done much more to address the larger challenges facing less skilled workers.

Bush’s vision of an “ownership society,” which centered on increasing homeownership among low-income Americans, building on the work of his Democratic predecessor, seems in hindsight to have been ill-advised, particularly in the wake of the housing bust. Bush’s faith-based initiative, which aimed to empower religious organizations to take a bigger role in providing them, was always very limited in scope. The Bush-era tax cuts, arguably the centerpiece of the Bush domestic policy, were at best a mixed bag. The cuts in top marginal tax rates and capital gains may well have improved the incentives to work and invest at the top end, and the increase in the child tax credit benefited large numbers of middle-income families. But in the absence of a more ambitious overhaul of the tax code, it’s not clear that these gains were worth the loss of revenue.

Republicans would be wise to heed some of the political lessons of George W. Bush, positive and negative. The most obvious lesson is that the GOP won’t flourish unless it is seen as the defender of the economic interests of middle-income Americans. In 2000, Bush’s emphasis on K-12 education and tax relief was in tune with the voting public. By 2005, however, the Bush administration’s domestic policy was adrift, as it championed misbegotten, ill-explained Social Security reform just as defined benefit pensions were vanishing and middle-class squeeze became a national obsession.

And as James Capretta argues in “Recasting Conservative Economics”in the new issue ofNational Affairs, the right-of-center policy journal (where I am a contributing editor), Republicans need to tell a more compelling story about the Bush years and the 2008 financial crisis with which they will forever be associated. In 2012, it often seemed as though Mitt Romney had forgotten that Bush had ever been in office, and he struggled to articulate how and why his views differed from those of the former president.

The outlines of a compelling counternarrative of what went wrong during the crisis are emerging. One view, which has gained in popularity among right-of-center intellectuals but remains profoundly unpopular among the conservative rank-and-file, is that Senator John McCain was actually right to say that “the fundamentals of our economy are strong” in 2008 — the only problem was that the Federal Reserve failed to do enough to keep aggregate demand stable as the financial crisis took its toll. This has been dubbed a “market monetarist” interpretation of the Great Recession.

The conservative intelligentsia has also rallied around the position that the stability of the financial system can be attributed in part to the overreliance of America’s major financial institutions on debt rather than equity. Wall Street Republicans resist this interpretation, as more stringent equity requirements would reduce profits. Yet at least one prominent Republican lawmaker, Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, has joined forces with the populist Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio to push for much higher equity requirements for banks with assets of more than $400 billion, a measure that will tend to curb the size of the largest banks. The idea is that higher equity requirements will help cushion banks against losses, thus forestalling future taxpayer bailouts.

One can imagine a Republican party that embraces tough equity requirements and market monetarism in the name of preventing future financial crises and catastrophic economic downturns. One can also imagine a GOP that takes George W. Bush’s lead by at least trying to craft a compelling message for middle-income voters. But in 2013, over four years after Bush left office, the GOP still doesn’t know what to make of his legacy, and the result is a party and a movement that is very much adrift.

“Today’s ruling marks an important victory for Texas women and sends a clear message to lawmakers: It is unconstitutional for politicians to pass laws that take personal, private decisions away from women and their doctors,” said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

After Texas lawmakers approved the new restrictions this summer, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers challenged them in court, arguing that they unfairly limited medication-induced abortion and forced doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital near the abortion clinic where they work, in effect closing a third of clinics statewide.

Opponents did not challenge one of the most controversial provisions of the new law, which bans abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy and is still scheduled to take effect Tuesday.

The Texas attorney general’s office argued that the new provisions protected women and fetuses.

U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel said in his ruling that the admitting-privileges requirement violated the rights of doctors to do what they thought was best for patients. But the judge said restrictions on medication-induced abortions should stand “except when a physician finds such an abortion necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.”

Texas Atty. Gen. Greg Abbott, a Republican campaigning for governor, made no personal comment Monday, but a spokeswoman for his office, Lauren Bean, said the state had already filed an appeal of Yeakel’s ruling with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

“As everyone – including the trial court judge – has acknowledged, this is a matter that will ultimately be resolved by the appellate courts or the U.S. Supreme Court,” Bean said in a statement.

Heather Busby, executive director of Austin-based NARAL Pro Choice Texas, said opponents of the law were “very pleased” that the judge had ruled against the provision requiring admitting privileges.

“This is one of the most dangerous provisions of the law because it would have closed clinics, leaving 22,000 women without access to care,” Busby said, adding that she was “disappointed it wasn’t a more broad ruling.”

Busby said she hoped the appeals court would uphold the judge’s ruling limiting the law.

“Our hope is that the 5th Circuit will look at how other jurisdictions have ruled on this and how damaging it can be for women, and not put politics or personal beliefs before the law,” she said.

Similar admitting-privileges requirements were blocked as a result of challenges in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota and Wisconsin before they took effect. State courts in North Dakota and Oklahoma have struck down restrictions on medication abortion.

Mississippi passed a law similar to the Texas restrictions last year. It faced a similar legal challenge before a federal judge blocked the law pending a trial in March. Mississippi’s attorney general asked the 5th Circuit to lift a temporary stay and allow the law to be enforced in the interim, but the court refused.

In Texas, unlike Mississippi, the judge’s order is a final decision, meaning an appeal to the 5th Circuit would require a review on the legality of the law itself, not just an injunction to block it.

“We’re optimistic that they will share our opinion on this issue,” said Emily Horne, a legislative associate at Houston-based Texas Right to Life.

The proposed restrictions drew national attention this summer when state Sen. Wendy Davis staged a daylong filibuster in an attempt to block them in June. Davis, a Democrat, is also running for governor.

The filibuster forced Republican Gov. Rick Perry to call a second special legislative session, where the Republican-controlled Legislature eventually passed the law.

“Today’s decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life and ensure the women of our state aren’t exposed to any more of the abortion-mill horror stories that have made headlines recently,” Perry said in a statement Monday. “We will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly elected officials of our state, laws that reflect the will and values of Texans.”

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said he hoped the appeals court would uphold the state’s “reasonable” law.

“Texas passed common-sense legislation to protect the health of women and their unborn children. This law is constitutional and consistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent protecting the life and health of the mother and child,” the senator said in a statement.

[For the record, 5:26 p.m. Oct. 28: An earlier version of this post quoted Emily Horne as saying Yeakel had rejected a Texas law two years ago that required sonograms before abortions. Actually, that ruling came from a different federal judge, so the paragraph with the erroneous information has been deleted.]

Only a few days before the big gala concert, the Obama Administration claimed sequestration caused January’s anemic jobs numbers by cutting vital government services. However, the purportedly severe cutbacks of government spending didn’t stop the President from enjoying a night of stirring soul music during Tuesday’s program, titled In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul.

First Lady Michelle Obama kicked off the April 9 tribute to Soul with an hour-long, morning program held in the White House State Dining Room billed as a “guidance” on the night’s Memphis Soul performance. The event was held for students and music lovers and featured soul greats Sam Moore, Mavis Staples, Charlie Musselwhite, Ben Harper, and pop star Justin Timberlake as panel members taking questions from the audience.

Mrs. Obama opened the morning’s introductory program by discussing the importance of music in America today and urged the children in the audience to faithfully practice playing music.

“The only way for you to become the best musician you can be is to keep pushing through those moments when something doesn’t seem fun by spending hours in the practice room repeating those scales and drilling into that theory,” she said. “And if you do all that… you might become a better performer than you ever imagined.”

The First Lady went on to note that even if one doesn’t become a musician for a career choice, all that effort is still a worthy exercise.

“When I was young I played the piano, now as I try to remind my kids I regret the fact that I didn’t keep it up. I try to tell them that every single day,” she claimed.

The full concert was recorded later that evening and included performances by Alabama Shakes, William Bell, Steve Cropper, Al Green, Ben Harper, Queen Latifah, Cyndi Lauper, Joshua Ledet, Sam Moore, Charlie Musselwhite, Mavis Staples, and Justin Timberlake, with Booker T. Jones as music director and band leader.

During the night’s finale, the artists tried to get President Obama to join in the singing on stage, but the President rebuffed the offer.

Despite declining to sing, Barack and Michelle stayed on the stage during the finale, shaking hands, dancing, and clapping.

The concert was recorded for television, and In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul was broadcast Tuesday on PBS stations nationwide."

The allegations, first reported in The Times, surround the recruitment of Andrew Basham, a former defensive lineman at Lynnwood High in Washington, who signed a letter of intent with the Huskies in February but did not qualify academically to enroll.

Compliance officials from USC and Washington and possibly the NCAA are scheduled to meet Friday in Seattle with Mike Davis, who alleged that Tosh Lupoi, Washington’s defensive line coach, gave him $3,000 to cover private tutoring for Basham through a test preparation company. Davis also alleged that he received $1,500 from Lupoi to reimburse Basham’s father for online classes Andrew could use to raise his grade-point average.

Lupoi has denied violating NCAA rules in the recruitment of Basham.

USC Athletic Director Pat Haden was part of a working group that developed the NCAA’s four-tier penalty structure and head coach responsibilities that became effective Oct. 30, 2012.

The bylaws state that a head coach is presumed to be responsible for violations occurring within his program, unless the head coach can prove that he has promoted an atmosphere of compliance and monitored his staff. The penalties can include suspensions. Because the penalty structure is new and has yet to be testedwith a similar case, it is unclear how the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions would deal with a coach’s new school.

John Infante, a former compliance director at Loyola Marymount and Colorado State, said Thursday that if the allegations in this case were proved true, Sarkisian would need to show, “that he did enough in terms of promoting an atmosphere of compliance and that he monitored his program so that he should not be held responsible.”

Sarkisian is not coaching USC in the Las Vegas Bowl, but he attended the Trojans’ practice at a Las Vegas high school. Sarkisian reiterated to reporters that he “did everything to promote a compliant atmosphere” at Washington and would do the same at USC.

Asked if he was concerned that he could be penalized if the allegations regarding Lupoi were found to be true, Sarkisian said, “I don’t know if concerned is the right word. I know what I did on a daily basis and I know the environment that I promoted there every single day that I went to work there.

“If and or when … the NCAA wants to talk to me, I’ll feel confident in my ability to show, factually, the ability that I exhibited to promote that atmosphere. So I don’t know if concerned is the right word. But I will be prepared.”

Lupoi, who is part of a Washington staff preparing for the Dec. 27 Fight Hunger Bowl, posted a message to his Twitter feed Thursday that included the passage: “I won’t let these sorts of untrue attacks break my focus! I look forward to an honest & thorough investigation.”

Agents have also had to double up in patrol vehicles, or have been ordered to sit in their vehicles without driving. Several parts of the border, like one 25-mile stretch west of McAllen, are at times not being watched, so the number of migrants who cross from Mexico without getting caught is surging, too, three agents said in interviews last week.

“It’s really demoralizing because there’s so much traffic passing through here and we can’t do anything about it,” one agent said Friday while on patrol, asking that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “And when you try to do something and they won’t let you do it,” he added, having been ordered during recent shifts not to drive his truck, “it’s just really demoralizing.”

Corruption has also been a problem: two Homeland Security auditors, until recently based in McAllen, were indicted in April on charges that they falsified documents when they were supposed to be investigating a string of cases in which Border Patrol agents had been helping smuggle illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

Mike Salinas, an alderman in La Joya, Tex., a tiny city on the Rio Grande, said border agents there were frequently outnumbered. Last week, a single agent tried to round up a group of 20, most of whom he watched scatter and get away.

“People are just crossing without fear,” Mr. Salinas said, recalling crowds right in his backyard in recent weeks.

The holding cells at the McAllen Border Patrol station are often filled beyond capacity, and dozens of migrants are temporarily held in a truck garage. As many as 50 adults are detained for up to a week in a single holding area, with no shower, agents said."

For years the disturbing answer from the Obama administration and hard-line states like Arizona has been: absolutely. Each has tried in its own way to expand the role of local law enforcement in catching unauthorized immigrants and feeding the deportation pipeline.

But states and cities are rejecting the blurring of a once-bright line that separated local cops and federal immigration agents. They recognize that a broken immigration system has stranded many people outside the law, but know that many have lived here for years, with clean records and citizen children, and would be on track to become Americans if the legislation now stalled in Congress ever passes. Deporting millions of harmless people — current taxpayers, future citizens — is a misguided mission for the nation. For the local police, it’s a costly and dangerous diversion from their main job: preventing crime and catching criminals.

California and New Orleans are two places tackling this question, with encouraging results. New Orleans has just settled a lengthy court battle to rein in a sheriff who had turned his jail cells into long-term holding pens for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A bill now moving through the California Legislature would strictly limit the role of local law enforcement in feeding inmates to ICE. Serious criminals would still be turned over for deportation, but others in jail for minor offenses would not be held on ICE’s behalf.

The New Orleans case involves a civil rights lawsuit brought by two immigrant workers who served short sentences for minor crimes, then languished in prison for months waiting for ICE to pick them up. The sheriff of Orleans Parish, Marlin Gusman, complied with an ICE request to hold the men, Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo, over possible immigration violations. Such requests, called detainers, are supposed to have a time limit: ICE has 48 hours to take an inmate into custody. But Mr. Cacho was held for more than 160 days; Mr. Ocampo more than 90. There were no federal charges against either of them."

The House voted 231-192 on a bill that would delay much of the 2010 health care overhaul for a year. It would also repeal a tax on medical devices that helps finance the health care law.

The measure would allow employers and insurers to opt out of providing health care services that they find morally or religiously objectionable. The addition reignites the debate over a portion of the health care reform law that requires most insurers to cover women's preventative health care, including contraception. CNN reports that the provision would allow them to opt out of coverage for the next year.

A House Republican leadership aide confirmed to HuffPost that the provision was added into the one-year delay of Obamacare during a House Rules Committee meeting on Saturday evening.

Planned Parenthood Federation of America Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens called the move ""desperate, misguided, and extreme"" in a statement. ""The country wants Congress to focus on jobs and the economy, not on pushing an extreme agenda against birth control,"" said Laguens.

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) didn't know Republicans had added the provision into the bill, even as the House was already debating the rule for bringing it up.

""They did?"" Becerra asked, during a Saturday night interview with The Huffington Post. ""What part of their social agenda will they not stick into a budget bill?""

Becerra called it ""absurd"" that an abortion-related provision found its way into the bill at the last minute. ""We're less than three days from watching [Republicans] lead to a government shutdown. Now they want to reignite the war on women?"" he asked. ""It makes for theater, and that's what it is. If it weren't so serious, it would be hard not to laugh.""

The one-year delay passed by the House early Sunday faces almost certain failure in the Senate, which has objected to Republicans' attempt to use the government funding bill to delay implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

""Once again House Republicans have found a way to mount an ideological attack on women's health as the clock ticks down on a crisis they created,"" Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement Saturday night. ""This is part of the right-wing playbook that's going nowhere in the Senate. The truly unconscionable thing is that Republicans would try to rob women of access to health care while holding our economy hostage.""

Police say investigating as attempted murder and suicide

Investigators say %22altercation%22 at family home in western Virginia

Deeds in fair condition%3B Democrat had run for governor%2C attorney general

Virginia state police are investigating a stabbing attack on a prominent state senator as an attempted murder and suicide by his son, who died at the scene, an official said Tuesday.

Creigh Deeds, 55, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Virginia in 2009, was reported in fair condition after being hospitalized with stab wounds Tuesday.

His son Gus, 24, was dead of a gunshot wound at their home west of Charlottesville, state police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said.

Gus Deeds had undergone a mental health evaluation under an emergency custody order on Monday, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch interview with Dennis Cropper, executive director of the Rockbridge County Community Services Board.

The younger Deeds was released from Bath County Community Hospital because no psychiatric beds were available across a wide area of western Virginia, Cropper said.

""We're still piecing together the exact circumstances that led to the altercation,'' Geller said at an afternoon news conference in Charlottesville. ""Based on the evidence we have now, we are looking at this as an attempted murder and suicide.''

Geller declined to comment on the mental health aspects of the case, citing legal restrictions on disclosure of personal health matters and the investigation.

She said Deeds was stabbed numerous times in the head and torso but was alert and had given statements to authorities. She said police were not looking for other suspects.

Austin ""Gus'' Deeds was valedictorian of his 2007 class at Bath County High School and had been a student at College of William & Mary since 2007, though not continuously, and had recently withdrawn as a student, the college said in a statement.

""He withdrew from the college last month and was not currently enrolled at the time of his death. Our hearts go out to the entire Deeds family,'' the school's statement said said.

The Treatment Advocacy Center, a Virginia-based non-profit organization that seeks timely treatment of people with severe mental illness, said the Deeds case points to the need for more mental health treatment capacity. It said Virginia has only 15% of the mental illness treatment beds that it needs, based on population size.

""The elimination of hospital beds for people who are psychotic or otherwise need help in a crisis is a driving force behind a long list of terrible consequences, including preventable violent acts,"" said Doris A. Fuller, the center's executive director.

""If there had been a hospital bed available for Gus Deeds, he may be alive today, and his father would not be grievously wounded,'' she said.

Ron Manderscheid, executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors, told USA TODAY earlier this year that spending on public mental health has declined markedly in recent years, and in-patient hospital care is very hard to come by.

Few people, even with insurance, can afford to pay for residential psychiatric care on their own, Manderscheid said. Most families rely on publicly funded hospital care.

""It is virtually impossible to get mental health care for many people who desperately need it,"" Manderscheid said. He noted that one in three people with ""severe"" mental illness never receive any treatment at all. Two in three of those with ""moderate"" illness remain untreated, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Geller said troopers responded to an early-morning 911 call from Deeds' home in Millsboro, where they found his son alive but with a gunshot wound. He died at the scene, she said.

Authorities said Deeds left the home on foot after being stabbed and walked down the hill to Route 42, where he was spotted by his cousin, who was passing by. They went to the cousin's house to call 911. Deeds was then taken to the hospital by helicopter from a nearby farm.

Deeds had four children with his first wife, whom he divorced in 2010. He remarried in 2012.

The longtime state legislator ran unsuccessfully for attorney general in 2005.

In 2009, he defeated Terry McAuliffe for the Democratic nomination for governor in a three-way race, but lost to Bob McDonnell, the current Republican governor. McAuliffe recently won the race for governor as McDonnell's successor.

McDonnell issued a statement saying Virginians were united in prayer for the Deeds family ""in this tough and sad time.""

""The news from this morning is utterly heartbreaking,"" the governor said in his statement. ""Creigh Deeds is an exceptional and committed public servant who has always done what he believes is best for Virginia and who gives his all to public service. He cares deeply about Virginia, and the people of Virginia care deeply for him.""

McAuliffe, the governor-elect, tweeted: ""Dorothy and I are praying for the Deeds family at this difficult time.""

""Stunning news from Bath County,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a tweet. ""I am praying for @CreighDeeds and his family at this very, very difficult time.""

U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said in a tweet: ""Praying for Creigh Deeds and his family.""

Movie stars and athletes joined children in the festivities

This year%27s theme was a healthy one%2C in keeping with Michelle Obama%27s fight against obesity

The budget crunch led to canceling White House tours but not the annual egg roll

WASHINGTON -- For President Obama, the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday turned into one of those ""best of times, worst of times"" kinds of deals.

The best: Hanging out with the Easter Bunny.

The worst: Going only 2-of-22 on the basketball court.

Obama grimaced repeatedly as shot after shot clanged off the rim. Eventually, the president asked 10-year-old Kahron Campbell of Landover, Md., for help, and the boy made a layup.

""He couldn't make one,"" young Kahron later told reporters. ""I had to help him out.""

On a happier note, Obama got to introduce the Easter Bunny to thousands of children who gathered on the South Lawn for the 135th annual White House Easter Egg Roll. ""Give the Easter Bunny a big round of applause!"" the president told the crowd.

First lady Michelle Obama urged the children to have fun and ""run around,"" but also to learn something about nutrition and exercise, pursuant to the theme of this year's egg roll: ""Be Healthy, Be Active, Be You!""

""We want you guys to have a good time and keep moving and be healthy,"" the first lady said. ""And, kids, eat your vegetables, okay?""

Mascots with names like Colby Carrot and Erica Eggplant helped drive home the healthy eating message.

In addition to the traditional egg rolling and egg hunting, visitors could listen to music, dance at the ""Hop To It Stage,"" and learn sports from professional athletes.

More than 30,000 people from all 50 states and the District of Columbia -- winners of a special lottery -- swarmed the White House lawn throughout the day.

Among the guests: Relatives of children killed during the Dec. 14 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The White House did not provide names, citing privacy concerns.

The mother and brother of Hadiya Pendleton -- a 15-year-old killed by gunfire shortly after attending Obama inauguration ceremonies in Washington -- also attended the egg roll. Ten-year-old Nathaniel Pendleton, Jr., played tennis with Obama.

In her remarks to the crowd, Mrs. Obama noted that ""the Easter Egg Roll is the biggest event that we have here on the South Lawn of the White House each year.""

After a heavy morning fog gave way to bright sunshine, Obama congratulated his guests on bringing good weather, saying they did ""a great job sending a message upstairs.""

Both Obamas later cheered on groups of egg rollers, who were deploying some of 19,000 eggs provided for the event. The White House said 14,500 hard-boiled eggs were dyed for rolls and hunts, while 4,500 others were available for children to decorate.

Some special eggs made a bird chirping sound so that children with poor eyesight could participate.

Children at the White House Egg Roll could also listen to story readings -- including one from the president himself, accompanied by the family dog Bo.

Obama's selection: Chicka, Chicka, Boom Boom, a rhyming alphabet story involving the climbing of a tree. (""A told B/ and B told C/ ""I'll meet you at the top/ of the coconut tree."")

""If you know how to read, then the whole world opens to you,"" Obama told children who attended his performance.

The president then headed for the basketball court for his 2-of-22 performance.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Obama at one point visited the ""Kids' Kitchen,"" where Al Roker of the Today show helped chef Anne Burrell make a broccoli rabe pesto with spicy Italian sausage. Burrell said the dish reflected a balanced diet that included nuts, vegetables, dairy, and extra virgin olive oil.

Applying the taste test, Mrs. Obama said: ""Mmmm, it's good.""

In addition to the famous bunny, the event featured Robby Novak, who plays ""Kid President"" in a series of popular YouTube videos, and who introduced the first couple. Oscar-nominated actress Quvenzhane Wallis ( Beasts of the Southern Wild ) and muppets from Sesame Street also made appearances.

A number of sport stars worked with children in the ""Eggtivity Zone."" They included Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, NASCAR driver Danica Patrick and Washington Wizards point guard John Wall.

Some ticket recipients had worried that the egg roll might be canceled, either because of sequestration -- the series of automatic budget cuts that led to the cancellation of White House public tours -- or the threat of a government shutdown.

But Congress and the White House struck a short term budget deal last week, and Obama administration officials said the egg roll was never subject to the sequester.

The National Park Service, which organizes the event, says it's largely funded by sales of commemorative wooden eggs, as well as some private donations. The park service has not announced the full cost of the event."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/15/Obama-Constitution-flashback,2013-11-15 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],FLASHBACK: Obama: 'I Actually Respect The Constitution',"In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) attended a fundraiser where he blasted President Bush, telling the crowd, “I was a constitutional law professor, which means unlike the current president I actually respect the Constitution.” President Obama, however, has been far less respectful of the Constitution that Senator Obama purportedly was. In fact, Obama has steadily violated a bevy of Constitutional provisions ranging from separation of powers to specific elements of the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments.

This week, Obama unilaterally decided to tell insurance companies that they could now allow sale of plans in the individual insurance market that Obamacare had prevented, forcing five million Americans off the health plans they liked. As Ken Klukowski of Breitbart News has written, this is a violation of the Constitutional separation of powers:

Obama’s announcement is a flagrant and undeniable violation of his constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause. The provisions of Obamacare causing enormous trouble for insurance plans are mandatory, and only Congress can change those parts of the Affordable Care Act.

But President Obama has a history of violating the Constitutional balance of powers. As Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal has noted, he has unilaterally suspended enforcement of immigration law; he has refused to prosecute drug law violators; he simply stopped defending federal laws he didn’t like, like the Defense of Marriage Act, in court; he issues waivers on Obamacare and the No Child Left Behind Act; Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency has attempted to regulate carbon emissions when Congress didn’t push through a global warming bill; he appointed members of the National Labor Relations Board in violation of law; his administration rammed through an auto bailout that screwed bondholders, as well as a slush fund from British Petroleum. Strassel writes, “Mr. Obama came to office promising to deliver a new kind of politics. He did–his own, unilateral governance.”

President Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not extend to freedom of religion – his administration has forced religious businessowners to pay for insurance plans that cover activities in violation of religious precepts. It does not extend to freedom of speech – Obama has condemned exercises of speech he doesn’t like as violative of American principles (see, for example, the infamous YouTube video Obama said caused violence in the Middle East). It does not extend to equal protection under the laws – Obama has personally intervened in criminal cases like that of George Zimmerman.

Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not apply to protections against unreasonable search and seizure, as Obama’s deeply intrusive National Security Agency programs prove. It does not apply to Fifth Amendment protections against taking of private property. It does not apply to the Second Amendment, as Obama’s executive orders on guns show. And it most certainly does not extend to the Tenth Amendment, which protects states’ rights.

Obama has never respected the Constitution. In fact, he sees it as a barrier to his ambitions. That’s why, as a senior law lecturer at the University of Chicago, he lamented the fact that the Warren Court “never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth, and of more basic issues such as political and economic justice in society.” That’s why Obama repeatedly emphasizes that the Constitution stops him from doing things he wants to do — it’s an obstacle to be overcome, not the greatest governmental structure ever created.

He Has Covered The Supreme Court Since November']",Supreme Court to weigh in on Obama’s recess appointments,"The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will decide next term whether President Obama exceeded his constitutional authority by making appointments while the Senate was on break last year.

The case at hand involves Obama’s appointment of three members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), but the broader issue concerns the power that presidents throughout history have used to fill their administrations in the face of Senate opposition and inaction.

The justices will review a broad ruling by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that upset decades of understanding about the president’s recess appointment power. The court ruled that presidents may make recess appointments only between sessions of the Senate — they generally come at the end of each year — and not when senators take an intra-session break.

Recent presidents have made appointments during both kinds of recesses.

Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. said in a petition to the Supreme Court that the appeals court’s reading of the clause would “drastically curtail the scope of the president’s authority.”

In addition, the Supreme Court will consider a narrower question presented by the specifics of Obama’s January 2012 appointments: whether the president can make appointments when the Senate is holding pro forma sessions designed to thwart such action.

White House press secretary Jay Carney said that he was “confident” that the court will uphold Obama’s appointments and that “the issue here is about the president having the authority that all of his predecessors have had to make these recess appointments.”

Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the court’s decision to hear the case. “We warned last year that by appointing these members to the NLRB in such a controversial fashion, a cloud of uncertainty covered the agency and its work,” he said.

Obama has used the recess appointments power fairly modestly compared with recent predecessors. But he went where no other president had gone in his appointment of the three NLRB members and his appointment of Richard Cordray to head the fledgling Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Senators had gone home, but the Senate was holding pro forma sessions by convening with one senator every three days.

The White House justified appointing the NLRB members by reasoning that the Senate actually was in recess because it was not available to fulfill its advice-and-consent role by conducting business.

A challenge brought by a Pepsi bottler in the state of Washington and backed by the U.S. Chamber went to the D.C. Circuit. But in January, the unanimous panel skipped past the question of pro forma sessions for a far broader ruling.

D.C. Circuit Judge David B. Sentelle wrote that the administration’s interpretation of when recess appointments may be made would give the president “free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be a weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction.”

The ruling interpreted the Constitution’s directive that “the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate” to apply only between sessions of the Senate, not merely when the senators are on a break, even an extended one.

The panel gave great weight to the framers’ use of “the recess” rather than “a recess.”

In addition, the panel also voted 2 to 1 that the phrase “vacancies that may happen” means only those openings that arise during the recess, not those that already exist when the recess occurs.

The ruling cast doubt on hundreds of decisions the NLRB has made in the past year, including the enforcement of collective-bargaining agreements and rulings on the rights of workers to use social media.

The government and the challengers asked the Supreme Court to take the case to settle differing interpretations of the recess appointments clause.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit agreed this year that recess appointments could come only between sessions of the Senate.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit came out the other way in 2005, and the Supreme Court at the time declined to review the decision.

When the constitutional clause was written, it could take weeks for senators to get to the Capitol. But partisan gridlock has made the recess appointment an important modern tool for presidents who are trying to get their nominees past a recalcitrant Senate.

In asking the justices to take the case, Verrilli said presidents have made more than 500 appointments during inter-session recesses, including “three Cabinet secretaries, five Court of Appeals judges, 10 District Court judges, a director of central intelligence, a chairman of the Federal Reserve, numerous members of multi-member boards and holders of a variety of other critical government posts.”

The pro forma sessions were pioneered by Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) to thwart President George W. Bush’s nominees. Republican senators have used them during Obama’s terms in office and have filed a brief with the court saying justices should also consider the question of pro forma sessions that the D.C. Circuit bypassed.

“The president’s claimed authority to name principal federal officers without the Senate’s consent while the chamber has declared itself in session has no basis in the Constitution,” said the brief filed by all Republican senators.

The case is National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning."

The bodies of Christopher MacKenzie and Kevin Woyjeck will be transported to the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, where they will be met by family and firefighters wishing to pay respects.

“There are various traditions associated with the fire service. One of them is when they lose someone in the line of duty, everybody gathers around,” said Carroll Wills, communications director for the California Fire Foundation.

The plane, a National Guard C-130, is expected to land at 1 p.m. The event is open to the public.

Hearses will transport the remains of the two men from the base.

Cal Fire and the United States Forest Service will escort MacKenzie, 30, by way of a procession to a mortuary in his hometown of Hemet, according to a Cal Fire news release. MacKenzie is the son of retired Cal Fire Capt. Mike MacKenzie.

A memorial service in his honor will be held at 6 p.m. Saturday at the Ramona Bowl Ampitheater in Hemet.

The Los Angeles County Fire Department will escort Woyjeck, 21, to Long Beach, Wills said. Woyjeck’s father, Capt. Joe Woyjeck, serves with the department.

A memorial service for Woyjeck is being planned in Long Beach for July 19, said Inspector Anthony Akins, public information officer for the L.A. County Fire Department.

The families of MacKenzie and Woyjeck requested their sons be transported back as soon as possible, Wills said.

Three others on the team also hailed from California.

Sean Misner, 26, will be transported by ground later this week, Wills said.

FBI searches suspect%27s condo in Stamford%2C Conn.

She was let go from her job as a dental hygienist last year

The woman%27s 1-year-old daughter was taken into protective custody

The 34-year-old Connecticut woman who was shot and killed by police after a harrowing high-speed chase from the White House to Capitol Hill was delusional, believing that President Obama was communicating with her, law enforcement officials said Friday.

The officials, who have been briefed on the investigation, spoke to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation.

Miriam Carey, a dental hygienist from Stamford, Conn., was identified Friday by Washington, D.C., police as the driver of the black luxury sedan that first rammed a barrier at the White House, then sped to Capitol Hill, defying attempts by armed police to stop her Thursday afternoon.

She was shot and killed fleeing her car near the Hart Senate Office Building.

Police in Stamford spoke to Carey in December 2012 after receiving a call from her boyfriend, the law enforcement sources said. She told police then that she thought Obama was eavesdropping on her and the government was electronically monitoring her house. She said she thought she was a prophet, the sources said.

Investigators have been able to trace Carey's movements in the days before the car chase and shooting, said a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation but not allowed to speak publicly.

Carey appears to have taken a direct route from Connecticut to Washington on Thursday. Investigators used New Jersey highway toll records to in part help track her route.

A 1-year-old girl was in Carey's car, though she avoided serious injury and was taken into protective custody.

NBC4 News, quoting law enforcement authorities, also reported that there were indications that Carey thought Obama was stalking her. Carey's mother told ABC News that her daughter began suffering from postpartum depression after giving birth to her daughter last August. ""A few months later, she got sick,"" Idella Carey said. ""She was depressed. ... She was hospitalized.""

Idella Carey said her daughter had no history of violence and that she had no idea why she was in Washington.

Authorities who descended on Carey's condo in Stamford have not determined a motive for her bizarre behavior through downtown Washington, D.C.

Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, was briefed on the incident by the FBI and secret service.

McCaul said he was told that Miriam Carey had postpartum depression, an injury to her head and a family history of schizophrenia.

He said Carey's boyfriend reported to police that she had been violent on at least one occasion. The boyfriend was worried about Carey's mental state.

McCaul said law enforcement authorities told him that she had a stay in the mental hospital though he didn't know the details. He also said Carey thought that her apartment was under surveillance and that Obama was monitoring her.

""It's the tragic story of a woman with a history of mental illness,"" McCaul said.

He says authorities found an envelope with white powder at the door of her apartment that has slowed down the search of her apartment.

Miriam Carey's sister Amy Carey-Jones said late Friday that her sister ""seemed OK"" the last time they spoke more than a week ago, and there were no indications she was unstable.

A second sister, Valarie Carey, a retired New York City police officer, said police should not have used deadly force.

Valarie Carey said there was ""no need for a gun to be used.""

""That's impossible. She works, she holds a job,"" said Amy Carey. ""She wouldn't be in D.C. She was just in Connecticut two days ago, I spoke to her. ... I don't know what's happening. I can't answer any more.""

In Brooklyn, Freddie Perera, 71, a retired traveling salesman, has lived one door down from Amy Carey for four years and said he has seen Miriam Carey a few times while she was visiting.

""When she was here, she was normal,"" Perera said of Miriam Carey. ""They are a pretty nice family.""

The New York Daily Newsquoted Carey's former boss, dentist Brian Evans from Advanced Periodontics, in Hamden, Conn., as saying that she ""fell down some stairs and she had a pretty significant head injury"" in recent years.

Evans also said that Carey, who was let go last year, had a temper and became incensed over being told to quit parking in a handicapped spot at the medical building. That created friction between them, he said.

Another of Carey's bosses at Advanced Periodontics, dentist Barry Weiss, told NBC Connecticut that she was a bit ""headstrong"" on a few occasions but was otherwise ""an average employee.""

Weiss also that said Carey ""could be a bit rough,"" and after complaints from patients, was fired in August 2012.

""Nothing would have led us to think she would have done this,"" Weiss said.

Another former boss, dentist Steven Oken, for whom she worked eight years, described Carey as a ""non-political person"" who was ""always happy.""

A new Facebook page called ""In Love Memory of Miriam Carey"" features comments from people described as friends and acquaintances. One, purportedly from a former classmate, said Miram ""was really just a sweet and nurturing person.""

A note at the top from the creator of the page says: ""Folks — this is a community page for us to share our feelings on today's tragedy. Keep your politics and hate speech off this page. This is in memory of my friend.""

Court records also show that Carey was sued last year by her condo association for failure to pay fees since 2010 on the Stamford home she owned since 2009. The lawsuit, involving $1,759 plus collection costs, was settled in February, the Associated Press reports.

U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said the incident ""appears to be an isolated, singular matter, with, at this point, no nexus to terrorism.""

Two federal officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly, told USA TODAY that all shots were fired by law enforcement officers. One official said no gun was recovered from her car.

""This does not appear to be in any way an accident,"" Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said Thursday. She noted that Carey twice tried to breach security barriers and struck a uniformed Secret Service officer near the White House.

The chaotic events began at 2:12 p.m. ET when the driver rammed a temporary barrier at 15th and E Streets NW, hitting the officer, said Secret Service chief Ed Donovan. Other Secret Service officers chased the woman east on Pennsylvania Avenue but did not shoot.

Lanier said Capitol Police officers pursued the speeding car eastbound and tried to stop it in Garfield Circle, just west of the Capitol lawn. A 23-year-veteran officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries when he crashed into a barrier.

Police had the woman's car surrounded but she escaped, ramming a Secret Service vehicle as she fled. Lanier said police then fired their first shots at the suspect.

The driver made her way onto Constitution Avenue before eventually stopping in the 100 blocks of Maryland Avenue NE, near the Hart Senate Office Building.

During a hearing in Sacramento, several justices of the state high court indicated they were not convinced that Stephen Glass, 41, who concocted articles for the New Republic and other magazines in the mid-1990s, had shown enough evidence of rehabilitation to be permitted to practice law.

Justice Joyce L. Kennard spoke at length of articles that Glass had fabricated and the importance of honesty in the law.

Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye observed that Glass was involved in a “a depth of deception that was pretty sophisticated.”

Justice Marvin Baxter noted that Glass’ prior conduct was not an isolated incident, but a pattern “over a long period of time.”

Justice Ming W. Chin said Glass had benefited from his misconduct by earning money from a novel he wrote about his experience.

As the court’s leanings became increasingly clear, Glass appeared to slump in his chair. Dressed in a suit and tie, he was seated near the front of the ornate courtroom next to his fiancee. He declined to comment afterward and left the courthouse alone with his girlfriend, his hands in his pockets and his head down.

Glass wrote 42 magazine stories that were wholly or partially fabricated before he was caught in 1998. He was in his mid-20s. He made up phony notes, a fictional website, fake business cards and bogus voice-mail messages to try to cover up his fabrications.

After leaving journalism in disgrace, Glass graduated from Georgetown Law School and applied for admission to the New York bar but withdrew that application after learning he would be rejected on moral grounds. He eventually moved to California, settling in Los Angeles, and landed a job at a personal injury law firm.

The California bar denied Glass a law license in 2009, but a state bar court approved him for admission after a 10-day confidential bar trial. A bar committee in charge of admissions appealed, and a bar appeals court also ruled for him. The bar committee then asked the California Supreme Court to deny him a license.

The Supreme Court is to rule on Glass’ case within 90 days.

End presidential term limits

By Jonathan Zimmerman,

Jonathan Zimmerman is a professor of history and education at New York University. His books include “Small Wonder: The Little Red Schoolhouse in History and Memory.”

In 1947, Sen. Harley Kilgore (D-W.Va.) condemned a proposed constitutional amendment that would restrict presidents to two terms. “The executive’s effectiveness will be seriously impaired,” Kilgore argued on the Senate floor, “ as no one will obey and respect him if he knows that the executive cannot run again.”

I’ve been thinking about Kilgore’s comments as I watch President Obama, whose approval rating has dipped to 37 percent in CBS News polling — the lowest ever for him — during the troubled rollout of his health-care reform. Many of Obama’s fellow Democrats have distanced themselves from the reform and from the president. Even former president Bill Clinton has said that Americans should be allowed to keep the health insurance they have.

Or consider the reaction to the Iran nuclear deal. Regardless of his political approval ratings, Obama could expect Republican senators such as Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.) to attack the agreement. But if Obama could run again, would he be facing such fervent objections from Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.)?

Probably not. Democratic lawmakers would worry about provoking the wrath of a president who could be reelected. Thanks to term limits, though, they’ve got little to fear.

Nor does Obama have to fear the voters, which might be the scariest problem of all. If he chooses, he could simply ignore their will. And if the people wanted him to serve another term, why shouldn’t they be allowed to award him one?

That was the argument of our first president, who is often held up as the father of term limits. In fact, George Washington opposed them. “I can see no propriety in precluding ourselves from the service of any man who, in some great emergency, shall be deemed universally most capable of serving the public,” Washington wrote in a much-quoted letter to the Marquis de Lafayette.

Washington stepped down after two terms, establishing a pattern that would stand for more than a century. But he made clear that he was doing so because the young republic was on solid footing, not because his service should be limited in any way.

The first president to openly challenge the two-term tradition was Theodore Roosevelt, who ran for a third term as president in 1912 on the Bull Moose ticket. When he stepped down in 1908, Roosevelt pledged not to seek a third term; reminded of this promise in 1912, he said that he had meant he would not seek a “third consecutive term.” The New York Times called Roosevelt’s explanation a “pitiful sophistication,” and the voters sent Woodrow Wilson to the White House.

Only in 1940, amid what George Washington might have called a “great emergency,” did a president successfully stand for a third term. Citing the outbreak of war overseas and the Depression at home, Democrats renominated Franklin D. Roosevelt. They pegged him for a fourth time in 1944 despite his health problems, which were serious enough to send him to his grave the following year.

To Republicans, these developments echoed the fascist trends enveloping Europe. “You will be serving under an American totalitarian government before the long third term is finished,” warned Wendell Wilkie, Roosevelt’s opponent in 1940. Once the two-term tradition was broken, Wilkie added, nobody could put it back together. “If this principle dies, it will be dead forever,” he said.

That’s why the GOP moved to codify it in the Constitution in 1947, when a large Republican majority took over Congress. Ratified by the states in 1951, the 22nd Amendment was an “undisguised slap at the memory of Franklin D. Roosevelt,” wrote Clinton Rossiter, one of the era’s leading political scientists. It also reflected “a shocking lack of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the people,” Rossiter said.

He was right. Every Republican in Congress voted for the amendment, while its handful of Democratic supporters were mostly legislators who had broken with FDR and his New Deal. When they succeeded in limiting the presidency to two terms, they limited democracy itself.

“I think our people are to be safely trusted with their own destiny,” Sen. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) argued in 1947. “We do not need to protect the American people with a prohibition against a president whom they do not wish to elect; and if they wanted to elect him, have we the right to deny them the power?”

It’s time to put that power back where it belongs. When Ronald Reagan was serving his second term, some Republicans briefly floated the idea of removing term limits so he could run again. The effort went nowhere, but it was right on principle. Barack Obama should be allowed to stand for re election just as citizens should be allowed to vote for — or against — him. Anything less diminishes our leaders and ourselves.

Gary Brown's laughing and derision is offensive. Here's a partial transcript:





Fox 2 reporter Alexis Wiley: Did any of the customers get any notice that the power would be cut? Gary Brown: We did start calling our customers prior to taking them down and asking them to turn off air conditioners, but they weren't responding as fast as we would like them to so we had to send them a strong message by turning the power off. The 'message' has Judge Craig Strong fuming. Strong works at the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice, which was shut down on Monday after a prisoner knifed a Wayne County Sheriff's deputy to escape. The event started a man hunt that left many people in the downtown area stressed. Strong says,""We're in a building that's already on high alert after what happened on Monday, we don't need any more mistakes. If they we're going to do this they should have given us notice so we could plan around it."" Wiley to Brown: What do you say to the people who were stuck in elevators in 90-degrees? Brown: I say we're working very hard to get them out of the elevators. I've turned the power on the building we're standing in front of (City County Building) to get people out of the elevator. I made sure people got out of the City County Building, turning the power back on.

Of course, they wouldn't have had to work so hard to get the people out of the elevators if they had given them notice the power was being cut ahead of time so they could have avoided using them in the first place.

Gary Brown is a former Detroit City Council meeting who resigned when Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr offered him a job as Chief Compliance Officer and an increase in salary from $73,000 as a Council member to $225,000 as a member of Orr's staff. His patronizing attitude fits in perfectly with the attitude that has been displayed toward Detroit by the Snyder administration from Day One. Patriarchal officials treat Detroiters as if they are naughty children who deserve everything they have coming to them. That includes, it appears, the completely innocent citizens who were trapped when the power went off without any warning whatsoever.

I see no good coming from this approach. If Snyder, Orr, and Brown are trying to push Detroiters to and then over the edge, this is exactly the right approach. I'm just not so sure they should be hoping for that. It may come back to bite them."

But Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has often talked about his own cost-cutting credentials, was told on Wednesday that the state had been a bit too generous under his watch.

Over a 22-month period, New Jersey paid nearly $24 million in unemployment, welfare, pension and other benefits to 20,000 people who did not qualify for them because they were in prison, according to a report from the state comptroller released on Wednesday.

In one case, a former state employee collected more than $37,000 in pension benefits while in prison for the sexual assault of a minor. In another, a man began receiving unemployment benefits three months after he was imprisoned for illegal gun possession — despite a state law that requires people who receive benefits to be “available for work.”

The report blames “a lack of adequate internal controls” at state agencies. In most cases, the agencies that administer the benefits did not check the list of beneficiaries against available databases of county or state prisoners. Instead, the division of pensions and benefits said it relied on tipsters and newspapers to determine whether people receiving benefits had been sentenced to prison."

Seemingly always working — she has a book out next September — Ms. Gillibrand nonetheless leaves the office promptly at 5 every night to pick up her children from school. If there is a vote at that hour, she has developed a system to signal her aye or nay from a doorway off the Senate floor — where children are not permitted — so she can hold onto her 5-year-old’s hand. “She is ubiquitous,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, “and I mean that as a compliment. I don’t know how she does it.”

Some of Ms. Gillibrand’s Democratic colleagues are less enamored, likening her zeal to that of the Tea Party Republicans who hew to a belief and won’t let it go, ignoring some of the structural protocols of seniority.

“She is unwilling to knuckle under to demands for deference,” said Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School. “It is very rare that you see a relatively junior member of the Senate staking out a position and sticking by it.”

Ms. Gillibrand’s taste for a fight was presaged in her decision to run for the House in 2006, when she took on Representative John E. Sweeney in a Republican-rich district in upstate New York.

When she approached Howard Wolfson, a Democratic strategist, for help, he told her she could not win. “She told me she was going to run, was going to win, and I would either be the winning consultant or someone else would be,” he said. “I took the race.”

The campaign was one of the nastiest of the cycle, with a spate of negative ads that depicted Ms. Gillibrand as alternately dippy and a war profiteer for investing in war bonds, and ended with the release of a police report that detailed a domestic violence call made from Mr. Sweeney’s home. Ms. Gillibrand won over 50 percent of the vote. “She never wavered, never faltered,” Mr. Wolfson recalled."

[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""Whether it was a fertilizer plant in West, Texas or those folks in Boston, those innocent, innocent children who were mangled by a senseless act of terror, along with the adults who lost their lives and limbs,"" such deaths are tragic, he said at a dinner held by the Michigan Democratic Party.

After Newtown, he said the country was gripped by ""So much carnage, so much pain, so much uh – so much uh – asking of ourselves what's happened? What can we do about all of this?""

The killing there of 20 young students and six adults at the school led him to spearhead the Obama administration's gun control effort.

Biden also chastized the Republicans behind ballot access efforts last year.

""We're never going to yield to the will of the Republicans throughout this country who want to suppress ... the continued attempt to suppress the minority vote in this country, which is the single most un-American thing any party has done,"" he said. ""It is un-American to suppress the vote.

""And by the way coming out of the civil rights movement, you want to make sure folks vote, try to tell them they can't vote,"" he continued. ""Think of what it's become if you think the only way you can win is stop people from voting or making it harder."""

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Stockman steps forward as Republicans step back,"Rep. Steve Stockman’s moment as a viable Senate candidate lasted exactly 13 hours 47 minutes.

At 7 p.m. Monday, the far-right Stockman (R-Toxicity) announced via the right-wing Web site WND that he would challenge incumbent John Cornyn in the Texas Republican Senate primary. And for a brief period, it appeared that Stockman could pose a credible threat; his decision was immediately praised by the Tea Party Patriots and the Senate Conservatives Fund, founded by the Heritage Foundation’s Jim DeMint.

But then something unexpected happened: Sanity prevailed.

The Club for Growth, which started the trend of conservative primary challenges to incumbent Republicans, issued a statement just before 9 a.m. Tuesday saying that it was not on board with Stockman, the flamboyant lawmaker who distributed articles of impeachment against President Obama this fall and who tweets messages such as “Obamacare is less popular than chlamydia.”

“While Congressman Stockman has a pro-economic growth record, so does Senator Cornyn, as witnessed by his 87% lifetime Club for Growth score,” the group said, adding that “we do not expect to be involved in the Texas Senate race.”

Why liberals are panicked about Obamacare If Obamacare fails, “It will discredit Obama’s new liberalism for years to come.” By Charles Krauthammer Jessica Rinaldi/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue.

Matt Lewis, a highly regarded conservative writer with the Daily Caller, pronounced Stockman doomed. Conservatives were “in danger of throwing some babies out with the bath water,” Lewis said, and he praised the Club for Growth’s restraint in Texas as “leadership by example.”

It was one of many signs that the tea-party-driven purge of the GOP has begun to subside. Conservative activists still dominate the party and its processes, but their reign of terror may be easing. Consider:

Rep. Paul Ryan, a darling of the Republican conservative base and a likely 2016 presidential candidate, just reached a budget agreement with Democrats that would allow a modest increase in spending. Even the hint of a spending increase was enough to produce howls from Heritage Action this week before the deal was announced. The group, influential among activists and GOP lawmakers, issued a statement Monday that it “cannot support a budget deal that would increase spending in the near-term for promises of woefully inadequate long-term reductions.”

The agreement is nothing for either side to celebrate: Raising revenue through fees and gimmicks, it does nothing about the problems with entitlement programs, it doesn’t reform the tax code and it doesn’t even fully replace the automatic “sequestration” spending cuts. But what’s noteworthy is that the threats from conservatives didn’t deter Ryan.

At the same time, Senate Republicans are stepping up their efforts to help each other beat back primary challenges. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is going to battle against the Club for Growth and other conservative groups over a primary challenge to veteran Sen. Thad Cochran (Miss.). Roll Call reported that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has a primary challenger in Kentucky backed by some of the same groups, is holding a fundraiser this week for Cochran. (Historically, the committee has saved its money for general-election battles.)

Concern is also spreading on the right that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is planning to defy the tea party set on immigration reform. Reports in conservative media outlets say that the speaker is planning to hold off on immigration votes until after primary filing deadlines have passed. That way, lawmakers needn’t fear a challenge from somebody criticizing a vote for “amnesty.” A Boehner spokesman called the reports rumor, but some GOP lawmakers are hoping the speaker pursues just such a strategy.

Stockman, the would-be senator, must have thought he had gamed the system just right when he entered the primary battle against Cornyn on the last possible day. He seems to have calculated that his extreme views would automatically make him a contender, but it hasn’t turned out that way.

Nobody can out-conservative Stockman. The former street vagrant, on his second tour in Congress, has been known for inviting Ted Nugent to the State of the Union speech, for opposing Boehner’s reelection as House speaker (because of “betrayal of conservative principle”) and for his bumper sticker announcing, “If babies had guns they wouldn’t be aborted.” He launched his campaign Monday by criticizing the “liberal” Cornyn because the incumbent didn’t wholly support Sen. Ted Cruz’s brinkmanship over Obamacare.

But Cornyn, a former Texas attorney general, is no liberal; he notes with pride that National Journal ranked him the second-most conservative senator last year. The difference between incumbent and challenger is character: Cornyn has it, Stockman is one. That the Club for Growth can recognize the difference is reason for hope.

Logan, the founder of Decoration Day, later to be known as Memorial Day, is the fascinating tale of a man who was once a racist Democrat and later became one of the favorite generals of Ulysses S. Grant, an ardent Republican.

General Logan, who later became a senator from Illinois and was the Republican vice-presidential nominee on the ticket with James Blaine in 1884, was a member of the House of Representatives in the Legislature of Illinois in 1853.

Logan originally introduced a bill prohibiting “the immigration of free persons of color to the State of Illinois, or the setting free of slaves within the limits thereof.” It was passed in 1855, and the bill, with its supplementary enactments, became known as “The Black Laws.”

Elected as a Democratic Congressman in 1858 and 1860, during his second term Logan denounced “Black Republicans and Know-Nothings.” He later blamed radical abolitionists for John Brown’s attack on Harper’s Ferry in front of Congress:

Every fugitive slave that has been arrested in Illinois, or in any of the western States – and I call Illinois a western State, for I [am] ashamed longer to call it a northern State – has been made by Democrats. In Illinois the Democrats have all that work to do. You call it the dirty work of the Democratic Party to catch fugitive slaves for the southern people. We are willing to perform that dirty work. I do not consider it disgraceful to perform any work, dirty or not dirty, which is in accordance with the laws of the land and the Constitution of the country.

Yet this same man respected the Union and despised extremists on both sides. He said to those Southerners wanting to secede, “The election of Mr. Lincoln, deplorable as it may be, affords no justification or excuse for overthrowing the republic… We cannot stand silently by while the joint action of extremists are dragging us to ruin.”

At the start of the Civil War, Logan fought at Bull Run in a Michigan regiment, then resigned his congressional seat to become colonel of the 31st Illinois Volunteers. He would later serving under General Grant at the Battle of Belmont (where his horse was killed under him), was wounded at Fort Donelson, and then promoted to brigadier-general in March, 1862.

When Grant attacked Vicksburg, Logan was the commander of XVII Corps, the first to enter the city; when Vicksburg fell, he became the military governor.

Logan took over from General Sherman when Sherman left XV Corps and initially commanded the Army of the Tennessee at the battle of Atlanta in 1864. By the end of the war, Logan had become a radical Republican and was elected as a GOP congressman 1867. He would serve in the House until 1871, and then served as a Senator from 1871 until 1877 and again from 1879 to 1886.

While General Logan, who was known as Black Jack, was in Congress in 1868, he was still the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1868, (a position he held until 1871); on May 5, 1868, he sponsored General Order #11, which designated May 30, 1868, as a day of remembrance:

The 30th day of May, 1868, is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet church-yard in the land. In this observance no form of ceremony is prescribed, but posts and comrades will in their own way arrange such fitting services and testimonials of respect as circumstances may permit. We are organized, comrades, as our regulations tell us, for the purpose among other things, “of preserving and strengthening those kind and fraternal feelings which have bound together the soldiers, sailors, and marines who united to suppress the late rebellion.” What can aid more to assure this result than cherishing tenderly the memory of our heroic dead, who made their breasts a barricade between our country and its foes? Their soldier lives were the reveille of freedom to a race in chains, and their deaths the tattoo of rebellious tyranny in arms. We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance. All that the consecrated wealth and taste of the nation can add to their adornment and security is but a fitting tribute to the memory of her slain defenders. Let no wanton foot tread rudely on such hallowed grounds. Let pleasant paths invite the coming and going of reverent visitors and fond mourners. Let no vandalism of avarice or neglect, no ravages of time testify to the present or to the coming generations that we have forgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided republic. If our eyes grow dull, other hands slack, and other hearts cold in the solemn trust, ours shall keep it well as long as the light and warmth of life remain to us. Let us, then, at the time appointed gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above them with the choicest flowers of spring-time; let us raise above them the dear old flag they saved from dishonor; let us in this solemn presence renew our pledges to aid and assist those whom they have left among us a sacred charge upon a nation’s gratitude, the soldier’s and sailor’s widow and orphan. It is the purpose of the Commander-in-Chief to inaugurate this observance with the hope that it will be kept up from year to year, while a survivor of the war remains to honor the memory of his departed comrades. He earnestly desires the public press to lend its friendly aid in bringing to the notice of comrades in all parts of the country in time for simultaneous compliance therewith. Department commanders will use efforts to make this order effective. By order of JOHN A. LOGAN, Commander-in-Chief N.P. CHIPMAN, Adjutant General Official: WM. T. COLLINS, A.A.G.

Logan is one of three men mentioned in the Illinois State Song, along with Grant and Abraham Lincoln.

The resolution was introduced by Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, who claims Holder has committed “the offenses of lying to Congress, refusing to comply with a subpoena, and failing to fulfill his oath of office.”

Olson cites Holder’s unwillingness to cooperate during the investigation into the botched Operation “Fast and Furious, his refusal to prosecute those involved IRS targeting of conservative groups, his failure to enforce laws including the Defense of Marriage Act, and his “false testimony” about the DOJ’s monitoring of Fox News journalist James Rosen as articles that are grounds for impeachment.

“For nearly five years, Attorney General Holder has systematically deceived Congress and destroyed the credibility of the Justice Department in the eyes of the American people,” Olson said in a statement.

Olson was joined by 19 other Republican representatives in the resolution.

One House Democrat spoke out against the resolution before it was introduced Thursday, calling it “the most fundamental abuse of the impeachment power.”

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a former federal prosecutor who led the Senate in the impeachment of a federal judge in 2010, said the articles of impeachment in the resolution are simply a list of “debunked conspiracy theories.”

“It is the height of irresponsibility to use the Congress's power to impeach office holders – a power that has been used very rarely and judiciously – to settle political scores,” Schiff said. “The House Republican Leadership should disavow this misguided effort immediately; it is far more damaging to Congress and its impeachment authority than to anyone in the administration.”

The DOJ did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News."

""We will pledge to oppose, all eight of us, provisions that would destroy the fragile agreement that we have,"" Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the group, told reporters. ""But we're certainly open to amendments, we're certainly willing and glad to have votes on them. This is the beginning of the process, not the end.""

The so-called gang of eight -- McCain, Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) -- will release the result of its months-long effort, the full text of immigrant reform legislation, by the end of the day Tuesday.

Senators will begin to consider the bill during Judiciary Committee hearings on Friday and Monday, and members of the gang of eight have said they want to give their fellow lawmakers plenty of time to consider the bill and offer suggestions to improve it. But they also know their own agreement was hard won, and any tweaks could damage the balance.

""I want to make sure that we do this the right way, and what we have now is a starting point,"" Rubio told reporters. ""From that point, I encourage my other 92 colleagues to get involved and to offer ideas. I hope sincerely that those that have problems with it don't just offer objections but offer solutions.""

There are a number of compromises in the bill, with perhaps the most important over the question of border security and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill would allow undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and eventual citizenship, but that pathway is tied to specific border triggers meant to prevent future unauthorized immigration. This requirement is aimed to reassure lawmakers that the legislation won't be a repeat of a 1986 bill under President Ronald Reagan that was followed by an increase in the number of undocumented immigrants.

Legalization under the bill would begin with a new ""registered provisional immigrant status,"" that would allow some undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. before 2012 to stay and work without federal benefits, after a $500 fine and criminal background check. Then nothing can move forward until after certain ""triggers"" that guarantee a plan for and then the implementation of increased border security measures. The bill would put $3 billion toward that effort, and another $1.5 billion toward fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. If the triggers are met, immigrants would be able to apply for lawful permanent status 10 years after beginning the process, then eventually citizenship.

There are other controversial provisions as well. The bill would mandate E-Verify, an already existing system to check whether potential employees are eligible to work in the United States. It would eliminate the diversity visa lottery, which allows up to 55,000 people each year to immigrate to the U.S. without work or family ties. While the current legal immigration system places emphasis on family visas, the bill would shift to give half of all visas based on merit, USA Today reported.

For now, senators have mostly remained quiet on what amendments they plan to offer, particularly before the full text is released. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) hasn't yet made a decision, but may offer amendments to improve due process in immigration if in his view the bill doesn't adequately address the matter.

""They're all written,"" Coons spokesman Ian Koski said of the possible amendments. ""It's just a matter of seeing the final legislation and determining which are necessary.""

Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has previously said he will push for same-sex couples to be included in the bill, but as of Tuesday afternoon had not seen the final text of the bill to make a decision on amendments, his spokeswoman said. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who opposes mandating an employment verification system on civil liberty grounds, said he hadn't seen enough of the bill to know whether he'd oppose such provisions.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who opposes key parts of the bill such as a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, said he hasn't yet determined whether he'll try to amend the bill or just attempt to block it. He told reporters he thinks it's ""very possible"" it will fail, and that his concern about the lack of hearings isn't assuaged by the two planned so far, since they're planned for days when some senators will be out of town.

""That gives the indication we're going through the motion of hearings,"" Sessions said. ""And besides, it does appear that the core members of the gang of eight have sort of an agreement that they'll defend all the key provisions of the bill and vote against any amendment. So I don't know how valuable a hearing is if they all agree to stick together.""

The White House seems prepared to put its weight into helping the bill pass, which McCain said earlier would be ""very important, particularly with the Democrats.""

After meeting with McCain and Schumer, President Barack Obama said in a statement Tuesday the legislation does not include everything he wanted, but he will push for reform.

""This bill is clearly a compromise, and no one will get everything they wanted, including me,"" Obama said. ""But it is largely consistent with the principles that I have repeatedly laid out for comprehensive reform. ... I urge the Senate to quickly move this bill forward and, as I told Senators Schumer and McCain, I stand willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that comprehensive immigration reform becomes a reality as soon as possible.""

Even if the bill passes the Senate, it could be a non-starter in the House, where lawmakers are working on their own compromise for immigration reform. When asked whether he could imagine the House picking up the Senate's bill, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), one of those working on a deal, said they're more likely to do their own.

""The scenario would be assuming the Senate passes it, and I'm not sure the Senate can pass it,"" Labrador said. ""We'll just have to see what they do, we're going to have our own regular order, our own process."""

Designer Jason Wu just got doubly famous.

The man behind Michelle Obama's bridal-esque inaugural confection from four years ago returned to the White House inaugural stage — this time in ravishing red.

It was the first time a designer had scored a one-two punch since Nancy Reagan and James Galanos graced the balls in the 1980s. Some fashion watchers expressed surprise that the first lady didn't opt to pluck another unknown designer from obscurity and put them on the fashion map.

Baring her famous biceps, Obama chose a shimmery ruby halter gown cut from chiffon and velvet with a keyhole neckline, belted waist and plunging back. Her hair, straight for the swearing-in ceremony, was feathered slightly to the side. On her left wrist, a stack of sparkling bangles. On her finger, a diamond ring from Kimberly McDonald. On her feet, matching red satin Jimmy Choo pumps.

The dress was a modern departure from the frilly white one-shouldered gown she wore during the first inaugural. Speaking on CNN, Elle creative director Joe Zee called the ruby shade ""optimistic."" The last first lady to wear red to an inaugural ball was Laura Bush in Texan Michael Faircloth's design, for her husband's first term.

""Some may dispute the quality of our president, but nobody disputes the quality of our first lady,"" President Obama said by way of announcing his ""date.""

For the hours preceding the reveal, all of Twitter was asking, ""Where is it?"" After what seemed like an interminable drum roll of speeches and introductions at the Commander-in-Chief's Ball, the main event — the first lady — waltzed out to wild applause and into fashion history.

The reaction online was equally wild, with assessments of ""stunning"" and ""superb."" Posted Kate Betts, author of Everyday Icon: Michelle Obama and the Power of Style: ""I like it — sleek and still romantic, and powerful!"" As @deedeeindc put it: ""Waited all day. And the dress did not disappoint.""

Sure, tomato is on trend. But InStyle editor Ariel Foxman liked the ""elegant, eye-catching"" Wu repeat for loftier reasons. ""The first lady managed to quickly punctuate weeks of speculation and perhaps de-emphasize weeks of ongoing dress deliberation to come,"" he said. ""Mrs. Obama dressed the part but is able to move the conversation along, to focus on other matters that concern her, the president and the American people.""

Nevertheless, minutes after the unveiling, Wu's website crashed.

Since he exploded onto the style scene in 2009, thanks to Obama, Wu has dressed everyone from Target shoppers (his 2012 collection sold out in hours) to red carpet walkers (Diane Kruger, Reese Witherspoon, Zoe Saldana)."

Sheriff’s spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said the department’s investigation was ongoing and declined to comment on the specifics of the search warrants released this week.

But she reiterated previous comments from Sheriff Bill Gore, who said Hannah “was not a willing participant.”

“As Sheriff Gore said earlier in the week, Hannah is a victim in every sense of the word,” Caldwell said in an email. “Our follow-up investigation has not changed that sentence.”

The multistate search for the Lakeside teen began Aug. 4, when the bodies of her mother and 8-year-old brother were found in James DiMaggio’s burning home in eastern San Diego County. Hannah and DiMaggio were found six days later, in a remote stretch of Idaho backcountry about 75 miles north of Boise.

Hannah was rescued; authorities said DiMaggio was shot and killed by FBI agents.

The search warrants provided some insight into the investigation, including the communication between Hannah and DiMaggio. Letters from Hannah were among the items seized from his home, the documents showed, and investigators said the teen and DiMaggio “called each other approximately 13 times” before their cellphones were shut off about 4 p.m. Aug. 4.

The documents did not specify during what time period the calls occurred. They also did not detail what the letters -- along with a handwritten note that was seized from DiMaggio’s property -- said.

Investigators also collected duct tape and handcuff boxes from DiMaggio’s home, along with a Yosemite camping printout, cut electrical cords, model rocket containers and two used condoms, the documents said.

Computers, papers, photos and a journal were among the items seized from the Andersons’ Lakeside apartment, additional warrants showed.

Authorities allege DiMaggio set up a trap by asking the family to come to his home so he could say goodbye before he moved to Texas.

Christina Anderson’s body was found in a standalone garage, with blood near her head and a crowbar nearby, the warrants said. Her son’s body was later found burned in the home. Both had been “tortured and killed,” the documents noted.

The family’s “medium brown dog” was also found shot to death under a sleeping bag, the warrants said.

Investigators believe the fires were set separately, possibly with timing devices and accelerant, arson specialists said in seeking one of the search warrants. The one fire could not have migrated to the other location, they said.

Investigators later found incendiary devices and “arson wire” on the property, the documents revealed.

DiMaggio was so close a friend to the Anderson family that the children called him “Uncle Jim,” authorities said. One of the warrants noted he and Hannah had been on “multiple day trips,” most recently visiting Malibu and Hollywood.

Hannah, who was reunited with her father after her rescue, attended a fundraiser held on her behalf Thursday at a Lakeside restaurant. She did not speak to reporters as she walked inside, but her father said she “sends her love” and was “doing good day by day.”

Washington (CNN) - The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is releasing ""several hundred"" people out of detention facilities to other ""less costly"" forms of supervision because of pending forced budget cuts, the agency said on Tuesday.

Gillian Christensen, a customs enforcement spokeswoman, said the cases were reviewed over the past week as part of agency preparations for $85 billion government-wide cuts due to take effect on Friday absent congressional action to avert them.



""As fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE's current budget,"" she said in a statement.

""ICE has reviewed several hundred cases and placed these individuals on methods of supervision less costly than detention. All of these individuals remain in removal proceedings. Priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety,"" she said.

That move prompted an incredulous reaction from House Speaker John Boehner, who said on CBS the release of detainees was “outrageous.”

""This is very hard for me to believe, that they can't find cuts elsewhere in their agency,” Boehner said, adding: “I'm looking for more facts but I can't believe that they can't find the kind of savings they need out of that department short of letting criminals go free.""

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican and a vocal critic of President Barack Obama, called the move ""pure political posturing and the height of absurdity.""

Republican leaders have criticized Obama administration warnings as scare tactics, but also said the cuts would be bad policy and should be changed. Only rigid fiscal conservatives have backed the concept of mandatory deep spending cuts as a painful first step of deficit reduction.

Obama said on Tuesday in Newport News, Virginia, that the spending cuts are a ""self-inflicted wound"" that do not have to occur. He called on Congress to reach an agreement to avert the harshest impacts.

Separately on Tuesday, Attorney General Eric Holder warned the spending cuts, also called sequestration, would leave Americans ""less safe.""

""We'll do the best that we can to minimize the harm that actually occurs as a result of the sequestration, but the reality is there is going to be harm,"" Holder told the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington.

Holder had barely finished his remarks when the leading Republican on the committee that oversees the Justice Department sent Holder a sharply critical letter about the agency's plans.

Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, cited a recent Holder letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee outlining operational cuts in spending for the FBI and other agencies totaling about $1.6 billion.

Because of the implicit promise of bailouts, Moody’s Investors Service, the second-largest U.S. ratings company, has boosted the scores for the six banks. Each increase in credit grade makes borrowing less expensive.

In a March 27 report, Moody’s displays a bar chart of its credit ratings for the banks in blue. In green bars, it shows Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo would be rated two grades lower if the taxpayer backstop didn’t exist. Moody’s boosted Morgan Stanley’s score by two grades for the same reason, even though it had downgraded that bank in June 2012.

The scores for Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan (JPM) are three grades lower in the green bars.

Debt sold by the holding companies of Bank of America and Citigroup (C), the second- and third-biggest U.S. banks by assets, would fall to junk status without the implicit government guarantee, Moody’s Senior Vice President David Fanger says.

“They have a high probability of government support,” Fanger says."

The bill, signed Friday by Gov. Scott Walker, would require women to view an ultrasound of the fetus before an abortion. Providers would be required to point out the fetus’ features on the ultrasound.

In addition, doctors performing the procedure are required to have admitting privileges at a hospital within a 30-mile radius.

Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and Affiliated Medical Service, both opponents of the bill, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Madison to block the law from taking effect Monday, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported.

The American Civil Liberties Union also sued. Planned Parenthood has abortion clinics in Milwaukee, Madison and Appleton; Affiliated has one in Milwaukee, according to the Journal-Sentinel.

Abortion clinic operators say the bill would cut the number of clinics offering abortions in Wisconsin from four to two, and one of the remaining clinics would have to significantly cut back on operations, the newspaper reported.

Planned Parenthood contends the law puts an undue burden on a woman’s right to choose abortion. The Republican-majority Legislature passed the bill a month ago.

Other states have passed similar restrictions.

In April, Alabama approved a measure requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit, and a federal judge last month temporarily blocked the law.

In late March, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple signed a law outlawing abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, making that state the most restrictive in the nation. There is only one abortion clinic in North Dakota and it has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the law.

Three weeks earlier, Arkansas passed a law that bans most abortions after 12 weeks. A federal judge there has temporarily blocked that law.

And that same month, a federal judge struck down an Idaho law prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks, ruling that the so-called fetal pain law violates U.S. Supreme Court prohibitions against unduly impeding a woman’s ability to seek an abortion before her fetus is able to live outside the womb.

Rucker Also Is Co-Author Of', 'A Very Stable Genius', 'A No. New York Times Bestseller']",Obama grants pardons to 17 people for nonviolent offenses,"President Obama pardoned 17 people for nonviolent offenses Friday, a rare move that nearly doubled the number of pardons he has granted since taking office just over four years ago.

The individuals came from 13 states and were sentenced years if not decades ago for such minor federal offenses as falsely altering a U.S. money order, possessing an unregistered firearm, embezzling bank funds and acquiring food stamps without authorization.

Among those pardoned was a Massachusetts fishing magnate who pleaded guilty more than 20 years ago to laundering Canadian fish and selling them to the Defense Department as American fish.

Two Washington area residents were on the pardons list released Friday. Jamari Salleh of Alexandria, a former foreign service officer, had been sentenced for submitting phony lodging vouchers to the State Department. Robert Leroy Bebee of Rockville is an accomplished biotechnology inventor whose offense was concealing information about a felony.

The pardons, the first of Obama’s second term, are significant because this president so infrequently grants clemency.

Before Friday, Obama had granted 22 pardons; he had received petitions from 1,333 individuals, according to the data maintained by the Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney. He granted his first batch of pardons, totaling nine, in December 2010, and granted eight in May 2011 and five in November 2011.

By contrast, former president George W. Bush received 2,498 petitions and granted 189 pardons, while former president Bill Clinton received 2,001 petitions and granted 396 pardons, according to the data.

Dafna Linzer of ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news organization, reported last year that Obama has granted clemency at a lower rate than any modern president. Among the hundreds of people who have been denied pardons by Obama, Linzer reported, are a former brothel manager who helped the FBI bust a national prostitution ring and a retired sheriff who inadvertently helped a money launderer buy land.

Obama has come under criticism for not using more frequently his constitutional powers to pardon people for federal crimes. Some academics argue that the president could have more impact by pardoning younger people with more recent crimes.

“He’s not only being extremely stingy, but he’s giving pardons to people who arguably need them the very least,” said P.S. Ruckman Jr., a political scientist at Rock Valley College in Illinois who blogs about presidential pardons. “The people who need pardons are people in their 30s and 40s and 50s who are trying to get jobs and raise families.”

Jeffrey Crouch, a political science professor at American University, said the pardons announced Friday mirror those Obama granted in his first term.

“The president’s pattern has been pretty much to go for the safe route — look for older offenses, nonviolent offenses — and using the pardon power in some cases just enough to not be criticized for not using it at all,” said Crouch, author of “The Presidential Pardon Power.”

The White House on Friday offered no information about why Obama selected these 17 individuals for pardons other than that he believes they will lead productive lives.

“As he has in past years, the president granted these individuals clemency because they have demonstrated genuine remorse and a strong commitment to being law-abiding, productive citizens and active members of their communities,” White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said.

Among those pardoned was James A. Bordinaro, a former general manager of Empire Fish, who served 12 months in prison and paid a $55,000 fine for a scheme to illegally launder Canadian fish.

Bordinaro, of Gloucester, Mass., was among a half dozen New England fishing industry executives who pleaded guilty to such scams, according to a 1991 report by the Boston Globe. They were charged with falsifying documents in their contracts with the Department of Defense certifying that Canadian fish were caught by U.S. fishermen in U.S. waters, a requirement of government contracts, according to the Globe.

Last year, members of the Bordinaro family introduced Republican congressional candidate Richard Tisei at a fishing-themed campaign event at the docks in downtown Gloucester.

In Alexandria, meanwhile, Salleh’s federal conviction dates to 1989. Salleh was a career foreign service officer who was caught, and pleaded guilty to, submitting $7,650 in phony lodging vouchers to the State Department. She was given a three-year suspended sentence, placed on four years of probation, fined $5,000 and ordered to pay $5,900 restitution.

The State Department then tried to fire her. Salleh appealed to the Foreign Service Grievance Board, saying that her offense stemmed from her alcoholism, and she was reinstated, court records show. The State Department then turned to the federal courts to reverse the grievance board, but two courts upheld the board and Salleh continued to work for State for many years. Other people granted clemency faced similarly modest sentences. Alfor Sharkey, of Omaha, was sentenced for unauthorized acquisition of food stamps. Sharkey was given three years of probation with 100 hours of community service and $2,570 restitution.

http://news.yahoo.com/orleans-political-brawl-over-police-jail-135832235.html,,[],"In New Orleans, political brawl over police, jail","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A political brawl has broken out between the mayor and a sheriff who runs the city jail, which has come under scrutiny for a video showing inmates using drugs, drinking beer and handling a gun.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu asked a judge last Tuesday to take the extraordinary step of placing the jail under federal oversight, effectively wresting control of it away from Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman. Landrieu is upset over an agreement Gusman reached with the U.S. Justice Department to reform the jail, saying the city, which funds the jail, can't afford the potential expense.

""Stated simply, the person at the top is neither accountable, nor capable of exercising leadership skills,"" the city said in court documents that cited the video and the recent guilty pleas of two jail officials in a bid-rigging bribery case.

Landrieu is trying to reform the much-maligned police department and reached a widely heralded agreement with the Justice Department last year to clean up the agency. Now he's trying to back out of it in light of Gusman's separate agreement. Landrieu said the city was making changes but can't afford all the requirements outlined in the jail and the police agreements.

Gusman believes the city has consistently underfunded the jail and suggested race may be behind the attacks. The African-American sheriff recently told reporters that Landrieu, who is white, was employing ""Archie Bunker rhetoric,"" invoking the name of the fictional television bigot.

""They have to be looking at something different than just the record,"" Gusman told The New Orleans Tribune. ""And maybe they're looking at the person who's there. Maybe they're looking at — they don't like the way that person looks.""

Landrieu, a Democrat who carried a majority of the black vote in his 2010 election, has not directly responded to the remarks on race.

While the problems at the police department have been widely known, less publicized have been unsanitary, violent and dangerous jail conditions that have long been the subject of lawsuits and court orders. The extent of the dysfunction was driven home during a recent federal court hearing on the jail reform pact when videos, apparently made by inmates in 2009, were released.

Story continues

Shown to a stunned courtroom audience, one video showed inmates smoking, snorting and injecting drugs. Some drank beer, some had cellphones and one inmate ejected bullets from a handgun.

In another video, an inmate was seen wandering Bourbon Street and boasting, ""Y'all know I'm supposed to be in jail right now.""

Gusman, a Democrat who was first elected sheriff in 2004, has said the dilapidated building where the drug party and escape happened has since been closed. Two inmates who escaped, including the one seen on Bourbon Street, were arrested and prosecuted.

His sketchy memory of seeing the video in 2009, and his failure to involve state or federal authorities in the investigation, drew harsh criticism from jail consultants in court.

The agreement to make changes at the jail, known as a consent decree, would settle complaints the Southern Poverty Law Center filed on behalf of inmates. The agreement, which was signed by Gusman, is awaiting a judge's approval.

During the recent court hearing, though, Gusman downplayed problems at the jail.

""I think we're doing pretty good without the consent decree,"" Gusman said, adding that a jail building now under construction with help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be a major step in improving conditions.

How much the jail agreement will cost is in dispute and will be the subject of federal hearings in May.

The Landrieu administration, citing one estimate in a court filing, says it could add $22 million annually to the $30.5 million the city already turns over to Gusman to house roughly 1,600 city inmates. The costs would cover medical services, higher pay for deputies and a larger jail staff.

City officials questioned whether he really needs that much money.

""The jail consent decree has undermined our ability to move forward with the costs associated with the police consent decree,"" Landrieu spokesman Ryan Berni said.

The city budgeted about $7 million for this year to begin complying with terms of the changes in the police department, where decades of scandal include the shootings of unarmed civilians in the law-and-order meltdown after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

The police reforms could cost in the neighborhood of $50 million over the coming years. The big-ticket items so far include $1.4 million to begin equipping all patrol cars with cameras to better document police, $1.2 million for new computer equipment and $2 million for a monitor's office that will make sure the police are toeing the following the pact.

While the administration complained the sheriff has asked for excessive funding given a jail population that has been decreasing, Gusman has cited increasing medical costs and the need for more pay for overworked guards.

""The only person who is holding out in moving forward and doing the things we need to do is Mayor Landrieu,"" Gusman said in a news release after the city's latest court filing. ""It's disappointing."""

Meanwhile...

Like clockwork, The National Review chimed in with complaints about President Obama's description of Nazism.

President Obama issued a statement yesterday to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day. He noted that survivors who bore witness to ""the horrors of the cattle cars, ghettos, and concentration camps have witnessed humanity at its very worst and know too well the pain of losing loved ones to senseless violence."" [...] The idea that all violence is ""senseless"" violence is one that has taken deep root on the left; it’s also, unfortunately, one that poses a major impediment to understanding the world. Nazism may have been an ideology to which the United States was — and to which the president is — implacably opposed, but it is hardly ""senseless.""

And, in related news...

Idaho state Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll (R) compared the fate of insurance companies under Obamacare to that of Jews under the Nazis.

""The insurance companies are creating their own tombs. Much like the Jews boarding the trains to concentration camps, private insurers are used by the feds to put the system in place because the federal government has no way to set up the exchange. Based on legislation and the general process that is written toward this legislation, the federal government will want nothing to do with private insurance companies. The feds will have a national system of health insurance and they will eliminate the insurance companies.""

Paul Broun makes aggressive bid for stupidest shutdown claim,"My cat's breath smells like cat food.

“There was absolutely no reason, whatsoever, for this administration to block access to the World War Two Memorial or the Lincoln Memorial. It’s never ever been done in a government shutdown prior to this administration doing so.”

Look, Rep. Paul Broun, we've already decided that Texas Republican Louie Gohmert is America's Dumbest Congressman. You don't have to keep trying so hard There are at least two problems with this.

1. The Lincoln Memorial was indeed closed during a previous government shutdown in 1995. That one was also caused by Republicans trying to extract concessions from a Democratic president. Broun should remember it well, since he ran for Congress the following year. (He lost.)

2. The World War II Memorial was completed in 2004, and so did not exist during any previous shutdowns. While this renders Broun's statement technically true, it is true in the same way as saying ""Abraham Lincoln never dined at Chipotle"" is true. Neither statement makes a particularly intriguing point.

Paul Broun is running for the U.S. Senate this time around, possibly because Paul Broun has been running for things for over 20 years and is bored with being a mere congressman. He is also known for being the congressman who thinks evolution, embryology and the Big Bang Theory are lies from the pit of Hell. Observing that monuments were never closed during time periods in which they did not exist is precisely the level of insight Mr. Broun typically brings to conversations; observing things that are flatly and provably untrue is just the usual conservative model for pandering to the base."

Apparently Boehner didn't want to let these guys near the White House

So here's the story: President Obama is inviting members of the House and Senate from both parties to meetings at the White House this week. His goal: To encourage Congress to end the government shutdown and avoid a debt limit default.

The president is starting his meetings today, meeting with the full House Democratic caucus. But when he invited House Republicans they couldn't bring themselves to accept his offer without twisting themselves into a knot:



Boehner's office said Wednesday that the GOP leader would send a small group to Obama's meeting Thursday, but not the full invited caucus. Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said the meeting was only worthwhile if it was focused on finding a solution. So Buck said only the elected leadership and select committee chairmen will attend - 18 lawmakers out of the 232 invited

If you're like most people, you're probably shaking your head at the fact that Boehner rejected a full conference meeting just one day after claiming that the GOP had only shut the government down because Obama won't even talk to them.

But you should really try tearing a page from the ""Both sides do it"" playbook and hail Boehner for agreeing to give Obama a substantial portion of what Obama requested: 18 of the 232 invited member of Congress. That's almost 8 percent of what Obama had asked—7.7 percent, to be precise. In non-numerical terms, that's an unprecedented concession. Surely, the president should reciprocate by accepting House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's plan to end Medicare as we know it, right?



@markknoller WH says Pres Obama is ""disappointed"" that only a small group of House Republicans will attend shutdown/default meeting tomorrow at WH.

Here's a list of who will attend the meeting. Lankford is the biggest tea partier among them."
