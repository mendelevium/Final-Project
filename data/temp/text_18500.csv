In certain corners of the foreign policy community, two theories in particular have developed. The first is that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice was promised the position of secretary of state only to have it taken away under the weight of Republican opposition. The second is that Obama never actually considered Rice for the post, instead, having her name floated to divert fire for his preferred choice, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).

The former theory is regarded as more plausible than the latter. But the latter still has its believers. Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, pushed the theory in a blog post published on The Huffington Post on Tuesday arguing that former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod admitted that Rice was never considered during a recent interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe.

It is possible that Axelrod saw his remarks as a way to protect the president from any lingering criticism over his handling of the Rice issue. There had, after all, been some undercurrent of discontent among women's groups who were upset over Rice's public humiliation. Also, the very visible scuttling of Rice did suggest to many observers that, despite Obama's reelection, Obama was once again showing how he caves into Republicans under a barrage of partisan attacks.

But Axelrod never actually said that Obama didn't consider Rice for Foggy Bottom; in fact, in interviews during the process and as recently as today, he has said that Rice was very much in the mix. As he recounts, Obama surveyed a number of possible candidates, including Rice. He never came to a decision on who to appoint until he ultimately chose Kerry. The attacks on the U.N. ambassador over her role in disseminating talking points about the consulate attack in Benghazi factored into the administration's thinking. But they weren't disqualifying. If anything, Axelrod said, they made the president more sympathetic towards choosing her.

""There is a myth that has grown up that the president was run off from choosing her,"" Axelrod told The Huffington Post Tuesday. ""That just wasn't true. She was highly regarded and considered for the post.""

""So far as my conversations with him and everything I know, he had never made a decision on that particular appointment and it is a misstatement of history to suggest he had chosen her or never considered her,"" he added. ""Kerry always was a strong candidate for that position.""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/31/Copperheads-The-Jacksonian-Sword-of-Lincoln,2013-08-31 00:00:00,[],Copperheads: The 'Jacksonian' Sword of Lincoln,"One of the most important undercurrents of the Civil War was the role the strong Democratic minority played in criticizing Lincoln’s Republican administration, the Radical Republican Congress, and the war effort in general. But Democrats did not provide a united front or bulwark of opposition to the government and the Union cause, rather far from it.

In fact, it was in large part the contentious, but ultimately loyal, Democratic opposition that put pressure on Republican President Abraham Lincoln and his administration to succeed and make wise military and political decisions. Dissent was an important factor, but ultimate loyalty to the broken nation and the Union cause was the highest form of patriotism.

While some Democrats focused on the perceived civil rights abuses of the administration, others became the most militant flag-wavers, joining the military en masse. These “Jacksonian” Democrats saw the confrontation between the Union and the Confederacy as a battle between “patriots and traitors,” as Illinois Democrat and famous Lincoln debate partner Stephen A. Douglas said just before the war. Staunch and enduring patriotism was at the heart of the 19th century Jacksonian creed.

Gods and Generals director Ron Maxwell explores some of the Northern Democrat opposition in his new movie, Copperheads. Copperheads were generally the “peace” democrats during the war who were highly suspicious of the cause, but the movie’s lead character, an upstate New Yorker named Abner Beech, is not among their number. He is more closely aligned with the Jacksonians, as were many of the country-dwelling folks of that period.

The film explores how the war was a battle for the American soul, a soul that remained very much divided during and after the war.

Notable antebellum America historian Eric McKitrick explained in Political Parties in American History: 1828-1890 how this energetic opposition, instead of weakening the Union, gave it an edge over the one-party rule of the Confederacy. McKitrick said, “…the presence of an organized party of opposition, performed a variety of functions in mobilizing and managing the energies needed for sustaining the Union war effort.”

McKitrick continued, “The absence of such a system in the Confederacy seems to have more than a casual bearing on the process whereby Southern energies, over and beyond the course of military events, became diffused and dissipated.”

The collapse of the Whig Party in the 1850s, initiated by the Compromise of 1850 and made complete by the ruinous Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, is well-known, but the disintegration of the Democratic Party had equally profound consequences for the Union.

In the period just before the war, there was a massive upheaval in party politics, devastating the old battle lines between the Democrats and the Whigs. Former free-state Whigs and Democrats started to band together under the “Republican” banner in general opposition to the slave states, or the “Slave Power” as some called it. Early Republican Party formation started in the West where party ties were weakest and spread to the more calcified East.

Old fights over economics and the size and scope of government moved to the sidelines as the Union neared complete dissolution.

For instance, the famous editor of the New York Tribune and former Whig turned staunch anti-slavery Republican, Horace Greeley, actually tried to enlist Abraham Lincoln’s future rival, Stephen A. Douglas, in the Republican cause to run for Illinois senator in 1858.

Douglas declined, but like many of the other Jacksonian Democrats, when he realized that pro-slavery forces had been unleashed and that America was rapidly becoming a slave republic, he responded with brutal, militant ferocity. As pro-slavery radicals like George Fitzhugh of Virginia were advocating slavery for 19 out of 20 people, black and white, and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision essentially made slavery legal everywhere, many like Douglas began to realize that the free-states were utterly surrounded and the foundations of the country were being upended.

Other Jacksonians took a similar track. Francis Preston Blair, one of the most prominent members of President Andrew Jackson’s “Kitchen Cabinet” and editor of the famous Jacksonian organ, the Washington Globe, left Democrats to form the Republican Party.

Though he was aging and sickly, and opposed many of the old Whig economic ideas of industrial development and tariffs that Lincoln supported, Blair became a chief Lincoln adviser when the administration needed him most.

When Blair’s son informed him that Lincoln might pull his troops out and withdraw from Fort Sumter, he marched over to the White House. He told Lincoln that “It would be treason to surrender Sumter,” and that recognition of secession’s constitutionality would lead to his “impeachment.”

Contrary to popular belief, it was Blair and not Lincoln that contacted General Robert E. Lee to head the Union Army. He, like many Democrats at that time, felt a deep connection to the South but felt so strongly about the preservation of the Union that he was willing to wage terrible war against it once backed into a corner.

In contrast, Greeley, who absolutely believed slavery was abhorrent and wished to end it forever, said of the South, “Let them go in peace.”

Not so with Jacksonian Democrats.

Once Fort Sumter had been attacked in April of 1861, most Northern Democrats rallied to the cause. Historian Jean H. Baker said in Affairs of Party: The Political Culture of Northern Democrats in the Mid-Nineteenth Century, “Overnight a singular change occurred. Antiwar in April, thousands of Northern Democrats were volunteering by May. If supporting the South had been a badge of nationalism in 1860, fighting the Confederacy became one by late 1861.”

Baker continued, “…like revivalists in evangelical assembly, young men converted from civilian to soldier, from Democrat to first Infantry, by signing the muster rolls while neighbors cheered and the band played ‘America.'”

One Democratic newspaper stated, “Now none but traitors deserving the gibbet will be found sustaining the Southern rebels. Those who are not for the Stars and Stripes are against them.”

This ethic has continued to resonate with Americans long after the Civil War.

Ronald Reagan displayed this Jacksonian attitude during the Cold War when he ditched the policy of détente and drew a firm line of opposition to the Soviet Union.

Reagan called the USSR an “Evil Empire,” pointing to the depravities of life under Communism. Americans, notably the “Reagan Democrats,” not only drew a line in the sand, but took aggressive action to build up the military and wage numerous small-scale wars as a part of the “Reagan Doctrine.”

Most recently, the atrocities committed on September 11, 2001, in which thousands of Americans were brutally killed by those who held a radical, anti-American Islamist ideology, prompted Americans to go on the warpath. Attacking the symbols of American power, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, were clear examples that the enemy was attempting to upend the foundations of American civilization.

Though this clash is clear to Americans with a Jacksonian outlook, it has been muddled by those with a different philosophy.

It must be noted that even though many Jacksonian Democrats initially opposed the conflict with the slave states in the lead up to the Civil War, were at best ambivalent and sometimes outwardly hostile to abolition, and deeply disliked President Lincoln, it was ultimately the swelling of Union ranks with these rough men of iron-will that preserved the United States as one nation and put an end to the institution of slavery.

Jacksonians turn to war when they believe that vital American interests are at stake and against enemies that they believe threaten American liberties and the foundations of the country. Once set off, Jacksonians see conflict ending in total victory or defeat with little in the middle. A simple, but important set of principles to understand whenever American leaders decide to let slip the dogs of war."

http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130605-the-ecstasy-and-the-agony,2013-06-05 00:00:00,['Sharon Weinberger'],Could ecstasy help treat soldiers with PTSD?,"It is hardly surprising that Tony Macie has an over-developed sense of awareness. As a US Army private he served for 15 months in Baghdad, calling in artillery and air support in his role as a member of a reconnaissance unit. Deadly roadside bombs and insurgent attacks were everyday occurrences in the city divided by sectarian violence. Being hyper-vigilant can help keep a soldier alive in a warzone, but when Macie returned home in 2007, he couldn’t switch off. “My brain was working on overdrive all the time,” he says. “I couldn’t relax, couldn’t unwind.”

He was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but found the standard treatments – mainly psychotherapy and anti-depressants – were of little help. While searching for an effective alternative, Macie came across the website of Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). This not-for-profit group was sponsoring research into the use of MDMA, better known by its street name ecstasy, as a treatment for PTSD. He enrolled in a study that is currently looking at whether combined use of the drug and psychotherapy could provide relief for those with the debilitating anxiety disorder.

MDMA was originally developed by scientists at the German chemical and pharmaceutical company Merck a century ago, while they were investigating ways to stop abnormal bleeding. In the 1970s, a number of psychiatrists used the chemical to enhance communication with patients. The practice ended when MDMA became better known as a party drug, leading to it being outlawed in the US in 1985.

Evidence for its therapeutic efficacy was largely anecdotal. However, a small clinical trial published in 2010 suggested the drug can increase response to psychotherapy among people with PTSD. Now Rick Doblin, the founder and executive director of MAPS, hopes further studies, such as the one Macie is taking part in, will eventually lead to MDMA being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a new effective treatment option for PTSD. “Everywhere we go, what we’re told is ‘this is really important’, but the people we’ve spoken with were not high enough in the hierarchy to comfortably say yes,” says Doblin. He does, however, believe he is making headway. He recently had a meeting in the Pentagon to discuss his research (although he declined to identify the office on the record).

On trial

MAPS also funded the clinical trial published three years ago, which was led by Michael Mithoefer, a psychiatrist based in South Carolina. It involved 20 PTSD patients, the majority of whom had the disorder after being sexually assaulted, or being sexually or physically abused as children. Participants were given either MDMA or an inactive placebo during psychotherapy sessions, and were later assessed for symptoms of PTSD. Ten of the 12 (83%) given MDMA responded positively, compared to just two of the eight (25%) who took placebos.

Mithoefer’s interest in MDMA dates back to a career shift in 1991, when he moved from emergency medicine to psychiatry. “I was interested in experiential therapy, helping people shift their consciousness in some way,” he says. He became interested in MDMA's possible use in psychotherapy from anecdotal evidence reported prior to the drug's US ban. ""There were published reports, but no controlled research,"" he says. PTSD was beginning to rise in the public consciousness in light of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I thought it behoved us to take a careful look at whether these anecdotal reports of MDMA could be born out with rigorous controlled trials.""

Mithoefer is also running the trial that Macie is participating in. A group of 24 veterans and firefighters will take part in three sessions during which they will be given MDMA before undergoing psychotherapy. The hypothesis is that participants will feel less fear and be better able to talk about the traumatic experiences that caused their PTSD while under the influence of the drug.

One problem with the previous study was the use of inactive placebos. Those in the control group would have known that they were not receiving the active drug and this knowledge could have influenced their mental state. To get around this Mithoefer is giving those in the current study low, medium, or high doses. As participants will not know which does they have been given, he says this should effectively create double-blind conditions that would give the study greater validity. Results will be measured using a questionnaire-based PTSD diagnostic tool. The study is due to be completed next year.

Treatment options for PTSD are by and large ineffective, and so MDMA is not the only “non-traditional” treatment under investigation. At the Army’s Fort Bliss Restoration and Resilience Center in Texas, patients receive therapies ranging from acupuncture to Reiki, a Japanese spiritual treatment. In California, researchers at the Pentagon-funded Institute for Creative Technologies have studied the use of virtual reality as part of “exposure therapy” for veterans with PTSD.

Bad reputation

These days, researchers have no problems finding subjects for such work. It is estimated that the US military is diagnosing between 14,000 and 15,000 new cases of PTSD every year among deployed service members. “We have 400 veterans on a waiting list who have called us, and that’s without doing recruiting,” says Mithoefer.

Doblin thinks that getting MDMA through the FDA’s regulatory hurdles will only take eight to 10 years and $15 to $20 million – relatively speedy and cheap compared to what is normally required to license a new drug. “The FDA knows more about MDMA right now than any drug that they’ve ever approved in their entire history,” he says, pointing to a wealth of literature generated, ironically, by MDMA’s illegal status.

But whether the new research will convince critics, particularly those influenced by MDMA's reputation as a party drug, is more doubtful. Part of the problem is overcoming the stigma of hallucinogens, and some of the biased research that has been done in the past. Jonathan Moreno, a bioethicist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, points to the studies conducted by Timothy Leary of Harvard in the 1960s. In a prison study, Leary claimed that hallucinogens combined with psychotherapy could reduce re-offending among prisoners, but those conclusions were later shown to be erroneous. Doblin published a follow-up study, highlighting problems with Leary's means of tracking re-offending in the long-term.

“It’s striking that even in the 60s and 70s people lined up on different sides on hallucinogens,” says Moreno. The lines are drawn pretty dark on various positions.”

It’s not just the recreational use and abuse of MDMA that raises concerns. There is what Doblin calls the “disastrous legacy of mind control experiments” at the Pentagon. During the Cold War, both the Army and the CIA experimented with using hallucinogens as a weapon. Particularly notorious was MK Ultra, a CIA project which experimented with the use of psychedelics for mind control, sometimes with unwitting subjects.

“That is in people’s minds,” says Doblin, adding that it has been sufficiently far in the past that it is not their dominant concern.” Doblin does say he was approached by a former member of the military who asked about the possibility of using MDMA, which fosters feeling of trust, as a tool for interrogating terrorists. “That was a scary thing,” says Doblin, who also expressed doubt such use would be effective.

The bigger barrier, Doblin says, is the fear of MDMA's recreational associations, and that it could be misused. Several researchers at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) turned down requests to be interviewed about Mithoefer's MDMA study. ""VA does not use ecstasy as a treatment for PTSD,"" said a spokesman in a statement. ""Nor has it conducted, nor is currently conducting, any studies into whether it could be used in such a capacity."" Ecstasy ""is an illegal drug and VA would not involve veterans in the use of such substances.""

For Macie, however, much of the debate is academic. He has taken part in one session of combined MDMA and psychotherapy as part of Mithoefer's study and already believes the approach has helped him. He does not see the drug as a magic bullet and recognises such treatment is likely to still require a great deal of effort on his part. “I don’t want you to think that doing it puts you in happy mode forever,” he says. “It’s hard work.”

(CNN) —

U.S. President Barack Obama will travel to Mexico and Costa Rica in May, officials said Wednesday.

The trip, scheduled to take place May 2-4, “is an important opportunity to reinforce the deep cultural, familial and economic ties that so many Americans share with Mexico and Central America,” the White House said in a statement.

Economic and trade ties will be topics of discussion in Obama’s scheduled meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the White House said.

Mexico’s foreign ministry said a wide range of issues would be on the table.

“The agenda between both countries is broad and directly affects both societies,” the statement said. “During the visit, competitiveness, education and innovation will be addressed, as well as border infrastructure, trade, immigration and citizen security, among other issues of shared interest.”

Pena Nieto met with Obama at the White House in November, just a few days before taking office in Mexico.

In Costa Rica, Obama will meet with President Laura Chinchilla and with the heads of state of other Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, the White House said.

“The trip will be an important chance to discuss our collective efforts to promote economic growth and development in Central America and our ongoing collaboration on citizen security,” the White House said.

In the past, the United States has pledged to increase security aid to Central America to help combat violence in the region."

The Ecuadorians are not just UNILATERALLY saying fuck it to the trade treating our government was supposedly going to wave at them like a $20 bill. The Ecuadorians are also offering to donate $23 million dollars a year to the US, ""similar to what we [Ecuador] we would have received from the trade benefits,"" in order to educate Americans about human rights.

Before anybody starts saying, ""Oh, but we're so much freer and better and spiffier than Ecuador, we don't have to take this from them, how dare they, sputter sputter sputter..."" They actually do have a point.

We have done this to ourselves. We have put ourselves in the position of being talked down to (and that's what it was) by another country because of our inadequate appreciation of basic human rights and appreciation of the human sense of dignity.

Simply precious. I remember the day that we demanded to know how the North Korean government was treating an American being held on charges of spying in their country. We wanted to know if they were being mistreated. Their reply was, ""You mean like you do at Guantanamo Bay?""

We earned that, too. Thanks to the lovely torture program (oh, I mean ""enhanced interrogation"" program) that the Bush administration was actually boasting about, we were lectured by the government of one of the worst human rights abusers in the world.

It didn't used to be like this.

Updated 5:14 p.m. ET on 7/24



(CNN) – Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy and a prominent Democratic backer, was nominated by President Barack Obama Wednesday to serve as U.S. ambassador to Japan.

She would become the first woman to hold the post if she's confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A top supporter of Obama's, she served as the co-chair of his vice presidential search committee in 2008.



CNN first reported in April that Kennedy had been asked to serve as ambassador and was being vetted for the role.

She's the only surviving member of JFK's immediate family and has largely shunned the limelight and scrutiny associated with her famous last name. After publicly expressing interest in running for the U.S. Senate seat in New York vacated when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, she ultimately decided against making a bid, citing ""personal reasons.""

She made speeches at the 2008 and 2012 Democratic National Conventions, both times recalling her famous relatives – in 2008, her speech served as a tribute to her uncle, Sen. Ted Kennedy, and in 2012 she noted that ""like my father's election in 1960, this is one of those elections where the future of our country is at stake.""

After receiving degrees at Harvard and Columbia, Kennedy served in a variety of roles at New York non-profits, including the John F. Kennedy Library and the American Ballet Theatre.

The current U.S. ambassador to Japan is John Roos, who assumed the role in 2009. He was the first American ambassador to attend commemoration ceremonies for the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He also led America's embassy through the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the ensuing nuclear aftermath.

The United States is Japan's largest economic partner as well as a military ally. The U.S. military presence on Japan's Okinawa Island has remained a point of diplomatic tension between the two nations. Some of the island's residents have complained about noise from the base, in an urban area. Many others were incensed by the misconduct of U.S. troops stationed there, including the 1995 rape of 12-year-old Japanese girl by three U.S. military personnel.

Opposition to the presence of U.S. troops in Okinawa runs so deep that it contributed to the resignation of former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in 2010. He had promised to move the base but later announced that the base would stay, a decision he called ""heartbreaking."""

Donald Trump was reportedly booed off the stage at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, according to various reports and attendees. The 66-year-old businessman attended the April 6 event as an inductee into the organization's 2013 Hall of Fame.

He was introduced by WWE CEO Vince McMahon, a longtime friend of the ""Celebrity Apprentice"" creator. According to Bleacher Report, McMahon said Trump has helped the WWE and would have made a great U.S. president, but even this endorsement wasn't enough to quell the audience.

“Donald will soon find out this is a very partisan crowd,"" McMahon said in response to the booing. Later adding, “You’re not even going to let him come out here before you boo him?”

When Trump appeared, the heckling only continued.

""Trump was booed for most of his speech and eventually cut it short after the abuse,"" according to a Wrestling Online recap. His son was also apparently booed, but his daughter, Ivanka, was not. ""Trump noted that at least there is a member of the Trump family that the MSG crowd liked!""

Others noted the negative response.

Prior to Saturday, Trump had expressed excitement about the event being held in Manhattan.

“I’ve always enjoyed and respected WWE’s brand of entertainment and look forward to the ceremony in my hometown at Madison Square Garden,” the Chairman and President of The Trump Organization said in a statement released by the WWE ahead of the ceremony.

Jim Varsallone of the Miami Herald was disappointed by the audience's behavior and penned an op-ed defending the would-be conservative pundit. ""How about Donald Trump,"" he wrote Monday. ""Long before others did, The Don lauded Mr. McMahon’s vision ... and instead of thanking him or just watching quietly, you heckle him.""

And this isn't the first time Trump has faced a disgruntled crowd. He was booed by members of the press at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, which he attended as a guest of the Washington Post."

A new Dove campaign says yes -- and offers proof, in the form of forensic sketches.

Dove recruited seven women of different ages and backgrounds and had FBI-trained forensic artist Gil Zamora create composite sketches of them based on descriptions of their own facial features. In the above video, produced for the campaign, you can hear the women use phrases like ""my mom told me I had a big jaw,"" ""I kind of have a fat, rounder face,"" ""I'd say I have a pretty big forehead.""

""We really weren't sure what was going on,"" Kela Cabrales, a 40-year-old technology teacher and digital artist who appears in the video, told HuffPost Women. ""They asked me to describe myself and use neutral terms and 'just the facts' sort of descriptions.""

Earlier in the day, the women had been asked to spend time with strangers, though neither party was told why. These strangers were later brought one by one into a room with Zamora and asked to describe the women who had been sketched earlier. The two resulting drawings of each woman were then hung side-by-side -- and the contrast is pretty stark. The tagline of the campaign is: ""You are more beautiful than you think."" (Scroll down for more of the sketches.)

It's worth noting that Dove is owned by Unilever -- the same company that owns Axe, king of misogynistic ads that use headless breasts and ""flirty girls"" to hawk its products. However, despite the obvious commercial intentions behind this campaign, the message rings true and is a refreshing departure from the many female-targeted ads that try to shame women into buying things.

And it's women's existing shame that the Dove campaign does a good job of exposing through its sketches. ""I probably beat myself up way more than I should,"" Cabrales acknowledged to HuffPost Women. ""I see my 8-year-old daughter, and she’s so happy and confident, and naturally exudes this beauty. And when I see her I feel like, 'Oh god, what pitfalls did I fall into, and how can I keep that from happening to her?' I don’t know what they are -- I wish I did. I really want to protect her.""

Nash was blinded, lost both hands and underwent a face transplant after being mauled in Stamford in 2009. She reached a $4 million settlement last year with the estate of chimp owner Sandra Herold, who died in 2010.

Her lawyer said the state should be held responsible for not seizing the animal before the attack, because it was warned the animal was dangerous. State Attorney General George Jepsen said the state shouldn't be held liable for the mauling.

Vance said in his decision that at the time of the attack, state law did not prohibit the private ownership of chimpanzees and did not require the state to seize an animal that was privately owned and not banned by the state. Vance noted that the state banned the ownership of chimpanzees after the attack.

""The State of Connecticut, were it a private person, would generally not have any duty to control the conduct of (a) third party absent some special relationship,"" Vance wrote.

Nash, 59, had gone to Herold's home on the day of the attack to help lure her friend's 200-pound chimpanzee, Travis, back inside. But the chimp went berserk and ripped off Nash's nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer. Nash now lives in a nursing home outside Boston.

Travis had starred in TV commercials for Old Navy and Coca-Cola when he was younger and made an appearance on ""The Maury Povich Show."" The chimpanzee was the constant companion of the widowed Herold and was fed steak, lobster and ice cream. The chimp could eat at the table, drink wine from a stemmed glass, use the toilet, and bathe and dress itself.

Travis had previously bitten another woman's hand and tried to drag her into a car in 1996, bit a man's thumb two years later and roamed downtown Stamford for hours in 2003 before being captured after escaping from Herold's home, according to Nash's lawsuit against Herold.

The $4 million settlement covers a small fraction of Nash's medical costs, according to her lawyers, who have said she requires care and supervision around the clock. She is facing another surgery for hand transplants and will need to be on antibiotics for the rest of her life.

Nash holds the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection responsible for not seizing the animal before the attack despite a state biologist's warning it was dangerous.

""I hope and pray that the commissioner will give me my day in court,"" Nash told reporters following a hearing last year before Vance. ""And I also pray that I hope this never happens to anyone else again. It is not nice.""

State Attorney General George Jepsen has said the state should not be held liable for the mauling. He has acknowledged that a state biologist had warned that the chimp was ""an accident waiting to happen"" before the attack. But Jepsen said state law on the issue was ambiguous and difficult to enforce, and there was no guarantee a court hearing would have led to a seizure order."

Rand Paul (R-KY) said on Laura Ingraham’s radio program that House Speaker John Boehner’s speakership is in jeopardy if any form of amnesty, such as the Senate’s immigration reform bill, becomes law.

“I’m worried about conference,” Paul said Friday, according to Roll Call. “The only way to avoid a problem with conference is for the speaker of the House to say we are not going to conference, and we will not allow a vote on anything coming out of conference that resembles the Senate bill, and if there were a much more limited bill that emphasizes border security first, that we would do that.”

“Conference” refers to a legislative process wherein after the House passes its own immigration bill, it will enter negotiations with Senate leaders and even the White House to reconcile the differences between the two chambers’ bills. Conservative lawmakers fear that in conference, Boehner would allow Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to include a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the final law submitted to President Barack Obama.

Paul asserted that if Boehner passes anything like the Senate bill, conservatives in the House will more than likely drive him out of office.

“If he allows something to pass out of conference that looks anything like the Senate bill and is passed with a majority of Democrats, I think that will be the final thing he does as speaker,” Paul said. “So, I think he knows that, and I think he’s going to be very cautious, and I hope he will defend us on this and not pass something that looks like the Senate bill.”

Boehner has agreed that any bill, or conference committee report, that would be voted on would need the support of the majority of House Republicans before receiving a vote in the House. But Boehner has not agreed to kill the Senate bill once and for all by saying no House immigration bill, or group of bills, would be allowed to go to conference with it.

According to The Hill, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the GOP’s most recent vice presidential candidate who with Mitt Romney lost to President Obama almost a year ago, is working with the Chamber of Commerce to finalize a deal on immigration legislation."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/17/Paul-Ryan-makes-pitch-for-minority-voters-for-GOP-after-failing-to-turn-out-base-in-2012,2013-11-17 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Paul Ryan Makes Pitch for Minority Voters for GOP After Failing to Turn Out Base in 2012,"After failing to turn out the base as Mitt Romney’s Vice Presidential pick in the 2012 elections, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) told the Des Moines Register in Iowa that he thinks the GOP should focus on going into minority communities to seek votes.

“Go into inner cities, go into minority communities,” Ryan said in an interview with the state paper. “Go into communities that have not seen or heard from Republicans in a long time.” Ryan was in Iowa on Saturday for a fundraiser and birthday event for the state’s GOP Gov. Terry Branstad.

Ryan and Romney lost the presidential election last year by failing to turn out the GOP base. As Byron York pointed out in the Washington Examiner in May of this year, six months after the election, the GOP duo would have needed to get 73 percent of the Hispanic vote to have won the election by solely focusing on Hispanics–when Republicans have not, at any point in history, been able to even break 45 percent of the Hispanic vote. George W. Bush got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004, the highest a Republican has ever gotten in a nationwide election.

“In 2012, President Obama famously won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote to Mitt Romney’s 27 percent,” York wrote. “If all other factors remained the same, how large a percentage of the Hispanic vote would Romney have had to win to capture the White House? What if Romney had won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, the high-water mark for Republicans achieved by George W. Bush in 2004? As it turns out, if Romney had hit that Bush mark, he still would have lost, with 240 electoral votes to 298 for Obama.”

York presented several other “unrealistic” scenarios, such as Romney and Ryan winning 50 percent or 70 percent of the Hispanic vote–only to show that the numbers prove if they were somehow miraculously able to pull off such a feat, they still would have lost the election. York noted that Romney and Ryan would have needed 73 percent of the Hispanic vote to beat Obama–if all the other numbers, such as the low GOP base turnout, stayed the same.

“The most serious of those problems was that Romney was not able to connect with white voters who were so turned off by the campaign that they abandoned the GOP and in many cases stayed away from the polls altogether,” York wrote. “Recent reports suggest as many as 5 million white voters simply stayed home on Election Day. If they had voted at the same rate they did in 2004, even with the demographic changes since then, Romney would have won. Likewise, the white vote is so large that an improvement of 4 points — going from 60 percent to 64 percent of those whites who did vote — would have won the race for Romney.”

Nonetheless, Ryan still believes somehow that pushing certain policies like amnesty that pander to the left will somehow win the GOP minority votes. Ryan is currently in the process of writing a bill that would legalize the status of America’s at least 11 million illegal aliens.

As part of his interview with the Des Moines Register, Ryan praised New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie’s re-election as evidence that the GOP can win minority communities in blue states.

“Absolutely,” Ryan answered when asked by the local paper if lessons can be learned from Christie’s re-election in New Jersey. “It shows that we have to go and campaign in non-traditional areas, non-traditional neighborhoods, and by showing up not just a few months before the election, but by being in these communities all year round, that will make a difference.”

“What Chris’s victory shows is that conservatives can win blue states if we focus on being inclusive and campaigning in every facet of this country, we can open up the electoral map, far more than where it has been,” Ryan added.

As part of the interview, Ryan pushed harder than he has in a long time in public for amnesty as well. Ryan said, in the words of the Des Moines paper, that pushing for amnesty for illegal aliens is “crucial.”

“When we get to it [amnesty], it’s not extremely clear,” Ryan said. “But there are many of us who still would like to see it happen in a step-by-step process before the end of the year. But if that doesn’t occur, we’ll still keep moving for it because, again, the status quo is unacceptable.”

Ryan is at odds with the entire rest of the House GOP leadership–and the GOP base–when it comes to immigration legislation. House Minority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has publicly promised there will be no immigration legislation voted on in the House of Representatives for the rest of 2013, something Ryan does not agree with as evidenced by this interview he did with the Des Moines paper. McCarthy, House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), House Speaker John Boehner, House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and scores of other Republicans and conservatives have publicly come out in opposition to ever going to a conference committee with the Senate “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Ryan is on record as being supportive of a conference committee, and refused to join the rest of House Republicans save for a few outliers who also support amnesty in denouncing any effort to save the Senate bill via conference after Speaker Boehner publicly promised last week there would never be a conference.

Ryan has taken a beating in polls for his support for amnesty. Ryan and Senate Gang of Eight GOP frontman Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)–who has since expressed regret for supporting the Senate bill and publicly opposed conference committee in a Breitbart News exclusive—combined for less than 10 percent of the total support from GOP base voters in the straw poll at the recent Values Voter Summit. Those GOP base voters are the same people who York noted did not show up to vote for Romney and Ryan at the polls last November–the real reason the GOP lost its shot to unseat incumbent President Barack Obama in November 2012."

Sex is one of those topics we’re all constantly thinking about, reading about, and even acting out… but not necessarily talking about. Sure, you’ll dish to your friends about the steamy sex session you had with your new man last night, but you won’t necessarily be so eager to share when your sex life goes from consistent to non-existent. And yet, several studies have been revealing for the last decade that a dry spell in the bedroom is actually common among couples. Is a lack of sex the one thing our conversations are lacking?

“It is very common for couples to go through sexual dry spells,” says Rabbi Ed Weinsberg, EdD. “It's estimated that this process begins for most couples anywhere from two to ten years after they get married.”

Defining a sexual dry spell, though, can be as difficult as dealing with the problem itself. One of my favorite scenes from the 1977 film ""Annie Hall"" features Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) talking to a therapist about their sex life. When the therapist asks how often they have sex, Alvy answers, “Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.” Annie, however, answers this way: “Constantly. I'd say three times a week.”

“The disparity is normal,” says Rabbi Weinsberg, author of two books on sexuality after illnesses, including ""Conquer Prostate Cancer: How Medicine, Faith, Love and Sex Can Renew Your Life."" “Going through a sexual dry spell is fairly subjective.” Just as we all have different likes and dislikes when it comes to sex, we all have a different take on how often we should be having sex as well. “There is no one ‘right’ amount of sex that a couple should be having,” says Jodi Lipper, co-author of ""How to Love Like a Hot Chick"". “For some married couples, normal is having sex every day. For others, it might be having sex once a month.”

Wondering if you and your partner are going through a sexual dry spell? Start by asking if both of your needs are being met. If your answer is no, then you may be facing a sexual drought. “It’s not enough when one or both partners is unsatisfied, or feels that his or her needs aren’t being met,” says Lipper. Her advice to couples in a sexless relationship? Talk it out with an open mind to determine the cause of the problem before you take drastic steps. In other words, share your sexual needs and wants before you demand that you and your partner either get it on, or get divorced!

“Sometimes a decrease in sexual activity in a relationship represents a manifestation of other problems,” explains Dr. Alexis Conason, a clinical psychologist in New York City. “It is important to understand why the couple has stopped, or decreased, having sex before we can diagnose a sexless period as problematic or not.” In other words, talking about your lack of sex could turn up a simple cause for what seems like a major problem. Before you give up on your sex life, Dr. Conason suggests asking yourself the following questions:

Have you stopped having sex because one partner is furious at the other?

Is one partner having an affair?

Are there medical issues that interfere with sexual functioning or desire?

Is one or both partners overwhelmed with childcare responsibilities?

Is one or both partners overwhelmed with career stress?

Was there ever a time when you were having more sex with your partner? Or has the relationship always been sexless?

Discussing these questions may seem like a daunting task, but it’s vital to the health of your relationship. “That hot and heavy sex that may have brought you together is not what is going to sustain the relationship,” explains Dr. Lisa Bahar, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Dana Point, Calif. “Now is the time to build intimacy on a deeper level, which requires awareness and a willingness to be curious about your partner in new ways that create spontaneous intimacy.” And spontaneous intimacy, my friends, is what leads to sexual intimacy… i.e. the opposite of a sexual dry spell!

The bottom line is that a lack of sex is an indicator of a greater problem. If you can’t remember the last time you had sex, make a list of all the obstacles holding you back from doing the deed –- like work stress, a lack of time, etc. –- and then work to find solutions to those obstacles, like trading massages with your partner to help relieve work stress, or planning a Saturday “staycation” in your bedroom to make time for an all-day shag. However, the most important step to finding your happy ending (pun intended) is to open up and talk to your partner about what’s really going on. You’ll hopefully go from “We need to talk” to “Less talk, more action!” in no time at all.

Story highlights NEW: Death revised from 6 to 4; gunman also killed One man describes the gunman as calm and ''looking around'' for targets Police have a person of interest in custody, the police chief says As many as six are slain; gunman also died

(CNN) —

[Update 11:55 p.m.]

(CNN) – The gunman who went on a shooting rampage in Santa Monica, California, killed four people, police spokesman St. Richard Lewis said. Authorities said earlier that six had died, but revised the number to four. The gunman was also killed, bringing the total number of deaths to five.

The shooter began his rampage at a residence near the campus of Santa Monica College, opening fire in a house, where police later found two bodies. He then shot at a passing car before carjacking another vehicle, Lewis said. He forced the driver, a woman, to drive onto the college campus. There he shot two people in a passing vehicle. One died at the scene. The gunman also fatally shot someone outside the campus library, where he engaged police in a gunfight, Lewis said. Officers fatally wounded him.

[Earlier story]

(CNN) – Six people were killed in a shooting rampage in Santa Monica, California, that ended Friday with the gunman clad in tactical gear dead in a college library and a “person of interest” in custody, authorities said.

“We are not convinced 100 percent that the suspect who was killed operated in a solo or alone capacity,” Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks told reporters.

The comments came as police and firefighters searched the sprawling campus of Santa Monica College for other possible victims or shooters. By early evening, authorities declared the campus clear.

The gunman has not been identified by authorities, Seabrooks said. She described him as a white male between the age of 25 and 35, clad in black and wearing what appeared to be a ballistic vest. He carried a semi-automatic assault rifle, she said.

Seabrooks did not identify the person in custody, nor did she explain why authorities wanted to talk with the individual.

At least three people were wounded in the shootings, which authorities believe began with a house fire and gunshots shortly before noon in a residential neighborhood near the college.

Jerry Cunningham was home when she heard the shots, and stepped out onto her porch to see what happened.

She saw the gunman firing at a neighboring house, and then she noticed it was on fire. She saw the gunman carjack a vehicle.

As he was holding the female motorist at gunpoint, the gunman waved another car by, Cunningham said. That driver, also a woman, hesitated for just a moment, and the gunman “fired three shots directly into her and the car,” Cunningham said. The motorist was wounded in the shoulder, she said.

Inside the house, firefighters found the bodies of at least two people, Seabrooks said.

Map: Shooting in Santa Monica

Investigators believe the gunman knew the dead people in the house, but police were unsure of the connection.

The others killed in the rampage were targeted randomly, Seabrooks said.

Investigators did not immediately identify the victims, saying authorities were still making next-of-kin notifications.

It was not immediately clear whether a woman who died from wounds at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center was counted among the six deaths. Another woman wounded in the shooting remains in critical condition, Dr. Marshall Morgan, chief of emergency medicine at the medical center, said Friday evening.

Within minutes of the carjacking, authorities said, the gunman targeted a bus in Santa Monica. Two passengers were injured, Suja Lowenthal, a Big Blue Bus spokeswoman, told CNN.

A short distance later, the gunman opened fire on cars, including a patrol car, adjacent to the college.

“There was an exchange of gunfire at the time, and the suspect tried to evade,” Seabrooks said.

The gunman ran on to the campus, where he again exchanged gunfire with police.

Student Joe Orcutt saw the exchange of gunfire and fled, only to come face-to-face later with the gunman near the campus parking lot.

“He was standing there. He looked over at me, and I looked at him. He just panned his gun and trained it on me, and I just jumped behind the building and he shot at me,” Orcutt said.

Orcutt said he heard bullets “whiz by my head.”

The gunman was “very calm, not running around.” He was just “looking around for targets very casually,” he said.

“He just looked like he was standing there posing for the cover an ammo magazine or something. It was bizarre.”

The gunman exchanged gunfire at least once on the campus with police, Seabrooks said.

As he fled toward the campus library, he shot a woman, she said.

A number of students were in the library building studying for finals when the gunman burst in. More than 30,000 students are enrolled in the two-year community college.

A woman – who was shaken up by the ordeal and asked not to be identified – said she was in the building when she heard a noise, realized it was a gunshot, then took off running.

Then, in a hallway, she saw a dark-haired man whom she initially mistook for a police officer but later realized was the shooter. The man – who she said was wearing black combat boots and what appeared to be a bullet-proof vest – was quiet and walking casually.

“(He had) a big shotgun,” the woman said.

She and a colleague eventually realized something wasn’t right and ran in the opposite direction. “Multiple” gunshots rang out at one point, in an exchange of gunfire the woman described as like a war zone.

Priscilla Morales, who was also studying in the library, told CNN she looked out the window and saw people running.

She and her friends grabbed their books and belongings to leave the study room. “As we open the door, we hear three gunshots,” she said.

Morales and the others closed the door and hid.

Still, she could hear the commotion: gunshots and then the gunman screaming.

Morales also said she heard police tell the gunman to “drop it.”

“I was so scared and thought literally I was going to die,” she said.

President Barack Obama was in Santa Monica for a fundraiser just a 10-minute drive from the campus, CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported. Obama’s schedule was not affected by the shootings or police followup.

Jerry Brown when he signed them last month, according to a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll.

The groups differ most on allowing immigrants without legal status to obtain driver’s licenses and practice law.

Nearly 69% of Latino voters but only 44% of whites support the new driving privilege law. The split was sharper on whether those who are in the country illegally should be allowed to become attorneys, with 65% of Latino voters in favor but only 26% of whites.

Neither law gained majority support among all voters.

To win over a growing Latino electorate, California politicians will continue to push for immigrant-friendly legislation, analysts predicted. The poll shows that 61% of Latinos approve of Brown’s performance, compared with 51% of whites.

“Latino voters are a life preserver for Jerry Brown, and in California they’re a very, very big life preserver, and that goes back to the relative import of cultural and social issues,” said Dan Schnur, director of Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC.

The bipartisan poll reached 1,503 registered California voters by telephone. It was conducted Oct. 30 through Nov. 5 by two polling firms, one Democratic and one Republican. The margin of error overall is 3.1 percentage points, higher for subgroups such as Latinos.

Brown signed 11 immigrant-related measures this fall, but none generated as much controversy as the long-debated driver’s license bill. The licenses will be marked “DP,” for driving privilege.

Overall, 49% support the license law, with 47% opposed. Support was greater for granting licenses without a distinguishing mark, with 51% in favor, 46% opposed.

A decade ago, polls showed that most California voters disapproved of driver’s licenses for immigrants who are in the country illegally, an issue that contributed to Gov. Gray Davis’ recall. But the state’s demographics have shifted, with Latinos now making up 23% of voters. Whites are also more likely to support the licenses than they were in the past.

“There are two factors at play. One is how much of that change is driven by the Latino population getting larger, and two is how much is driven by white voters changing their minds?” said David Kanevsky of American Viewpoint, the Republican firm that conducted the poll for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times, along with the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.

As a group, white voters are still less enthusiastic about pro-immigrant measures than Latinos are, drawing the line at rights they see as reserved for citizens.

“It just suggests the population is both divided and not particularly motivated really in a positive way by these measures,” said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.

Two-thirds of white voters are opposed to allowing holders of green cards to serve on juries, with 44% of Latinos opposed. Overall, only 35% of voters supported the measure, which was vetoed by Brown. A majority of whites support a new law allowing those with green cards to serve as poll workers.

More than 50% of Latino voters but only 44% of white voters support the Trust Act, which limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Overall, 48% of voters approve of the law, which Brown signed after vetoing a similar measure last year.

The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll also showed broad support from whites and Latinos for new laws protecting immigrant whistle-blowers from employer retaliation and granting overtime pay to domestic workers.

“Californians are extremely welcoming and supportive of undocumented immigrants and their families, but they still have concerns about those individuals who have committed crimes,” Schnur said.

Denis Nolan, a retired tutor in Daly City, is in favor of driver’s licenses for immigrants without legal status. Many of them are driving anyway, Nolan said, and he would rather have them pass a driving test.

Nolan, a Democrat, would not allow those immigrants to become attorneys, though he is not opposed to green card holders serving on juries. One minor crime should not trigger deportation, but a series of them might be enough, he said.

“If local law enforcement felt that someone was a danger, even if it wasn’t a major crime, they should be held accountable,” said Nolan, 75, who is white. “There’s a benefit in deporting them. I think our jails are too full already.”

As the great-grandson of Mexican immigrants, Ralph Guerrero did not have firsthand experience with the problems faced by immigrants without legal status. Then he met his wife, whose parents crossed the border from Mexico and lived in the United States illegally until receiving amnesty in 1986.

Guerrero, 35, an administrative assistant from Victorville, supports extending many privileges to immigrants who are in the country illegally, including driver’s licenses without distinguishing marks, admission to the bar and serving on a jury.

“This whole country is built off of immigration. Besides Native Americans, everybody is an immigrant,” said Guerrero, a Democrat. “More power to them. Let them come, and give them the opportunity for freedom, just like everyone else who’s stepped into this country.”

Whittier resident Susan B. Pasillas is among the 28% who identify themselves as Latino and oppose the new driving privileges for immigrants lacking legal status.

“If you’re here illegally in a country, I don’t see how you’re entitled to any kind of benefits,” said Pasillas, 55, a Republican who works for a packaging company and who traces part of her ancestry to Mexico.

Eric Lund, a maintenance technician from Crescent City, does not accept the argument that immigrants should get driver’s licenses because they drive anyway.

“To me that’s like saying people are going to murder, so why not make murder legal?” said Lund, 59, a Republican whose great-grandparents immigrated from Sweden. “It’s illegal. It’s right or wrong.”

But Pasillas and Lund say that some of the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally should have a chance to become legal residents.

“I don’t think deportation is even possible,” Lund said. “They’re human beings. It’s very complicated.”

Their court is guilty of judicial activism.

“If it’s measured in terms of readiness to overturn legislation, this is one of the most activist courts in history,” Justice Ginsburg said in August in an interview with The New York Times. “This court has overturned more legislation, I think, than any other.”

But Justice Ginsburg overstated her case. If judicial activism is defined as the tendency to strike down laws, the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. is less activist than any court in the last 60 years.

Nonetheless, Justice Ginsburg’s impression fits with a popular perception of the court. In 2010 in Citizens United, it struck down part of a federal law regulating campaign spending by corporations and unions, overruling two precedents in the bargain. In June, it struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act and the Defense of Marriage Act."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Newark Mayor Cory Booker (D) put talk of his likely U.S. Senate campaign and love of Twitter aside Tuesday night to engage in a ""Star Trek"" trivia contest while calling into a New Jersey radio station's pledge drive.

Booker competed with comedian and ""Daily Show"" correspondent John Hodgman in the contest on WFMU, a Jersey City-based radio station, around 11 p.m. Tuesday. The Star-Ledger first reported Booker's late night geek-a-thon Wednesday evening, posting audio of the 15-minute interview.

“John and I know the difference between a Vulcan mind meld and a Jedi mind trick,"" Booker told host Tom Scharpling when he was challenged to battle Hodgman in the trivia contest.

Questions included ""Star Trek"" trivia from the original series and the more recent incarnations. Booker was asked about the shirt color most likely to indicate a character will get killed. He said that while red is the prevailing guess, a recent statistical analysis he read showed it was yellow. Booker indicated he was pointed to the statistical analysis on his favorite medium, Twitter.

Booker's love of ""Star Trek"" was never a secret, sharing his inner Trekkie with his more than 1.3 million Twitter followers. During the recent South by Southwest conference, Booker engaged his Twitter followers in a ""Star Trek"" discussion before his presentation.

Booker has formed an exploratory committee for a 2014 run for the seat now held by retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.).

A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll released Wednesday shows Booker with 50 percent of the vote in a hypothetical Democratic primary match-up against Rep. Frank Pallone, who received 4 percent and Rep. Rush Holt who received 7 percent. Neither Pallone nor Holt has announced a run for Senate, but Pallone is considered a likely candidate. State Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-East Orange) has also indicated that she is considering entering the Senate race."

Updated 10/31/2013 at 5:23 p.m. ET

(CNN) - Republicans blocked two high-profile presidential nominees on Thursday as the bitter fight over appointments escalated in the U.S. Senate, but Democrats held their fire and decided, for now, to forgo a change in rules to limit filibusters.

The GOP mounted filibusters against Judge Patricia Millett, who was appointed by President Barack Obama to the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia, and Rep. Melvin Watt, who was named to head the agency that oversees housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.



Democrats fell short in procedural votes called to move forward on the nominations, testing their patience and raising serious questions about how they might respond.

Although it was raised as a possibility, Democrats are not expected at this time to invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"" to change filibuster rules, two Senate Democratic leadership aides told CNN.

Many rank-and-file Democrats wanted the change, over objections from minority Republicans, to allow the Senate to approve appointments with a simple majority vote rather than the 60 now needed to proceed with a nomination.

But Democratic leaders are reluctant to engage a knock down fight with Republicans at the same time they need to move other legislative priorities through the Senate.

Next week, the Senate will take up a key piece of gay rights legislation, and Democrats believe they are just one vote shy getting it passed and don't want to jeopardize their prospects by angering Republicans with a rule change effort.

The Senate also will soon enough turn its attention back to the fiscal issues in desperate need of bipartisan cooperation.

Opposition to appointments

Republicans argued that Millett's appointment to the judicial post that has been a stepping stone for some to the U.S. Supreme Court was unnecessary.

They said the appeals panel now is evenly divided between judges appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents and doesn't have enough work to justify an additional member even though there are three vacancies.

Democrats said the filibuster was a transparent attempt to maintain conservative influence on the court.

Earlier in the day, Republicans also blocked Obama's nomination of Watt, a North Carolina Democrat, to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, an independent federal entity that has been in control of Fannie and Freddie since their taxpayer rescue last decade during the housing crisis.

Republicans argued Watt is not independent enough and lacks expertise to run the agency.

Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee more than half of all outstanding mortgages in the United States, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Opening from Biden

The push to change the rules appeared to get a boost when Vice President Joe Biden, who served in the Senate for decades, said it was ""worth considering.""

The opening from Biden reflects the thinking of many Democrats who want to push for the controversial change.

For instance, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, was frustrated with the Millett vote, especially.

""This is declaring war on the judicial branch. This is declaring war on the executive branch. It is inconsistent with the traditions of the Senate,"" he said. ""This type of blockade cannot stand.""

Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, complained the fight was ""all about ideology"" and said he thought support was ""growing for changing the rules when they play these games.""

But other veteran Senate Democrats who have seen the majority change hands between the parties over the years are opposed, saying they want to preserve the right to filibuster in the future.

""I've never favored using the nuclear option,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, who chairs the Armed Services Committee and who is retiring from the Senate after this term.

The second-ranking Senate Republican warned that Democrats need to ""think twice"" about changing the rules.

Or, he said, the ""next time there is a Republican president and Republicans hold a majority in the Senate then we could confirm another (Antonin) Scalia, another (Clarence) Thomas with 51 votes,"" Senator John Cornyn of Texas said, referring to the two conservative Supreme Court justices.

“A vote for this bill is a vote to end nutrition in America,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.

Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, called the House measure “an insult to rural America.”

Anti-hunger groups called passage of the farm bill without the food stamp program a disgrace.

“Today’s vote is the latest smoking gun that the House majority isn’t truly interested in deficit reduction,” said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. “They’re interested in supporting special interest groups over hungry Americans.”

The 608-page bill keeps the changes that were in the version that failed last month, and amendments were not allowed. The bill would save about $20 billion by consolidating or cutting numerous farm subsidy programs, including $5 billion paid annually to farmers and landowners whether they plant crops or not.

The money saved from eliminating those payments would be directed into the $9 billion crop insurance program, and new subsidies would be created for peanut, cotton and rice farmers. The bill adds money to support fruit and vegetable growers, and it restores insurance programs for livestock producers, which expired in 2011, leaving thousands of operations without disaster coverage during last year’s drought. The bill also made changes to a dairy program that sets limits to the amount of milk produced and sold in the United States.

One new proposal from last month would also repeal a provision in the current farm bill, called “permanent law,” that causes farm programs to revert to 1949 price levels if a new farm bill is not passed. Congress has traditionally maintained the provision to prod lawmakers into passing a farm bill or face large increases in farm program expenditures. Without the provision, many lawmakers and farm groups fear there would be no incentive for Congress to pass a farm bill on time.

One overlooked provision in the bill came from Representative Dan Benishek, Republican of Michigan, a surgeon, and would require additional economic and scientific analyses before a 2010 law to improve the food safety system goes into effect."

The Coast Guard was called. Onlookers remained at a distance for safety. And the answer surprised everyone.

As first reported by the Florida Keys Keynoter, it turns out the bright orange, 20-foot long, missile-shaped object was a $570,000 Air Force drone that had been shot down during a training mission in January -- 800 miles away, near Tyndall Air Force base in the Florida Panhandle.

""As soon as we heard, we had people on the way,"" Lt. Col. Lance Wilkins, commander of Tyndall's 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron, told the Keynoter, explaining that the Air Force would repair and reuse the drone.

According to an official fact sheet, the BQM-167 drone is ""a high-performance, remotely-controlled subscale aerial target used to provide a threat-representative target drone to support the Air-to-Air Weapon System Evaluation Program and other Air Force and Department of Defense air-to-air test and evaluation programs.""

NBC News reports that Tyndall airmen have launched BQM-167s about 600 times since 2007, according to Wilkins, initially losing 16 of them at sea. Of the missing, nine were later recovered.

The others, like the Keys drone, presumably slipped into currents in the Gulf of Mexico and headed to sea.

""You would think that they would have awesome beacon tracking or at least GPS enabled on the thing,"" Roger Grimes, one the boaters who radioed the Coast Guard, told the Keynoter.

And who can blame South Floridians for being cautious? In 2011, a live Navy mine washed ashore in Miami Beach, causing the bomb squad to evacuate the sand.

A month later, a Miami Gardens family found a live grenade in their backyard.

UPDATE, Friday noon: Lt. Col. Lance Wilkins, commander of Tyndall's 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron, told HuffPost that the drones used for live fire exercises -- including the one that floated to the Keys -- are equipped with a tracking beacon.

But batteries don't last forever, he said, and the drone's GPS can be ""thwacked"" out of service when struck by an anti-drone practice missile traveling at several thousand miles per hour.

Though boats are pre-positioned to retrieve the drones after an exercise, weather doesn't always cooperate with a safe recovery.

""For us to recover these we have to have weather that is acceptable risk,"" Wilkins said, ""because we have to put a diver in the water to hook up the drone and get it on the back of the boat.""

Wilkins told HuffPost the Air Force has been using the types of drones launched for live fire exercises since the 1950s, and his unit will attempt to retrieve a fallen drone three days in a row before damage from prolonged exposure usually sinks them.

They were lawyers at the world’s largest law firm, trading casual e-mails about a client’s case. One made a sarcastic joke about how the bill was running way over budget. Another described a colleague’s approach to the assignment as “churn that bill, baby!”

The e-mails, which emerged in a court filing late last week, provide a window into the thorny issue of law firm billing. The documents are likely to reinforce a perception held by many corporate clients — and the public — that law firms inflate bills by performing superfluous tasks and overstaffing assignments.

The internal correspondence of the law firm, DLA Piper, was disclosed in a fee dispute between the law firm and Adam H. Victor, an energy industry executive. After DLA Piper sued Mr. Victor for $675,000 in unpaid legal bills, Mr. Victor filed a counterclaim, accusing the law firm of a “sweeping practice of overbilling.”

Mr. Victor’s feud with DLA Piper began after he retained the firm in April 2010 to prepare a bankruptcy filing for one of his companies. A month after the filing, a lawyer at the firm warned colleagues that the businessman’s bill was mounting.

“I hear we are already 200k over our estimate — that’s Team DLA Piper!” wrote Erich P. Eisenegger, a lawyer at the firm.

Another DLA Piper lawyer, Christopher Thomson, replied, noting that a third colleague, Vincent J. Roldan, had been enlisted to work on the matter.

“Now Vince has random people working full time on random research projects in standard ‘churn that bill, baby!’ mode,” Mr. Thomson wrote. “That bill shall know no limits.”

A DLA Piper spokesman said the firm did not comment on pending litigation.

Legal ethics scholars said that it was highly unusual to find documentary evidence of possible churning — the creation of unnecessary work to drive up a client’s bill.

Stephen Gillers, who teaches professional responsibility at New York University Law School, called the e-mails a troubling example of lawyers’ flip attitudes toward a client’s escalating fees. And he noted that they had come to light at a time when corporations are increasingly rejecting the billable hour standard and becoming vigilant about controlling skyrocketing legal expenses.

William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University’s Cumberland School of Law who specializes in billing ethics, said that the DLA Piper e-mails appeared to support what several of his studies had shown: that churning, while not endemic, is an insidious problem in the legal profession.

In a survey of about 250 lawyers that Professor Ross conducted in 2007, more than half acknowledged that the prospect of billing extra time influenced their decision to perform pointless assignments, such as doing excessive legal research or extraneous document review. There is also the issue of “featherbedding,” he said, or throwing armies of bodies at every problem.

“Lawyers sometimes conflate their own financial interests with the interests of the client who pays the bills,” Professor Ross said. “Of course, most lawyers are ethical, but the billable hour creates perverse incentives.”

The three DLA Piper lawyers who wrote the e-mails have since left the firm. Mr. Eisenegger and Mr. Roldan, who now work for other law firms, did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Thomson, now a government lawyer, declined to comment. Their departures had nothing to do with the Victor case, according to people briefed on the matter.

The fee dispute centers on DLA Piper’s representation of Mr. Victor in a Chapter 11 filing for one of his holdings, Project Orange Associates, the operator of a power plant in Syracuse that provided steam to Syracuse University. Mr. Victor, the chief executive of TransGas Development Systems, which is based in New York, said that his fight over the Project Orange bill was the culmination of a relationship that had deteriorated over the last decade as DLA Piper undertook a breathtaking expansion.

He said that when he first started working with DLA Piper in the late 1990s, the firm was a modest size and went by the name Piper Rudnick. Mr. Victor had a point person at the firm, Nicolai J. Sarad, a partner in the energy industry practice.

But as DLA Piper grew, Mr. Sarad began spending less time on his assignments, Mr. Victor said. Mr. Sarad did not respond to a request for comment.

Through acquisitions, joint ventures and the aggressive hiring of partners from other firms, DLA Piper has grown into a global monolith of 4,200 lawyers in more than 30 countries, making it the world’s largest firm by lawyer count. Last year, it posted revenue of $2.25 billion, according to The American Lawyer magazine.

“As the firm got bigger, there were all of these lawyers who I didn’t know suddenly showing up on my bills,” Mr. Victor said.

He said he was particularly irked by the routine practice of DLA Piper partners farming out assignments to the firm’s junior lawyers. He complained that this resulted in higher bills and often subpar work.

Internal DLA Piper e-mails from the Project Orange bankruptcy appear to corroborate that criticism. Lawyers on the case openly discussed the inefficient use of junior lawyers, who are known as associates. Mr. Thomson, a DLA Piper lawyer, wrote that although the firm had reduced the amount of a bill for Mr. Victor, he expected his fees to escalate.

“DLA seems to love to lowball the bills and with the number of bodies being thrown at this thing it’s going to stay stupidly high and with the absurd litigation P.O.A. has been in for years it does have lots of wrinkles,” Mr. Thomson wrote.

Later, Mr. Thomson complained that DLA Piper associates were taking too long to complete assignments. “It took all of them four days to write those motions while I did cash collateral and talked to the client and learned the facts,” Mr. Thomson wrote. “Perhaps if we paid more money we’d have skilled associates.”

The e-mails were included in the 250,000 pages of documents that were turned over to Mr. Victor by DLA Piper as part of pretrial discovery in the case. Mr. Victor said that the e-mails confirmed his worst suspicions.

His lawyer, Larry Hutcher at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, amended the countersuit last week to include a fraud claim and a request for $22.5 million in punitive damages, a number representing 1 percent of DLA Piper’s reported revenue last year.

“For the past decade, I have fought with DLA to reduce their legal bills,” Mr. Victor said. “And now I’m going to keep on fighting.”"

* Network says it is suing AT&T for breach of contract

* Early coverage ""not much different"" from cable rivals-Kurtz

* Defining mission clearly is crucial for Al Jazeera-advertisers

* Channel may need to pay distributors to reach more viewers-media exec

By Liana B. Baker and Lisa Richwine

Aug 20 (Reuters) - New cable network Al Jazeera America introduced itself to viewers on Tuesday with reports on political strife in Egypt and the impact of climate change on U.S. cities, shortly after a major pay TV distributor declined to carry the channel.

The decision by AT&T's U-verse pay-TV service stemmed from a contract dispute over terms to carry the new network, AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said. Al Jazeera responded by suing AT&T for breach of contract in Delaware Chancery Court.

Globally, Al Jazeera is seen in more than 260 million homes in 130 countries. But the new U.S. channel funded by the emir of Qatar has so far had difficulty getting distributors, in part because Al Jazeera was perceived by some as being anti-American during the Iraq war.

Before AT&T's announcement, Al Jazeera America said it would be available in more than 40 million homes, about 40 percent of U.S. pay TV households and roughly half the reach of Time Warner Inc's CNN. U-verse was launched in 2006 and had 5 million video customers at the end of June in markets such as Texas and California.

""We could not reach an agreement with the owner that we believed provided value for our customers and our business,"" AT&T spokesman Siegel said.

Al Jazeera America said in a statement AT&T had ""unilaterally"" deleted the network and ""presented us with circumstances that were untenable - an affiliate that has willfully and knowingly breached its contractual obligations.""

The network said it had ""no choice"" but to file a lawsuit over the matter.

Defining the new channel's mission clearly will be crucial for Al Jazeera to gain a foothold in the United States, according to advertisers, executives and industry experts.

In its first hour at midafternoon, Al Jazeera pledged to cover ""issues that matter to America and the world beyond."" Anchors said they would provide in-depth coverage of stories ignored by other media outlets, with bureaus in cities they considered underserved such as Nashville and Detroit.

Al Jazeera America hired ABC news veteran Kate O'Brian to be its president and hired on-air talent like CNN veterans Ali Velshi and Soledad O'Brien.

Its news coverage kicked off with reports on Egypt, a Georgia elementary school shooting and wildfires in the western United States, topics covered by cable news competitors on Tuesday. Al Jazeera America also reported on a hunger strike by inmates protesting conditions in California prisons and Kodak's plan to rebound from bankruptcy.

It turned to sports with an interview of retired slugger Gary Sheffield about baseball's steroids scandal. A show called ""Inside Story"" explored the impact of climate change on U.S. cities and working conditions in Bangladeshi factories.

Audience ratings data were not yet available.

COVERAGE DESCRIBED AS BALANCED

Media critic Howard Kurtz, speaking on rival Fox News Channel, said Al Jazeera America's early coverage was ""not much different, at least so far, than what you might see on Fox News, CNN or MSNBC."" One top story on Egypt was ""right down the middle"" in terms of balance, he said.

The network is airing six minutes of commercials per hour, below the 15 to 16 minute average on other cable news outlets. Executives indicated they are willing to lose money in the near term.

Advertisers on Tuesday included Procter & Gamble Co's Gillette for its Fusion razors and phone service provider Vonage .

U-verse is the second TV provider after Time Warner Cable to drop the network since it acquired Current TV in January and replaced it with Al Jazeera America. Comcast, DirecTV, Dish and Verizon are carrying the network.

Merrill Brown, a former media executive who helped launch cable news network MSNBC, said Al Jazeera America may need to pay distributors if it wants to reach more viewers, particularly since it is not owned by a media conglomerate that can package it with other channels to gain leverage in negotiations.

""It's hard to believe they are going to get this thing nationally distributed without paying for carriage,"" Brown said."

It’s that time of year when crazy people jump into icy cold waters. Some do it for charity, and some do it just because they’re crazy. In Reston on Saturday, the sixth annual “Freezin for a Reason Virginia Polar Dip” will occur at Lake Anne, to raise money for Camp Sunshine, a retreat for seriously ill children and their families.

A similar “Polar Plunge Winter Festival” is scheduled Saturday in Virginia Beach to benefit Special Olympics, and Triangle resident Steve Costa is participating for the second straight year. Except this year he won’t be in Virginia Beach. He is in Bagram, Afghanistan, where he manages the heavily armored MRAP vehicle program, and he is going to take the plunge with 10 to 20 other “volunteers” (his quotes) in a small pool he bought online and had shipped to Bagram.

“We are filling the pool tomorrow morning,” Costa told me in an e-mail Wednesday, “and posting a guard with the night shift for ice breaking duties!” Bagram has not had a shortage of snow this winter, as one of Costa’s photos shows, and it is forecast to be in the 30s with “either snow or rain” on Saturday.

Good times. Totally not crazy. For more on Costa and how you can help, or dive in yourself, read after the jump.

When he’s in Virginia, Costa is the Marine Corps program manager for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protect (MRAP) vehicle program. He also is a Special Olympics coach in Stafford County. Every year, the Stafford team, called “Area 11,” participates in the Polar Plunge in Virginia Beach, and Costa said Area 11 has raised the most donations in each of the last four years..

“I knew I was deploying to Afghanistan in October,” Costa wrote, ”so I made a promise to the kids that I would honor the plunge this year by plunging in the ‘Stan.”

Last year was Costa’s first plunge, and he said his costume featured the “Braveheart” battle theme, with the blue facepaint. (Not sure William Wallace had any words painted across his chest, but you never know.)

“I was a little naive,” Costa said. “I actually didn’t do my investigative work, as I assumed it was only going to be Area 11 plunging. There were over 10,000 plungers — it was awesome.”

I asked Costa why anyone would do this in Afghanistan in February. He said that one of his co-plungers is also from Virginia, Curtis Dunn.

”I would love to say that I am a motivational leader and these folks will follow me anywhere,” Costa replied. “But truth be told, these folks are real heroes sacrificing their time away from their families and loved ones to support our war fighters and they just know a good cause when they see it. Plus, I truly believe that it will take the ‘edge’ off for at least an hour — and that hour means a lot in this place.”

And if you want to try this yourself, but need a month to get ready, Special Olympics is having another one of these on March 2 in Dumfries, at Tim’s Rivershore Restaurant and Crabhouse. Around here, it could be 70 degrees that day, or it could be 10. Good luck."

The Arizona Republic

Earlier%2C House GOP leaders rejected Senate package

Reformers say Boehner%2C Ryan making effort to find solutions

Reform critics say they also plan to make their voices heard at town hall meetings

PHOENIX -- Despite the missed goals, uncertain timetable and at-times heated rhetoric in the Republican-led House of Representatives, immigration-reform supporters remain cautiously optimistic that a game plan is emerging that will have lawmakers voting on the legislation this year.

Action in the House is on hold until after Congress returns from its August recess on Sept. 9. But the five-week break, during which representatives will hold town hall meetings and otherwise gauge the feelings of their constituents, could go a long way toward determining the legislation's fate.

Immigration-rights activists this month are planning to press their case with House lawmakers. Business, religious, law-enforcement and labor groups already have been lobbying aggressively for reform. Opponents of immigration reform — which many critics call ""amnesty"" for law-breaking immigrants — also are expected to make their voices heard, but the House's inaction so far has provided little to galvanize them.

The break comes as other developments offer renewed hope for supporters of immigration reform.

While House Republican leaders flatly rejected the comprehensive immigration package that the Senate passed June 27, making it seem as though immigration reform was destined to die a slow death,it appears likely that votes on a series of bills are possible in October and that a conference committee with the Senate could be completed in December or early next year, before midterm election-year politics paralyze Capitol Hill.

Reform advocates say they detect a sincere effort by Republican leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to come up with solutions for the most vexing problems associated with the nation's broken border system, including addressing the status of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants who have already settled in the country.

At a town hall meeting last month in Racine, Wis., Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee and a possible 2016 White House hopeful, told the audience that the group ofHouse immigration bills would include one ""to legalize people who are undocumented,"" the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

Hoping to avoid the broad pathway to citizenship included in the Senate-passed plan, many House Republicans are more open to legislation without a special path for most undocumented immigrants. They are more inclined tolimit citizenship to young undocumented immigrants, known as ""dreamers,"" and leave the majority of the 11 million who have no legal status without a certain path to citizenship. The idea would allow many to work toward citizenship through existing channels, such as having their children or employers sponsor them, which would be more difficult than allowing them to apply for citizenship on their own after they received permanent residency.

While many reform backers disagree with that concept, they say it at least would provide a starting point for House and Senate negotiations on bringing undocumented immigrants out of the shadows.

Even controversial remarks, such as those made by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa — who caused a furor recently by comparing dreamers with drug runners — might wind up helping the reform movement by reminding Republicans of the political damage that immigration hard-liners can do the GOP brand among Latino voters.

Boehner called King's comments ""deeply offensive and wrong"" and contrary to the values of the American people and the Republican Party.

Since President Barack Obama's 2012 defeat of Republican Mitt Romney, many Republican leaders have said that the GOP needs to make rebuilding its relationship with Latino voters a priority.

""My sense is ... that momentum is growing,"" said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., who is part of a bipartisan House group that for months has been working on a comprehensive immigration-reform bill. ""Even, to some degree, you're beginning to hear House Republicans change their tune. It's still got a lot of sour notes in it, but at least they are now singing a tune that is talking about possibly getting this done. But it is decision time. We are watching the clock run out.""

Frustrations mount

So far, the House immigration push mostly has been a series of disappointments for supporters.

Becerra's group has yet to produce a bill, and on a recent media conference call, he acknowledged that it has taken longer than expected.

""Many of us would have preferred to have done this before the August recess,"" he said.

Others similarly had hoped that the House would pass at least one immigration-related bill — border-security legislation was seen as the likeliest candidate — before the break, but that didn't happen, either.

Boehner's criticism of the Senate bill, which passed on a 68-32 vote, and insistence that any House immigration legislation have the support of a majority of Republicans, also has complicated matters.

August could prove pivotal. Reform supporters and immigration-rights activists aim to keep up the drumbeat for a pathway to citizenship and let Congress members know that they are not giving up.

""The August recess is very important because ... we're trying to make it clear to our Republican colleagues, including those in Arizona, that we'd like for them to pass the legislation that they think is best,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the lead GOP negotiator on the Senate bill. ""Then, we would look forward to a conference and trying to meet the concerns of both sides and come up with legislation. I believe we all share the conclusion that the status quo is unacceptable.""

Promise Arizona, a pro-reform organization founded in opposition to the controversial 2010 state immigration law known as Senate Bill 1070, and a coalition of 22 other groups this month plan to step up the pressure on Republican members of Arizona's House delegation.

In June, Promise Arizona sent flower bouquets to McCain and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., to thank them for writing and helping to pass the Senate bill.

""Republicans need to see (immigration reform) as an opportunity,"" said Petra Falcon, Promise Arizona's executive director. ""It's an opportunity for the GOP to turn around its image and get to working on other things. Immigration reform should be an easy answer.""

Critics of immigration reform say they intend to make their own points at town halls this month.

""We're planning on making all of the events of the congressmen and congresswomen,"" said Tim Rafferty, president of the group RidersUSA, a Phoenix-area organization that recently put up a billboard promoting Flake's role in ""the Flake-Obama amnesty."" The group is part of a coalition called ""Remember 1986"" for the year a previous law provided amnesty to nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants.

'It's not going to be pretty'

While the scope of the mobilization of immigration foes remains to be seen, one leading reform advocate said supporters have a ""tremendous amount of activity"" planned around the country.

""We're pretty confident that we'll come out of the summer with momentum and we're optimistic that the House of Republicans are going to find a way to get to 'yes,'"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based organization America's Voice. ""It's not going to bepretty and it's not going to be quick, but I really do think that they get that doing nothing is not an option ... that as a political party they can't deny that a majority of the people want reform and that a mobilized majority of Latinos want respect.""

Sharry noted that the blowback from King's derogatory comments about dreamers already was overshadowing the strides made by McCain, Flake and other Republicans who backed the Senate immigration bill. Sharry and Flake both said the controversy should provide House Republicans extra motivation to get immigration reform done.

""I don't think most Republicans want to be tarred with that brush, and most Republicans don't feel that way,"" Flake said. ""But when people like Steve King keep saying things like that it, unfortunately, kind of puts everybody in the same category. I think people want to resist that and want to do something to show that we want to move ahead.""

Other observers also said that there may be cause for cautious optimism about immigration reform's chances in the House.

The Senate took a top-down approach, with a group of influential senators leading the way, while the House is taking more of a bottom-up approach, but House Republicans are grappling with the issues and asking ""what can we do, how far can we stretch,"" said Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a coalition of business groups that backs immigration reform.

More Republicans are talking about a way to achieve legal status for undocumented immigrants without a special path to citizenship, Jacoby said. And from her perspective, the House's take on workplace enforcement, a lower-skilled worker program and border security might turn out better than the Senate's.

""The House could come through in ways that really would advance the ball and be helpful and be part of the solution,"" she said. ""It's not going to be the Senate way, but I don't think the question is going to be the Senate way or nothing.""

Which has led some viewers to ask: Does this mean that broadcast TV will turn into a rat’s nest of foul language and naked bodies? Teacher is away, so there might be orgies on “Castle.” No oversight, so that means f-bombs on “The X-Factor.” CBS might turn into HBO.

Anarchy rules, bro!

Well, not so fast. Yes, it is true that the FCC has closed up shop, telling roughly 1,700 workers not to bother coming in. Bureaucrats being bureaucrats, the good folks there even published a memo -- an inaction plan, if you will -- detailing how they would shut down in “orderly” fashion. Read it here if you dare.

But thinking that an FCC closure means everyone on “Big Bang Theory” strips down is like thinking that the government shutdown means no more taxes (yes, exactly, say some conservatives -- but that’s another story).

Odds are good that the FCC is going to come back again someday. And when it does, it will begin fielding complaints again -- including those from viewers who took notes during the shutdown. A funding-related door-shuttering doesn’t overturn federal law or cancel the FCC’s mandate. It also doesn’t mean that the FCC can’t revoke the license of any broadcaster who flouts its rules, shutdown or no.

PHOTOS: Seven odd casualties of the government shutdown

In fact, there’s evidence that during a shutdown, the FCC commissioners work anyway. That’s the contention of former commissioner Susan Ness, who wrote that when Westinghouse was merging with CBS in 1995, the agency chiefs kept working on merger issues straight through that shutdown, when House Republicans were battling President Clinton.

So for anyone on network TV, the message might be, swear today, pay tomorrow.

Now get back to work.

“The fact that the president and the vice president are hosting illegal immigrants in the White House while constricting citizen tours and refusing to meet with immigration officers says it all,” Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said in a statement to FoxNews.com Friday. “The White House will not even grant ICE officers a low-level White House meeting but invites illegal immigrants into the Oval Office.”

Obama and Vice President Biden met Tuesday with eight advocates of immigration legislation, which is making its way through Congress. Three of the participants were listed in the White House readout as having “deferred action” -- a term that means they were granted a reprieve, likely via the administration directive last year that allowed some illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to avoid deportation and seek work authorization.

Some Republicans are open to ultimately granting permanent legal status to these and other undocumented immigrants. But Sessions, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., both complained that the president is at the same time snubbing the law enforcement officials tasked with enforcing U.S. border policies.

Sessions and Goodlatte sent a letter to Obama Thursday asking why the White House had not responded to repeated requests to meet with representatives from the National ICE Council, the union that represents more than 7,000 customs enforcement officers.

More On This...

According to the letter, the ICE union has been trying to snag a meeting at the White House for three months to discuss the immigration overhaul, to no avail.

“To be effective any immigration reform bill must heed the warnings from our federal immigration agents,” the lawmakers wrote. “Unfortunately, far from being included in the process, ICE officers have been shut out and have even had their day-to-day operations handcuffed by DHS officials to the point of being unable to carry out their sworn duties.”

The White House refutes the claims, though, and says it has made itself available to multiple immigration enforcement officers over the past few months -- if not the ICE union specifically.

On May 14, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Director of National Drug Control Policy R. Gil Kerlikowske were among administration officials who sat down with law enforcement officers from across the country. During the meeting, Napolitano and Kerlikowske pushed for broad immigration reform and touted the White House’s investments in personnel and technology targeted to keep the borders safe.

The meeting came three months after another Washington gathering with Napolitano and White House Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Munoz. In that meeting, Munoz outlined the principles at the heart of Obama’s immigration proposal which included cracking down on employers who hire undocumented workers and creating a pathway to citizenship.

But Chris Crane, president of the ICE union, has made clear dating back to February that he wants his group to be as involved with immigration legislation as other business and advocacy groups have been.

Obama may have other reasons for avoiding a meeting -- members of the union have filed suit against Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, claiming they're being prevented from doing their jobs.

The union has started to actively lobby against the current Senate bill, citing concerns that current gaps in enforcement will only be perpetuated. They were joined this week by the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, which represents 12,000 federal immigration officers at the USCIS.

On Tuesday, a Senate committee passed the so-called Gang of Eight immigration bill. The legislation would still have to be approved by the full Senate.

On the House side, Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor warned Thursday that they would not rubber-stamp the legislation.

“The House remains committed to fixing our broken immigration system, but we will not simply take up and accept the bill that is emerging in the Senate if it passes,” Boehner and Cantor said in a joint statement."

“There’s no winning,” Obama told reporters before ordering lunch at a favorite haunt near the White House. “No one is winning.”

The president’s rare midday stroll outside the White House came as he tried to contain the fallout from a senior administration official’s comment that the White House was “winning” in the budget fight that has frozen parts of the government. ”It doesn’t really matter to us” how long the shutdown lasts, the official told The Wall Street Journal. “Because what matters is the end result.”

Aides disavowed the comment Friday morning, Day Four of the shutdown, before Obama and Biden took to the streets for the impromptu hoagie run. Jacketless and shirt-sleeves rolled up, the men were cheered on by pedestrians as they walked. “Hang tough, Mr. President” one person yelled. “You’re doing the right thing.”

LIVE UPDATES: Day four of the shutdown

At Taylor Gourmet, standing between a sign saying “Order Here” and a poster that read “Love,” Obama praised the restaurant for offering furloughed employees a 10% discount, but said the shutdown “could be over today.” “I’m happy to have negotiations, but we can’t do it with a gun held to the head of the American people,” he said.

The president has turned to Taylor’s Philadelphia-style hoagies during tough times with Congress before. In May 2012, as he tried to win support for his economic proposals, the president fetched takeout from Taylor for a meeting of the top four congressional leaders.

The meeting and the sandwiches did little to move his proposals along.

Members of the House Ways and Means Committee grilled Steven Miller, who has resigned as acting commissioner but is still on the job until Wednesday, why he made no mention of the problems in letters and testimony to Congress, despite being aware of the issue.

“How can we conclude that you did not mislead this committee?” asked a visibly agitated Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.)

“I did not mislead the committee,” Miller said. “I stand by my answer then. I stand by my answer now.”

Miller said the queries from lawmakers in 2012 asked if the IRS was “targeting” conservative groups for intensive questioning and prolonged delays in their applications for 501(c)4 nonprofit status.

“When you talk about targeting, it’s a pejorative term,” Miller said. He later said “targeting” was a “loaded term,” ascribing partisan motives to what he said was a flawed work process.

“I can say generally, we provided horrible customer service here,” Miller later said. “I will admit that. We did horrible customer service. … Whether it was politically motivated or not is a very different question.”

The agency did not publicly disclose the problem until May 10, when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS’ exempt organizations division, apologized at a tax law conference, an unorthodox venue for such an admission.

Just two days earlier, Lerner had testified in front of a Ways and Means subcommittee and made no mention of the issue.

Lerner was asked by Celia Roady, a member of the agency’s advisory board for tax-exempt entities, how the agency was dealing with applications from 501(c)4 groups.

Miller said Friday that the question was anticipated and Lerner’s answer was prepared in advance.

Seems the concert was put together on behalf of China National Petroleum Corp. for the entertainment of their executives working in Turkmenistan, according to a statement from J.Lo’s rep obtained by E! News, and “was not a government sponsored event or political in nature.”

“The event was vetted by her representatives, had there been knowledge of human rights issues of any kind, Jennifer would not have attended,” the statement continued. However, the corporation folks made a last-minute request for a “birthday greeting” before the singer took the stage, and President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov got a 56th birthday serenade.

The Human Rights Foundation criticized the performance in a strongly worded statement released Sunday, prompting the apology. According to the nonprofit, Berdymukhamedov has “ruled the country with an iron fist since 2006.”

The HRF statement, which listed the country’s alleged rights abuses and cited other groups’ rankings of the country among “the worst of the worst,” was not without a bit of snark.

“Lopez obviously has the right to earn a living performing for the dictator of her choice and his circle of cronies, but her actions utterly destroy the carefully-crafted message she has cultivated with her prior involvement with Amnesty International’s programs in Mexico aimed at curbing violence against women,” said the foundation’s president, Thor Halvorssen. “What is the next stop on her tour, Syria? The dictator of Kazakhstan’s birthday is July 6, maybe she will also pay him a visit?” Halvorssen asked.

TIMELINE: Summer’s must see concerts

It’s not the first time Lopez has found herself a focus of international attention linked to a concert in a situation where human-rights abuses have been alleged.

In July 2010, Lopez canceled a performance that was to celebrate the opening of a hotel in the breakaway northern part of the island of Cyprus. Some saw Lopez’s planned performance as an endorsement of the self-declared state.

“Jennifer Lopez would never knowingly support any state, country, institution or regime that was associated with any form of human rights abuse,” said a statement issued at the time of the cancellation.

That gig, scheduled for J.Lo’s 41st birthday, reportedly would’ve come with a $3-million paycheck.

Mr. Kerry, who is a Vietnam veteran, a former presidential nominee and the son of a diplomat, will be inheriting a difficult agenda. The conflict in Syria has killed more than 60,000 people. The international envoy on the Syrian crisis, Lakhdar Brahimi, who reported to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, has made no headway. Egypt is in turmoil. By Mr. Kerry’s own account, relations with Russia have deteriorated.

As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee during Mr. Obama’s first term, Mr. Kerry was a loyal ally of the White House and served as an interlocutor with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, among others.

During a nearly four-hour confirmation hearing last week, Mr. Kerry demonstrated familiarity with a broad range of issues, but he did not present any new ideas on how to address them.

Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose last day as secretary of state is Friday, said at a global forum at the Newseum on Tuesday that she expected Mr. Kerry to undertake a new effort to narrow differences between Israel and the Palestinians."

George W. Bush will return to the spotlight this week for the dedication of his presidential library, an event likely to trigger fresh public debate about his eight fateful years in office. But he reemerges with a better public image than when he left Washington more than four years ago.

Since then, Bush has absented himself from both policy disputes and political battles. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that the passage of time and Bush’s relative invisibility have been beneficial to a chief executive who left office surrounded by controversy.

Days before his second term ended in 2009, Bush’s approval rating among all adults was 33 percent positive and 66 percent negative. The new poll found 47 percent saying they approve and 50 percent saying they disapprove. Among registered voters, his approval rating today is equal to President Obama’s, at 47 percent, according to the latest Post-ABC surveys.

Majorities said they still dis­approve of Bush’s performance on the Iraq war and the economy, but his economic approval numbers nearly doubled between December 2008 and today, from 24 percent to 43 percent, with 53 percent disapproving. Iraq remains the most troublesome part of his legacy. Today, 57 percent say they disapprove of his decision to invade, though that is down from 65 percent in the spring of 2008, the last time the question was asked.

Historians say it will take years, even decades, for any substantial revision of his presidency to take place. Bush has said he is content to let history judge him and told the designers of his presidential museum to present the facts and let visitors decide whether he was right. But some allies see Thursday’s official opening of the library in Dallas as an opportunity to begin to set his presidency into broader perspective.

View Graphic Public warms to George W. Bush's presidential legacy

“Obviously, it’s a big moment for him,” former British prime minister Tony Blair said in a telephone interview from London. “It’s a chance for him to explain that his political philosophy encompasses much more than the decisions he had to take after 9/11. We forget this sometimes. . . . This is a much more rounded person with many more dimensions to him than the caricature often portrays.”

Contemporary judgments of Bush’s presidency have been harsh. The war in Iraq, which he launched on the basis of faulty intelligence in the aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, left this country deeply divided. His final months in office brought a collapse of the financial system that led to the worst recession since the Great Depression. In between, his administration’s wobbly response to Hurricane Katrina damaged his image.

But Bush will return to public view at a moment when some parts of his record are being viewed more charitably. His advocacy for immigration reform and his relative success at attracting Hispanic votes, for example, are now seen as a model for a Republican Party that has awakened to its glaring deficit in the Latino community.

Thursday’s events are likely to be shorn of partisanship, though commentary around them may not be. The guest list will be topped by Obama and all living former presidents, including Bush’s father, George H.W. Bush. Blair, who stood steadfastly with Bush after the 2001 attacks and his decision to invade Iraq 18 months later, will be among the many dignitaries and Bush administration alumni who will gather on the campus of Southern Methodist University.

Karen Hughes, who served as counselor to Bush, said the former president told her that he considers the day “a joyful opportunity to give thanks” — to the other presidents for being there, to those who served in his administration, to the workers who built the architecturally handsome Bush Center.

Former advisers say no one should expect the opening of the library and museum to bring a notable change in Bush’s generally low-profile post-presidency. “It’s a little too simplistic to say this is some big coming out or that some definitive change will happen that will mark a new approach to things by Bush or his people,” said Karl Rove, who served as Bush’s chief political adviser and White House deputy chief of staff.

Still, members of Bush’s team recognize the significance of the moment and are prepared to take on some of his critics, if necessary, amid the glare of media attention this week. “Clearly some pretty significant distortions have been fostered by the current president and others,” Hughes said. “Those of us who worked for him see it [the dedication ceremony] as an opportunity to set the record straight in some cases.”

Bush advisers believe that over time, more attention will focus on aspects of his presidency that were overshadowed by the controversies of his national security and economic records. They point to his initiative to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa, which has helped save hundreds of thousands of lives; his efforts to bring accountability and higher standards to public education; and his advocacy for comprehensive immigration reform, which was rejected by his party.

Bush’s decision to stay out of the public arena in recent years reflects his humility and his belief that he owed his successor “a decent interval of silence,” as Rove called it. He played no role in the 2012 campaign, neither attending the Republican National Convention last summer nor campaigning for Mitt Romney last fall. But there was no clamor among the Republican candidates for his participation.

Instead, Bush has quietly pursued activities that grew out of his presidential agenda. Much of that work, focusing on global health, the role of women in the Middle East, education and the economy, is carried out through the Bush Institute, which was founded in 2009 and shares the 23-acre site at SMU with the presidential library and museum.

The institute and the new museum are designed to highlight the values and principles that guided Bush in office. “Freedom is really the one central axis around which everything revolves,” said Mark Langdale, president of the George W. Bush Foundation.

Bush and former first lady Laura Bush have spent time in Africa on projects related to the AIDS initiative and other health issues. The former president also spends considerable time with wounded veterans and has participated with them in vigorous mountain-biking expeditions. He has taken up painting. He and his wife recently became grandparents for the first time.

He gave 70 speeches last year and plans 60 or so this year, according to Dan Bartlett, who was counselor to Bush in the White House. The paid speeches are all off the record, but one adviser said Bush is extremely candid in the question-and-answer sessions. He and former president Bill Clinton have done a series of joint appearances.

Last week’s Boston Marathon bombing was a tragic reminder of the episode that changed Bush’s presidency. After 9/11, Bush ­implemented aggressive ­anti-

terrorism policies, many of which were embraced by the Obama administration, though not the controversial interrogation measures authorized under Bush. A recent report by the Constitution Project concluded that those policies resulted in torture of some detainees.

Some Bush allies say Obama has gone out of his way to be critical of his predecessor and often has not acknowledged what they contend were key policies that have been helpful to him. They highlight two decisions by the former president that have proved beneficial to Obama in office: One was the troop surge in Iraq, which was highly controversial at the time but which, they contend, made it possible for Obama to end the war as quickly as he did.

The other was Bush’s decision in the fall of 2008 to press Congress to pass the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) to bail out financial institutions. That was equally controversial, especially among Bush’s fellow Republicans, but his advisers argue that it helped stabilize the financial system before Obama took office.

“Both reflected strong presidential leadership and, as we now see in retrospect, excellent judgment,” said Joshua Bolten, who served as Bush’s White House chief of staff.

Bolten also noted that spending during most years of Bush’s presidency was below 20 percent of gross domestic product, the target now established by House Republicans in their budget blueprint. No president since Richard M. Nixon, other than Clinton, can make such a claim, he said.

But on fiscal issues, Bush draws criticism from both left and right. Tea party Republicans regard him as a reckless spender. Democrats say his tax cuts and two wars that were not paid for helped create larger deficits, though Obama accepted making the bulk of those cuts permanent last December.

Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the country would be happy to have the deficit levels of Bush’s presidency, but she declined to praise his overall record. She said that his record on neither tax cuts nor spending “was particularly fiscally responsible.”

Bush has continued to bear much of the culpability for the condition of the economy. On Election Day last November, 53 percent of voters said they blamed Bush for the current economic problems, while 38 percent blamed Obama, according to exit polls.

Iraq looms larger than perhaps any other issue over Bush’s legacy, but Blair said the former president’s attitude toward his decisions has not changed. “There was never any doubt while he was in office, and there’s not any doubt now,” he said.

Blair said Bush continues to believe that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein in power and added: “When you see what is happening in Syria today, the sense of that argument is evident. . . . What it does is just make clear that these decisions are very difficult. If you intervene, it can be very tough. If you don’t intervene, it can also be very tough.”

One section of the Bush museum, known as the Decision Points Theater, focuses on four key decisions: the invasion of Iraq, the troop surge, the financial crisis and the response to Hurricane Katrina. Visitors will hear the information available to the president at the time and then choose what they would do in each case. Bush, on video, will explain his decisions.

Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University recently toured the Bush museum; he called it “beautifully designed” but predicted that it would spark controversy. “It’s going to be mocked and trashed by liberal Democrats, and conservative Republicans are going to say what a marvelous place it is,” he said. As for Bush’s potential place in history, he said, “It’s going to be hard for him to rehabilitate fully.”

Stanford University’s David Kennedy predicted that judgments about Bush are not likely to change unless perceptions of Iraq and what triggered the financial crisis change first. Presidents are judged on foreign policy and economic policy, he said, adding: “In neither one of those areas do I see anything on the horizon that will change people’s opinion.”

But H.W. Brands, a professor of history at the University of Texas, said it’s quite possible that Bush’s legacy could undergo a genuine reworking as time passes. “The worse a president’s reputation when he leaves office, the better chance there is for revision,” he said. “Every so often there’s a new generation of historians, and they have to come along and challenge the conventional wisdom.”

Story highlights 40,000 measures set to become law in 2014 Obamacare mandate is the big federal law going into effect But states and cities have laws impacting minimum wage, shark fins and gender identity New gun control failed at federal level, but Connecticut acting on its own

(CNN) —

Not everyone subscribes to a New Year’s resolution, but Americans will be required to follow new laws in 2014.

Some 40,000 measures taking effect range from sweeping, national mandates under Obamacare to marijuana legalization in Colorado, drone prohibition in Illinois and transgender protections in California.

Although many new laws are controversial, they made it through legislatures, public referendum or city councils and represent the shifting composition of American beliefs.

Federal: Health care, of course, and vending machines

The biggest and most politically charged change comes at the federal level with the imposition of a new fee for those adults without health insurance.

For 2014, the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income, whichever results in a larger fine.

The Obamacare, or Affordable Care Act, mandate also requires that insurers cover immunizations and some preventive care.

Additionally, millions of poor Americans will receive Medicaid benefits starting January 1.

Thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines.

Local: Guns, family leave and shark fins

Connecticut: While no national legislation was approved to tighten gun laws a year after the Newtown school shooting, Connecticut is implementing a final round of changes to its books: All assault weapons and large capacity magazines must be registered.

Oregon: Family leave in Oregon has been expanded to allow eligible employees two weeks of paid leave to handle the death of a family member.

California: Homeless youth are eligible to receive food stamps. The previous law had a minimum wage requirement.

Delaware: Delaware is the latest in a growing number of states where residents can no longer possess, sell or distribute shark fins, which is considered a delicacy in some East Asian cuisine.

Illinois and drones

Illinois: passed two laws limiting the use of drones. One prohibits them from interfering with hunters and fisherman. The measure passed after the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said it would use drones to monitor hunters. PETA said it aims through its “air angels” effort to protect against “cruel” and “illegal” hunting.

Also in Illinois, another law prohibits the use of drones for law enforcement without a warrant.

Gender and voting identity

California: Students can use bathrooms and join school athletic teams “consistent with their gender identity,” even if it’s different than their gender at birth.

Arkansas: The state becomes the latest state requiring voters show a picture ID at the voting booth.

Minimum wage and former felon employment

Workers in 13 states and four cities will see increases to the minimum wage.

While most amount to less than 15 cents per hour, workers in places like New Jersey and Connecticut will see a slightly larger increase.

New Jersey residents voted to raise the state’s minimum wage by $1 to $8.25 per hour. And in Connecticut, lawmakers voted to raise it between 25 and 75 cents to $8.70. The wage would go up to $8 in Rhode Island and New York.

California is also raising its minimum wage to $9 per hour, but workers must wait until July to see the addition.

Rhode Island: It is the latest state to prohibit employers from requiring job applicants to signify if they have a criminal record on a job application.

Social media and pot

Oregon: Employers and schools can’t require a job or student applicant to provide passwords to social media accounts.

Colorado: Marijuana becomes legal in the state for buyers over 21 at a licensed retail dispensary.

In a brief, three-line order Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Gary Feess formally lifted the binding agreement the U.S. Department of Justice imposed on the LAPD in 2001, which spelled out dozens of major reforms the police agency had to implement and frequent audits it was required to undergo by a monitor who reported to Feess.

The dismissal of the so-called consent decree, which arose largely out of the Rampart corruption scandal and addressed basic problems of accountability that stretched back decades, delivered a largely symbolic, but nonetheless important milestone for the LAPD as it continues to disassociate itself from a past marked by abuses and turmoil. Following revelations in 1999 that officers assigned to the LAPD’s Rampart Division were implicated in serious misconduct, including physical abuse of suspects, evidence tampering and perjury, public trust in the police plummeted and federal officials responded to calls from a growing chorus of critics for intervention.

L.A. NOW LIVE: Discuss what comes next at 9 a.m.

Though many in the department bitterly disliked the idea of federal oversight, Department of Justice officials threatened to sue the city for complete control of the LAPD if department and city officials resisted the idea of the consent decree.

“In these last 12 years the Los Angeles Police Department did not just comply with the consent decree, they took it to heart. They used it as a guide to change their culture,” Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said at a late afternoon news conference with Police Chief Charlie Beck and members of the Police Commission, the civilian board that oversees the department. “The entire department, from the officers on the beat in the neighborhoods to the top brass downtown, have made these reforms their reforms.”

Although his predecessor, Bernard Parks, was lukewarm on it, former Chief William J. Bratton, who ran the department from late 2002 to 2009, embraced the consent decree. An outsider hired on his reputation for overhauling large, troubled police departments, Bratton used the decree as a ready-made blueprint for remaking the LAPD. Under the terms of the decree, the LAPD was required to revamp its tools for tracking officer misconduct, investigations into cases involving force by officers, training, an independent watchdog office and more.

In 2006, however, as the decree was set to expire, Feess angrily rebuked the department for what he found to be its slow pace of reform and extended the decree for five years.

As the years wore on, Bratton and other senior LAPD officials grew increasingly impatient with the judge’s refusal to loosen his grip on the department and called openly to be let out from under the consent decree. The department, they argued, had implemented the vast majority of the reforms called for in the decree, proved its ability to operate responsibly and needed the freedom to run on its own. Bratton pointed out frequently that about two-thirds of the department’s roughly 10,000 officers had joined the force while it was under the decree — a sign, he said, that the department had, in fact, broken with its unsavory past.

On the eve of Bratton’s departure, Feess relented and approved a transitional plan that called on the Los Angeles Police Commission, which oversees the LAPD, to assume responsibility for keeping tabs on the department’s efforts to fully implement the few issues that had not yet been completely addressed. If Department of Justice lawyers were unsatisfied with the commission’s oversight, the agreement allowed them to object and bring the department back before Feess.

With Wednesday’s order, Feess severed that remaining authority, leaving the LAPD fully as its own master for the first time in 12 years. With the transition agreement completed, Feess had been waiting for Department of Justice officials to file necessary paperwork before taking his final step, police officials said.

Hector Villagra, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, praised Bratton, Beck and Villaraigosa for their “stewardship” in seeing the consent decree through. The reform package, he said in a statement, has “accomplished its purpose by and large. This is no longer your father’s Los Angeles Police Department. The LAPD has made serious culture changes.”

Advertisement

Villagra, however, cautioned that the department must guard against backsliding into its old ways and had more work to do on “persistent racial disparities in policing” and officers’ treatment of homeless people.

Andrea Ordin, the president of Police Commission, echoed Villagra, saying at the news conference that “there’s lots more to do, we know that. But it should be done by the department.”

Beck credited the department’s officers for adopting the changes imposed on them from the outside. He reserved special praise for an advisor, Gerald Chaleff, who worked closely with him and Bratton on putting the decree in place. “Without him, this new day would never have dawned,” Beck said of Chaleff.

“The consent decree has made this a department that I am proud to hand over to my children,” said Beck, who has a daughter and son on the force. “It has been the catalyst for incredible change in my Police Department. We’ve become accountable, we’ve become transparent and we’ve become more effective than we’ve ever been.”

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Led by conservative Republicans and whipped into a froth by right-wing radio talk-show hosts, opponents of reform are banking on derailing the measure with a strategy of delay and dismemberment.

The focus of these efforts is the House, where many Republican backbenchers remain unsold on immigration reform despite the party’s disastrous loss of the Latino vote in 2012.

On Thursday, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and an opponent of a pathway to citizenship, served notice that the delay-and-dismemberment plan was under way. Rather than wait for a comprehensive immigration bill to wend its way through the Senate, or for a roughly similar plan to emerge from a bipartisan group in the House, Mr. Goodlatte said his committee would consider a series of smaller bills.

That strategy gives conservatives a chance to say they were for immigration reform before they were against it. They may vote for bills that would tighten border security, provide a steady source of migrant farm workers and expand a program that companies may use to verify the immigration status of employees. Then, decrying “amnesty,” they can shoot down measures that would extend legal status and eventual citizenship to most of the undocumented.

In poll after poll, large majorities of Americans say they favor granting legal status to illegal immigrants, most of whom have been in the country for more than a decade and are vital to the U.S. economy. Even if some conservatives cling to the idea of “self-deportation,” most Americans acknowledge that 11 million people cannot be bullied into leaving the country and should not be left in legal limbo.

Recognizing that, a number of Republican leaders have taken the lead in pushing for a comprehensive bill, courageously urging their party to drop the myth of mass deportation. In effect, these lawmakers are pleading with their colleagues not to commit long-term electoral suicide by continuing to alienate the nation’s fastest-growing minority voting bloc. Still, they face a struggle.

The most prominent among these leaders is Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a putative contender for the party’s presidential nomination in 2016, who is taking abuse on conservative talk radio for having helped draft the Senate bill. Mr. Rubio has been joined by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who appeared last week at a series of events in Chicago, plugging a comprehensive approach alongside a pro-reform Democrat, Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (Ill.).

“We need it for national security reasons. We need it for the economy,” Mr. Ryan said. “We do not want to have a society where we have different classes of people who cannot reach their American dream by not being a full citizen.”

This is common sense, but it is also the kind of talk that has been unwelcome in many Republican circles. The question is whether the GOP, after so many years of denial, is capable of weaning itself from its delusions."

He later was pressured to walk back some of his remarks, but after winning the Open Championship on Sunday–and earning $1.43 million–Mickelson may have to reassess his options.

Mickelson backed off after complaining about the California state tax rate being raised to 13.3 percent for those earning over $1 million, which occurred when voters approved of Proposition 30 in November of 2012. ESPN reported regularly that Texas’s zero percent state income tax rate, for example, may have had a role in pushing Dwight Howard to ultimately sign with the Houston Rockets (see Breitbart Sports’ table of state taxes before California’s hike). Forbes Magazine is now reminding Mickelson that California will benefit greatly from Mickelson’s British Open win Sunday. Tiger Woods is another athlete who has publicly said he moved out of California, where he was born and raised, because of the state’s high tax rate.

One report suggests Mickelson may pay over 60 percent of his $1.43 million out in taxes to the UK, IRS and California. As Breitbart Sports reported, athletes are taxed based on where they earn the money (away games go to the state in which a game was played, etc.), but whether California collects their 13.3 percent of the $1.43 million since Mickelson decided not to leave the state is small change compared to what California may get from him after the win in Scotland.

Forbes points out the that the bigger impact of Mickelson’s win will be in extending and potentially even expanding the $36 million a year he gets from endorsements from companies such as KPMG, Barclays, and Callaway. If the British Open win increases his sponsorship by just $2 million, California would receive $5 million in state taxes from him.

The $5 million tax payoff the state of California could receive from Mickelson almost matches the $5.8 million the state could continue to keep after Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson was able to stop the Kings from moving to Washington, where the players would have kept the $5.8 million a year even under their relatively low $44 million team salary."

* Xibrom drug said to be marketed for unapproved uses

* Settlement announced amid Bausch & Lomb merger talks

By Jonathan Stempel

May 24 (Reuters) - Ista Pharmaceuticals Inc pleaded guilty on Friday to charges it used kickbacks and improper marketing to boost sales of a drug meant to treat eye pain and agreed to pay $33.5 million to settle criminal and civil liability, the U.S. Department of Justice said.

The unit of eye care company Bausch & Lomb pleaded guilty to conspiracy to offer kickbacks to induce physicians to prescribe Xibrom, a drug meant to treat pain after cataract surgery, and conspiracy to promote that drug for unapproved uses, including after Lasik and glaucoma surgeries.

Ista agreed as part of a criminal settlement to a $16.63 million fine and an $1.85 million asset forfeiture. It also agreed to a $15 million civil settlement to resolve allegations that its marketing of Xibrom caused false claims to be submitted to government health care programs.

As part of the settlement, Ista will be barred from participating in Medicare and Medicaid, and Bausch & Lomb agreed to strengthen its compliance and ethics procedures.

""The fact that Ista offered doctors illegal inducements - such as a wine tasting, golf outings, and payments to attend what were in essence marketing sessions - makes the company's illegal conduct particularly deserving of the hefty penalty Ista has agreed to pay,"" U.S. Attorney William Hochul in Buffalo, New York said in a statement.

Ista pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara in Buffalo.

Bausch & Lomb, which is based in Rochester, New York, said it was pleased to settle the matter, which involved conduct between January 2006 and March 2011, and that it knew of the government probe well before it purchased Ista.

That purchase closed in June 2012 and Bausch and Lomb plans to wind down the Ista corporate entity by year end.

The civil settlement resolves claims filed under the False Claims Act, which lets private parties known as whistleblowers sue on the U.S. government's behalf and share in recoveries.

Keith Schenker, a whistleblower who had been an Ista sales representative in Brooklyn and Queens counties in New York, will receive $2.5 million of the settlement amount, according to the Justice Department and court papers.

Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc is nearing an agreement to buy Bausch & Lomb from Warburg Pincus LLC for about $9 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. News about that transaction surfaced at about the same time that the settlement was announced.

The criminal case is U.S. v. Ista Pharmaceuticals Inc, U.S. District Court, Western District of New York, No. 13-cr-00099. The whistleblower case, which was unsealed on Friday, is U.S. ex rel. Schenker v. Ista Pharmaceuticals in the same court, No. 07-00372."

Despite the fanfare -- and the spectacle of senators lingering for hours into the weekend to vote on dozens of amendments before the final tally -- the budget passed by the smallest of margins, 50-49. Four Democrats facing tough re-elections voted against it.

The resolution also stands no chance of passing Congress in its current form. The nonbinding but politically symbolic measure caters to party stalwarts on the liberal edge of the spectrum just as the House GOP measure is crafted to appeal to more recent tea party arrivals.

The vote, though, follows four years of pressure and taunting by House Republicans who excoriated the Senate for failing to approve a formal year-long budget throughout most of President Obama's first term. The government has been limping by on a series of partial-year budget bills, the latest of which was approved this week to fund the rest of fiscal 2013.

The final vote early Saturday morning was preceded by a marathon session of votes on dozens of amendments to the 2014 budget proposal. Many of the proposals were offered in hopes of inflicting political damage on Democratic senators up for re-election in GOP-leaning states like Alaska and Louisiana.

The two main budget proposals produced by Senate Democrats and House Republicans are miles apart. The Senate plan does not attempt to balance the budget at all, though it does claim to reduce the deficit by imposing nearly $1 trillion in tax increases on top of more than $600 billion in higher taxes on top earners enacted in January. It also includes $875 billion in spending cuts, generated by modest cuts to federal health care programs, domestic agencies and the Pentagon and reduced government borrowing costs.

The House plan -- by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., his party's vice presidential candidate last year -- claims $4 trillion more in savings over the period than Senate Democrats by imposing major cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and other safety net programs for the needy. It would also transform the Medicare health care program for seniors into a voucher-like system for future recipients.

""We have presented very different visions for how our country should work and who it should work for,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Budget Committee. ""But I am hopeful that we can bridge this divide.""

Congressional budgets are planning documents that leave actual changes in revenues and spending for later legislation, and this was the first the Democratic-run Senate has approved in four years. That is testament to the political and mathematical contortions needed to write fiscal plans in an era of record-breaking deficits that until this year exceeded an eye-popping $1 trillion annually, and to the parties' profoundly conflicting views.

""I believe we're in denial about the financial condition of our country,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, top Republican on the Budget panel, said of Democratic efforts to boost spending on some programs. ""Trust me, we've got to have some spending reductions.""

Though the shortfalls have shown signs of easing slightly and temporarily, there is no easy path to the two parties finding compromise -- which the first months of 2013 have amply illustrated.

Already this year, Congress has raised taxes on top earners after narrowly averting tax boosts on virtually everyone else, tolerated $85 billion in automatic spending cuts, temporarily sidestepped a federal default and prevented a potential government shutdown.

By sometime this summer, the government's borrowing limit will have to be extended again -- or a default will be at risk -- and it is unclear what Republicans may demand for providing needed votes. It is also uncertain how the two parties will resolve the differences between their two budgets, something many believe simply won't happen.

Both sides have expressed a desire to reduce federal deficits. But President Barack Obama is demanding a combination of tax increases and spending cuts to do so, while GOP leaders say they won't consider higher revenues but want serious reductions in Medicare and other benefit programs that have rocketed deficits skyward.

Obama plans to release his own 2014 budget next month, an unveiling that will be studied for whether it signals a willingness to engage Republicans in negotiations or play political hardball.

In a long day that began Friday morning, senators plodded through scores of amendments -- all of them non-binding but some delivering potent political messages.

They voted in favor of giving states more powers to collect sales taxes on online purchases their citizens make from out-of-state Internet companies, and to endorse the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that is to pump oil from Canada to Texas refineries.

They also approved amendments voicing support for eliminating the $2,500 annual cap on flexible spending account contributions imposed by Obama's health care overhaul, and for charging regular postal rates for mailings by political parties, which currently qualify for the lower prices paid by non-profits.

In a rebuke to one of the Senate's most conservative members, they overwhelmingly rejected a proposal by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to cut even deeper than the House GOP budget and eliminate deficits in just five years.

The Democratic budget envisions $975 billion in unspecified new taxes over the coming 10 years. There would be an equal amount of spending reductions coming chiefly from health programs, defense and reduced interest payments as deficits get smaller than previously anticipated.

This year's projected deficit of nearly $900 billion would fall to around $700 billion next year and bottom out near $400 billion in 2016 before trending upward again.

Shoehorned into the package is $100 billion for public works projects and other programs aimed at creating jobs.

In a letter delivered to the White House on Thursday, journalists from a variety of media organizations protested limits that often prevent them from taking photos of Obama. The letter questioned why only White House-approved photos were the only ones of certain events allowed to be released.

NBC News chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd raised the issue at a briefing with White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest. Todd compared the restrictions to Vladimir Putin's control over the press in Russia, and later clarified on Twitter:

Folks. I used hyperbole to make a point. Good grief. Listen to entire exchange with @jearnest44 Fact is they are setting a new precedent — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) November 21, 2013

And the press access precedent being set by this WH press office will only be followed in a more rigid way by next POTUS. why we whine — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) November 21, 2013

Politico reported that Earnest argued the administration was using new technologies to increase access to the president, which elicited a groan from the press corps. Reporter April Ryan tweeted during the exchange,

Fight!!!! The mud is slinging in the briefing room. — AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) November 21, 2013

Okay a polite fight, but a fight none the less. I love it. Keep up the fight for access. — AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) November 21, 2013

Later, WHCA President Steve Thomma challenged Earnest on photo access, and explained the differences between the pictures taken by independent journalists and White House photographers. Earnest replied, ""We don't view the government camera as a substitute in any way"" and acknowledged that the two sides will never agree ""100% of the time about those decisions,"" but that working with the press corps is ""a priority"" for the administration.

Also on Thursday, the American Society of News Editors and the Associated Press Media Editors urged their members to stop using photos and video released by the White House.

""We must accept that we, the press, have been enablers,"" the organization said in a letter. ""We urge those of you in news organizations to immediately refrain from publishing any of the photographs or videos released by the White House, just as you would refuse to run verbatim a press release from them."""

President Obama, reacting to the startling figures Tuesday, said he had “no tolerance” for sexual crimes in the ranks and pledged to crack down on commanders who ignored the problem. Obama said he had spoken to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and ordered that officers “up and down the food chain” get the message.

“I expect consequences,” Obama told reporters at the White House. “If we find out that somebody’s engaging in this stuff, they’ve got to be held accountable — prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged, period. It’s not acceptable.”

The worsening statistics are a blow to the Pentagon’s military and civilian leadership, who have announced repeated initiatives to combat rape and sexual assaults, only to see the problem grow.

The increase in both reported and suspected sex crimes — and evidence that many in the military still fear retaliation if they report an assault to a superior officer — comes as the military faces far-reaching social changes, including opening up combat jobs to women and lifting the ban on gays and lesbians serving openly.

It also comes two days after police in Arlington, Va., arrested the chief of the Air Force sexual assault prevention branch for allegedly groping a woman outside a bar near the Pentagon, the latest sexual scandal to hit the headlines. Officials said Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski was removed from his post after the arrest.

“This department may be nearing a stage where the frequency of this crime and the perception that there is tolerance of it could very well undermine our ability to effectively carry out” the military’s mission, Hagel said at a Pentagon news conference.

Hagel outlined steps he had ordered, including holding commanders accountable for preventing sexual assaults, expanding programs to help victims, and screening recruiters and training instructors. An investigation that began in 2011 at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas has turned up 59 cases of sexual assault of military recruits by drill instructors.

In testimony Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Air Force’s top commander, Gen. Mark A. Welsh III, appeared to blame broader society, noting that 20% of women report they had been sexually assaulted “before they came into the military.”

“So they come in from a society where this occurs,” he said. “Some of it is the hookup mentality of junior high even and high school students now, which my children can tell you about from watching their friends and being frustrated by it.”

Reported sexual assaults of both men and women in the military rose to 3,374 last year, up from 3,192 a year earlier, according to the Pentagon. About 1 in 4 of those who were assaulted and received medical care declined to press charges, however, an indicator of the victims’ fear of retribution, officials said.

But the annual Defense Department report says about 6% of women surveyed, as well as 1% of male soldiers, declared they had been sexually assaulted but did not report the incidents up the chain of command. Extrapolating those percentages across the military, the report estimates 26,000 sexual assaults occurred, up from 19,300 in 2010.

Lawmakers and experts say many victims are reluctant to come forward because they lack faith in the military justice system and fear their careers could suffer if they try to bring criminal charges, particularly against higher-ranking officers.

In two cases since early 2012, Air Force generals overturned convictions of male officers under their command who had been found guilty of sexual assault. The cases have prompted a push in Congress to overhaul the Uniform Code of Military Justice to make it more difficult for commanders to intervene in such cases.

Maj. Gen. Gary Patton, who heads the Pentagon’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, said the 5.7% increase in reported sexual assaults indicated that more people are willing to come forward. But he acknowledged that the 35% rise in unreported cases showed “it’s very clear we got some work to do.”

Advocates for victims criticized the Pentagon for doing too little to reverse the problem.

Kate Weber, a former Army soldier who now counsels military sexual assault victims in Sonoma County, Calif., said in a telephone interview that she was raped by a senior officer while stationed in Germany in 1993. She said her superiors rebuffed her attempt to lodge a complaint.

The authority to prosecute “needs to be taken out of the chain of command, so a victim can report rape to an independent, uninterested party,” she said.

Advertisement

Nancy Parrish, president of Protect Our Defenders, a victims group, said “the problems are so longstanding and pervasive that, at a minimum, it constitutes gross negligence on the part of the leadership and actually reflects … countenancing of a culture of violent abuse.”

Pentagon officials have talked publicly for years about holding officers accountable who tolerate or cover up for male subordinates accused of sex crimes. But when asked whether any officers had been disciplined for mishandling sexual assault cases, Patton offered no examples.

Advertisement

In April 2012, then-Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta ordered that only colonels or higher-ranking officers could decide whether to prosecute a sex crime. The reform was aimed at blocking lower-level officers from protecting colleagues.

But this year, Air Force Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, commander at Aviano Air Base in Italy, overturned the sexual assault conviction of a lieutenant colonel, threw out his one-year prison sentence and reinstated him to duty. Franklin said he had doubts about the accuser’s credibility.

Advertisement

In response, Hagel announced last month that he would urge Congress to limit a commander’s ability to overturn court-martial verdicts. But several lawmakers say that was insufficient.

Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) plan to introduce legislation to amend the military code so that military prosecutors are put in control of all legal decisions on sexual assaults and other major crimes, eliminating the possibility that commanders can intervene.

Advertisement

Boxer called the increase in sexual assaults “horrifying” and vowed to change how the military “investigates and prosecutes these heinous crimes.”

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said Tuesday that she was blocking the nomination of Lt. Gen. Susan Helms, whom Obama had nominated to be vice commander of Air Force Space Command. McCaskill said she was opposing the promotion because Helms last year overturned the conviction of Capt. Matthew S. Herrera, who was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a female lieutenant at Vandenburg Air Force Base.

“That is the crux of the problem here, because if a victim does not believe that the system is capable of believing her, there’s no point to risking your entire career,” McCaskill said at a Senate hearing with Air Force officials.

In response, the Air Force released a memo written by Helms in which she expressed doubts about the victim’s testimony that she was asleep and did not consent to sex. Instead of sexual assault, Helms found Herrera guilty of committing “an indecent act,” a lesser offense. He was involuntarily discharged in December.

The rule issued Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security aims to reduce the time illegal immigrants are separated from their U.S. families while seeking legal status, officials said.

Beginning March 4, illegal immigrants who can demonstrate that time apart from an American spouse, child or parent would create “extreme hardship” can apply for a visa without leaving the United States. Once approved, applicants would be required to leave briefly in order to return to their native country and pick up their visa.

Sources said that the administration might expand the changes to include relatives of lawful permanent residents.

The change, first proposed in April, is the latest move by the administration to use executive powers to revise immigration procedures without Congress passing a law. In August, the Obama administration began a program to halt the deportation of young people brought to the U.S. unlawfully as children.

“This is a continuation of usurping Congress’ control over immigration,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in Washington that supports tighter controls on immigration. “This waiver rule is a small piece of this broader effort to go around Congress.”

The new procedures could reduce a family’s time apart to one week in some cases, officials said. In recent years, a few relatives of U.S. citizens have been killed in violence in foreign countries while waiting for their applications to be resolved, a process that could take a year or longer.

“It’s going to be a better future for me,” said Analy Olivas, 21, of Claremont, who crossed the border illegally from Mexico with her family when she was 8 and eventually married a U.S. citizen. She didn’t think she could bear to be separated from her 4-year-old son, Naythan, for an extended period, adding: “If I kept on going through the process, I was going to have to leave the country. I wasn’t ready for it.”

“The change will have a significant impact on American families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon,” said Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Wait times will be “drastically reduced,” Mayorkas said.

The immigration agency does not provide applicants with a specific definition of “extreme hardship,” despite requests from legal aid organizations to clarify the phrase. The agency “looks at the totality of the applicant’s circumstances and any supporting evidence,” according to the final rule posted in the Federal Register on Wednesday.

Advertisement

Immigration officials said they had no plans to add staff to process what could be a large number of new hardship-waiver applications. The agency received 24,780 such applications between September 2011 and October 2012.

Until now, officials said, many immigrants who might have sought legal status have not pursued a hardship waiver of strict U.S. immigration laws out of fear they would be rejected and stuck outside the country.

Someone who has overstayed a visa for more than six months is barred from reentering the U.S. for three years; those who overstay more than a year are barred for 10 years.

Many Mexicans applying for a visa must report to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, one of Mexico’s most violent cities. Fearful applicants often spend weeks in hiding while waiting for appointments with consular officials. U.S.-born spouses also must travel to Juarez for interviews to determine whether marriages are valid.

The wait proved too long for Luis Luna, who was born in Mexico but crossed illegally into Southern California last year. He married his U.S.-born high school sweetheart, but became desperate as weeks in Juarez turned to months. He was bullied by thugs, harassed by cops and witnessed several fatal shootings.

“The days were so long,” said Luna, who rented a $70-per-month room for several months while waiting for his visa to be processed. Luna, penniless and fearful, finally tried to reenter the U.S. by falsely claiming American citizenship with a Washington state driver’s license. His application was eventually rejected. He is now back in California.

The possibility of having to leave the country for Juarez long kept Andrea from applying for U.S. residency, even though she is married to an American citizen and her 4-year-old daughter is also a citizen. The 30-year-old, who lives in Orange, asked not to be further identified because she is in the country illegally.

“I’d rather have a wife without papers than a dead wife,” Andrea said her husband often told her.

Those whose hardship waiver applications were denied in the past will be eligible to apply again under the new rule, officials said. Family members who have been in deportation proceedings that were suspended will also qualify. But someone who has been deported before, or is facing a final deportation order, is not eligible.

Los Angeles immigration attorney Carl Shusterman hailed the end of what he called a “totally crazy system.”

“It’s going to keep families together who otherwise would have to go out of the country and sometimes wait over a year, separated,” Shusterman said.

Jessica Dominguez, an immigration attorney whose clients are mostly from Mexico and Central America, said Latinos in Southern California were celebrating the change.

“This is going to affect thousands of families,” Dominguez said.

Gregory Mankiw'],"From Summer Camp, a Parable for Washington","During the first week of camp, the groups were separated. The boys within each group participated in various activities together, like hiking and swimming. They bonded with one another, and each group developed its own norms of behavior. The two groups named themselves the Eagles and the Rattlers.

In the second week of camp, the Eagles and the Rattlers were brought together for competitive team activities like baseball and tug-of-war. Even though the boys had similar backgrounds, the competition was far from friendly. Taunting, name-calling and vandalizing the other team’s property were common. The teams were so aggressive that the researchers sometimes had to physically separate them. When the boys were later asked about the experience, they described their own team as virtuous and the opposing team in much more negative terms.

In short, group identity and competition led to irrational and self-righteous hostility. Doesn’t that sound like the political rhetoric we hear on the daily news?

Now imagine that Mr. Sherif had added a wrinkle to his experiment. Suppose that one of the boys had been required to switch teams every day. It seems likely that this boy would have developed friendships in both groups and, at the same time, would have been viewed by both with suspicion. He probably would have said: “Hey, guys, the other team really isn’t so bad. They’re a lot like us.” But his words would most likely have been ignored.

That is how I feel every day. While among Republicans, I want to say President Obama’s goal of universal health insurance has a noble motivation, and it is impossible to achieve without a significant expansion in the role of government. While among Democrats, I want to say President Obama has vastly oversold the Affordable Care Act. The law is unlikely to reduce the cost of health care as promised, will shrink the economy by increasing implicit marginal tax rates and will, by virtue of its scope and complexity, lead to numerous other unintended consequences.

Mr. Sherif did not try my hypothetical wrinkle to his experiment, but he did manage to return some harmony to the Eagles and the Rattlers.

For example, the boys had to deal with an interruption in their water supply, a problem that could be solved only if the two groups worked cooperatively.

Josh Gad and the cast of ""1600 Penn"" met President Obama at a special screening of the comedy in the White House.

Gad found himself unable to speak when the President introduced himself.

The President introduced the comedy in the White House theater and then had to excuse himself.

President Obama is so powerful that he even has the power to silence the very talkative Book of Mormon star Josh Gad.

Gad was at the White House this week for a special presidential screening of his new NBC comedy 1600 Penn and found himself unable to speak when Obama introduced himself.

""I was thinking this is going to be amazing, I have so much I want to say. And he walks in and I literally freeze,"" says Gad. ""He shakes my hand and says, 'So great to meet you. How you feeling? How you doing?' All I could say was, 'Um, um, I'm better now.'""

""Oh my God. I don't think I've been at a loss for words. I'm unfortunately very verbose too often,"" says Gad. ""I don't know what his impression was but you are meeting the leader of the free world on his home turf. It's not something you can prepare for.""

Gad plays a slacker son of a fictional president (Bill Pullman) in the sitcom written by former Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett. The president introduced the sitcom to members of his staff and the show's in the White House theater.

""It was incredible. It's like the President of the United States is giving a 10-minute speech introducing the show,"" says Gad.

But Obama couldn't stick around and excused himself by saying, ""something came up."" Lovett looked over at Gad and said that the last time Obama said 'something came up' was when Lovett was helping on his White House Correspondents dinner speech and the President walked away.

""And the next morning they found out he was killing Osama Bin Laden,"" says Gad. ""(Lovett) said, 'I have come to take it on his word when he says he has to go do something, it's really something.' ""

Nonetheless, Gad and Obama's crew saw the show, then enjoyed a special champagne reception in the East Wing to end the ""really remarkable"" day.

""It was incredible, one of the highlights of my life,"" says Gad."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/31/Copperheads-The-Jacksonian-Sword-of-Lincoln,2013-08-31 00:00:00,[],Copperheads: The 'Jacksonian' Sword of Lincoln,"One of the most important undercurrents of the Civil War was the role the strong Democratic minority played in criticizing Lincoln’s Republican administration, the Radical Republican Congress, and the war effort in general. But Democrats did not provide a united front or bulwark of opposition to the government and the Union cause, rather far from it.

In fact, it was in large part the contentious, but ultimately loyal, Democratic opposition that put pressure on Republican President Abraham Lincoln and his administration to succeed and make wise military and political decisions. Dissent was an important factor, but ultimate loyalty to the broken nation and the Union cause was the highest form of patriotism.

While some Democrats focused on the perceived civil rights abuses of the administration, others became the most militant flag-wavers, joining the military en masse. These “Jacksonian” Democrats saw the confrontation between the Union and the Confederacy as a battle between “patriots and traitors,” as Illinois Democrat and famous Lincoln debate partner Stephen A. Douglas said just before the war. Staunch and enduring patriotism was at the heart of the 19th century Jacksonian creed.

Gods and Generals director Ron Maxwell explores some of the Northern Democrat opposition in his new movie, Copperheads. Copperheads were generally the “peace” democrats during the war who were highly suspicious of the cause, but the movie’s lead character, an upstate New Yorker named Abner Beech, is not among their number. He is more closely aligned with the Jacksonians, as were many of the country-dwelling folks of that period.

The film explores how the war was a battle for the American soul, a soul that remained very much divided during and after the war.

Notable antebellum America historian Eric McKitrick explained in Political Parties in American History: 1828-1890 how this energetic opposition, instead of weakening the Union, gave it an edge over the one-party rule of the Confederacy. McKitrick said, “…the presence of an organized party of opposition, performed a variety of functions in mobilizing and managing the energies needed for sustaining the Union war effort.”

McKitrick continued, “The absence of such a system in the Confederacy seems to have more than a casual bearing on the process whereby Southern energies, over and beyond the course of military events, became diffused and dissipated.”

The collapse of the Whig Party in the 1850s, initiated by the Compromise of 1850 and made complete by the ruinous Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, is well-known, but the disintegration of the Democratic Party had equally profound consequences for the Union.

In the period just before the war, there was a massive upheaval in party politics, devastating the old battle lines between the Democrats and the Whigs. Former free-state Whigs and Democrats started to band together under the “Republican” banner in general opposition to the slave states, or the “Slave Power” as some called it. Early Republican Party formation started in the West where party ties were weakest and spread to the more calcified East.

Old fights over economics and the size and scope of government moved to the sidelines as the Union neared complete dissolution.

For instance, the famous editor of the New York Tribune and former Whig turned staunch anti-slavery Republican, Horace Greeley, actually tried to enlist Abraham Lincoln’s future rival, Stephen A. Douglas, in the Republican cause to run for Illinois senator in 1858.

Douglas declined, but like many of the other Jacksonian Democrats, when he realized that pro-slavery forces had been unleashed and that America was rapidly becoming a slave republic, he responded with brutal, militant ferocity. As pro-slavery radicals like George Fitzhugh of Virginia were advocating slavery for 19 out of 20 people, black and white, and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision essentially made slavery legal everywhere, many like Douglas began to realize that the free-states were utterly surrounded and the foundations of the country were being upended.

Other Jacksonians took a similar track. Francis Preston Blair, one of the most prominent members of President Andrew Jackson’s “Kitchen Cabinet” and editor of the famous Jacksonian organ, the Washington Globe, left Democrats to form the Republican Party.

Though he was aging and sickly, and opposed many of the old Whig economic ideas of industrial development and tariffs that Lincoln supported, Blair became a chief Lincoln adviser when the administration needed him most.

When Blair’s son informed him that Lincoln might pull his troops out and withdraw from Fort Sumter, he marched over to the White House. He told Lincoln that “It would be treason to surrender Sumter,” and that recognition of secession’s constitutionality would lead to his “impeachment.”

Contrary to popular belief, it was Blair and not Lincoln that contacted General Robert E. Lee to head the Union Army. He, like many Democrats at that time, felt a deep connection to the South but felt so strongly about the preservation of the Union that he was willing to wage terrible war against it once backed into a corner.

In contrast, Greeley, who absolutely believed slavery was abhorrent and wished to end it forever, said of the South, “Let them go in peace.”

Not so with Jacksonian Democrats.

Once Fort Sumter had been attacked in April of 1861, most Northern Democrats rallied to the cause. Historian Jean H. Baker said in Affairs of Party: The Political Culture of Northern Democrats in the Mid-Nineteenth Century, “Overnight a singular change occurred. Antiwar in April, thousands of Northern Democrats were volunteering by May. If supporting the South had been a badge of nationalism in 1860, fighting the Confederacy became one by late 1861.”

Baker continued, “…like revivalists in evangelical assembly, young men converted from civilian to soldier, from Democrat to first Infantry, by signing the muster rolls while neighbors cheered and the band played ‘America.'”

One Democratic newspaper stated, “Now none but traitors deserving the gibbet will be found sustaining the Southern rebels. Those who are not for the Stars and Stripes are against them.”

This ethic has continued to resonate with Americans long after the Civil War.

Ronald Reagan displayed this Jacksonian attitude during the Cold War when he ditched the policy of détente and drew a firm line of opposition to the Soviet Union.

Reagan called the USSR an “Evil Empire,” pointing to the depravities of life under Communism. Americans, notably the “Reagan Democrats,” not only drew a line in the sand, but took aggressive action to build up the military and wage numerous small-scale wars as a part of the “Reagan Doctrine.”

Most recently, the atrocities committed on September 11, 2001, in which thousands of Americans were brutally killed by those who held a radical, anti-American Islamist ideology, prompted Americans to go on the warpath. Attacking the symbols of American power, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, were clear examples that the enemy was attempting to upend the foundations of American civilization.

Though this clash is clear to Americans with a Jacksonian outlook, it has been muddled by those with a different philosophy.

It must be noted that even though many Jacksonian Democrats initially opposed the conflict with the slave states in the lead up to the Civil War, were at best ambivalent and sometimes outwardly hostile to abolition, and deeply disliked President Lincoln, it was ultimately the swelling of Union ranks with these rough men of iron-will that preserved the United States as one nation and put an end to the institution of slavery.

Jacksonians turn to war when they believe that vital American interests are at stake and against enemies that they believe threaten American liberties and the foundations of the country. Once set off, Jacksonians see conflict ending in total victory or defeat with little in the middle. A simple, but important set of principles to understand whenever American leaders decide to let slip the dogs of war."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/books/review/peter-bakers-days-of-fire.html,2013-10-20 00:00:00,['David Frum'],Peter Baker’s ‘Days of Fire’,"The Bush administration opened with a second Pearl Harbor, ended with a second Great Crash and contained a second Vietnam in the middle.

The story of those eight years would seem far too vast to contain inside a single volume. Yet here that volume is. Peter Baker (who covered the Bush White House first for The Washington Post, then for The New York Times) neither accuses nor excuses. He writes with a measure and balance that seem transported backward in time from some more dispassionate future. Yet “Days of Fire” is not a dispassionate book. Its mood might rather be described as poignant: sympathetic to its subjects, generous to their accomplishments and extenuating none of their errors.

“Bush was not one given to reflection, at least not out loud. Yet one day,” in the summer of 2008, “he seemed in a rare introspective mood. Sitting in the Situation Room while waiting for another meeting to begin, the president looked at Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, who had succeeded Peter Pace as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and harked back to the critical days in 2003 before he launched the war that had become so problematic. ‘You know,’ he recalled, ‘when I made the decision on Iraq, I went around the room to everybody at that table, every principal. “You in? Any doubts?” Nothing from anybody.’ For Bush, it was a rare moment of doubt. Was he ruing his own flawed judgment? Bitter that he had been led off track by advisers? Or both?”

That story is sourced to an interview with a “senior official” — your guess whether it was Mullen, Gates or somebody else. Baker’s book is informed by remarkable access to its main characters, including Vice President Dick Cheney. (I’ll note here that I am one of those interviewed for and quoted in Baker’s book.) Yet “Days of Fire” is something more than the reporter’s “first rough draft of history.” Almost every leading figure in the Bush White House, including Bush and Cheney, has now published his or her version of events, and Baker has painstakingly worked through them all. The result is what you might call a polished second draft of history, most likely the most polished draft we’ll have until the archives are opened and the academics can get to work."

President Barack Obama says that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project from Canada to Texas should only be approved if it doesn't worsen carbon pollution. Obama says allowing the oil pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so is in the nation's interest. He says that means determining that the pipeline does not contribute and ""significantly exacerbate"" emissions. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)

WASHINGTON -– State Department documents released to an environmental group are raising new questions about the hiring of a government contractor to evaluate environmental impacts of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.

Environmental Resources Management has conflicts of interest that should have prevented it from winning the contract for the analysis of the controversial pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Sierra Club has said. The group filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the State Department seeking documents that would show how Environmental Resources Management was chosen. Sierra Club provided some of the documents it received to The Huffington Post.

But the documents do not indicate that the State Department conducted its own investigation into the company's ties to pipeline operator TransCanada before approving it to produce the analysis. Environmental Resources Management's draft supplemental environmental analysis, released in March, recommended changes to the pipeline route, but declared the project would have ""no significant impacts to most resources."" The Obama administration's decision on the pipeline is expected sometime early next year.

Included in the documents Sierra Club obtained is a memo from a State Department staffer to Kerri-Ann Jones, assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, that recommends Environmental Resources Management for the pipeline contract.

""ERM is the only candidate that has not worked for TransCanada or its subsidiaries of affiliates, nor has ERM been a third-party contractor on any reviews of TransCanada projects,"" the memo says. The documents include signed forms from ERM and TransCanada affirming that they had not previously worked together, as well as talking points for government staff to use answering press questions about potential conflicts of interest.

""The most alarming thing is the documents that aren't there,"" said Doug Hayes, a staff attorney at Sierra Club. ""So far they've sent us a bunch of documents, and none of them demonstrate that State Department did any independent inquiry into ERM's conflict of interest.""

If State Department officials had looked, they may have found reasons to reject ERM, Hayes said. After ERM's analysis was released, Mother Jones revealed that a key ERM staffer on the project had previously done work for TransCanada, and that two other contractors had done work for ANR Pipeline, a TransCanada subsidiary. Still other ERM employees had worked for companies that would benefit from the pipeline.

The biographies of those ERM staffers had been removed from materials the State Department released with the draft environmental impact statement. Mother Jones reported on the potential conflicts earlier this year after obtaining the version of the biographies before they were redacted by the State Department. Environmental groups seized on those connections, arguing that they should have prevented ERM from getting the contract. They also argued that ERM had not been transparent about this previous work for TransCanada in its disclosure form.

The State Department's Office of Inspector General is now looking into those allegations. The inspector general's report, delayed by the government shutdown, will not be ready until late-February 2014, spokesman Douglas Welty told The Huffington Post.

The department's first environmental analysis for the pipeline was conducted by Cardo Entrix, a company whose previous work for TransCanada prompted environmental groups to complain of conflicts of interest. That led to an investigation by the State Department's inspector general, which found no evidence that TransCanada had ""improperly influenced"" State's selection of the contractor and no actual conflict of interest in hiring Cardno Entrix. But the report dinged the department for failing to independently evaluate the contractor's claim that it had no conflicts and for ""accepting them at face value.""

Sierra Club's FOIA request sought records related to State's approval of ERM for the second study to see what, if anything, the department did differently in evaluating potential conflicts of interest for the new environmental study. ""It looks like State Department did exactly what they did last time, which is take ERM and TransCanada's statements at face value and not do any independent evaluation,"" Hayes said.

In response to questions about the documents, a State Department official said the department doesn't believe there was a conflict of interest in selecting ERM.

""No Environmental Resources Management (ERM) employees working on the review have worked for TransCanada,"" said the official. ""Our rigorous conflict of interest procedures are designed to ensure that no contractors or subcontractors have financial or other interests in the outcome of a project.""

The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Interior both have submitted comments critical of ERM's study. The EPA said the study included ""insufficient information"" about several environmental concerns.

Another document released in response to the FOIA request is a State Department press guidance from of Aug. 3, 2012. It includes this paragraph as a suggested response to reporters' questions about whether ERM had worked with TransCanada before:

No, ERM has neither worked directly for TransCanada before, nor has it worked as a third-party contractor for a federal agency reviewing a TransCanada project. This is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada.

The FOIA includes another version of the press guidance dated three days later. That document removes the line that says this ""is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada.""

Ross Hammond, a senior campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the removal of that line raises more questions about any potential relationships between ERM and TransCanada, and what the State Department knew about them. Hammond said the information that has come out about ties between the contractors and TransCanada should also raises questions about the Keystone report that ERM wrote.

""There's no reason that anyone should have any confidence -- particularly the president, who will be making the decision on this pipeline -- that what they put in this report is true,"" said Hammond."

Either way, it is a tale of central Alabama, a region dotted with churches and youth groups.

“He owns the stage when he’s on it,” said Blane Jett, 22, who first attended one of Mr. Pitt’s events when he was in high school. “He’s got the anointing of God on him, and no one else can do it like him.”

Mr. Pitt and his organization, Whosoever Ministries, have stood apart from others in the way they have regularly drawn crowds of more than 5,000. He brought a showman’s flair to the stage, where he would share his own story of sin and redemption with ceaseless exuberance and an array of effects that rivaled those at rock concerts.

His story was a gripping one: After a troubled college stint, a drug overdose and a pivotal meeting with his parents in the family’s basement, Mr. Pitt was moved to become a preacher and began inviting people to his home in 2004. He called his events the Basement.

“He is so real,” said Shelby Jackson, who first encountered Mr. Pitt’s messages on a DVD seven years ago. “He’s not afraid to share his heart and his struggles with the Lord.”"

Last week Oprah Winfrey made the very naughty observation that racism still exists in America and that—gasp—president Obama probably faces some of it. Worse, she made the equally naughty and equally true observation that racism will likely only get better when older generations of racists die. Since black people are not allowed to talk about racism, this has resulted in a network-wide Fox News freakout Hannity, for his part, seems to be under the impression that Oprah threatened to personally knock off elderly racists one by one, which for a movement still convinced that Obama is secretly raising an army of black people is probably not much more of a stretch.

This is just a thought, but it seems to me that people who were not racist are just not as prone to getting worked up about people talking about racism as racists are. Conversely, breaking out in network hives whenever someone brings the subject up is probably not the best way to show you understand the topic. The network push against Oprah might also have something to do with the White House awarding her the Medal of Freedom for her achievements; it seems many in the network get very worked up when black Americans visit the White House.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

AP Business Writer

RALEIGH, N.C. — The North Carolina House approved plans Tuesday to immediately strip Charlotte of the airport it has run for more than 70 years and turn over control of the country's eighth-busiest airline hub to an appointed body.

The House voted 75-39 to hand management of US Airways' top hub to a regional authority. Changes made by House lawmakers, including the immediate transfer of the assets and management, still must be approved by the state Senate. The plan does not require Gov. Pat McCrory's approval to take effect because it is considered a local issue, and he cannot veto it.

Charlotte officials are warning of a lawsuit to block the move. Ex-mayor Anthony Foxx fought the move before becoming U.S. transportation secretary this month.

US Airways is close to merging with American Airlines and deciding where to place major operations.

Advocates for the change say they want to protect the commerce that depends on the easy flight connections of a major airline hub. Banana giant Chiquita Brands International decided in 2011 to move its global headquarters from Cincinnati in part because of the greater access to foreign flights in and out of Charlotte Douglas International Airport.

""The airport is not like regular city departments. It really is a business. And smart business people don't wait until the system is broken before they fix it. They look ahead, prepare to avoid dangers and to capture opportunities,"" said Rep. Ruth Samuelson, R-Mecklenburg, a former county commissioner. ""A smart business person recognizes that when her biggest customer, in this case US Airways, is undergoing a major reorganization impacting every factor of their business including hub locations, she needs to be well-positioned to capture that opportunity.""

Charlotte-area Democrats urged their Republican colleagues to reject the plan, the latest in a series of local disputes in which the Legislature's GOP majority has intervened this year. Opponents of a takeover by a regional operating authority noted US Airways already enjoys some of the lowest operating costs in the country at Charlotte's airport.

""We've started out with a conclusion and then tried to figure out how to jury-rig the structure to support that conclusion,"" said Rep. Kelly Alexander, D-Mecklenburg. ""I appeal to you - you were elected to use your brains.""

Charlotte proposed transferring some airport control of to an independent 11-member governing body whose members would be appointed by the city and not state leaders, Mayor Patsy Kinsey said Tuesday. Airport employees would continue working for the city.

Kinsey criticized legislative Republicans for appearing intent on taking the airport away from Charlotte.

""The citizens of Charlotte built that airport; Raleigh didn't,"" Kinsey said in a video released by city officials.

""The city's proposal is designed to avoid litigation and remove the cloud of uncertainty hanging over Charlotte Douglas International Airport's future,"" she said."

HINTS??!! How About Action!","From TPM:



Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) on Tuesday threatened to revisit the Senate rules amid the latest Republican filibuster, his second such threat this month. (snip) It is things like that that will cause the Senate to have to reassess all the rules because right now they accomplish so little, Reid said on the Senate floor. I'm disappointed.

Senator Reid is disappointed? I'm pissed. First, before you even finish reading this post, please go ahead and sign the Daily Kos petition calling on Reid to stop ""threatening"" to reopen the debate of fixing the filibuster, and to just do it.

As TPM noted, this is not the first time, even this month, that Reid has made such a threat. The first was when Republicans filibustered Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court. And did that threat get Republicans to back down? Nope.

Some have evoked the classic image of Charlie Brown, who repeatedly falls victim to Lucy Van Pelt and her unquenchable need to pull away the football just before he can kick it.



Others have brought up the great philosopher, George W. Bush, who ""won't get fooled again.""

I wish I was clever enough to come up with something truly original (the best I could do was a Led Zeppelin song):



But what I can do is remind Senator Reid of one popular definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.

Oh, and this:



Seriously, the time has come for the Democrats in the Senate to do what they should have done in January, namely to change the rules of the Senate and enact the Merkley-Udall filibuster reform plan:



1.Eliminate the Filibuster on Motions to Proceed: Clears a path to debate by making motions to proceed not subject to a filibuster, but providing two hours of debate. 2.Require a Talking Filibuster: Forces Senators who filibuster to actually speak on the floor, greatly increasing public accountability and requiring time and energy if the minority wants to use this tool to obstruct the Senate. 3.Expedite Nominations: Reduces post-cloture debate on nominations from 30 hours to 2 hours, except for Supreme Court Justices (for whom the current 30 hours would remain intact). 4.Eliminate the Filibuster on Motions to Establish a Conference Committee: Reduces the steps to establish a conference committee from three motions to one, and limits debate the consolidated motion to 2 hours.

Some of us might like to see even stronger filibuster reform, but at least this proposal was under public discussion in January, and, according to Merkley and Udall, got significant support within the Democratic caucus, tantalizingly close to a majority. Now is the time for the waverers to come on board, and for Harry Reid to make the change. Stop threatening, and start doing. NOW."

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: George W. Bush returns as a uniter,"Former president George W. Bush, on his recent trip to Africa, toured Victoria Falls, one of the seven wonders of the world. He then sat down for an interview that may qualify as the eighth.

The man who started two wars abroad and introduced a new level of hostility to domestic politics spoke with ABC News’s Jonathan Karl in Tanzania in a conciliatory and reflective manner that bore little resemblance to that of the divisive figure who left Washington in 2009.

In the segment, which aired Sunday, the 43rd president, in a striped blue polo shirt, cautioned those who have been “overly critical” of gay marriage. He defended President Obama against criticism that he hasn’t devoted much attention to Africa, and he resisted an invitation to gloat over Obama’s continuation of counterterrorism policies that he had created. Of most importance, Bush put in a plug for the comprehensive immigration legislation that is at the top of Obama’s agenda but has divided Bush’s Republican Party.

“I think it’s very important to fix a broken system, to treat people with respect and have confidence in our capacity to assimilate people,” said Bush, who failed to enact such reform.

For Bush, who has been under a self-imposed gag order for much of the time since he left office, this amounts to something of a reemergence. He’s planning to talk about immigration again Wednesday in a naturalization ceremony at his presidential center. It’s likely not a coincidence that he’s beginning to return to public view now that it’s safer to do so: More Americans are forgiving, or at least forgetting, what they didn’t like about him.

A Gallup poll last month found that for the first time in his ex-presidency (actually, the first time since 2005), a plurality of Americans have a positive view of Bush. Forty-nine percent viewed him favorably, compared with 46 percent who viewed him unfavorably. This puts him on par with Obama and is a healthy recovery from the depths of the economic collapse in March 2009, when 35 percent viewed him favorably.

It’s standard for former presidents to grow in public esteem as memories fade. In Bush’s case, the war in Iraq is over, the war in Afghanistan is winding down and the economy is finally recovering. But Bush’s rebound could be accelerated, particularly among Democrats, by the type of assist he gave Obama in the Karl interview.

That’s in marked contrast to his former understudy, Dick Cheney, who in his retirement regularly and rudely denounces Obama. As the New York Times’ Jonathan Martin reports, Cheney is now also antagonizing fellow Republicans by boosting a challenge by his daughter to Sen. Mike Enzi, a popular conservative in Cheney’s Wyoming.

Bush was all bonhomie as he sat in a shaded garden with his wife, assuring Karl that he didn’t talk substance with Obama when their Africa tours overlapped in Tanzania. “He’s busy, and I’m retired,” Bush joked. That’s long been his official line. “The only way I can really make news is either criticize the president, which I don’t want to do, criticize my own party or weigh in on a controversial issue,” he told Karl. “And I’m off the stage.”

But for a guy who’s “off the stage,” Bush had quite a few lines about the issues of the day. Earlier in his trip, Bush invoked a biblical admonition when asked whether gay marriage conflicts with Christian values: “I shouldn’t be taking a speck out of somebody else’s eye when I have a log in my own.” Bush told Karl “it’s very important for people not to be overly critical of someone else until you’ve examined your own heart.”

Karl’s interview had all the rehabilitative imagery Bush could want: clips of him in a T-shirt, painting a medical clinic in Zambia and dancing with the locals — and video of Obama asserting that Bush’s devotion to Africa has meant “millions of people’s lives have been saved.” After championing HIV treatments, Bush is now promoting cervical-cancer screening.

Bush, never one to put himself on the couch, dismissed as “absurd psycho-babble” the notion that the good works he is doing in Africa is “to make up for mistakes you made in Iraq,” as Karl put it.

But he seems to have grasped that his own place in history can be improved by generosity toward Africa — and magnanimity toward opponents. Asked by Karl about the criticism that Obama hasn’t done much for Africa, Bush disagreed, saying that Obama “cares deeply” about the continent and that his administration “has been incredibly helpful.”

With a laugh, Bush added: “It doesn’t surprise me that presidents get criticized.”

This is not something that Republicans want to get blamed for, but unfortunately for House Speaker John Boehner, the only way he got House Republicans to agree to raise the debt limit was by promising to enforce the spending sequester. So now he's in a bit of a trap: He has to defend the sequester at the same time that he has to deny responsibility for it.

Here's how his office tried to accomplish that balancing act today:



""These arbitrary, automatic cuts were a creation and demand of the White House in 2011,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker of the House John Boehner in response to Carney's comments. ""Twice the House has passed legislation to replace them with common sense cuts and reforms. If there was any uncertainty late last year about the sequester, it was because the Democratic-controlled Senate, per usual, never lifted a finger to pass a plan to replace it.""

Actually, the truth is that the Senate has offered plenty of ways to achieve the same level of deficit reduction as the sequester—it's just that doing so would raise taxes, and Republicans refuse to do that. So it's not that the Senate hasn't lifted a finger, it's that House Republicans don't like the Senate's ideas.

Beyond that, however, there's no eternal rule that says the House couldn't just suspend the sequester indefinitely. The fact that they are insisting on equivalent cuts means that one way or another they are the ones insisting on the sequester.

Boehner's spokesman says the White House is the reason the sequester was created in the first place, back in 2011. But the truth is that Republicans were the ones pushing for the massive spending cuts—the president was trying to figure out how to keep the government running the face of GOP obstruction, and the sequester is what we ended up with.

That being said, what difference does it make who came up with the idea in 2011? It's 2013: What matters is what happens now. The GOP has within its power the ability to put aside the sequester—if it so chooses. If it doesn't, the most logical explanation is that John Boehner was telling the truth when he said this in August of 2011 after passing the debt ceiling deal that created the sequester in the first place:



When you look at this final agreement that we came to with the White House, I got 98 percent of what I wanted. I'm pretty happy.

Republicans created our fiscal nightmare. They can still fix it, or at least get out of the way, but the clock is ticking."

USA TODAY

So how did well-known heckler and war protester Medea Benjamin -- leader of the activist group Code Pink -- get into President Obama's counterterrorism speech on Thursday?

With a press pass.

Politico reported that a photographer who stood in line with Benjamin at the National Defense University saw her wearing a bright green pass pass adorned with her original name, Susan Benjamin.

Security officials eventually escorted Benjamin from the hall after she continually yelled at Obama in protest over drones and the terrorism prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The Atlantic recited Benjamin's history of heckling: ""She's been seen and heard at many big political events over the last year: at CIA chief John Brennan's confirmation hearing, the NRA's Wayne LaPierre's press conference, the Republican National Convention."" It quoted a ""Senate source"" as saying she also used the media pass trick to get into one of its events.

In statement, the National Defense University confirmed Benjamin's strategy:

""The individual who continued to attempt to interrupt the President's speech at the National Defense University was given access via the list of media attendees expected.

""When it was apparent this individual would not be deterred by the President's effort to address her concerns, officials from the National Defense University staff and Base Police asked her to leave and escorted her from the venue. She has been questioned by Join Base Myer-Henderson Hall police.

""This speech was not open to the general public. Attendance for non-media was limited to invited guests from the National Defense University faculty, staff, and student body, along with those invited by the White House."""

But even celebrities experience surreal moments that leave them in awe. For Perry, there were two distinct moments in his life that made him realize the magnitude of his success. One, which he reveals in the video, involved Oprah and Tina Turner. The other involved President Barack Obama.

In this clip from Tyler's interview on ""Oprah's Next Chapter,"" he recounts the private conversation he had with President Obama inside the president's motorcade. President Obama had just visited Tyler Perry Studios before attending a fundraising event Tyler was hosting, and the President invited Tyler to ride to the event with him in the motorcade.

""I get in the car with [the president] and he's talking to me in the motorcade. There is not a soul on the freeway... And he's talking, [but] all I'm hearing is... Charlie Brown time in my ear,"" Tyler recalls, mimicking the ""Peanuts"" teacher whose words were always too muffled to understand.

Recognizing how monumental the moment was, Tyler wanted to make sure he fully experienced it. ""I finally stop and I say, 'Listen. I know this is your everyday. But this moment, for me, I've got to just take it in. I've got to really just breathe,'"" he says he told the president.

That's when the two had a conversation that Tyler will never forget. ""I said, 'What a great country that something like this could happen, that you could become president,'"" Tyler remembers telling Obama. ""And he said, 'What a great country that you could become Tyler Perry.'"""
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/25/Report-McConnell-Targets-Nebraska-Conservative-Senate-Candidate,2013-11-25 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Report: McConnell Targets Nebraska Conservative Candidate Ben Sasse,"After the Senate Conservative Fund (SCF) endorsed Matt Bevin, the Tea Party challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), McConnell has reportedly gone on a rampage against SCF allies and the conservative candidates it has endorsed.

Most recently, McConnell reportedly directed his anger at Nebraska conservative Senate candidate Ben Sasse, whom the SCF has endorsed in the open primary.

According to National Review, on November 12, “Sasse walked into Mitch McConnell’s office to clear the air” and let him know he never intended to oppose McConnell’s leadership, but McConnell was having none of it. The outlet notes that McConnell’s incident with Sasse in his war with SCF is “notable” because “it involves an attractive, promising candidate in an open primary as collateral damage in the intramural fight.”

Josh Holmes, McConnell’s top adviser, “privately told friends afterward it was the most uncomfortable meeting he’d been in”; Sasse reportedly turned to Holmes when he walked out of meeting and said, “That didn’t go well!”

McConnell reportedly “lit into” and grilled Sasse about “exactly when Sasse had first interacted with Matt Hoskins, the hard-charging executive director of SCF” who is “working to elect McConnell’s primary challenger.” The SCF was started by former South Carolina Senator and current Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, who feuded with McConnell because he backed candidates–like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul–that went up against McConnell’s handpicked candidates in Republican primaries.

McConnell reportedly asked Sasse about the YouTube video (embedded below) that was highlighted on the Drudge Report in September in which Sasse said it was time for “every Republican in Washington, starting with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, to show some actual leadership.”

In that video, Sasse also ripped Washington’s permanent political class, saying that elected officials are not kings and the American people are not “peasants.” He said there is not “one set of rules for the Washington elite and another for the masses” and called on McConnell to show leadership and give up his Obamacare subsidies. The outlet also reported that “the bad blood between Sasse and McConnell escalated” when Sasse met with National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) political director Ward Baker.

McConnell, along with the Republican establishment like the NRSC, is mounting an organized effort against conservatives and Tea Partiers. For instance, McConnell, as Breitbart News reported, said he would like to punch the SCF “in the nose” on a conference call with donors of Karl Rove’s political group on October 30. McConnell has taken steps to put his words into action; National Review reported that “pressure from McConnell allies convinced SCF’s bookkeeper, Lisa Lisker, to part ways with the group,” even though “Lisker has previously worked for Republican candidates locked in tense primary elections without incident.” McConnell has been accused of “bullying” the bookkeeper.

Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, in response to McConnell’s hostile words, told Breitbart News, “Why would Senator Mitch McConnell want to ‘punch in the nose’ the millions of patriotic moms, grandmoms and veterans who stand up for America through the Tea Party and groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund?”

“The people supporting SCF are the same people going to Tea Party meetings and rallies across the country. We elect our representatives to represent us, not to threaten us with physical violence during secret meetings with Karl Rove’s friends,” she told Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle. She added that “everything” the Tea Party said “about Obamacare turned out to be true.”

She continued, “If they’ve got so much fight in them, then where were they when we needed them to stand up and fight against Obamacare?” Martin also emphasized that the “Tea Party Patriots shares Senate Conservatives Fund’s goal of holding establishment Republicans accountable, and specifically, we shared the goal of defunding Obamacare.”

McConnell has not endorsed Sasse’s primary opponent in the race, but Sasse is being considered “collateral damage” in a fight he never wanted in McConnell’s and the Republican establishment’s broader war on conservative Tea Partiers and specifically against SCF."

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/06/18/742552/-Are-Jews-white,2009-06-18 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Are Jews white?,"I've always identified as white, whenever people have asked. If someone wants to say, ""No, you're not white, you're a Heeb, man,"" my reaction is going to be, ""Okay, whatever.""

But I've occasionally met fellow Ashkenazi Jews who do not consider themselves white. These people point out correctly that Jews were once considered nonwhite in the United States. Of course, the same was true for many European ethnicities, including Germans and Irish. (There's a book called How Jews Became White Folks, and another called How the Irish Became White.) This has far more to do with social status than with biology, but then that's always been the way race has worked in our society.

The thing is, as an Orthodox Jew, I find the question ""Are Jews white?"" rather silly. Jews, according to Judaism, are not a race nor a subset of a race. A Jew is traditionally defined as either one who has a Jewish mother, or a non-Jew who converts to Judaism. Thus, ancestry plays a strong role in Jewish identity, but it isn't the whole picture. Wikipedia describes Jews as an ethnoreligious group, a concept largely unknown in the West but not uncommon in other parts of the world.

There are in fact Jews of all races and colors. People of African and Asian descent have converted to Judaism, or have been adopted into Jewish families and raised as Jews. (I personally know several such individuals.) There are a few historical Jewish groups who are clearly nonwhite, most notably Beta Israel (Ethiopian), Bene Israel (Indian), and Kaifeng Jews (Chinese).

Still, those are exceptions. Most Jews in the world are divided into three broad groupings: Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi. Ashkenazim, those with a family history in Eastern and Central Europe, tend to be relatively lighter-complexioned on average than Sephardim and Mizrahim, and since they constitute the majority of Jews in the United States, they have dominated the popular American image of the Jew.

The term Mizrahi (literally ""Oriental"") is generally applied to Jews with a family history in the Middle East and North Africa. Sephardi is a confusing term. Strictly speaking, it is used to designate Jews with a family history in Spain or Portugal. In the late 1400s, Iberian Jews who refused to convert to Christianity were expelled from the peninsula and settled in various other countries throughout Europe, Asia, North Africa, and even the New World. Because they are so widespread, Sephardi has come to be used as a virtual synonym for ""non-Ashkenazi."" While this practice is not strictly accurate, it is pervasive in the media.

Some people perceive that Ashkenazim are white but Sephardim and Mizrahim are nonwhite. A while ago, the New York Times ran an article about the debate over Christopher Columbus's ethnic origins. When it came to the hypothesis that Columbus was Jewish or of Jewish descent, it made the following curious remark (this quote isn't in the online version of the article): ""Most Jews in Southern Europe at the time were Sephardic Jews of North African descent, but preliminary analysis of Columbus's DNA suggests he was Caucasian.""

This statement shows ignorance of the fact that genetic studies suggest a close kinship between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews. And I have no idea where the author of this article got the idea that European Sephardim were of ""North African descent.""

The racial status of Jews ties into the racial status of Arabs and other Middle Eastern groups. Are Arabs white? According to census forms, they are. But in popular imagination, they are often distinguished from whites. Of course many Arabs show evidence of having a mixed racial background. But the same is true of Jews from the same countries. Yemenite Jews often look black or nearly black. Paula Abdul is partly of Syrian Jewish ancestry (the other part is Ashkenazi) and many people have incorrectly identified her as black.

Many anti-Zionists have seized upon the largely discredited Khazar hypothesis, which supposes that most Ashkenazim are descended from European converts, and therefore are more ethnically European than Middle Eastern. There's no question that Jews mixed to some degree with the native populations of the countries in which they settled, and European Jews are no exception, but the evidence suggests that overall Jews are still fundamentally a Middle Eastern people.

Jews and Arabs are in fact closely related, and in Israel, where the Jewish population is about half non-Ashkenazi, it is often hard to tell the two groups apart. Race may be an imprecise scientific concept, but as long as we're going to invoke racial classifications, we might as well try to be a little consistent. And classifying Jews as white but Arabs as nonwhite is the height of absurdity.

In sum, I don't care what race you consider Jews to be, if any, as long as you're consistent and show at least some knowledge and understanding of the complex history and social dynamics of the Jewish people."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/04/Post-Cliff-a-Leaderless-Washington,2013-01-04 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Post-'Cliff': A Celebrity President, a Leaderless Washington","President Barack Obama is supposed to lead the country, but barely participated in the “fiscal cliff” negotiations except to berate Republicans in the media. As Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid is meant to move legislation through the upper chamber, but gave up and was sidelined by the Vice President. House Speaker John Boehner is meant to lead his caucus, but they rejected his proposals, and he barely held onto his job.

Welcome to post-“fiscal cliff” Washington, a leaderless chasm in which no one is bold enough to offer an agenda, nor confident enough to compromise. Even the Tea Party refuses to step up: it was ironic that Michele Bachmann cast the 218th vote that gave Boehner the bare majority he needed to retain the Speaker’s gavel. This is an age without a Reagan, without a Thatcher–without even a Ted Kennedy, on the other side.

President Obama marked the conclusion of the “fiscal cliff” deal by promising he would not negotiate with Congress on the debt ceiling. Likewise, Speaker Boehner promised he would no longer negotiate directly with the President. These are absurd promises that mock the spirit of the Constitution’s separation of powers, bold statements that are meant to convey strength but in reality betray the weaknesses of both party’s leaders.

The branches must co-govern, even as they check each other’s power. Yet the separation of powers is something President Obama has never accepted, as he ignores Congress and writes regulations or makes appointments as he pleases. He resents the fact that Congress controls the debt ceiling, and there is now serious talk that he might simply ignore Congress by minting a $1 trillion coin and depositing it in the Treasury.

Meanwhile, in Congress, the Senate has treated the Republican-controlled House as if it were an illegitimate body, ignoring dozens of economic bills passed through the lower chamber even as it refuses to pass a budget. The “extremist” House compromised on the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff, much to the annoyance of the GOP base, because Republicans accepted the reality of divided government. Not so the Democrats.

The new Republican temptation, as expressed by Boehner’s promise not to deal one-on-one with the President, is to withdraw from a political process in which good faith is punished by mockery and demands for more concessions. That is understandable, but mistaken. President Obama is actually weaker than ever, because there is no political will to enact further tax hikes, and because fiscal circumstances demand spending cuts.

These are precisely the conditions under which Republican leaders should want to engage President Obama directly. The President does not want to negotiate because he knows he will have to make concessions–just as, during the campaign, he took little interest in debating Gov. Mitt Romney because he did not want to have to defend his record. The House has the opportunity, finally, to hold the President accountable for his debts.

But instead of inviting direct talks, Speaker Boehner had to reject them to retain his position. And so Republicans have re-elected a leader on a promise not to lead. It is almost as bad as watching Democrats re-elect Nancy Pelosi as Minority Leader after guiding her party to two successive defeats.

Because there are few consequences for bad leadership, there is little good leadership. And so we stagger into the next crisis."

For generations, the West was a Republican stronghold, the land of Goldwater and Reagan and sagebrush rebels. But a change began under President Clinton and was hastened under President Obama, who twice added Nevada and Colorado to the Democrats’ stable of support in the West.

The reason, in short, is Latino voters.

The rise of Latino power, which began in California as a backlash to the heated rhetoric surrounding Proposition 187, the 1994 anti-illegal-immigration initiative, has steadily spread eastward, giving once-red states a distinctly more blue tinge.

There may be no better illustration than California’s next-door neighbor.

Obama won Nevada in 2008 by a whopping 12 percentage points. By all rights, however, Republican Mitt Romney should have been strongly competitive there in 2012. He had an organizational base among the state’s large Mormon population, and Nevada has been an economic basket case for years, with jobless, foreclosure and bankruptcy rates that set a national standard for awfulness.

Obama carried the state, however, winning in November by more than 6 percentage points.

Strong Latino support is one reason. What happened in Nevada reflected the results nationwide: The percentage of Latino voters grew to 18% of the electorate, from 15% in 2008, and Obama won their support by a crushingly large margin.

Immigration has become the Democrats’ wedge issue, drawing small-business-owning and culturally conservative Latinos away from the GOP in the way Republicans long used abortion and other contentious social issues to pry working-class Democrats away from their party moorings.

As an added political benefit to Democrats, the issue of illegal immigration splits the GOP between enforcement-only hard-liners and advocates of a more balanced approach that would mix fortified borders with some path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in the United States illegally. To hard-liners, that amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers and an unacceptable capitulation to Obama and his fellow Democrats.

The president used last week’s inaugural address to signal that immigration reform, one of the unfulfilled promises of his first term, would no longer be overlooked.

America’s journey “is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity,” he said to strong applause from the hundreds of thousands gathered on the National Mall.

Latinos in Congress who met with Obama on Friday said the president described the issue as his top legislative priority.

Obama’s remarks in Las Vegas are likely to cover proposals he has called for in the past: tougher border security, a crackdown on employers who hire illegal workers and a way for undocumented immigrants to responsibly “earn” their way to U.S. citizenship. More details are expected in the president’s State of the Union address on Feb. 12.

The political message on Tuesday, however, may be more significant than the substance.

The goal for Democrats is to lock in their strong Latino support and the votes of succeeding generations, the way the party has in California, so candidates can devote more time and resources to red states like Arizona and Texas that should, the demographics suggest, grow more competitive in 2016 and beyond.

Obama may have run his last election campaign. But one thing he would like to bequeath to fellow Democrats is a solid electoral college base rooted in the West to offset the advantage Republicans enjoy across the South.

His Las Vegas appearance is a step toward that second-term goal.

""At least 50 percent of the [prison] population has symptoms of mental health disorders,"" said Brad Brockmann, executive director of the Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights at Brown University. ""With Medicaid expansion, we have an incredible opportunity to take care of the very neediest, the very poorest while freeing up huge amounts of money within the states through not having to provide that care in correctional settings.""

The Eighth Amendment guarantees adequate medical care for prisoners -- often an expensive undertaking because many battle addiction and have serious mental health issues. Currently, counties and states pay for that care. But in January, when the Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid coverage to men living below the poverty line, the cost of this care shifts to the feds.

""That's one of the reason why you're seeing a lot of Republican governors support the Medicaid expansion because for them, it's a fiscal windfall,"" said Avik Roy, a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. ""They will be able to offload these costs to the federal government that currently they're paying for.""

State and county prisoners who need acute care outside a prison facility can also have that cost reimbursed by Medicaid.

""That's a substantial savings for the county and local system,"" Brockmann said.

Consider the projected savings in California: for the 2014-2015 fiscal year, the Legislative Analyst's Office projects a federal reimbursement of more than $70 million dollars, which is more than double the $21 million in funds it received for the 2011-2012 fiscal year.

But overall, counties stand to see the biggest financial windfall. Currently, counties are responsible for inmate care. However, under Obamacare, counties will have the authority to charge insurance purchased through the state exchange for inmates awaiting trial.

""An individual who's awaiting trial [...] would still be in the community and would be able to retain his or her benefits,"" Brockmann said.

To help shift the cost burden, counties and states across the country are working to make sure inmates entering and exiting their jails are signed up for coverage either through the state exchange or with expanded Medicaid.

""That streamlining of the eligibility criteria for Medicaid makes it much easier for states and localities to offload their health care,"" Roy said.

That means the cost is dispersed to all federal taxpayers -- even those in states who opted out of the Medicaid program.

""If you choose not to expand the Medicaid program, you're saving your state taxpayers a fair amount of money,"" Roy said, ""but that means that the federal expenditures on Medicaid are going to other states.""

So in essence, money from taxpayers in the states who opted out of Medicaid, like Texas, will see it go towards the care of inmates in the states that did opt in, like California.

""That's one of the moral dilemmas of the Medicaid expansion generally,"" Avik said. ""Should taxpayers be required to spend a fair amount of money -- because this is a very expensive program -- on the costs of health care for these inmates?""

But prison advocates predict this could have long term cost savings for prison systems because treatment may reduce recidivism rates or even prevent incarceration in the first place. Brockmann cites a 2004 program in Texas that introduced community treatment and addiction programs. The state saw a 10 percent drop in crime and a savings of $2 billion over 5 years. Brockmann theorizes there is the potential for similar outcome because some people more at risk of incarceration will receive treatment under the new state exchanges and Medicaid guidelines.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/09/Book-Donald-Trump-birther-theories-consumed-Obama-as-his-re-election-campaign-kicked-off,2013-11-09 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Book: Trump Forced President to Search Mom's Keepsakes for Birth Certificate,"President Barack Obama’s “most persistent distraction” when he launched his re-election campaign in April 2011 was not the economy, the Tea Party movement, the GOP presidential primary field, the unpopularity of Obamacare, or even the soon-to-be-launched mission to take out Osama bin laden.

No, the most pressing issue for the president was the fact that real estate mogul Donald Trump had been challenging him over his birth certificate, according to the new book Double Down: Game Change 2012.

“[T]he most persistent distraction Obama was facing personified by Donald Trump, the real estate billionaire and reality show ringmaster who was flirting with making a presidential run under the banner of birtherism–the crackpot conspiracy theory claiming that Obama was born in Kenya and thus was constitutionally ineligible to preside as commander in chief,” authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann note in the opening chapter of the book.

While Obama–who was born in Hawaii–thought of the theory as “lunacy” and “simply mental,” in 2008 his campaign posted his short-form birth certificate online. But as 2011 rolled around, the theory, the authors note, “wouldn’t go away.”

“A recent New York Times poll had found that 45 percent of Republicans and 25 percent of voters overall believed he was foreign born,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote. “And with Trump serving as a human bullhorn, the faux controversy had escaped the confines of Fox News and conservative talk radio, reverberating in the mainstream media.”

George Stephanopoulos asked Obama about Trump’s crusade for his birth certificate twice in an interview the morning of April 14, 2011. “We’re not really worrying about conspiracy theories,” Obama said in response.

But that is not what this new book found; Halperin and Heilemann claim Obama literally spent that night in his Chicago home digging through old records to try to find some kind of proof he was born in Hawaii amid the belongings of his late mother, Ann Dunham.

After Obama made the fundraising rounds throughout Chicago, “he avoided mentioning Trump,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote, “yet the issue remained much on his mind.”

“What confounded him about the problem, beyond its absurdity, was that there was no ready solution,” they wrote. “Although Trump was braying for his original long-form birth certificate, officials in Obama’s home state were legally prohibited from releasing it on their own, and the president had no earthly idea where his family’s copy was.”

What Obama did try to do was “joke about the topic,” as he did during his final fundraiser that night at Chicago’s Navy Pier. “I grew up here in Chicago,” he said. “I wasn’t born here–I just want to be clear. I was born in Hawaii.”

Halperin and Heilemann note that Obama spent the night in the Chicago home that he, Michelle, Sasha, and Malia left behind for the White House in early 2009. When Obama walked through the door after 10 PM, he “stayed up even later” the authors noted, “intrigued by some old boxes that had belonged to his late mother, Ann Dunham.”

While Obama’s mother died seven years earlier, Obama still had not dug through and “sorted” all of her things. “Now, alone in his old house for just the third night since he’d become president, he started rummaging through the boxes, digging, digging, until suddenly he found it: a small, four-paneled paper booklet the world had never seen before,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote. “On the front was an ink drawing of Kapi’olani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital, in Honolulu. On the back was a picture of a Hawaiian queen. On one inside were his name, his mother’s name, and his date of birth; on the other were his infant footprints.”

Obama was so pleased that he found it, he bragged about the discovery to his friend Marty Nesbitt who visited him the next day. Nesbitt, one of Obama’s best friends who bonded with the president over sports over the years, came over for breakfast the next morning. “After chatting for a while at the kitchen table, Obama went upstairs and came back down, wearing a cat-who-ate-a-whole-flock-of-canaries grin, waving the booklet in the air, and then placing it in front of Nesbitt,” the authors wrote.

“Now that’s some funny shit,” Nesbitt said before he “burst out laughing.”

Obama was so proud he found the booklet that on the way to a scheduled interview with the Associated Press, he “pulled aside” adviser David Plouffe and press secretary Jay Carney “and eagerly showed them his discovery.”

Both Plouffe and Carney were unsure if that was, in fact, Obama’s long form birth certificate, but were hopeful that it could help them in fighting the birther conspiracy theories. As for Obama, Halperin and Heilemann noted, he “didn’t know what to think, but he flew back to Washington hoping that maybe, just maybe, he now had a stake to drive through the heart of birtherism, killing it once and for all–and slaying Trump in the bargain.”

Obama hoped this was his saving grace, as Trump’s charges had gotten so far under his skin it started consuming him. “Striding into a meeting with his senior advisers in the Oval Office the next Monday morning, he reached into his suit pocket and whipped out the booklet, infinitely pleased with himself,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote."

In the linked interview where he called for that sale, he also advocated the abolition of farm subsidies and the enactment of a flat tax, and he opposed the enactment of Medicare. In other words, this position was one of a right-wing GOP crank who was throughly demolished by the last New Deal Dem to be elected president.

To see a Dem president coming off a resounding re-election steal a page from Goldwater's playbook (at the same time that he's proposing to cut SS) causes the mind to reel. I'm really not old enough to recall any details of the 1964 campaign, but Goldwater's pledge to sell TVA, along w/ his suggestion to lob one into the men's room of the Kremlin demonstrated his clear lack of seriousness as a prospective president. TVA thereafter became as dangerous of a third rail in American politics as SS.

It's fascinating to note that both of TN's GOP senators opposing this idea. Even Goopers suddenly become ""socialists"" when it's their own ox that's being gored:

The power authority’s bonds fell on news of a potential sale, which was criticized as “one more bad idea in a budget full of bad ideas,” by Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican...A sale of TVA would cost taxpayers money and may boost electricity rates, Alexander said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Both of Tennessee’s Republican senators oppose a sale. “There is by law no federal taxpayer liability for TVA debt,” the senator said. “And after deducting its debt, selling TVA would probably cost taxpayers money.”



It was my understanding that, as exemplified by his dinner last night w/ Johnny Isakson and 11 of his friends, the president is trying to build bridges to GOP senators. Why alienate 2 of them so that you can potentially repudiate FDR's legacy and carry out the agenda of the GOP right? Why is such an insane idea even beingAre there any other equally insane proposals in this budget?

TVA, like any program of its scale, has its obvious flaws. Selling it off to Wall Street, probably at a loss, however, is the worst idea imaginable. The fact that it is even on the table now raises even more questions about exactly what it was that we voted for last November."

The statement, released to Fox News, follows a Breitbart News report on Obama administration Pentagon appointees meeting with anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein to develop court-martial procedures to punish Christians in the military who express or share their faith.

(From our earlier report: Weinstein is the head of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, and says Christians–including chaplains–sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in the military are guilty of “treason,” and of committing an act of “spiritual rape” as serious a crime as “sexual assault.” He also asserted that Christians sharing their faith in the military are “enemies of the Constitution.”)

Being convicted in a court martial means that a soldier has committed a crime under federal military law. Punishment for a court martial can include imprisonment and being dishonorably discharged from the military.

So President Barack Obama’s civilian appointees who lead the Pentagon are confirming that the military will make it a crime–possibly resulting in imprisonment–for those in uniform to share their faith. This would include chaplains–military officers who are ordained clergymen of their faith (mostly Christian pastors or priests, or Jewish rabbis)–whose duty since the founding of the U.S. military under George Washington is to teach their faith and minister to the spiritual needs of troops who come to them for counsel, instruction, or comfort.

This regulation would severely limit expressions of faith in the military, even on a one-to-one basis between close friends. It could also effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military, as it would not allow chaplains (or any service members, for that matter), to say anything about their faith that others say led them to think they were being encouraged to make faith part of their life. It’s difficult to imagine how a member of the clergy could give spiritual counseling without saying anything that might be perceived in that fashion.

In response to the Pentagon’s plans, retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin, who is now executive vice president of the Family Research Council (FRC), said on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning:

It’s a matter of what do they mean by “proselytizing.” …I think they’ve got their defintions a little confused. If you’re talking about coercion that’s one thing, but if you’re talking about the free exercise of our faith as individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, especially for the chaplains, they I think the worst thing we can do is stop the ability for a soldier to be able to exercise his faith.”

FRC has launched a petition here which has already collected over 60,000 signatures, calling on Secretary Hagel is stop working with Weinstein and his anti-Christian organization to develop military policy regarding religious faith.

**UPDATE**

The FRC petition has now exceeded more than 40,000 signatures at the time of this update.

After the boos erupted, a contingent of Obama supporters countered with cheers.

Obama also golfed on Saturday for the first time since the sequester cuts went into effect at the beginning of March and then took some of his foursome–and his Secret Service detail–to watch Syracuse oust Marquette and secure a trip to the Final Four.

One would have expected a friendlier crowd for the President, but there are still several possible explanations for the boos. Obama and his White House team had supported Georgetown (Syracuse’s rival) in the past, and the President had forecast Indiana (who was eliminated by Syracuse) to win the East Regional and go on to win the national title, for example. Or, perhaps they booed because POTUS had gone to the game with Secret Service agents while the White House remains closed to tours.

The Obama administration canceled the popular White House tours citing Secret Service costs. Throughout the week, Obama has been scrutinized because of Secret Service expenditures for the First Daughters’ vacations to the Bahamas and Sun Valley, Idaho.

Peters, 16, was known locally as a hero for helping save two children who had fallen through the ice at the same lake when she was a seventh-grader, in 2010.

The Indianapolis Star reported, ""those who knew Peters spoke of her positive energy, her nonjudgmental personality and her willingness to help those she didn't know.""

On Sunday, Peters and two other men were at the home of Jacob Travis McDaniel. According to police, McDaniel was showing off a handgun and a shotgun when, thinking the handgun was empty, he allegedly pointed the weapon at Peters and pulled the trigger.

Palin said Obama promised the most transparent administration ever but has been mired in crony capitalism and has not even passed a budget. She said refusing to pass a budget is not “just bureaucratic bungling,” it is “refusing to declare what” Obama intends to do with the people’s money.

“Barack Obama, you lie!” Palin said of Obama’s transparency claims.

On background checks for guns, Palin said, “Dandy idea, Mr. President. Should have started with yours.”

She said “bad guys who ignore the laws” will not follow new laws when it comes to gun control legislation Democrats want enacted. She blistered liberals for over-simplifying the causes of gun-related crimes.

“Saying a chunk of metal did the crime is like saying the fork made me fat,” Palin said.

She mocked the mainstream media for gathering again to write their “conservatives in crisis” stories.

Palin had some harsh words Obama’s lack of leadership and the lack of leaders in Washington.

She said there is a “direct correlation between the Senate’s stubbornly refusing to pass a budget and selfishly agreeing to spend our children’s and our grandchildren’s money.”

“No budget is no leadership,” Palin said. “It’s time for America to be more outraged about this.”

She said America faces challenges “so big” while its leaders are so small.

Palin called Obama a campaigner who makes promises he can’t keep and seeks to divide and conquer while orchestrating crisis after crisis to exploit for political gain.

“We don’t have leadership coming out of Washington, we have reality television,” Palin said.

Palin said everything coming out of Washington, D.C. feels put-on and every event feels calculated to fool Americans.

She blistered the permanent political class for focusing too much on the process of politics instead of the purpose of politics, which is to lead and serve. She resoundingly mocked Obama as a permanent campaigner even though he is not up for reelection anymore.

“Now step away from the Teleprompter, and do your job,” Palin said to Obama."

Editor’s Note: Robert Blecker is a professor at New York Law School where he teaches criminal law and constitutional law. His crime and punishment memoir, “The Death of Punishment: Searching for Justice Among the Worst of the Worst,” will be published by Palgrave Macmillan in November.



(CNN) —

No matter how vicious the crime, no matter how vile the criminal, some death penalty opponents feel certain that nobody can ever deserve to die – even if that person burned children alive, massacred a dozen strangers in a movie theater, or bombed the Boston Marathon. Other opponents admit the worst of the worst of the worst do deserve to die. They just distrust the government ever to get it right.

Now that pharmaceutical companies refuse to supply the lethal drugs that U.S. corrections departments have used for years to execute criminals – whether from their own genuine moral objections or to escape a threatened economic boycott – states have begun to experiment. Death penalty opponents, who call themselves abolitionists, then protest the use of these untried drugs that just might cause a condemned killer to feel pain as he dies.

Let the punishment fit the crime. We’ve mouthed that credo for centuries, but do we really mean it? We retributivists who believe in justice would reward those who bring us pleasure, but punish severely those who sadistically or wantonly cause us pain. A basic retributive measure – like for like or giving a person a taste of his own medicine – satisfies our deepest instincts for justice.

When the condemned killer intentionally tortured helpless victims, how better to preserve some direct connection short of torture than by that murderer’s quick but painful death? By ensuring death through anesthesia, however, we have nearly severed pain from punishment.

Robert Blecker

An unpleasant life in prison, a quick but painful death cannot erase the harm. But it can help restore a moral balance.

I, too, oppose lethal injection, but not because these untried new drugs might arbitrarily cause pain, but because they certainly cause confusion.

Lethal injection conflates punishment with medicine. The condemned dies in a gurney, wrapped in white sheets with an IV in his veins, surrounded by his closest kin, monitored by sophisticated medical devices. Haphazardly conceived and hastily designed, lethal injection appears, feels, and seems medical, although its sole purpose is to kill.

Witnessing an execution in Florida, I shuddered. It felt too much like a hospital or hospice. We almost never look to medicine to tell us whom to execute. Medicine should no more tell us how. How we kill those we rightly detest should in no way resemble how we end the suffering of those we love.

Publicly opposing this method of execution, I have found odd common ground with Deborah Denno, a leading abolitionist scholar who relentlessly attacks lethal injection protocols. Although Denno vigorously opposes all capital punishment, we both agree that the firing squad, among all traditional methods, probably serves us best. It does not sugarcoat, it does not pretend, it does not shamefully obscure what we do. We kill them, intentionally, because they deserve it.

Some people may support the firing squad because it allows us to put blanks in one of the guns: An individual sharpshooter will never know whether he actually killed the condemned. This strikes me as just another symptom of our avoidance of responsibility for punishment. The fact is, in this society, nobody takes responsibility for punishing criminals. Corrections officers point to judges, while judges point to legislators, and legislators to corrections. Anger and responsibility seem to lie everywhere elsewhere – that is, nowhere. And where we cannot fully escape responsibility – as with a firing squad – we diffuse it.

My thousands of hours observing daily life inside maximum security prisons and on death rows in several states these past 25 years have shown me the perverse irony that flows from this: Inside prisons, often the worst criminals live the most comfortable lives with the best hustles, job opportunities and sources of contraband, while the relatively petty criminals live miserably, constantly preyed upon.

Refusing to even contemplate distinguishing those few most sadistic murderers who deserve to die painfully, states seem quite willing haphazardly and arbitrarily to expose prisoners in general, regardless of their crimes, to a more or less painful life, or even death at the hands of other criminals.

Ironically, even as we recoil from punishing those who most deserve it, we readily over-punish those who don’t. A “war on drugs” swells our prisons. We punish addiction and call it crime; we indiscriminately and immorally subject a burglar or car thief to the same daily life in prison we also reserve for rapist murderers.

The time has come to make punishment more nearly fit the crime. To face what we do, and acknowledge, with regret but without shame, that the past counts.

So part of me hopes the abolitionists succeed with their latest campaign against death by lethal injection. We should banish this method. Let the abolitionists threaten to boycott gun manufacturers. See where that gets them. Meanwhile, the rest of us will strive to keep our covenants with victims, restore a moral balance, and shoot to kill those who deserve to die.

Rest assured, when we can only achieve justice by killing a vicious killer, We, the People will find a constitutional way to do it.

Bob Corker (R-TN)

Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)

Volkswagen faces pressure from labor interests on its supervisory board to grant workers a stronger voice at the plant. And Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper, reported Monday that UAW President Bob King and five other officials discussed the Tennessee plant with the company's employee relations chief last week at VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg. [...] German law gives labor representatives half the seats on the Volkswagen's supervisory board, where some members have raised concerns about the Chattanooga plant being alone among the company's large factories without formal labor representation.

Southern auto workers may get some added power in the workplace thanks to strong unions overseas. While states like Tennessee have enacted just about every anti-union law they can think of, making it extraordinarily difficult for workers to form unions, foreign auto manufacturers can face pressure at home to take a step back and not take advantage of all those anti-union laws:So while American companies are refusing to sign a binding agreement making it less likely that garment workers in Bangladesh will be burned or crushed to death, German workers are exerting pressure against the regressive labor laws of another low-wage labor source: Tennessee. In the Volkswagen case, such pressure could lead not to a union with a collective bargaining agreement, but to a works council, in which worker representatives have a say in plant management.

Such a step is probably not imminent, but just the prospect of increasing worker power at the plant has Tennessee Republicans nervous; after all, the whole southern Republican pitch in recruiting companies to relocate business to their states consists of promising workers who'll accept low wages and will be too afraid to talk back. So deeply rooted is the Tennessee Republican hatred of unions, in fact, that when Sen. Bob Corker was asked about the revival of a GM plant under union contract, in Tennessee:



""On the one hand I'm happy that people have jobs,"" Corkers said of a recent announcement that the plant would add or keep up to 1,800 jobs to expand production. ""But on the other hand I certainly hope there aren't inroads made at additional facilities.""

Heaven forbid! It sure is a scary thing to have jobs coming to your state if they might give workers ideas about having a say in their wages and working conditions."

How right he was. The release of his long-form birth certificate did not eliminate the “birther” movement, which wrongly contends that Obama was born in Kenya and is therefore ineligible to be president. Although conspiracists had demanded its release, once he made public the document it merely shifted the debate. Some birthers accused Obama of forgery, while others turned their focus to his college transcripts in hopes of proving that he had applied for admission as a foreign student. (He had not.)

And this week, birthers seized on a plane crash off Hawaii that killed one person: state public health Director Loretta Fuddy, the woman who verified the authenticity of Obama’s birth certificate.

Skeptics turned to social media Thursday to suggest that Obama had played some role in Fuddy’s death. Twitter posts included: “The WH tying up loose ends?” “What did she really know?” and “R.I.P. Loretta Fuddy — we’ll know the truth about Barack Hussein Obama, regardless.”

Donald Trump, a longtime doubter of Obama’s birthplace, also weighed in on Twitter: “How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s ‘birth certificate’ died in plane crash today. All others lived.”

That reaction didn’t surprise those who study conspiracy theorists.

Mark Fenster, University of Florida law professor who wrote a book on conspiracy theories, said adherents will search for evidence to support their beliefs, and each piece of news can give their theory new life.

“The theories themselves are a process of stitching together individual facts to form a larger narrative, and this is just one more fact that gets linked to the chain,” Fenster said.

Fuddy, 65, was among nine people in a Cessna that crashed into the ocean Wednesday, shortly after leaving Kalaupapa Airport on the island of Molokai about 3:15 p.m. The eight others on the plane, including the pilot, were rescued, but Fuddy “remained in the fuselage of the plane,” Honolulu Fire Capt. Terry Seelig told KHON-TV. “It’s always a difficult situation when you’re not able to get everybody out.”

On Thursday, Lt. William Juan with the Maui Police Department said that Fuddy’s body had been recovered from the wreckage and that an autopsy would be conducted.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash, agency spokesman Eric Weiss said, and a preliminary report should be ready in 10 to 14 days.

The pilot of the Makani Kai Air plane did not call for help, officials said, but radio reception is bad in the area.

Makani Kai Air President Richard Schuman said the crash was caused by “catastrophic engine failure.”

Fuddy was apparently headed to Honolulu from Kalawao County, a park on the north coast of Molokai and the home of Hawaii’s former leper colonies. The director of the health department serves as the mayor of Kalawao County.

Fuddy had been the state’s public health director since March 2011. She approved the release of Obama’s long-form birth certificate, which is not a public document in Hawaii, at his lawyers’ request.

More recently, she had been involved with implementing the Affordable Care Act and the state’s gay marriage law, which took effect Dec. 2.

Hawaii’s governor praised Fuddy.

“Our hearts are broken. Loretta was deeply loved and respected. She was selfless, utterly dedicated, and committed to her colleagues in the Department of Health and to the people of Hawaii,” Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a statement. “Her knowledge was vast; her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience.”

For Orly Taitz, the leading birther litigator who has argued in several federal courts that Obama isn’t a natural-born American, the sole fatality was too much of a coincidence.

“Attorney Taitz calls on 8 courts and judges who received her cases to rule expeditiously on the merits and review the evidence of forgery and theft in Obama’s IDs before more people die in strange accidents,” she said on her website. Taitz has yet to win a case in the matter.

Anyone who believes that Obama’s birth certificate is fake will find a way to tie the plane crash to their beliefs, said Dan Cassino, professor of political science at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey. Their train of thought goes something like this, he joked: “If there’s nothing wrong with the birth certificate, why did Obama have the people from Scandal go ahead and shoot that plane down?”

It’s unclear how many people ascribe to birther beliefs. But a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University in January found that 36% of voters, including 64% of Republicans, believed Obama is hiding information about his background.

Conspiracy theories aren’t new, Cassino noted. The birthplace of the 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, became a point of contention in 1881 as rumors spread that he had been born in Canada.

The Internet has made it easier to spread outlandish theories, Cassino said. Thirty years ago, if you tried to tell people about a farfetched belief, they’d ignore you, he said. But online, “you can go and find a community of people who all agree with you.”

This causes a false-consensus effect, in which people overestimate how many people agree with them, he said. Under these conditions, the loudest voices win, and theories become more and more extreme, he said.

Fenster said he didn’t think the Internet had increased the number of people who believe in conspiracy theories. But it does provide people with a platform to instantaneously make their beliefs known, and allows theories to develop much more quickly, he said.

Although the number of theories may have gone up, Fenster said, the number of people who believe in them probably has not.

by R.Crosby Lyles

Transcript:

It’s Sunday May 5th, 2013. My name is R.Crosby Lyles and this is “news from the can.”

Breaking News: Frank Porter Stansberry is at it again. In an article by the New York Times from way back in 2003 entitled “E-mail Stock Tip Tests Limits of Security Laws” Mr. Stansberry’s company Stansberry and associates investment Research apparently sent an email out to “thousands of subscribers to (his) financial newsletters”… “claiming that a certain company’s share price would double after an announcement at a summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia.” Twelve hundred subscribers paid about a thousand dollars apiece to learn the name of a company that processes nuclear fuel that may have seen an improvement in the price of the bomb-grade uranium it was buying from Russia to reprocess. According to the New York Times, the summit came and went and the stock price of the enrichment company rose 12% but fell well short of the performance claimed by Stansberry’s company. In 2007 Stanberry was fined $1.5 million by the SEC for fraud in connection with this email, and to date, Stansberry’s appeals have been denied.

According to Steven Nelson of the Daily caller in 2011 Stansberry had a website NewAmerica3.com that predicted dire consequences for the US economy and was basically hawking $49.50 subscriptions to his news letter. The news letter would provide ways to get rich during the economic apocalypse that Stansberry claimed was on the way. Of course Porter Stansberry has also been a guest speaker on Info-Wars with Alex Jones if that tells you anything. Remember that Alex Jones is brought to you by Genesis communication Network another purveyor of doom owned by Ted Anderson who also owns Midas Resources, Inc. a precious metals dealer. Note here, that various personalities on GCN are constantly hawking the need to invest in precious metals to hedge against an apocalyptic future. Indeed, birds of a feather, really do flock together.

Now, just the other day, while I was checking the weather on accuweather.com a thumbnail picture of President Obama with the caption, “End of Obama” stood out from the usual list of advertisements. Out of curiosity, I clicked on the thumbnail and of course I knew instantly that it was one of those endless gloom and doom monologues. You know, one of those ads with a white background that only has voice and text. Thankfully, I had the presence of mind to record it with my screen capture program. Although I don’t have sound, I do have a sped up version of the text I recorded so you can see for your self what is on it. For comparison the “End of America” video is on Youtube.

I won’t hold you in suspense, the “End of Obama” presentation is basically just a carbon copy of “The end of America” video that came out in 2011. It hits all of the right-wing economic fear mongering talking points from anti-taxation to U.S. treasury and Fed Policy, but most importantly it is hawking Gold and Silver, and some unknown fabulous investment thing that you have to pay to see. Just as a reminder one of my previous Vlogs entitled “Cults, Rackets, Jesus People, and Gold” covered the relationship between Alex Jones, Ted Anderson, Lyndon Larouche, Fear mongering, and the sales of precious metals. This latest offering from Porter Stansberry is not only a retread of a previous video in a slightly different wrapper but part of the same old scare-racket these people have been using to get your money for years. And, let me emphasize, that making money is what it is all about.

Well, that’s about it for today Sunday May 5th, 2013. My Name is R. Crosby Lyles, and this is “News from the can.”

An accelerated reprint of the ""End of Obama"" video is provided at the end of this video for proof of its controversial contents and is displayed without the original sound. It is meant to be used as a tool to skim an otherwise intractable presentation (77 minutes reduced to around 25 minutes) with questionable material interspersed throughout. ""Stansberry's End of Obama and Gold"" is not monetized and should be considered as News.

Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, surrendered to federal agents and then stood before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mikel H. Williams, who appeared via video at the federal courthouse in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

Hundley, of Hayden, Idaho, was released by the magistrate on a $10,000 unsecured bond.

As conditions of his release, the Hundley cannot drink alcohol or possess firearms and must surrender his passport. He cannot travel outside of Idaho, eastern Washington state, or the northern district of Georgia, where the case will be tried.

Hundley is accused of slapping the 19-month-old boy during a Feb. 8 Delta Air Lines flight. Hundley has been charged in Atlanta with simple assault. His attorney says he will plead not guilty.

The charge carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison if Hundley is convicted.

Hundley was president of Unitech Composites and Structures, an aerospace company in Hayden. But he was fired last weekend by Unitech's parent company, AGC Aerospace & Defense, because of the in-flight incident.

There was no answer at Hundley's home when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door Tuesday. He has an unlisted telephone number.

The boy's mother, Jessica Bennett, 33, told the FBI their flight was on final descent into Atlanta when her son started to cry. Hundley ""told her to shut that (N-word) baby up,"" according to a statement from an FBI agent. Bennett said Hundley then slapped the child in the face, scratching the boy below his right eye and causing him to scream even louder.

Bennett has said Hundley appeared intoxicated, became increasingly obnoxious during the flight and complained her son was too big to sit on her lap.

Bennett has said she was shocked by the racial slur. She and her husband are white, while the child, Jonah, whom they adopted, is black."

He Has Served As The Paper S Deputy National Editor', 'Political Editor', 'White House Correspondent', 'Southwest Correspondent.']","Obama has problems, but what has the GOP done since November?","President Obama passed the 100-day mark of his second term facing questions about whether his political capital is already disappearing. Republicans took delight in his discomfort, but they have their own 100-day question to answer: What have they done since November to turn around their fortunes?

The president has had a difficult spring. His gun legislation, though it mustered more than 50 votes, was blocked in the Senate. His advisers are more optimistic about immigration reform, but the measure still faces serious obstacles, especially in the House. Implementation of his health-care law worries some members of his own party. And if there is genuine progress on the budget, no one has been able to describe it.

What do Republicans have to show politically for the president’s travails? So far, there is little to suggest they have truly begun to solve the problems highlighted by Mitt Romney’s loss to Obama last November, party weaknesses that were cited in a post-election report by a Republican National Committee task force.

Congressional Republicans still have far lower approval ratings than the president, although so do congressional Democrats. That is almost always the case. But Republicans also have taken positions on issues this year that have left them on the wrong side of public opinion. Those issues include background checks for gun purchases, the best way to deal with the budget (spending cuts alone vs. a combination of cuts and taxes) and, to a lesser extent, whether illegal immigrants should be given a path to citizenship.

In a recent Washington Post-ABC News survey, seven out of 10 Americans said the GOP is out of touch with the concerns “of most people” in the country. Neither Obama nor the Democratic Party has sterling ratings on this question (slightly positive for Obama and slightly negative for the Democratic Party). But the Republican deficit is far bigger than that of the other two. Even 49 percent of Republicans said their party is out of touch.

Obama’s news conference in two minutes: The president took questions from reporters at the White House on Tuesday, discussing Syria, the Boston bombings, closing Guantanamo, immigration reform, and Jason Collins. (The Washington Post)

Republican opposition to universal background checks for gun purchasers continues to reverberate. The opposition may threaten few individual members, given the leanings of individual congressional districts or constituencies in largely Republican-leaning states. But it is likely to hurt Republicans in areas and among voters they need to win presidential races — suburbs and female voters being prime examples.

After an election in which their nominee won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, many Republicans said it was time to find a new strategy to attract Hispanics to the party. That brightened prospects for comprehensive immigration reform, which George W. Bush tried to enact in his second presidential term, only to be thwarted by his own party.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whose conservative credentials were not in question, took the lead in working out a bipartisan proposal as a member of the Senate Gang of Eight that included Republicans John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.). The group’s work raised the hopes of reform advocates that this was the year for action.

Since then, criticism has been rising on the right, echoing complaints from conservatives that killed prior reform efforts. In an op-ed he co-wrote in USA Today, former senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, president of the Heritage Foundation and once a strong Rubio backer, attacked the proposal as “legislated amnesty.” National Review’s latest cover shows the Florida senator along with two other members of the Gang of Eight — McCain and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) — with the headline “Rubio’s Folly.”

Obama said Thursday in Mexico that he remains optimistic that an immigration reform bill will pass this year, saying the time is right for enactment. Rubio now says his proposal probably needs stronger border security measures to pass the Senate and earlier said the bill could not pass the House in its current form, presaging a rocky path ahead.

The legislative maneuvering has a long way to go. The fact that many of the Republicans who might run for president in 2016 favor immigration reform reflects concern that the party not be cast negatively when this process ends. If Republicans end up blocking the bill, or even if it passes but over significant Republican opposition, they could pay a significant price with the Hispanic community.

Republicans also have not broken through on the economy or the budget. Over the past three years, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has offered a series of comprehensive budgetary blueprints, but he has yet to muster broad public support for the main elements of his package.

The fact that Obama has spent the winter and spring talking about things other than the economy has given Republicans the opportunity to begin to fill that vacuum. So far they haven’t done so, rhetorically or substantively. To most voters, the Republican economic message remains focused more on green eyeshade budget accounting than on kitchen-table concerns of middle-class families.

Rubio’s engagement on immigration is an example of something that has been missing in the Republican Party’s overall approach during Obama’s tenure, which is a willingness to offer concrete and constructive ideas — to be for something rather than just against things — and to go out and really try to sell them.

Republican governors, from Louisiana’s Bobby Jindal to Wisconsin’s Scott Walker to New Jersey’s Chris Christie, to name three of the 30 GOP state leaders, have the opportunity to turn their conservative philosophy into a popular governing agenda that could be taken nationally in a presidential race. But for all the flurry of talk about the 2016 race already starting, at this point the governors are subordinate to the party’s congressional wing.

2014 vs. 2016

The year so far highlights the frustrations Obama has experienced trying to work his will on Capitol Hill. As long as his approval rating hovers at or below 50 percent, Republicans can look to the 2014 elections with optimism. But the year so far also points to the vulnerabilities of a congressionally based party whose members play to narrower constituencies. And as Republicans learned last year, there is often a big difference between the electorates in midterm elections and in presidential elections. A good 2014 does not necessarily mean success in 2016.

Had the president been able to maintain the momentum he gained from his reelection victory, Republicans would be in even worse shape. GOP pollster Bill McInturff pointed out that the fact that Obama has had setbacks and run into questions “has allowed breathing room for thought, recovery and some capacity to regroup.”

As long as Obama is in the White House, many Republicans will define success as stopping bad things from happening. That could be a trap, as the party trades short-term legislative “victories” for what could become longer-term problems. Obama has second-term problems, but in this case, politics might not be a zero-sum game. If Republicans fail to find a message and an agenda that appeal to a broader constituency, they could continue to struggle to win a national election.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/13/distrust-sinking-obama/,2013-06-13 00:00:00,['Chris Stirewalt'],Distrust Sinking Obama,"“The greatest danger zone a president can be in is when he is being attacked on the left and the right. When they are reading off the same talking points, that’s when presidencies fall apart.”

-- Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Obama, in an interview with the Washington Post.

In the little that President Obama has said publicly about his administration’s recently exposed domestic surveillance programs he has returned to the overall motif of his presidency: warning against excessive distrust of the federal government.

While hawks wait anxiously to see if Obama can summon the political courage to defend the programs he has expanded despite his onetime opposition, the president has so far used the occasion to preach against what he seems to believe is a virus of anti-government sentiment in the nation.

(At this moment it appears more likely that Obama will mostly leave it to Republicans to defend his programs, as he and they did with his war in Afghanistan and his flying killer robots. But who knows? The stakes are so huge here that even Obama may not be immune to political risk taking.)

More On This...

Obama’s commencement speech this year at Ohio State, his 2011 reprise of fellow liberal icon Theodore Roosevelt’s “New Nationalism” speech and many others, particularly his off-the-cuff comments on those who “get bitter and cling…” have been musings on the theme that the deep distrust of government in the United States is not just harmful but artificial – that moneyed corporate interests are behind these sentiments.

Obama’s argument in concentrate is that rich people play on the fears and prejudices of the working class in order to block government from fulfilling its rightful role as regulator and protector. This is a particularly unhappy view of the condition of the American experiment arguing as it does that the majority of the citizenry has been bamboozled into mistrusting their own protector.

Whatever the dark impulses and manipulations Obama believes lay at the heart of American disdain for government, the effect is that the president does not often deign to honestly engage the critics of his agenda and worldview. If he thinks that the Koch Brothers and Exxon lurk behind every critic of big, powerful government (apparently a view shared by many in the IRS), why would Obama give them the time of day?

If they are not, as the president says “on the level,” why indulge them and allow them to distract from his goal of reorganizing the community of the disenfranchised around the banner of “collective action?”

As scandals and misdeeds rack his administration, though, Obama is paying a high price for his cynicism as Americans return the favor.

Just flip through the results of the latest FOX News poll:

[pullquote]

-- 56 percent of voters believe Obama did not try to rescue the doomed garrison in Benghazi, Libya because he didn’t want to risk his re-election.

-- 62 percent agree that Obama’s NSA phone surveillance constitutes “an unacceptable and alarming invasion of privacy rights.”

-- 63 percent believe that Obama’s Justice Department seized reporter’s records for political reasons, compared to 29 percent who take the administration’s national security argument to be true.

-- 68 percent believe that the White House isn’t telling the truth about the targeting of the president’s political enemies by the IRS. Just 24 percent believe the White House line that Team Obama neither directed nor was aware of the targeting.

-- 74 percent said that when it comes to openness and transparency, the Obama administration is either the same or worse than George W. Bush’s administration.

The result is that Obama, in whom the public had long placed more trust than it did in his government, finds himself for the first time at the break-even point on the question of whether he is personally honest and trustworthy. That rating, which stood at a shimmering +49 percent in the spring of 2009, is almost certainly heading into negative territory.

All of that leads to Obama’s lowest job approval rating since April 2012 when the economy again tumbled amid ""headwinds."" It's worth noting that voters are darned cheery about the economy and still are turning on the guy. And the 44 percent who still give him a passing grade will likely shrink too.

Obama has consistently questioned the patriotism and motives of his adversaries. It was enough to win him a second term against a candidate whom Team Obama turned (with Mitt Romney’s help) into the personification of corrupt corporate abuse of middle-class America.

But as Obama comes under withering attack from left, right and center, he is finding that many voters don’t think he is on the level either.

And Now, A Word From Charles

“So here is a guy saying, ‘It's over, essentially. I am winding it down.’ And at the same time running this unbelievably huge, invasive program whose only idea, whose only basis is the vast terror threat out there. So he doesn't only support the program, he contradicts it in public. That's a total lack of leadership and that's why his numbers, the poll numbers he now has are markedly down.”

-- Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/09/30/1242615/-No-menorahs-at-Hobby-Lobby,2013-09-30 00:00:00,"['Daily Kos Staff', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",No menorahs at Hobby Lobby,"Hobby Lobby owner David Green notoriously sued the government ( which is still being challenged ) because he doesn't want to cover birth control for his employees—who, like his shoppers, happen to be mostly women.

Now comes word there is yet another reason to avoid getting your crafty supplies and holiday decorations from Hobby Lobby. They recently opened a new store in New Jersey and blogger Ken Berwitz discovered last week that Hobby Lobby doesn't sell any Hanukkah merchandise. Not a single menorah. Not a single dreidel.



In the past few days two different friends told my wife they had gone into the new hobby lobby store in Marlboro, New Jersey and noticed that, although there already was a lot of Christmas merchandise available, there was none for the Jewish holiday of Chanukah (some people drop the ""C"" and spell it Hannukah. Same holiday). One of our friends entered the store, asked where the Chanukah goods were, was told there wouldn't be any, and asked why. According to her, the answer was: ""We don't cater to you people"" Understandably irate, she called the home office, and was told, indifferently, that hobby lobby doesn't have Chanukah on its list of holidays. Since I did not hear this ugly exchange with my own ears, I was not personally certain it was the case. And that's not good enough for this blog. So I just called the Marlboro hobby lobby and asked whether it would be stocking any Chanukah merchandise. I was told it would not. When I asked why, the answer - verbatim - was: ""Because Mr. Green is the owner of the company, he's a Christian, and those are his values"" FYI, I would guess that, in a five mile radius around the Marlboro store, a solid one-third of all residents are Jewish. But, then again, what is the difference? The reason hobby lobby won't sell Chanukah goods is unrelated to how many Jews are in the area,

In a brief email to Patch, Hobby Lobby representative Vincent Parker said, ""We currently do not carry any Hanukah items in our store. Our customers have brought this to our attention and we are currently evaluating our Holiday items and what we will carry in the future."" Parker did not comment on the alleged remarks by a Hobby Lobby employee, and did not confirm the conversation ever happened.

Over the weekend, backlash started to build and as of this morning, the company says: For what it's worth, I went to their Facebook page and asked whether they would confirm whether they do or do not sell any Hanukkah merchandise, and while my comment/question is still visible on the page, the ensuing conversation has been deleted. They seem to be responding to questions about a variety of friendly topics such as new store openings, discounts, etc., but questions from consumers about their policy on Hanukkah merchandise remain unanswered.All comments and questions regarding Hannukah merchandise are now being deleted from their Facebook page.

EDIT: as Colorado Luis points out, they won at the tenth circuit and the Obama administration is now challenging."

The Supreme Court today – in a 5-4 decision – delivered another victory to corporate America. In Vance v. Ball State University, the court made it more difficult for employees to sue their employers over harassment in the workplace, the latest instance in which Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's conservatives have pledged fealty to business interests, to the detriment of American workers. In this case, the court narrowed the definition of ""supervisor"" in the workplace, making it so that supervisor means only those with the ability to hire and fire. As Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority's opinion, someone is only a supervisor ""if he or she is empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim."" [...] It's not hard to see the problem with limiting ""supervisor"" to only those who have hiring and firing power. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in the dissent, the court's decision ""strikes from the supervisory category employees who control the day-to-day schedules and assignments of others,"" which ""ignores the conditions under which members of the work force labor.""

In a pair of 5-4 decisions handed down Monday morning, a conservative pro-business majority of the Supreme Court of the United States has closed the courthouse doors to individuals seeking redress against their employers. [...] In both cases, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sided with the corporations, bringing its record to 13-3 this term. (Good enough for a first-round bye, because clearly the Chamber has home-field advantage before the Supremes.) And in both cases, this will lead to fewer lawsuits trying to hold employers accountable—indeed, in Dr. Nassar's case, the five conservative Justices openly decry just how many retaliation lawsuits are filed, and cheer on the closing of the courthouse doors to these victims.

The most remarkable thing about the Supreme Court’s opinions announced Monday was not what the justices wrote or said. It was what Samuel Alito did. The associate justice, a George W. Bush appointee, read two opinions, both 5-4 decisions that split the court along its usual right-left divide. But Alito didn’t stop there. When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg read her dissent from the bench, Alito visibly mocked his colleague. Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the high court, was making her argument about how the majority opinion made it easier for sexual harassment to occur in the workplace when Alito, seated immediately to Ginsburg’s left, shook his head from side to side in disagreement, rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling. His treatment of the 80-year-old Ginsburg, 17 years his elder and with 13 years more seniority, was a curious display of judicial temperament or, more accurately, judicial intemperance.

PRESIDENT OBAMA’S first major trip to sub-Saharan Africa on Wednesday is expected to cost from $60 million to $100 million, prompting many calls for the president to cancel his trip. Yet, such opposition is shortsighted: Now, more than ever, the United States cannot afford to ignore Africa. Geopolitically, Africa is an emerging force to be reckoned with. Economically, it hosts several of the world’s fastest growing economies — including Rwanda, Zambia, and Mozambique — while the continent as a whole is expected to outstrip global growth for at least the next three years. Simultaneously, the rise of fundamentalist actors hostile to US interests — especially in Somalia and Nigeria — means that the continent presents unprecedented exigencies in the security realm as well.

the excessive, flamboyant nature of the Hoeven-Corker approach is its entire point. Yes, people like Rand Paul and John Cornyn can and will continue to claim that they oppose the overall immigration bill because it just isn't tough enough on border security. But with this amendment now part of the bill, any plausibility that excuse might once have had is gone. If you oppose the Senate bill, even after all this, you oppose it because you oppose a path to legitimacy for the 11 million or so illegal immigrants in this country. Period. If you oppose the Senate bill, you cast your lot with Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin and other hardliners who offer no solution to the problem other than keeping those people in the shadows as a permanent underclass for the rest of their lives.

Cable news channels regularly stoke their viewers' fears about China holding $1.1 trillion of U.S. debt. But they're focused on the wrong $1.1 trillion of loans. The borrowers of this other $1.1-trillion debt are far more likely to default on their obligations: students, particularly those who went to for-profit colleges. The global consequences could be — and likely will be — staggering. More than 38 million Americans have student loans outstanding. To put this in perspective, 38 million is the combined population of New York and Florida. And this collective debt is on par with the entire GDP of Mexico.

Follow Her On Twitter']",First Lady Michelle Obama's surprise Oscar appearance sparks debate,"The Dolby Theater at Hollywood and Highland was filled with A-listers for the 85th Academy Awards on Sunday night, but the coveted task of presenting the final award was given to someone not even on the premises.

Instead presenter Jack Nicholson cut to First Lady Michelle Obama, featured on a drop-down screen, flanked by military servicemen and women, to deliver a passionate monologue live from the White House.

""(These films) taught us that love can beat all odds,"" Obama said of the nominees. ""They reminded us that we can overcome any obstacle if we dig deep enough and fight hard enough and find the courage within ourselves.""

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the FLOTUS appearance was the work of Obama supporter and friend Harvey Weinstein and his daughter Lilly, who arranged for Academy representatives and show producers to secretly fly (via Disney's jet) to D.C. just two weeks ago to make the magic happen.

And let's not forget that last month former President Bill Clinton made an unexpected cameo and drew a standing ovation at the Golden Globes when he presented ""Lincoln."" That guest list addition was rumored to have been a last-minute favor pulled by director Steven Spielberg, one of the entertainment industry's most dedicated Democratic donors.

So not to be outdone, the Academy went for a one-up: a reigning White House resident.

""I was hallucinating at that point,"" Ben Affleck said backstage with regards Obama's presentation of the Best Picture Oscar to his film ""Argo."" ""I was asking people, 'was that Michelle Obama?' It was a huge honor, and the fact she was surrounded by servicemen and women. It was very cool.""

However, instead of inspiring, the surprising presenter instantly drew a few head shakes and loud groans from journalists backstage.

""This makes no sense, it adds nothing to the show,"" one industry expert told FOX411's Pop Tarts column with a bemused laugh, while another surmised it as something of a ""suck job.""

""They threw all the campaign parties, I guess it was Hollywood's way of acknowledging their continued love and support of the Obamas,"" said another. ""It was stupid and pointless.""

Indeed FLOTUS' presentation drew mixed reviews and ignited quite the debate in the twitterverse.

""Forget separation of church and state - we need a separation of Hollywood and state,"" conservative journalist Michelle Malkin retweeted, while others weighed in that it was ""tacky and tasteless"" and cheapened the Presidency.

Scores of other viewers gave Obama rave reviews, however, calling her appearance ""amazing,"" ""show stealing"" and placing her and her designer Naeem Khan gown at the top of the Oscars best dressed list."

First, let’s have the debate he sparked over surveillance and privacy. Then we can decide how history should remember him.

Snowden is the 29-year-old intelligence analyst and computer geek who leaked some of the National Security Agency’s most precious secrets to journalists from The Post and the Guardian. He is now on the lam, having checked out of the Hong Kong hotel where he holed up for several weeks as he orchestrated a worldwide media splash that shows no sign of ending.

Snowden betrayed his employer, the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, and his promise not to divulge classified information. He paints what he did as an act of civil disobedience, but he has decided to seek political asylum abroad rather than surrender to authorities and accept the consequences. In published interviews, he comes across as grandiose to the point of self-parody, a legend in his own mind.

He is an imperfect messenger, to say the least. But his message should not be ignored.

Did you know that the NSA is compiling and storing a massive, comprehensive log of our domestic phone calls? I didn’t. Nor did I know that the agency can access huge volumes of e-mail traffic and other electronic data overseas — not just communications originating in trouble spots such as Pakistan but also in countries such as Germany and Britain. I would have thought that anyone who accused the U.S. government of “omniscient, automatic, mass surveillance,” as Snowden did in an exchange with Post contributor Barton Gellman, was being paranoid. Now I’m not so sure.

Ann Telnaes animation: The NSA’s data gathering technique (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

As President Obama noted, nobody is eavesdropping on the phone calls of U.S. citizens and residents. I’m not certain this could be said about e-mail communications in other countries, some of which take privacy as seriously as we do. British Foreign Secretary William Hague felt obliged Monday to reassure Parliament that “our intelligence-sharing work with the United States is subject to Ministerial and independent oversight” and to legislative scrutiny.

But we have oversight of intelligence operations in this country, too. The problem is that the system works more or less like a rubber stamp.

The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has to issue the orders that allow the NSA to collect “metadata” from telephone providers. But as far as I can tell — we are not allowed to know the content of the court’s rulings and have to make do with crumbs of, well, metadata — the court’s standard answer is yes.

In its 34 years of existence, the court has approved more than 30,000 government requests for surveillance authority while rejecting a grand total of 11. That is not what I’d call oversight.

The NSA’s snooping is also subject to scrutiny by the intelligence committees of the Senate and the House. The chairmen of those panels — Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) — have been among the NSA’s most vocal supporters in recent days. But since so much of the committees’ work is classified, they say they can’t tell us why.

And as for Obama, he said last week that “I welcome this debate and I think it’s healthy for our democracy.” Why, then, didn’t he launch the discussion rather than wait for Snowden’s leaks?

In the coming debate, someone should explain why a mid-level computer guy working for a private contractor had access to so many of the NSA’s most closely held secrets. Someone should explain why the intelligence court is evidently so compliant. Someone should explain — perhaps in French, German and Spanish — why our allies’ e-mails are fair game for the agency’s prying eyes.

But here’s the big issue: The NSA, it now seems clear, is assembling an unimaginably vast trove of communications data, and the bigger it gets, the more useful it is in enabling analysts to make predictions. It’s one thing if the NSA looks for patterns in the data that suggest a nascent overseas terrorist group or an imminent attack. It’s another thing altogether if the agency observes, say, patterns that suggest the birth of the next tea party or Occupy Wall Street movement.

Is that paranoia? Then reassure me. Let’s talk about the big picture and decide, as citizens, whether we are comfortable with the direction our intelligence agencies are heading. And let’s remember that it was Snowden, not our elected officials, who opened this vital conversation.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/19/inside-job-leaders-state-departments-benghazi-review-grilled-by-lawmakers/,2013-09-19 00:00:00,[],‘Inside Job’? Leaders of State Department’s Benghazi review grilled by lawmakers,"The leaders of the State Department's internal review of the Benghazi terror attack were grilled Thursday by congressional Republicans who suggested their probe amounted to an ""inside job"" that let senior officials off the hook.

The hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee comes days after the committee released a draft report alleging that top State Department officials escaped blame for some of the policy decisions that left the U.S. compound in Benghazi less secure. The leaders of the internal review board -- former Amb. Thomas Pickering and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Mike Mullen -- were called to testify, and defended the board's objectivity and findings.

""I had no sense anywhere that there was any conflict of interest,"" Pickering said. ""I'm proud of the report.""

Four mid-level employees were disciplined in the wake of the report, though most were later re-assigned. More than a year after the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in which four Americans were killed, many Republican lawmakers say there still hasn't been any measurable accountability. Their scrutiny recently has turned to the work of the Accountability Review Board, led by Mullen and Pickering.

""It looks like ... sort of an inside job of an investigation. The Department of State looking at the Department of State,"" Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., said.

Pickering later explained that the principle goal of the review was to find out what went wrong so such a tragedy does not happen again.

""This was not, quote, a gotcha investigative panel,"" he said.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., retorted: ""Obviously this was not a gotcha panel. Because nobody was gotcha'd.""

The hearing was one of three being held on Benghazi on the House side this week. Democrats complained that Republicans are re-treading over tired talking points, and that the new attempt to pick apart the State Department review is inappropriate.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., top Democrat on the committee, said accusations that the review was a whitewash are ""reckless.""

""Those kinds of statements upset me, because I think that they are so unfair, and we're better than that,"" Cummings said. ""This Benghazi review was one of the most comprehensive ARB reviews ever conducted.""

Though it has been a year since the attack, lawmakers' frustration stems in part from the fact that nobody has been brought to justice in connection with the attack. On top of that, Secretary of State John Kerry recently re-assigned most of those who were disciplined internally over the security posture at the Benghazi post.

In a heated exchange, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, also suggested Mullen was not acting independently when he gave Cheryl Mills, a top aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a heads-up that department official Charlene Lamb might not be an ideal witness at a House hearing last fall. Mullen acknowledged that he told Mills he didn't think Lamb would ""represent the department well.""

Jordan questioned how that intervention squared with his claims that the review board was independent.

But when future generations come to this library and study this administration, they’re going to find out that we stayed true to our convictions.”

Bathed in the admiration of a friendly crowd and enjoying a modest resurgence of public appreciation in recent surveys, he choked up as he finished speaking and wiped tears from his eyes after sitting down.

Obama poked fun at himself as well as some of his political adversaries during the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner attended by politicians, members of the media and Hollywood celebrities.

Entering to the rap track ""All I Do Is Win"" by DJ Khaled, Obama joked about how re-election would allow him to unleash a radical agenda. But then he showed a picture of himself golfing on a mock magazine cover of ""Senior Leisure.""

""I'm not the strapping young Muslim Socialist that I used to be,"" the president remarked, and then recounted his recent 2-for-22 basketball shooting performance at the White House Easter Egg hunt.

But Obama's most dramatic shift for the next four years appeared to be aesthetic. He presented a montage of shots featuring him with bangs similar to those sometimes sported by his wife.

More On This...

""So we borrowed one of Michelle's tricks,"" Obama said. ""I thought this looked pretty good, but no bounce.""

Obama closed by noting the nation's recent tragedies in Massachusetts and Texas, praising Americans of all stripes from first responders to local journalists for serving the public good.

Saturday night's banquet not far from the White House attracted the usual assortment of stars from Hollywood and beyond. Actors Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Claire Danes, who play government characters on series, were among the attendees, as was Korean entertainer Psy. Several Cabinet members, governors and members of Congress were present.

And despite coming at a somber time, nearly two weeks after the deadly Boston Marathon bombing and 10 days after a devastating fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, the president and political allies and rivals alike took the opportunity to enjoy some humor. Late-night talk-show host Conan O'Brien headlined the event.

Some of Obama's jokes came at his Republican rivals' expense. He asked that the GOP's minority outreach begin with him as a ""trial run"" and said he'd take his recent charm offensive with Republicans on the road, including events with conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Michele Bachmann.

""In fact, I'm taking my charm offensive on the road -- a Texas barbeque with Ted Cruz, a Kentucky bluegrass concert with Rand Paul, and a book-burning with Michele Bachmann,"" Obama joked.

Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson would have had better success getting Obama out of office if he simply offered the president $100 million to drop out of last year's race, Obama quipped.

And on the 2016 election, the president noted in self-referential irony that potential Republican candidate Sen. Marco Rubio wasn't qualified because he hasn't even served a full term in the Senate. Obama served less than four years of his six-year Senate term before he was elected president in 2008.

""I mean, the guy has not even finished a single term in the Senate and he thinks he's ready to be President,"" Obama joked.

The gala also was an opportunity for six journalists, including Associated Press White House Correspondent Julie Pace, to be honored for their coverage of the presidency and national issues.

The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza won the Aldo Beckman Award, which recognizes excellence in the coverage of the presidency.

Pace won the Merriman Smith Award for a print journalist for coverage on deadline.

ABC's Terry Moran was the winner of the broadcast Merriman Smith Award for deadline reporting.

Reporters Jim Morris, Chris Hamby and Ronnie Greene of the Center for Public Integrity won the Edgar A. Poe Award for coverage of issues of national significance."

Washington (CNN) – President Barack Obama attended the Gridiron Club and Foundation’s annual dinner in Washington Saturday night, even cracking a joke on forced budget cuts along the way.

The annual event brings together politicians and Washington’s media elite. Because there’s limited press access, presidents who attend usually act a little looser than when the camera light is on.



This is the second time Obama has attended the dinner as president but the first since 2011.

“As you know, I last attended the Gridiron dinner two years ago. Back then, I addressed a number of topics - a dysfunctional Congress, a looming budget crisis, complaints that I don’t spend enough time with the press. It’s funny, it seems like it was just yesterday,” Obama said.

This year, the president said the jokes were a little harder to come by because of forced budget cuts and also talked of the notoriously long dinner.

“My joke writers have been placed on furlough,” Obama said. “Of course there is one thing in Washington that didn’t get cut: The length of this dinner. Yet more proof that the sequester makes no sense.”

Vice President Joe Biden wasn’t in attendance but his presence was still felt. Biden is rumored to be a potential presidential nominee in 2016 but Obama said he may have different aspirations.

“(The) vice president is still ambitious. But let's face it, his age is an issue. Just the other day, I had to take Joe aside and say, ‘Joe, you are way too young to be the pope,’” Obama said.

Obama even made light of Sen. Marco Rubio’s infamous water sip during the Republican response following the State of the Union address.

“Of course, as I begin my second term, our country is still facing enormous challenges,” the president said, taking a long sip of water. “That, Marco Rubio, is how you take a sip of water.”

The president also brought up his new Secretary of State, John Kerry, and compared him to his predecessor, the famously pantsuit-wearing Hillary Clinton.

“Let’s face it - Hillary is a tough act to follow. But John Kerry is doing great so far. He is doing everything he can to ensure continuity. Frankly, though, I think it’s time for him to stop showing up at work in pantsuits. It's a disturbing image,” Obama said.

Every president since 1885 except for Grover Cleveland has spoken at the 128-year-old organization’s dinner.

The Gridiron is a media organization bringing together the “who’s who” of the Washington press corps. About 650 people attended the dinner according to Gridiron and they included top politicians and journalists. There are 65 members of the Gridiron and membership is by invitation only. The group is a charitable organization and provides annual scholarships to colleges and journalistic organizations.

Despite being a media organization, the dinner is traditionally closed to the television press pool which typically covers the president. But a newspaper pool reporter was allowed into the dinner Saturday for the first time ever and provided updates to the media. The idea behind the limited media access is to allow both club members and politicians a chance to let their guards down and tell jokes they may not otherwise tell with cameras watching and listening.

Still, some have criticized the gathering both for the limited media access and for the perceived coziness between the press and politicians they have to report on.

Obama will be attending the larger White House Correspondents’ Dinner next month which does allow television media coverage.

The president ended tonight’s dinner on a serious note, thanking journalists for the work they do.

“In an age when all it takes to attract attention is a Twitter handle and some followers, it’s easier than ever to get it wrong. But it’s more important than ever to get it right. And I’m grateful for all the journalists who do one of the toughest jobs there is with integrity and insight and dedication and a sense of purpose that goes beyond a business model or a news cycle,” Obama said."

A new book says President Obama's staff features ""a cadre of idolizers,"" but he is also trying to reach beyond the confines of what he calls the White House ""bubble.""

""Barack Obama has said that the hardest thing about being president is staying in touch with 'the flow of everyday life,'"" says author Kenneth T. Walsh. ""And he has admitted that one of the biggest mistakes he made during his first term was confining himself to the White House too much.""

Walsh, the veteran White House correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, has a new book out Wednesday, Prisoners of the White House: The Isolation of America's Presidents and the Crisis of Leadership.

Walsh discusses the attempts by different presidents to break from the White House, which President Harry Truman described as ""the great white jail"" and President Bill Clinton called ""the crown jewel of the federal penitentiary system.""

Like some of predecessors, Obama's efforts are hampered by a like-minded staff.

""Obama has a cadre of idolizers around him, people such as Chicago friend and confidante Valerie Jarrett, and devoted adviser Denis McDonough, who is now White House chief of staff,"" Walsh says in a note about his book.

Walsh adds that ""this is nothing unusual, since every president tends to reward loyalty and wants to surround himself with admirers even if this risks creating a closed-off inner circle."" This could just as easily describe the staffs of presidents John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.

Walsh also says that ""more than most recent presidents, Obama has made a sustained personal effort to break out of the bubble -- a term he uses to describe his life in the White House.""

Writes Walsh:

""He actively browses on his BlackBerry, and takes messages from friends around the country. He pays attention to the polls. He travels outside Washington, reads 10 letters from constituents every weekday, keeps track of what the news media are saying about him, and brings outsiders into the White House to give him ideas.""

Sports provides another respite, Walsh says of Obama:

""He follows sports, which gives him a break from the tedium and keeps him from obsessing about politics, his advisers say. He watches ESPN and frequently will relax by enjoying games on live TV, especially basketball and football.

""But staying in touch requires constant effort, and it's unclear whether Obama will, or can, keep up his current efforts amid all the time constraints, security limitations and pressures of office."""

USA TODAY

Overton volunteered for service in his 30s

Vet is expected to have breakfast with President Obama on Monday

He%27s the oldest known living veteran of WWII

WASHINGTON – Last May, when he was in town with a veterans' group touring the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and the World War II Memorial, Richard Overton wondered out loud what it would take to meet President Obama.

The president was out of town that day, but in Overton's case, all it took to arrange the meeting was a phone call and another trip back to the nation's capital.

Richard Overton is not just any veteran. At 107, he's believed to be the oldest known American veteran of World War II.

A member of the Army's 188th Aviation Engineer Battalion, Overton was in his 30s when he volunteered for service in 1942 and saw combat while ""island hopping"" in the Pacific with an all-black unit, says Allen Bergeron, chairman of Honor Flight Austin, the Texas group that brings local veterans to Washington to tour the monuments. It was Bergeron's group that arranged for Overton's return trip to Washington.

On Monday, nearly 70 years after he returned from the Pacific, he'll meet President Obama at the White House for breakfast before accompanying the president to Arlington National Cemetery for a Veterans Day ceremony, Bergeron said.

""War's nothing to be into,"" Overton said during a brief interview Sunday. ""You don't want to go into the war if you don't have to. But I had to go. I enjoyed it after I'd went and come back, but I didn't enjoy it when was over there. I had to do things I didn't want to do.""

Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell calls Overton ""a regular guy and an extraordinary gentleman. His story is the story of veterans everywhere who leave their peaceful lives to fight in far-off lands for our future.""

On Sunday afternoon at Reagan National Airport, Overton got a hero's reception when airport personnel announced his arrival. The crowd surprised Overton, sitting in a wheelchair, who said, ""I didn't think I was worth that much.""

Still living in the house he built when he returned from the war, Overton has been a widower for the past 22 years. He still starts his day each morning with ""a tablespoon"" of whiskey in his coffee and still smokes a dozen cigars a day, two indulgences that he says are the secret to his longevity.

Beside him for the trip was his ""lady friend,"" as he calls her, 89-year-old Earlene Love, who quietly counseled him through a brief interview before a small group from Austin whisked him away to his hotel.

Asked how it feels to be meeting the President on Monday, Overton quips, ""I ain't met him.""



Asked what he'd tell Obama, Overton says, ""Whatever he asks me.""

And if the President asks Overton to talk first?

""I'll just keep my mouth shut — I wouldn't know what to tell him. I've never thought of that. For one thing, I'd talk about (how) we're proud to have him. I wish him good luck all the way through. We have to pray for him. We have to pray for him and help him because we all need help."""

Anything With War In The Title We Are So There' (VIDEO),"Original post HERE.

Bill Maher had a rather prescient “New Rules” closing monologue on Saturday. Many Conservatives and Right Wingers are likely to be very upset inasmuch as there is a lot of truth to his statements on America’s war acumen.

Maher admonished Kim Jong-un, the young Korean dictator to be careful. After-all, America is winding down its war in Afghanistan and will be without a major war for the first time in more than a decade. Following is the transcript from a few snippets of his monologue. The video follows as well.

[Best of Mill Maher’s “New Rules Monologue”] I am not worried about him. But I do worry about America’s military industrial complex using any excuse to ramp up the war machine again. Be careful Mr. Kim. I know threatening the US is fun, but the reason it could bite you in the ass is with Afghanistan winding down America is now dangerously close to not having a war…. Come on. We are the war people. We don’t need a lot of encouragement… Preemptive war, just war, wars of choice, wars of liberation, drug wars, wars we put on the credit card, anything with war in the title we are so there. We fought Mexico steal Texas, Spain to steal the Philippines, and the Indians because no one had invented Iraq yet. … Just in my lifetime, we have invaded Vietnam, Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iraq again. That’s when you know you are war mongers when some countries are coming up twice. … However if you type “wars involving the US” into Wikipedia, the list is 32 pages long. At some point don’t you have to look in the mirror and say maybe it’s me? … America needs to start defining peace as strength. … You know who the role model for every president should be? Jimmy Carter. Because he is the one out of all of them who figured out how to sit in office for four years and never fire a shot.

It is high time that someone acknowledges the basic decency and strength through diplomacy of President Jimmy Carter. For too long, while greatly admired throughout the world, Americans have allowed the Right to disparage Carter.

Maher is correct; working towards peace is the ultimate display of strength. Choosing war is easy. Choosing war means telling the many companies that comprise the military industrial complex yes. Choosing war means using the fog of war as Bush did, to convince a citizenry to give up their civil liberties (e.g. the Patriot Act). Choosing war means having a ready-made excuse for all domestic failures that are then generally falsely attributed to war.

President Eisenhower’s January 17th, 1961 farewell address remains relative to this day. The following paragraphs within the speech were likely the most important and are what we have summarily ignored.

[source] In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.

Inasmuch as Bill Maher is funny and his monologue is funny, his statements more now than ever should give us pause. As we are beginning our path to a warless time, we can hear the drumbeats of our corporate controlled media attempting to instigate the type of disproportional hype that makes yet another war plausible. How else can one explain a suspiciously timed release of the Reuters piece “'Speculative' Pentagon Report On North Korea's Nuclear Missile Capability Sparks Fear As Officials Urge Skepticism”.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

She was admitted to hospital Sunday after blood clot was discovered

A date for Clinton's return to the State Department has not been set



Medical team says Clinton will fully recover

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was released from a New York hospital on Wednesday, three days after doctors discovered a blood clot in her head.

Clinton's medical team advised her Wednesday evening that she was making good progress on all fronts and said they are confident she will fully recover, said Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines. Doctors had been treating Clinton with blood thinners to dissolve a clot in a vein that runs through the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear.

""She's eager to get back to the office,"" Reines said in a statement, adding that the secretary and her family are grateful for the excellent care she received at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.

Reines said details of when Clinton will return to work will be clarified in the coming days.

Clinton had been in the hospital since Sunday, when doctors discovered the clot on an MRI test during a follow-up exam stemming from a concussion she suffered earlier in December. While at home battling a stomach virus, Clinton had fainted, fallen and struck her head, a spokesman said.

""Grateful my Mom discharged from the hospital and is heading home,"" the secretary's daughter, Chelsea, wrote on Twitter. ""Even more grateful her medical team (is) confident she'll make a full recovery.""

Earlier on Wednesday, the State Department said Clinton had been speaking by telephone with staff in Washington and reviewing paperwork while in the hospital.

""She's been quite active on the phone with all of us,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.

Before being released from the hospital, Clinton was photographed Wednesday getting into a black van with her husband, Bill, Chelsea and a security contingent to be taken elsewhere on the sprawling hospital campus. The last time Clinton had been seen publicly was on Dec. 7.

Clinton's physicians had said Monday that there was no neurological damage but that they planned to keep her in the hospital while they established the proper dose for the blood thinners. They said Clinton, 65, had been in good spirits and was engaging with doctors, family and aides.

Sidelined by her illness for most of December, Clinton was absent on Dec. 21 when President Barack Obama nominated Democratic Sen. John Kerry to succeed her when she steps down at the start of Obama's second term, as had long been planned. The illness also forced to cancel scheduled testimony before Congress about a scathing report into the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, although she could still testify in the future.

""She has said that she is open"" to going before Congress, Nuland said Wednesday, while Clinton was still hospitalized. ""We are working with them now on their schedule, because there's also a question of when they are going to be in.""

Clinton had expected to return to work this week and had already started to resume regular phone contact with her foreign counterparts. On Saturday, the day before the clot was discovered, Clinton had a half-hour conversation with Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. envoy to Syria, in which the two discussed the state of affairs in that country, her spokeswoman said.

Also on Saturday, Clinton spoke by telephone with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, discussing recent developments in Syria, Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories.

The illness has also raised questions about Clinton's political future and how her health might influence her decision about whether to run for president in 2016, as prominent Democrats have been urging her to consider.

Clinton suffered from a blood clot in 1998, midway through her husband's second term as president, although that clot was located in her knee."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-predecessors-mark-opening-george-w-bush-library-165532698--politics.html,,"['Click Image To See More Photos.', 'Alex Wong Getty Images']",Obama and predecessors mark opening of George W. Bush library,"DALLAS—President Barack Obama praised his predecessor George W. Bush as a “good man” who should be commended for his resolve in trying to keep the country safe after the 9/11 attacks, and for his foresight in leading the fight for immigration reform.

Obama’s remarks came as he and the other four living presidents along with dozens of state, federal and foreign dignitaries gathered here to mark the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library on the campus of Southern Methodist University.

Obama, who has been a fierce critic of Bush’s handling of the country, and his colleagues followed the tradition of past presidential library ceremonies by putting political differences aside. Obama praised what he called Bush’s “compassion,” “generosity” and “personality,” and said, “To know the man is to like the man.”

Remarking on the rare gathering of all five presidents, Obama spoke of the “exclusive club” that he shares with Bush as well as Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter—who were also in attendance. But, he said, “it’s more like a support group.”

He recalled finding a letter in his desk from George W. Bush upon arriving in the Oval Office in 2009 offering his successor advice.

“He knew I would come to learn what he had learned,” Obama said. “Being president above all is a humbling job. There are moments when you make mistakes. There are times when you wish you could turn back the clock.”

But, Obama noted, “We love this country and we do our best.”

Obama’s remarks came after former Clinton and Carter offered similar praise of Bush. Among other things, they touted Bush’s efforts to stop the spread of AIDS in Africa.

But Clinton’s remarks seemed more like a roast of his successor, as he spoke warmly of Bush and talked about how close he had gotten to the Bush family after he defeated George H.W. Bush. He joked of being “the black sheep son” and said his mother had told him not to speak too long at the event, turning to acknowledge former first lady Barbara Bush, who giggled in response.

Story continues

He also praised George W. Bush’s recently discovered artistic skills as a painter, saying Barbara Bush had shared portraits her son had painted of animals. “I thought they were great,” Clinton said, adding that he had considered asking Bush to paint his portrait.

Clinton said he had hesitated, however, after seeing Bush’s self-portraits in the bathroom. “At my age, I think I should keep my suit,” Clinton said, as Bush laughed wildly.

A bittersweet moment came when George H.W. Bush briefly addressed the crowd, thanking them for coming. The elder Bush was hospitalized in December, and the family worried he might not make it to see his son unveil his presidential library.

From the podium later, George W. Bush praised his father for “teaching him how to be a president, but first teaching him how to be a man,” and said it was the first time in history that father-and-son presidents had attended the opening of each other’s libraries.

Addressing the crowd of more than 8,000 supporters and former staffers, Bush repeatedly became emotional as he thanked those who had turned out to mark the library’s opening. At one point he joked, “There was a time in my life when I wasn’t likely to be found in a library, much less founding one.”

In praising his ex-staffers, Bush said, “History is going to show I served with great people.” He then gave a shout-out to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who is barely mentioned in the library’s exhibits, telling him, “I’m proud to call you a friend.”

In brief remarks, Bush recalled the goals that led him while in office.

“In democracy, the purpose of public office is not to fulfill personal ambition,” he said, echoing a line that he’s used throughout his career. “Elected officials must serve a cause greater than themselves. The political winds blow left and right, polls rise and fall, supporters come and go. But in the end, leaders are defined by the convictions they held.”

At the end of his speech, Bush audibly choked up. With tears in his eyes, he returned to this seat, where he smiled and threw three fingers in the air in the shape of a”W.”"

If confirmed, Foxx would take charge of a department that has been in the spotlight of late because of flight delays associated with furloughs of air traffic controllers. Last week, under pressure from inconvenienced travelers, Congress passed legislation allowing the Federal Aviation Administration – part of the Transportation Department -- to halt the furloughs, which are related to $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts.

Foxx would become the third African American in Obama’s Cabinet, joining Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice.

The current Transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, had announced his resignation in January, effective upon his replacement’s confirmation.

Foxx, a 41-year-old lawyer, was in the national spotlight last summer as the host of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte.

During his tenure as Charlotte mayor, the White House official said, Foxx improved transit infrastructure, including the groundbreaking of an electric streetcar project. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity ahead of the administration’s official announcement.

Foxx served in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division during the latter part of the Clinton administration, and he later served on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee. He was first elected mayor in 2009.

He was seen as having aspirations for higher office, but earlier this month, Foxx surprised much of his city when he announced he would not run for reelection. He said then that he wanted to spend more time with his wife and two young children.

“I never intended to be mayor for life,” he told the Charlotte Observer.

The Charlotte mayor’s post is part-time; Foxx also works as a lawyer for the DesignLine Corp, a Charlotte-based maker of hybrid buses.

Among those reportedly considered for Transportation secretary was Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who announced in February that he would serve out his full mayoral term, which ends June 30.

Washington (CNN) – The third episode of the History Channel's miniseries “The Bible” was supposed to be remembered for the brutality of Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar, the strength of Daniel in the lion’s den, and the birth of Jesus Christ.

But after viewers claimed there was a striking resemblance between Satan’s human form and President Barack Obama, that probably won't be the case.

Buzz on Twitter quickly grew. According to Topsy.com on Monday, there were an estimated 20,000 tweets containing the words “Obama” and “Satan” since the 9:00 p.m. ET hour on Sunday, the hour in which Satan appears in the two-hour show.

In a statement, miniseries producer Mark Burnett called claims there was a resemblance ""utter nonsense.""

Burnett said the actor who played Satan, Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, ""is a highly acclaimed Moroccan actor. He has previously played parts in several Biblical epics - including Satanic characters long before Barack Obama was elected as our President.""

Ouazanni has had roles in two biblical TV movies - ""Jeremiah"" and ""The Ten Commandments.""

Executive producer of the miniseries Roma Downey, Burnett's wife, added, ""Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our President, who is a fellow Christian. False statements such as these are just designed as a foolish distraction to try and discredit the beauty of the story of The Bible.""

Satan appears during the miniseries’ retelling of the Temptation of Christ, when Jesus fasted for 40 days in the Judean Desert. Satan tests Jesus’ faith, asking him to make bread out of stone and jump from a cliff, but he refuses each temptation and returns to the Sea of Galilee to begin his ministry.

In the desert, Satan is draped in a long, black, hooded robe and with a slight silver tint to his face.

Both Downey and Burnett supported Obama's first campaign for president in 2008, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Downey gave $5,000 to the Obama Victory Fund and $2,700 to the Democratic National Committee in 2008. Burnett also donated to Obama's first campaign - $2,300 in 2007.

Neither gave money to Obama's 2012 campaign.

After three episodes, the show has scored strong ratings. Its first episode drew 13.1 million viewers, ratings that trumped CBS’s “60 Minutes” and AMC’s “The Walking Dead.” The second episode drew 10.8 million viewers.

Ratings for the third installment in the five-week miniseries have not been released.

CNN’s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories

The project has been a three-and-a-half year process for The History Channel and for Burnett and Downey. Burnett - who is better known as a king of reality television, with “Survivor,” “The Voice” and “The Apprentice” all under his name - told CNN earlier this month that this project was “personal.”

“It was time for an updating, adding fresh visual life to a sacred text,” Burnett said.

Both Downey and Burnett were raised Catholic, Burnett in England and Downey in Ireland. They still regularly attend Mass in Los Angeles. Growing up, both watched the classic biblical films that the Hollywood of yesteryear churned out, like “The Ten Commandments” and “The Greatest Story Ever Told.”

To film their Bible series, the duo set off for the southern tip of Morocco with a crew of around 400 people.

Burnett and Downey consulted a wide range of pastors and academics, including a major evangelical leader and a Catholic cardinal.

Their advisory panel consisted of many people from varied backgrounds familiar with sharing the stories of the Bible, rather than a who’s who of biblical academics.

Joel Osteen, a popular television preacher and pastor of the 30,000-member Lakewood church in Houston, was among those consulted. Osteen and Burnett are friends and were developing a television series together that went on the back burner during the production of this series. Osteen even took his family to Morocco during some of the filming.

While the History Channel owns the exclusive North American rights to the project, Burnett and Downey own the rights to global distribution and theatrical airings, which are in the works. The project also has a book tie-in, games and apps.

We discussed a number of potential subjects, and eventually settled on Hillary Rodham Clinton. The film would be ambitious, controversial, and highly visible. But I felt that it was important, that I was qualified to do it, and that I could be fair. CNN gave me complete control (""final cut"") over the theatrical version, and a generous budget.

And then the fun began. The day after the contract was signed, I received a message from Nick Merrill, Hillary Clinton's press secretary. He already knew about the film, and clearly had a source within CNN. He interrogated me; at first I answered, but eventually I stopped. When I requested an off-the-record, private conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Merrill replied that she was busy writing her book, and not speaking to the media.

Next came Phillipe Reines, Hillary Clinton's media fixer, who contacted various people at CNN, interrogated them, and expressed concern about alleged conflicts of interest generated because my film was a for-profit endeavor (as nearly all documentaries and news organizations are). When I contacted him, he declined to speak with me. He then repeated his allegations to Politico, which published them.

CNN and I decided to publicly confirm the film project to clear the air. Immediately afterwards, the chairman of the Republican National Committee announced that the Republicans would boycott CNN with regard to the Republican presidential primary debates in 2016. Shortly afterwards, the entire RNC voted to endorse this position. This did not surprise me. What did surprise me was that, quietly and privately, prominent Democrats made it known both to CNN and to me that they weren't delighted with the film, either.

Next came David Brock, who published an open letter on his highly partisan Democratic website Media Matters, in which he endorsed the Republican National Committee's position, repeating Reines' conflict of interest allegations and suggesting that my documentary would revive old, discredited Clinton scandal stories. Coming from Mr. Brock, this was rather amusing. David Brock began life as an ultraconservative ""investigative journalist,"" quotation marks very much intended, spreading scandal with little regard for truth. He first attracted attention with The Real Anita Hill, his nasty (and factually wrong) hatchet job on the woman who, during Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings, said that Thomas had sexually harassed her. Years later, he apologized and switched to the Democrats.

When Brock published his letter about my film, I got in touch with several prominent Democrats who knew Hillary Clinton. I told them that this campaign against the film and against CNN was counterproductive. They conveyed this message to Mrs. Clinton personally, along with my request to speak with her. The answer that came back was, basically, over my dead body.

None of this deterred or even greatly bothered me. I flew to New York and had a two hour meeting with CNN's President Jeff Zucker and his senior staff. They were great. They asked me how I was holding up -- I said fine. They pledged their support, expressed dismay that things were so nasty, and told me to go forth and make my film. I did so.

In June, I attended a dinner for Bill Clinton, which was educational. Clinton spoke passionately about his foundation, about African wildlife, inequality, childhood obesity, and much else with enormous factual command, emotion, and rhetorical power. But he and I also spoke privately. I asked him about the financial crisis. He paused and then became even more soulful, thoughtful, passionate, and articulate. And then he proceeded to tell me the most amazing lies I've heard in quite a while.

For example, Mr. Clinton sorrowfully lamented his inability to stop the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which banned all regulation of private (OTC) derivatives trading, and thereby greatly worsened the crisis. Mr. Clinton said that he and Larry Summers had argued with Alan Greenspan, but couldn't budge him, and then Congress passed the law by a veto-proof supermajority, tying his hands. Well, actually, the reason that the law passed by that overwhelming margin was because of the Clinton Administration's strong advocacy, including Congressional testimony by Larry Summers and harsh public and private attacks on advocates of regulation by Summers and Robert Rubin.

Wow, I thought, this guy is a really good actor. And I also saw one reason why Hillary Clinton might not be thrilled about my movie. I discovered others. In Arkansas, she joined the boards of Walmart and Tyson Foods. One of the largest donors to the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is the government of Saudi Arabia. The Clintons' personal net worth now probably exceeds $200 million, and while earned legally, both the money's sources and the Clintons' public statements indicate a strong aversion to rocking boats or making powerful enemies.

It was not always thus. When Bill Clinton became President, he and Hillary initially attempted courageous reforms: allowing gays to serve in the military, a carbon tax, health care reform. But they got their heads handed to them: Colin Powell went on television telling America that if gays served in the military, morale would suffer. And the Clintons also learned about money, because back then they had none. When they were mercilessly hounded by Kenneth Starr and Congressional Republicans, culminating in impeachment, their legal bills soared and the Clintons fell many millions of dollars into debt. (To be sure, Bill Clinton poured gasoline on the fire by lying.) It is very clear that the Clintons then decided never to be at anyone's mercy again. And since Bill Clinton first became Governor of Arkansas, the cost of Presidential campaigns has gone from $66 million (both parties combined, in 1976) to an estimated $5 billion for 2016, when Hillary will run. So more than ever, the Clintons need money and the people who supply it.

I would have loved to explore all this. But when I approached people for interviews, I discovered that nobody, and I mean nobody, was interested in helping me make this film. Not Democrats, not Republicans -- and certainly nobody who works with the Clintons, wants access to the Clintons, or dreams of a position in a Hillary Clinton administration. Not even journalists who want access, which can easily be taken away. I even sensed potential difficulty in licensing archival footage from CBN (Pat Robertson) and from Fox. After approaching well over a hundred people, only two persons who had ever dealt with Mrs. Clinton would agree to an on-camera interview, and I suspected that even they would back out.

This, of course, was the real consequence, and probably the real intent, of the announcements by the RNC, Philippe Reines, and David Brock. Neither political party wanted the film made. After painful reflection, I decided that I couldn't make a film of which I would be proud. And so I'm cancelling. (Not because of any pressure from CNN -- quite the contrary.) It's a victory for the Clintons, and for the money machines that both political parties have now become. But I don't think that it's a victory for the media, or for the American people. I still believe that Mrs. Clinton has many virtues including great intelligence, fortitude, and a deep commitment to bettering the lives of women and children worldwide. But this is not her finest hour."

Before Heading East', 'He Was The Los Angeles Times Bureau Chief In Sacramento', 'Where He Spent A Decade Untangling California S Epic Budget Mess', 'Political Dysfunction.']",California discourages needy from signing up for food stamps,"WASHINGTON — It was not surprising that Texas held out.

For years, Texas was among a handful of states that required every resident seeking help with grocery bills to first be fingerprinted, an exercise typically associated with criminals.

Even though Republican Gov. Rick Perry ultimately got rid of the policy, Texas — always seeking to whittle down “big government” — remains one of the most effective states at keeping its poor out of the giant federal food stamp program.

But it is not No. 1. That distinction belongs to California.

Advertisement

Liberal California discourages eligible people from signing up for food stamps at rates conservative activists elsewhere envy. Only about half of the Californians who qualify for help get it.

That stands in contrast to other states, including some deeply Republican ones, that enroll 80% to 90% of those with incomes low enough to qualify.

That public policy paradox — one of the country’s most liberal states is the stingiest on one of the nation’s biggest benefit programs — has several causes, some intentional, some not. It also has two clear consequences: Millions of Californians don’t get help, and the state leaves hundreds of millions of dollars of federal money on the table.

The federal government pays for almost all of the food stamp program, which provides cash aid to about 46 million Americans at a cost of $74.6 billion this year. States administer the program.

In Washington, those costs have generated a furious debate that will heat up again next month when Congress returns from its summer recess.

While the federal government pays the bill, states get an economic boost from more people with money to spend on groceries.

Cash for food is so close to free money for states that several, such as Florida, with a Republican-controlled Legislature and a conservative GOP governor, pay contractors to scour the landscape for people to enroll in the program.

“It is impossible to get states to do conservative types of reform to this program,” said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has tried and failed to get GOP-controlled states to enact tougher enrollment standards.

“The things they could do, they don’t,” he said. “It would bring them political controversy and no financial gain for their state. It is like asking them to jump into a buzz saw and to bring their governor along.”

Not so in California, where onerous paperwork requirements, inhospitable county benefits offices and confusing online applications often prevail. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s latest study reflects the participation rate in 2010, agency enrollment figures released since then leave California stuck in last place.

In California, sometimes even those who qualify get rejected, as understaffed agencies prove unable to properly process applications.

Edlyn Countee had no idea she was eligible for food stamps until a friend who volunteered at a food bank brought it up. The 61-year-old from Oakland applied. She was rejected. “They said I made too much money,” she said. “I figured, ‘There goes that.’”

Advertisement

The friend insisted that there had been a mistake and that Countee should keep at it. The advice was solid, but it took an attorney from Bay Area Legal Aid calling social services officials, and Countee filling out an affidavit, before she got her $101 per month.

In Washington, the debate over food stamps has pitted Republicans, concerned about how much the program has grown, against Democrats who defend it. But that partisan divide does not truly reflect the reality of food stamp use back in lawmakers’ districts.

Much of the program’s growth involves the deep recession that started in 2008. But a big part stems from states that have actively tried to boost enrollment.

California has been slow to follow, as 36-year-old Sarah Palmer, a single mother from the East Bay city of Albany, discovered when the state threatened to cut her off unless she could produce receipts every few months detailing her child-care costs.

Advertisement

“Every three months I had to ask the day care to write a note detailing what I paid,” she said. Staff would keep forgetting. “Finally, one day I had to go in and tell them. ‘You know, we are receiving food stamps. I really need you to write this note for me.'…. It was humiliating.”

In most other states, Palmer would not have to produce such receipts; few require as much paperwork and none still require people to keep proving their eligibility as often.

“People are being denied benefits because of policies California chooses to employ,” said Jessica Bartholow, a legislative advocate at the nonprofit Western Center on Law and Poverty.

Some of those policies came into place under two Republican governors, Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who campaigned on promises to vigorously root out government waste.

Advertisement

Schwarzenegger vetoed several bills to end the state’s fingerprinting of food stamp recipients.

“Our first responsibility to taxpayers is to take necessary steps to prevent fraud and abuse,” he wrote in a 2005 veto message.

In 2011 the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California concluded after a study that the costly fingerprinting process did little to combat fraud but did discourage about 280,000 qualified people from signing up for CalFresh, as the food stamp program is known in California.

By then, even Texas had done away with fingerprinting. That October, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill ending California’s fingerprinting requirement.

Advertisement

Other hurdles, however, involve a problem that affects much of California’s government: the outmoded and inefficient data-intake systems the state uses to process applications. Different county agencies use different software programs, which are often incompatible with one another.

As other states have moved nimbly to overhaul their application processes, constantly simplifying them, California finds even a minor tweak can be a monumental undertaking.

The state’s complex history of dealing with immigrant families also has had a lingering effect. Only 20 years ago, California voters directed law enforcement to prosecute people suspected of being in the country illegally who applied for benefits.

The state’s requirements to produce bank statements, utility bills, day-care receipts and, until recently, fingerprints have left many immigrants, even those in the country legally, wary that an application will trigger a visit from immigration authorities, advocates say.

Advertisement

California is also one of 13 states that has a lifetime ban on food stamps for anyone convicted of drug dealing.

At a recent hearing in Sacramento, Wendy Still, chief adult probation officer for San Francisco, urged lawmakers to lift the ban, which affects about 20,000 felons. “If an individual does not have this basic need met, it can trigger an episode, an addiction, and then that triggers the cycle [of criminal behavior] over and over again,” she said.

Brown has taken several steps to loosen the state’s rules. In addition to ending the fingerprinting requirement, he also signed a measure that reduced the number of times each year applicants need to prove they qualify for assistance.

Yet nobody expects California to reach a participation rate of 92% anytime soon. That figure comes from conservative Tennessee, where Republicans control the governor’s office and both legislative chambers.

He Previously Worked In The Los Angeles City Hall Bureau For The Times. He Is A Native Of San Diego', 'A Graduate Of San Jose State University.']",Immigration bills benefited from a more engaged Gov. Brown,"SACRAMENTO — Tom Ammiano was frustrated.

Gov. Jerry Brown had refused to meet with him, said the Democratic assemblyman from San Francisco, to talk about the Trust Act. Ammiano had proposed it to prevent immigrants in the U.S. illegally from being turned over to federal officials for possible deportation when arrested by local authorities.

Advertisement

Eventually, Brown skewered the measure with his veto pen, saying the bill was “fatally flawed” because it might have let some serious criminals escape deportation.

That was last year. This year, things were different. Ammiano said the two had multiple meetings in Brown’s office, where they discussed its threadbare carpet, their shared Roman Catholicism — and the Trust Act.

“He said, ‘I have some tweaks,’” Ammiano recalled. “Then we talked turkey and … came up with what everybody could live with.”

Brown signed the measure into law about a week ago, one of 11 immigrant-related bills he accepted this year. He also significantly expanded driver’s licenses for immigrants without documents. He rejected a measure to allow noncitizens to serve on juries, but gave those in the U.S. illegally permission to be lawyers and signed a bill protecting them from employers who threaten to report their status.

Advertisement

Brown’s embrace of new immigrant rights is a shift from three years ago, when he openly opposed the driver’s license idea while running for governor. He signed a small handful of immigrant-rights bills last year, permitting driver’s licenses for those eligible for temporary federal work permits and giving undocumented college students access to public financial aid. But mostly, he stayed focused on the state’s budget morass.

Now, with the fiscal crisis behind him, legislators describe the governor as more approachable and engaged. Instead of being handed off to his staffers, they hashed out differences with him face to face.

Advertisement

It helped that the Legislature’s 25-member Latino caucus, which led the charge on many immigrant bills, is mostly Democratic and that the party won supermajorities in both houses last November. This year’s efforts also coincided with a new recognition of California’s changing demographics: Even the Republican Party that once rallied voters against illegal immigrants has launched a Latino outreach effort.

“There is a change,” said Brown, who is expected to run for reelection next year in a state where 20% of voters are Latino and 10% are of Asian descent. “It’s in part the sheer numbers and participation by immigrants in the life of our communities. It’s also the advocacy and impressive work of immigrant groups and their supporters.”

…

The driver’s license law was long in the making.

Advertisement

Los Angeles City Councilman Gil Cedillo began working on the issue in 1997, when he was first elected to the Legislature. He eventually persuaded lawmakers to pass a bill that Gov. Gray Davis signed in 2003.

Arnold Schwarzenegger canceled the measure later that year, after replacing Davis in the recall election.

Advertisement

Ten years on, “what [has] changed was the political leadership and … the political climate,” Cedillo said in an interview last week.

Even so, the license expansion would have foundered this year but for one lawmaker’s chance remark to Brown.

Advertisement

The bill’s author, Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville), planned to table it amid a fight over a distinguishing mark on the licenses — something Brown said federal law required.

With only one more day to go in the legislative session, Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) mentioned the stalled bill to the governor in a Capitol hallway. The senator said Brown, surprised, told him: “Send me the bill. I’ll sign it.”

Advertisement

Seizing the moment, DeLeon and a few colleagues revived the bill in the Senate, which passed it just hours before the Legislature adjourned. The Assembly quickly followed suit.

A couple of weeks later, more than 40 domestic workers — many of them Latino immigrants — were ushered into the governor’s inner office, where they tearfully watched him sign another long-sought bill. It requires overtime pay for nannies, healthcare aides and other personal attendants, a goal of community activists since 2006.

Advertisement

The group pressed in around Brown for a photo with him and Ammiano, the bill’s author. Many of those present had marched at the Capitol for years to make their case for equal employment rights, carrying babies or pushing in wheelchairs the disabled people they care for.

Lawmakers passed a bill last year that would have required rest and meal periods as well as overtime wages. But Brown rejected it, expressing concern in a long veto message about the “economic and human impact on the disabled or elderly person.”

Advertisement

Ammiano and Brown talked about the bill this year, providing the assemblyman with a road map for what the governor would support. Ammiano’s labor expert held meetings and conference calls with Brown’s aides to answer questions: How many workers were involved? How would work hours be counted? How would that affect the people being cared for?

In the end, only the overtime provision survived. But it was the one the workers most wanted.

…

In March of this year, a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll found that only 19% of Californians opposed a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. Among those with changing views are Republicans, who have a historically small minority in the Legislature and hold no statewide offices.

Advertisement

Two decades ago, the GOP was the main force behind Proposition 187, the effort to block public services for the undocumented, which drove up Democratic voter registration among Latinos. This year, the driver’s license bill received some GOP votes, and 16 Republican lawmakers signed a letter urging congressional leaders to change the nation’s immigration laws.

“Republicans chose the wedge of … Proposition 187, and we are paying the price for that decades later,” said Sen. Bill Emmerson (R-Hemet), who signed the letter, although he abstained from voting on the driver’s licenses bill. “It’s time for us to turn the page.”

Advertisement

Not all Republicans cede the issue. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly (R-Twin Peaks), a former Minuteman leader who may run against Brown next year, said the governor is “rolling the dice” with his flurry of immigrant-bill signings.

“We’ve created a precedent and an incentive for more people to come here illegally,” he said. “That’s a demerit for Gov. Jerry Brown.”

Advertisement

But Brown, immersed in California politics for the last four decades, has repeatedly proved his political instincts, noted Peter Dreier, a professor of politics at Occidental College.

The governor’s bill actions are “no accident,” Dreier said. Latinos’ increasingly powerful voice has “made them impossible to ignore.”

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, argues that the NSA’s ongoing, daily collection of virtually all Verizon telephone records is unconstitutional and should be stopped.

“This dragnet program is surely one of the largest surveillance efforts ever launched by a democratic government against its own citizens,” Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director, said in a statement. “It is the equivalent of requiring every American to file a daily report with the government of every location they visited, every person they talked to on the phone, the time of each call, and the length of every conversation.”

As a Verizon customer, the ACLU claims that the NSA’s seizure of telephone records “compromises sensitive information about its work” and harms its ability to freely communicate.

The Guardian newspaper last week published an order, marked “Top Secret,” from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that requires Verizon to turn over all “telephony metadata,” or records of each call, over a three-month period. Lawmakers later said the program has been in operation nonstop for seven years under similar court orders.

The White House has come under harsh criticism for the NSA’s deal with Verizon, as well as the so-called PRISM program, which was designed to secretly obtain emails, photos, documents and other online material from foreign nationals. A former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, has claimed responsibility for leaking both programs.

The administration has strongly defended the surveillance systems, saying they are approved by Congress and the courts, and thus within the law.

Obama “believes as commander-in-chief that the oversight structures that are in place to ensure that there is the proper review of the kinds of programs that we have in place, authorized by Congress through the Patriot Act, and FISA do strike that balance,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday.

Now I bring this up because there is a phenomenon happening lately that's really bugging me, and it's the resurgence of the smart stupid person. Now the smart stupid person is not new; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a smart stupid person. He was a surgeon, and he created Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. So he was not only smart, he was way ahead of his time on gay marriage. But he also believed in fairies. The other kind. (shakes head at Dan Savage)

Dr. William Mackenzie King was a smart stupid person, and he was the prime minister of Canada for 22 years, and held 5 degrees. And he believed he could speak to the spirits of his two dead Irish terriers, which is why Canada was always declaring war on squirrels.

Which brings me back to the Proof of Heaven book and its author, Dr. Eben Alexander, and the question of how a neurosurgeon, of all people, could say he made a day trip to heaven while in a coma, when his scientific training, not to mention every other scientist in the world, is telling him, no dude, you were just tripping. Those coma drugs are some good shit! Well, that's the scientific explanation.

You heard that, right? I didn't just.... (wild audience laughter and applause)

That's right, that was God, right.

Here's what Dr. Alexander said. He said:



DR. EBEN ALEXANDER: I was a speck on a beautiful butterfly wing; millions of other butterflies around us. We were flying through... indescribable colors... arcs of silver and gold light.

And yet, somehow Dr. Alexander isn't even the only brilliant brain surgeon who's also a drooling idiot. Dr. Ben Carson is the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, and the first doctor to separate conjoined twins at the head. And he believes the earth is 6,000 years old. And that homosexuality is akin to bestiality. And the Bible calls for a flat tax. (audience laughter) He's half brilliant brain surgeon, half Tea Party dumbass. He doesn't just operate on conjoined twins, he is one.

He's also someone who many Republicans are encouraging to run for President in 2016. And why not? There's no more attractive figure in the Republican Party these days than an anti-intellectual with an advanced degree. People like Antonin Scalia, Ted Cruz, and Bobby Jindal, who are accomplished scholars on the outside, and on the inside, a creamy layer of Michele Bachmann. (wild audience laughter and applause)

And what's with all the know-nothing doctors? People like Scott DesJarlais, and Paul Broun, and Tom Coburn, and their subspeciality — OBGYNs who know nothing about reproduction! Like Congressman/OBGYN Ron Paul, who said abortion leads to euthanasia. Or Congressman/OBGYN Michael Burgess, the guy who just last month said fetuses masturbate in the womb. Wearing tiny raincoats. (audience laughter) Or Congressman/OBGYN Phil Gingrey, who when Todd Akin introduced America to the concept of ""legitimate rape"" — Remember that? When a woman is assaulted by a licensed, bonded, and fully insured rapist — backed him up and said aww, all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate. Well, forget for a moment that's wholly untrue, let's ask the more important question: Why are we electing so many gynecologists to Congress? (audience applause)

If having your head between a woman's legs is a qualification for public office, then why not Congressman Michael Douglas?"

Woods, Jr. and the Neo-Confederate Catholic Right","Over the years, this column has looked at the many facets of the Catholic Right, including neo-cons, paleo-cons, Bill Donohue, Opus Dei, and more. We now come to the Neo-Confederate Catholic Right, a peculiar variation of libertarianism, which focuses almost exclusively on economics while maintaining most, if not all of the social conservative culture war issues such as opposition to reproductive rights and marriage equality. Indeed, this movement employs the long discredited states' rights theory of nullification -- the notion that any state has the right to ignore any federal court order or law which that state has deemed unconstitutional.

Among the Catholic Rightists beating the drum for nullification are Pat Buchanan, Thomas DiLorenzo, Thomas Fleming and Thomas E. Woods, Jr. All four advocate states' rights, a seething resentment of Abraham Lincoln, and as Rachel Tabachnick recently highlighted, Woods is a key member of the pro-secession League of the South, Traditional Catholicism (save possibly DiLorenzo) and Austrian-school, libertarian economics.

Woods is a convert to the type of Catholicism sought by many on the Catholic Right. As such, he is a vocal proponent for a return to a pre-Vatican II mindset. He is extreme in his economic libertarianism as well as secession and nullification. While nullification has a long and dark history on matters of race in the U.S., it is also looming as an issue for reproductive rights and marriage equality.

It is therefore no surprise that among Woods' admirers is the influential Opus Dei priest C. John McCloskey. The former Ivy League-Wall Street laissez-faire apostle-turned-prelate has himself ruminated on the appeal of secession to achieve theocracy. In his infamous futuristic dystopian essay 2030: Looking Backwards he gleefully imagines a violent separation from the United States:

The tens of thousands of martyrs and confessors for the Faith in North America were indeed the ""seed of the Church"" as they were in pre-Edict of Milan Christianity. The final short and relatively bloodless conflict produced our Regional States of North America. The outcome was by no means an ideal solution but it does allow Christians to live in states that recognize the natural law and divine Revelation, the right of free practice of religion, and laws on marriage, family, and life that reflect the primacy of our Faith. With time and the reality of the ever-decreasing population of the states that worship at the altar of ""the culture of death,"" perhaps we will be able to reunite and fulfill the Founding Fathers of the old United States dream to be ""a shining city on a hill.""

What McCloskey describes as ""by no means an ideal solution"" has a more accurate, more commonly-held description: Treason.

And yet there is more than a hint of hypocrisy in McCloskey's admiration of Woods - especially his libertarian economic outlook. Catholic writer Angus Sibely has observed, Woods is a devotee of über-libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard. A closer examination of Rothbard beliefs reveals why this is problematic.

First, Rothbard is the father of anarcho-capitalism, the basis of Woods' economic philosophy. It is such an extreme philosophy that even law enforcement and the courts would be privatized; taxation would be replaced by either private payments or insurance settlements. Rothbard is on record saying ""the entire theory of labor unions is deeply flawed."" As Angus Sibley explains, it is the very antithesis of Catholic economic teachings:

Most practical methods of reducing inequalities are repugnant to libertarians. Labor unions are hated because they obstruct the worker's freedom to agree his own contract with his employer. ... Redistributive taxation (higher tax rates on higher personal incomes) ""is a mode of disguised expropriation of successful capitalists and entrepreneurs"" according to Mises, while his admirer Murray Rothbard stated that ""Taxation is Robbery"" and that ""the libertarian favors the right to unrestricted private property and free-exchange"". Hayek rejected outright the principle of distributive justice: ""the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question of whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just or unjust has no meaning."" Catholic teaching flatly repudiates such nonsense. Leo XIII (Rerum Novarum, §45) spoke of ""a dictate of natural justice more imperious and ancient than any bargain between man and man, namely that wages ought not to be insufficient to support a frugal and well-behaved wage-earner"", and he strongly commended (#49) workers' associations, of which ""the most important of all are workingmen's unions."" John Paul II (Centesimus Annus, §20) observed that ""unions... are indeed a mouthpiece for the struggle for social justice, for the just rights of working people.""

But what is all-too-conveniently glossed over by Woods, McCloskey and others -- is Rothbard's shocking and idiosyncratic view on abortion. It is a view that is consistent with extreme libertarianism, but is very far from any other pro-choice thought I have ever heard. Rothbard's view suggests a deep fissure on the conservative spectrum that they would rather we not see.

Most fetuses are in the mother's womb because the mother consents to this situation, but the fetus is there by the mother's freely-granted consent. But should the mother decide that she does not want the fetus there any longer, then the fetus becomes a parasitic ""invader"" of her person, and the mother has the perfect right to expel this invader from her domain. Abortion should be looked upon, not as ""murder"" of a living person, but as the expulsion of an unwanted invader from the mother's body. Any laws restricting or prohibiting abortion are therefore invasions of the rights of mothers. [Emphasis added]

We need to understand why Woods and McCloskey's Neo-Confederate philosophy of nullification and secession is so appealing to some on the Catholic Right so we can not only better answer them, but sharpen the contrast with just alternatives. Those tasks will be tackled in subsequent posts.

The photographers say they didn't stage photos for this series, making this arrangement of televisions in a New York hotel all the more curious.

Their explorations brought them to this desolate theater in Connecticut.

Each room and hall of this defunct sanitarium in New York was ripe for exploration, the photographers say.

The photographers took pleasure in exploring abandoned structures like this grain silo in upstate New York for the perfect shot.

This shot was taken in a chapel in New York.

These dusty boots are just a few of the forgotten artifacts they found in this coal-breaking plant in Pennsylvania.

The photographers declined to provide a specific location for most of the sites they visited, including this asylum in upstate New York, citing ""exploring ethics.""

Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia closed in 1971, making for eerie pictures of cellblocks from the defunct prison.

They explored parts of central New York state, where they found this room with a view in an abandoned Masonic lodge.

For ""States of Decay,"" the photographers traveled through America's Rust Belt, a geographic term used to describe the economic decline of America's industrial heartland. They found a rack of forgotten bowling shoes in an old asylum in New York.

The cover photo for ""States of Decay,"" a photo book by Daniel Barter and Daniel Marbaix, was shot in a cathedral in Pennsylvania during their photographic exploration of the northeastern United States.

Story highlights Abandoned churches, prisons, asylums are the stars of the photo book ""States of Decay"" Photographers Daniel Marbaix and Daniel Barter found their subjects in America's Rust Belt A shared fascination with old buildings brought the photographers together

(CNN) —

British photographers and self-described “urban explorers” Daniel Marbaix and Daniel Barter see beauty amid the desolation of abandoned buildings.

Their shoots have brought them to defunct factories, mines and houses of worship around the world, from their native England to Japan. For their first book, they captured the forgotten structures of the eastern United States: ruins of churches and theaters in New York City, derelict train stations, asylums and factories in the Rust Belt.

Images from “States of Decay,” published in July, evoke different reactions, especially the book’s cover. Shot by Barter, it shows an American flag hanging over a defaced frieze of the Last Supper. Barter said the image reflects the separation of church and state in a reference to American politics.

Citing an “explorers’ code,” the photographers chose not to provide specific information about the locations of their shoots. Indeed, the decaying structure may or may not reflect a general decline in the surrounding area, regardless of the state of the structure.

A shared fascination with old buildings brought the photographers together. Barter’s love of old buildings started as a child. Growing up in North London, he and a few friends would climb a fence after school and play inside a derelict airplane.

“The combination of leather and shiny metal switches was a formative experience for me,” said Barter, 29. “If I close my eyes, I can almost still smell it.” When he grew older, Barter studied restoration art in college, and that knowledge transformed his interest into a job as a professional photographer.

Meanwhile, Marbaix studied zoology at Royal Holloway, University of London, and somehow fell in love with photography.

Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life.

“My courses seemed to just spill over into exploring the urban environment and that led to photography,” said Marbaix, 33. “I have not looked back since.”

When the two first met through friends in a pub in London of 2011, they were competing photographers. But after they learned of their mutual interest in taking photos of “older building and artifacts,” a friendship developed that has led to many adventures, for work and pleasure – often both.

Poking around abandoned buildings has led to a few close calls with authorities, the “Dan duo” said. The mixture of luck and adrenaline has concocted a slew of comical memories for the pair as well as some great shots.

Although many of their shoots might appear to be planned and organized, most of the time they’re produced during holidays and trips with friends and family.

“There is not a method to the madness. We just do whatever we feel like,” Marbaix said.

While they continue to work on projects centered on the unseen and unfamiliar in Britain, they’re looking forward to more adventures.

“We are told that we are too old to be doing this sort of thing,” said Marbaix. “But honestly I could care less. My mother loves it and that’s all that matters.”"

Gannett Washington Bureau

Rubio initially backed bill that would give illegal immigrants a path to citizenship

Aide says senator%27s current immigration views acknowledge %22political reality%22

Shift seen as beneficial to Rubio%27s presidential aspirations

WASHINGTON — Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is backing off his push for comprehensive immigration reform, opting instead to pursue a piecemeal approach favored by House Republican leaders.

Rubio was a key player on the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" that conceived, wrote and pushed a Senate bill aimed at tightening border security, revamping the nation's visa program and providing a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.

The bill was approved 68-32 in June, a remarkably decisive outcome in a divided Senate. It has stalled in the House, where GOP leaders oppose the citizenship provision. They would rather address immigration through a series of smaller bills, most dealing with security.

Immigration activists praised Rubio for his courage following the Senate vote. Tea party activists denounced him for backing what they call ""amnesty"" for immigrants in the country illegally and said they were rethinking their support for him if he runs for president in 2016.

Now, Rubio's immigration strategy has abruptly pivoted from a comprehensive approach to the go-slow strategy backed by the House.

In interviews with reporters this week, the son of Cuban-American immigrants said he still supports a comprehensive bill but is being ""realistic"" about what can be achieved given the House's resistance. His spokesman, Alex Conant, confirmed the new tactic.

""Sen. Rubio worked very hard on immigration reform and we successfully passed it in the Senate, but now we're dealing with the political reality of what's achievable in the House,"" he said.

Rubio ""is just trying to make progress on immigration reform, and the best way to make progress is to focus on what we agree on,"" Conant continued. ""We should not waste another opportunity to begin to improve our immigration system, which is what will happen if people stick to an all-or-nothing approach.""

That's not sitting well with immigration activists.

They view the move as a betrayal and an attempt by Rubio to revive his flagging presidential aspirations. Rubio's star has been somewhat eclipsed by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a fellow Latino tea party favorite for the White House who staunchly opposed the Senate's immigration bill.

""I've been working on this for 25 years and there's no question that the only way you fix any one part is to have a comprehensive approach that addresses all the parts,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration group America's Voice.

Rubio is ""tacking to the right to make himself more electable in places like New Hampshire and Iowa,"" Sharry said. ""This is about personal ambition, not a concern for proper policy.""

Tea party activists aren't impressed either.

Kathy Jones, who chairs the Lee County Patriots in Florida, said she thinks Rubio might be trying to appease the Republican base. She said it won't work.

""There are so many of us who will never cast a vote for him again,"" Jones said. ""Those of us who voted for him voted for him based on what he said he was going to do and what his beliefs were. And he stated too many times — unequivocally — (that he) will never support amnesty for illegals.""

The Senate bill Rubio championed to conservative audiences would spend more than $40 billion to build more fencing along the Southern border and add more than 20,000 border agents. It would revamp the nation's visa program and beef up workplace verification to make sure jobs are held by legal residents. It also would offer immigrants in the country illegally a 13-year citizenship process, provided certain security benchmarks are met.

Under the House approach, the only bills likely to win approval are those related to security, or pro-business measures that would expand the agricultural workforce or increase the number of high-tech visas, Sharry said.

""Many Republicans want to pass pieces of immigration reform but not deal with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in America,"" he said. ""How can you solve the problem of immigration without dealing with a population the size of Ohio?""

Sharry calls Rubio's latest move ""flip-flopping.""

But ""flip-flopping isn't so bad if you're going in the right direction,"" said Bob Vander Plaats, who heads The Family Leader, a socially conservative organization based in Iowa, where the nation's first presidential caucus takes place.

Vander Plaats said conservative voters in Iowa don't like the Senate immigration bill but will give Rubio a full hearing if he decides to run for president.

""If he's still saying at the end of the day the plan we put forward is where I want to go, well, this isn't going to help him a lot then,"" he said. ""If he's saying, 'I've got a change of heart, we need to secure the border, we need to make sure all these things are done before we start looking into the other process' — that would probably help him.""

Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida, said Rubio seems to be practicing pragmatism.

""There's nobody that better represents the difficulties of immigration reform than Marco Rubio,"" she said. "" No matter which way you zig or zag, you're going to run into roadblocks. It all comes down to whether reformers or tea party people can be moved themselves, or are they intransigent. And he's banked on the fact that something is better than nothing."""

The comment sparked criticism from activists and politicians

Police Commissioner Kelly said separately that 90%25 of New Yorkers killed or shot are minorities

A federal lawsuit is ongoing over %27stop and frisk%27 procedures

NEW YORK (AP) — Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday that police ""disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little"" as compared to murder suspects' descriptions, sparking criticism from activists and some politicians in a city that has been immersed in a debate about law enforcement and discrimination.

Speaking on his weekly WOR-AM radio appearance, Bloomberg echoed an argument he has made before: that the stops' demographics should be assessed against suspect descriptions, not the population as a whole. But coming a day after city lawmakers voted to create a police inspector general and new legal avenues for racial profiling claims, the mayor's remarks drew immediate pushback.

The measures' advocates accused the mayor of using ""irresponsible rhetoric,"" some mayoral hopefuls chastised him and some City Council members said his remarks only emphasized the need for change.

""Our mayor's comments prove he just doesn't get it,"" said Councilman Robert Jackson, who co-chairs the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus.

Bloomberg spokesman Marc LaVorgna said the critics were ""fabricating outrage over an absolutely accurate comment.""

""What they should be outraged by is the number of minorities who are being killed and that successful police efforts to save minority lives are being hampered,"" he added.

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly noted separately Friday that more than 90% of people killed or shot in the city are black or Hispanic.

The police tactic known as stop and frisk has become a high-profile political issue in the city, where stops have soared during Bloomberg's three terms. He and Kelly say the stops are an invaluable policing aid and have helped cut crime rates dramatically, while critics say the street stops humiliate many innocent people and are unfairly focused on minorities.

Those complaints have prompted a federal lawsuit over the stop and frisk practice and were part of the impetus for the City Council's vote Thursday. Bloomberg reiterated Friday that he'll veto the legislation, which he says will impede policing. They passed with enough votes to override a veto, but the mayor has noted that he plans to keep pressing his case with lawmakers.

About 5 million stops have been made during the past decade. Eighty-seven% of those stopped in the last two years were black or Hispanic. Those groups comprise 54% of the city population.

Bloomberg says that comparison isn't appropriate.

The racial breakdown of those stopped is ""not a disproportionate percentage of those who witnesses and victims describe as committing the murder. In that case, incidentally, I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little,"" he said Friday on ""The John Gambling Show.""

More than 90% of suspects in killings in the last two years were described as black or Hispanic, according to city officials.

""The cops' job is to stop (people in) the groups fitting the description. It's society's job to make sure that no one group is disproportionately represented as potential perpetrators,"" Bloomberg said earlier in the show.

The group Communities United for Police Reform called Bloomberg's view misinformation, noting that most stops aren't spurred by suspect descriptions. Police department records of the stops also list such reasons as ""furtive movements"" or suspicious bulges in clothing.

""Mayor Bloomberg should cease with the irresponsible rhetoric and seek to work with the council on a constructive path forward,"" said Communities United for Police Reform spokeswoman Joo-Hyun Kang.

Public Advocate and mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio sent supporters an email rapping Bloomberg's remarks, while fellow contender and City Comptroller John Liu issued a statement calling them ""insensitive, outrageous, and just plain weird."" Rival and former City Comptroller Bill Thompson, who is black, termed Bloomberg's comments insulting and called on him to apologize.

""What he seems to indicate to the hundreds of thousands of people who have been unnecessarily stopped and frisked is, 'We're sorry we didn't stop more people,'"" Thompson said."

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed Friday’s ruling that President Obama violated the constitution when he bypassed the Senate last year to fill vacancies on a labor relations panel. Carney says the White House “strongly disagrees” with the decision. (The Washington Post)

President Obama exceeded his constitutional authority by making appointments when the Senate was on a break last year, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. The court’s broad ruling would sharply limit the power that presidents throughout history have used to make recess appointments in the face of Senate opposition and inaction.

A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit flatly rejected the Obama administration’s rationale for appointing three members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) while the Senate was on a holiday break.

Chief Judge David B. Sentelle sharply criticized the administration’s interpretation of when recess appointments may be made, saying it would give the president “free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be a weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction.” He added, “This cannot be the law.”

The issue seems certain to end up before the Supreme Court, which ultimately could clarify a president’s authority to fill his administration and appoint federal judges when a minority of the Senate blocks consideration of his choices.

Although recess appointments have been made throughout the nation’s history, they have been more commonly made by modern presidents who face partisan opposition that has made it hard for nominees to even receive a vote in the Senate.

Additionally, Friday’s decision casts doubt on hundreds of decisions the NLRB has made in the past year, ranging from enforcement of collective-bargaining agreements to rulings on the rights of workers to use social media.

The ruling also raises questions about the recess appointment of former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray to head the fledgling Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and about the actions taken by the agency during his tenure, including major new rules governing the mortgage industry. Obama named Cordray at the same time as the NLRB nominees, and his appointment is the subject of a separate lawsuit in D.C. federal court.

The White House criticized the court ruling. “The decision is novel and unprecedented, and it contradicts 150 years of practice by Democratic and Republican administrations,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Friday. “We respectfully but strongly disagree with the ruling.”

Presidents from both parties have made hundreds of recess appointments when the Senate has failed to act on nominations. Ronald Reagan holds the record with 243. Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, made 105, and it was during his term that Senate Democrats began holding pro-forma sessions, some lasting less than a minute, when the Senate went on break. They contended that that kept the Senate in session and did not allow Bush to make recess appointments.

Republicans took up the practice when Obama was elected. But Obama decided to challenge it in January 2012, when the Senate was on a 20-day holiday but holding pro-forma sessions every three business days to block presidential action.

Obama moved ahead with the nomination of Cordray, who many Republicans considered overly antagonistic toward business, and three NLRB members — Sharon Block, Terence F. Flynn and Richard F. Griffin Jr.

At the time, the NLRB had only two members and was thus unable to take any official action. Some Republicans were worried that the board under Obama would be too pro-union.

Obama said he had the authority under the Constitution’s recess appointments clause, which grants power for such appointments “during the Recess of the Senate,” when senators are unavailable to provide their advice and consent.

Sentelle, joined by Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson and Thomas B. Griffith, said that the Constitution’s reference to “the Recess” means that appointments are allowed only during the recess between sessions of the Senate, not when the Senate is simply on a break. It was not up to the president to decide what constitutes a recess, Sentelle said.

The ruling noted that another federal appeals court has read the Constitution differently, which adds to the likelihood the Supreme Court will have to settle the issue.

Sentelle and Henderson went where apparently no other court has gone. They said that the president has the authority to make appointments only to vacancies that arise during a recess, which would drastically limit a president’s ability to make use of the recess appointment power.

A senior administration official who was granted anonymity to discuss White House legal strategy said it was unlikely that the White House would ask the full D.C. Circuit court to take up the case. The official said it might be better to wait for other courts around the country to rule on similar cases and then seek Supreme Court review.

Senate Republicans said the decision was a victory for the separation of powers.

“Today’s ruling reaffirms that the Constitution is above political party or agenda, despite what the Obama administration seems to think,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah).

Some Democrats said the ruling will encourage Senate Republicans to block Obama’s nominees by refusing to allow them to come to a vote.

“Today’s circuit court decision is not only a radical departure from precedent, it ignores the fact that President Obama had no choice but to act,” said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). Harkin said that “throughout his presidency, Republicans have employed unprecedented partisan delay tactics and filibusters” to block Obama’s nominees.

The case was brought by Noel Canning, a company in Washington state that challenged an NLRB ruling by saying the three Obama board members were not properly appointed. The court’s ruling on Noel’s behalf leaves hundreds of decisions in which the three members have participated open to court challenge. Block and Griffin continue to serve. Flynn resigned last year.

NLRB Chairman Mark Gaston Pearce said the board, which now has only three members, will continue with business as usual.

“It should be noted that this order applies to only one specific case, Noel Canning, and that similar questions have been raised in more than a dozen cases pending in other courts of appeals,” Pearce said in a statement on the board’s Web site.

But labor unions were alarmed. “Chaos” is the way Pamela Allen, legal director of National Nurses United, described the effect of the court ruling. She said, “It’s a field day for the employers. This decision will be appealed, but to a [Supreme] Court that hasn’t always been friendly to labor over the years.”

Allen said that hundreds of NLRB rulings might be contested by employers. One example, she said, was a recent ruling to force a rural California hospital to award back pay to union activists and to accept a vote by its nurses to let the union bargain on their behalf.

Charles I. Cohen, a former NLRB member and senior counsel in the labor and employment practice of the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said the result of the court ruling was “a cloud” over the NLRB that would “present a quandary for employers about how to comply with the law.”

The work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could also be in jeopardy because the law requires the agency to have a director in place before it can exercise its power to write regulations and enforce them.

In the past three weeks alone, the bureau has issued seven rules changing the way that homeowners interact with the mortgage industry by limiting upfront fees, providing free appraisals and curtailing harmful practices such as interest-only payments, among other things.

“There will be lots of lawsuits, lots of uncertainty about what the rules of the road are, and lots of taxpayer money wasted on things that potentially turn out to be invalid,” said Andrew J. Pincus, an attorney who represents the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Cordray’s recess appointment expires at the end of this year. Obama renominated him on Thursday, but GOP leaders have said they continue to oppose him.

(CNN) - One of the Gang of Eight senators who negotiated an immigration deal headed to the Senate floor says the bill does not yet have support to overcome a potential filibuster.

""At this moment we have not found 60 votes in the Senate,"" Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, said in an interview on the Spanish-language network Univision that was translated by CNN. ""We still need more votes in the chamber.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The immigration legislation passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday with support from 10 Democrats and three Republicans, including Sens. Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham, two other members of the Gang of Eight. After months of backroom crafting by the four Democrats and four Republicans in the informal group, as well as negotiations with labor and other groups, the committee considered some 300 amendments and rejected several which some senators considered poison pills that would doom the bill.

It was important that the committee kept largely intact the product of their negotiations, Menendez said in the interview, but he said much needed to be done before the bill could pass the full Senate, where he indicated debate will likely begin on June 10.

He hoped a significant margin in the Senate would put pressure on the GOP-led House to sign on. A separate bipartisan effort has been under way there and appears to have survived a dispute over how undocumented immigrants' health care costs would be covered.

Members of both parties want to see immigration legislation pass this year, and the effort has the support of President Barack Obama and the Democratic and Republican Senate leaders.

Neither party, however, has enough to overcome a Senate filibuster on their own.

In a statement after the committee vote, Menendez wrote that the legislation faces ""a long road and our work is far from done.""

As written now, the bill would create a 13-year path to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.

Univision said the interview will air Sunday on the network's ""Al Punto"" program.

Throughout his time in office, President Obama has opened many outside-the-Beltway speeches with a suggestion that he, too, feels like an outsider in the nation’s baffling, frustrating capital city. He shouts to the audience about how good it is to be wherever he is that day — Cleveland, Miami, San Francisco. Then he takes pokes at the town where great success in his chosen profession has brought him.

“It is good to be out of Washington,” he often says — a line that, in good times and in bad, always generates warm, sympathetic applause.

Changing Washington may not have come off as Obama promised. But for the president and his supporters, the city has been an object of contempt they can believe in.

Now, though, Obama has raised the possibility that he might remain a resident of the capital after his lease on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. expires in January 2017.

In an interview this week with Barbara Walters of ABC News, Obama and the first lady, Michelle, said they may live in Washington beyond their time in the White House to allow their younger daughter, Sasha, to graduate from Sidwell Friends School.

Sasha would be a high school sophomore at the end of the president’s second term, giving the family a couple years to enjoy, or endure, Washington as private citizens.

“We gotta make sure that she’s doing well . . . until she goes off to college,” Obama told Walters, according to an advance transcript of the interview, which aired Friday night. “Sasha will have a big say in where we are.”

For a couple who celebrate the city of Chicago as often as they skewer Washington’s nasty political culture, the suggestion that they may stick around past the constitutionally mandated time is surprising. And it highlights the reality that despite the cloistered and well-supported lifestyle of the American presidency, the Obamas are in some ways working parents who face a set of decisions not unfamiliar to others their age.

Obama would be the first former president to remain in Washington post-presidency since the dying Woodrow Wilson more than nine decades ago. A former president is an easy political target, and to stay in Washington is to be a close-range one as well. The journey from leader of the free world to the person most to blame for the early problems of a new administration is as short as a walk across Lafayette Square.

Most find it best to be far from the scene of the alleged crimes when the accusations start flying. George W. Bush, who moved back to Texas and began painting, was relatively well-served by that distance when Obama pointed often to his predecessor as the cause of the economic and fiscal problems his administration faced early on.

Sticking around is “a terrible idea and I can’t imagine it will last very long,” said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution. “Once you’re in Washington you are somehow connected to every problem that your predecessor is going to be confronting. And you will be asked to say something each time your name comes up, given that you will have reporters camping out on your doorstep.”

This, in part, is the reason many former presidents don’t flee just Washington, but public life entirely.

Ronald Reagan and Lyndon B. Johnson vanished onto beloved ranches in California and Texas, the former to enjoy his last years in a pretty valley north of Santa Barbara and the latter to lament what might have been if not for Vietnam.

Both men were getting on in years by the time they left office. Younger occupants such as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton remained active on the world stage after their presidencies rather than in the tiny arena that is official Washington.

As for the Obamas, “they are still trying to figure it out,” said Josh Earnest, the White House principal deputy press secretary. “It is certainly something they have been thinking about, and that is evident in the answer they gave.”

Earnest said the decision will likely be made late in the president’s term and pivot largely on Sasha, who is 12 and in seventh grade. Malia, 15, a high school sophomore, will have left for college by then.

“I think it is school and Sasha being able to keep her social group as much as possible — that is what is most important to them,” Earnest said.

The Obamas have kept their home in Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood, staying there on some visits home. Their departure was always meant to be temporary. As Valerie Jarrett, a close family friend and senior adviser to Obama, said as the family decamped for Washington, “It is really not goodbye. Rather, Chicago will say, ‘See you soon.’ ”

Michelle Obama, if not her husband, has raised the prospect of picking up post-White House life somewhere other than the city where she grew up. Last year, she said on two occasions that the family may not return to Chicago, as much as she loves the city.

“While I like going back to Chicago — I like to see the lake — this is home now because this is where we’ve built our lives,” Michelle Obama told USA Today in May 2012. “And when it’s time to leave, we’ll build it somewhere else.”

The Obamas’ frequent knocks of Washington have focused on the politics — the K Street money and the 24-hour punditry, the partisanship on Capitol Hill and the culture of point-scoring, which the president and his predecessors have said comes at the expense of the country.

Obama’s message about the city: Hate the players, not the playground. But how much Obama and his family like Washington as a place is a bit of a mystery .

At the start of Obama’s presidency, the first couple dined out with some frequency, not only on special occasions such as anniversaries but also for regular date nights. The Obamas seemed to embrace the city as much as the city embraced the new administration in the afterglow of a historic election.

Those nights out have become less common, and off-hours Obama now leaves the White House most regularly for the fairway-to-green seclusion of 18 holes at Andrews Air Force Base.

So what would private life in Washington look like for an ex-president?

That is hard to say, given that the most recent precedent is Wilson, who remained in town after his presidency ended in 1921 largely because he was suffering the debilitating aftereffects of a stroke.

One unknown is what Obama, who will be 55 when he leaves office, will want to do after his presidency.

There are law schools where he could pick up his teaching career — a vocation he says has informed his presidency — and any private home the couple may choose would certainly have a place for him to hide away and write the inevitable memoir of his presidency, even if his presidential records and library would be somewhere else.

That work could take the couple through Sasha’s graduation — and then, perhaps, far from a city traditionally full of transients who find it hard to love it.

“It’s just not a very congenial place to hang out,” Hess said."

Well, Enrile's new position as Senate minority leader has obviously given him more time to do the things he could not afford to do when he was still busy leading the Senate in the 15th Congress.



On Wednesday, the Senate minority leader was seen enjoying a popular game, Bejeweled, on his tablet while waiting for his turn to speak before the Senate committee hearing.



Observers from the Senate saw how Bejeweled entertained Enrile, who had to wait long for his colleague Senator Jose ""Jinggoy"" to finish asking questions about the sex-for-flight scandals in the Middle East.



""I'm now at Level 271,"" a grinning Enrile later admitted in an interview.



Enrile explained he enjoys playing Bejeweled more than playing Candy Crush because he doesn't like eating candies. He also confessed he was not into computer games when he was still Senate President.

""It was only during the campaign when I started (playing),"" he told reporters.



During the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) last summer, Enrile said he found time to tinker with his iPad.



And yes, he is convinced that games like Bejeweled are effective mind exercises.



""My former secretary at the law office downloaded this game on my iPad,"" the veteran lawmaker said



""I like it because it exercises my mind. And it challenges me to know how fast I can solve one level,"" he added.

Senator Teofisto ""TG"" Guingona led the Senate probe on the issue as chair of Senate committee on blue ribbon.



Enrile attended the Senate's first hearing on sex-for-flight scandal, which implicated Philippine Labor Attache Adam Musa.



And it seemed like playing Bejeweled inspired Enrile to grill Musa for his alleged shortcomings in handling the case of an abused Filipina worker while she was still working in Saudi.



During the Senate inquiry, Enrile said Musa failed to meet his duty to protect the welfare of overseas Filipino workers.



The Filipina worker sought help from Musa after she reported that her employer sexually abused her. After quitting her job, Musa's office took the Filipina in to work as a janitress.



The worker then accused Musa's driver of trying to rape her, another case that should have been properly investigated if only the Philippine labor official did not allow his staff to immediately settle by paying financial damages.



The settlement of the case, Enrile pointed out, also prevented Musa to look into the woman's first complaint of abuse against her previous employer in Saudi.

Updated at 8:19 p.m. ET on 8/11

(CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden will travel to Iowa next month to deliver the keynote speech at Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry, an aide to the vice president - and potential candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination - told CNN's Jim Acosta on Sunday.

An Iowa Democratic official also confirmed Biden's upcoming visit to Harkin's steak fry, which typically attracts a high-profile crowd of national Democrats. Its setting in the first-in-the-nation caucus state makes it a natural stop for potential White House hopefuls.



A Biden aide said the stop in Iowa has long been a commitment on the vice president's calendar after he was unable to attend last year's steak fry.

The vice president's trip was first reported by The New York Times.

Biden has not yet said whether he'll make a third bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, though his schedule this year has hinted at where his aspirations may lie.

In May, he spoke to a gathering of Democrats in South Carolina, site of the first-in-the-South primary contest in presidential nominating years. And later this month, he'll help raise money for New Hampshire's Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, though the event itself won't take place in the first-in-the-nation primary state, but rather in neighboring Maine.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, considered the Democrats' top pick for the presidential nomination in 2016 if she chooses to run, has not visited any early voting states since she left her post at the State Department in February. Like Biden, she has not said whether she'll make another bid for the White House.

And while Clinton hasn't yet traveled to Iowa in her new role as a private citizen, a group that works to elect Democratic women to public office held a ""Madam President"" event there this weekend with Clinton as the unspoken target.

Plenty of Republicans have visited Iowa, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania this weekend for an evangelical gathering.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana have also visited the Hawkeye State over the past several months.

A further 850,000 will be denied benefits in the first quarter of 2014.

Congressional Democrats and the White House, pointing to the sluggish recovery and the still-high jobless rate, are pushing once again to extend the period covered by the unemployment insurance program. But with Congress still far from a budget deal and still struggling to find alternatives to the $1 trillion in long-term cuts known as sequestration, lawmakers say the chances of an extension before Congress adjourns in two weeks are slim.

As a result, one of the largest stimulus measures passed during the recession is likely to come to an end, and jobless workers in many states are likely to receive considerably fewer weeks of benefits.

In all, as many as 4.8 million people could be affected by expiring unemployment benefits through 2014, estimated Gene Sperling, President Obama’s top economic adviser."

Both Ernie Angelo, Ronald Reagan’s Texas campaign manager in 1980, and Rick Shelby, the 1980 Reagan campaign’s regional political director responsible for Texas, told the Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis on Friday that Karl Rove was not the “director of the Texas campaign for Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980” as he claimed Thursday on The O’Reilly Factor:

I finally caught up with Rick Shelby, who helped me get to the bottom of it. Today, Shelby’s with the American Gas Association, but in 1979, he was one of the original Regional Political Directors for the Reagan for President Committee. This involved coordinating nine states — including Texas. Since Texas was important, Shelby tells me he spent an “inordinate” amount of time in the Lone Star State in 1980. And though Rove never technically worked on the Reagan campaign, Shelby says he served as executive director for the state’s Victory Committee. In that capacity, Shelby recalls that Rove “played a vital role in helping raise the funds necessary” for an effective voter ID and turnout program in the state.

Here’s what 1980 Reagan Texas campaign manager Ernest Angelo said about Rove’s role in the 1980 Reagan campaign in an email Friday:

In 1980 I was Gov Reagan’s Texas chairman in the primary and Campaign Manager for the general election. Gov Clements endorsed Reagan after the Texas primary and was the campaign Chairman. I was a full time volunteer on site for most of the Fall campaign in Austin. I worked closely with Rick Shelby who was a Reagan Regional Political Director and was in Austin nearly full time. We had a large staff of volunteers and paid individuals. I’m not much for titles but I can assure you Karl Rove was materially involved since he was working for me and Gov Clements in the campaign.

Reagan biographer Craig Shirley said he was “delighted” to see Angelo and Shelby confirm his own research, he said in an exclusive email to Breitbart News Friday evening.

“This confirms earlier documentation by Tom Pauken and Gary Hoitsma, both deeply involved in the Texas Reagan campaign of 1980,” Shirley wrote. He stated that his own interviews for the book Rendezvous With Destiny, none of his sources linked Rove to Reagan’s campaign.

In the course of interviewing President Carter, Vice President Mondale, John Anderson, Jim Baker, Jody Powell, President George H.W. Bush, Tom Brokaw, Lou Cannon, Dave Keene, Vic Gold, Frank Donatelli, Roger Stone, Ed Rollins and over 150 people all told including Ernie Angelo and Rick Shelby, Mr. Rove’s name never came up except sparingly in relation to the Bush 1980 campaign. But never the Reagan campaign.

Shirley says that he never found Rove’s name in his personal search of the Reagan Library’s files on the 1980 campaign. He claims that of the 200 books used in the bibliography for Rendezvous, “Mr. Rove’s name never came up in connection to the Reagan campaign of 1980 in any of these publications.”

“Just to be sure,” he continued, “we ran a search today of Texas newspapers from March to November of 1980 and Mr. Rove’s name never appeared. Period.”

Earlier this month, Rove’s announcement that he had established a new SuperPAC, the Conservative Victory Project, drew the ire of Tea Party activists, who saw this new organization as yet another attempt to force moderate candidates through the Republican primary process."

By Jennifer Ablan

NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - George Soros, the 83-year-old billionaire investor, philanthropist and active supporter of liberal political causes, married health care and education consultant Tamiko Bolton on Saturday afternoon.

Soros and Bolton, 42, exchanged vows in a small ceremony at his Bedford, New York, estate, which Soros bought in 2003 from ""Jurassic Park"" author Michael Crichton. Federal judge Kimba Wood officiated at the non-denominational wedding, which was attended by members of the couple's families, including the groom's five children, a source familiar with the wedding told Reuters on Saturday.

For Soros, whose net worth is $20 billion according to Forbes, this will be his third marriage. It is Bolton's second.

Soros put a Graff wedding band on Bolton's finger during the half-hour ceremony, according to the source.

The exchange of vows will be followed by a reception, which begins at 4:30 p.m, with more than 500 guests at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, the Westchester County complex known for its Italian Renaissance-inspired buildings and lush gardens.

Among the guests at the various events are World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and some foreign leaders, including Hendrik Toomas Ilves, president of Estonia; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia; and Edi Rama, prime minister of Albania.

Also expected to attend are fellow titans of the hedge fund world, Paul Tudor Jones and Julian Robertson. From the U.S. political realm those invited include Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, both Democrats.

On Friday night, the couple held a reception for 300 guests at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan for a preview of the new exhibition of works by Belgian painter Rene Magritte - ""Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938.""

The honeymoon plans were not immediately disclosed.

Soros, who established one of the first hedge funds in 1969 and is probably best known for famously betting against the British pound in 1992, met Bolton at a dinner party in 2008. Their engagement was announced in August 2012.

Bolton, who was raised in California, is the daughter of a nurse and a retired naval officer. She graduated from the University of Utah and holds an MBA from the University of Miami.

Bolton has been a consultant and entrepreneur working in the fields of health and education. She started an Internet-based dietary supplement and vitamin sales company, and her most recent project was advising on development of a web-based yoga education platform.

The bride's dress was designed by U.S.-based, Lebanon-born Reem Acra, whose gowns have been worn on the red carpet by many stars, including Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Lopez.

The reception on Saturday night will feature Hungarian composer and conductor Iván Fischer, a family friend, who created a new arrangement for the occasion. It will be presented with the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Also, Cape Verdean Mayra Andrade will sing with the Harris Lane Orchestra. Andrade and Roma ensemble Via Romen will perform at a Sunday brunch.

In lieu of gifts, the couple has asked that donations be made to charities including Global Witness, Harlem Children's Zone, National Dance Institute, Planned Parenthood and the Roma Education Fund."

Here in the Dutch Reformed country of West Michigan, long a bastion of mainstream, mannerly conservatism, voters in 2010 handed the House seat once held by Gerald R. Ford to Justin Amash, a 33-year-old revolutionary and heir to the libertarian mantle of former congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.). Amash was part of an attempted coup against House Speaker John A. Boehner (R- Ohio) and is a leader of the House tea party faction that helped force a government shutdown last week.

But within Grand Rapids’ powerful business establishment, patience is running low with Amash’s ideological agenda and tactics. Some business leaders are recruiting a Republican primary challenger who they hope will serve the old-fashioned way — by working the inside game and playing nice to gain influence and solve problems for the district. They are tired of tea party governance, as exemplified by the budget fight that led to the shutdown and threatens a first-ever U.S. credit default.

Similar efforts are underway in at least three other districts — one in the moneyed Detroit suburbs and the others in North Carolina and Tennessee — where business leaders are backing primary campaigns against Republican congressmen who have alienated party leaders. The races mark a notable shift in a party in which most primary challenges in recent years have come from the right.

“It’s a new dynamic, and we don’t know how far it’s going to go,” said Vin Weber, a former GOP congressman who is close to the House leadership. “All the energy in the Republican Party the last few years has come from the tea party. The notion that there might be some energy from the radical center, the people whose positions in the conservative mainstream are more center-right but who are just furious about the dysfunctionality of government — that’s different.”

But any move to take out a tea-party-aligned congressman in a Republican primary would be challenging, especially here in Michigan’s 3rd District, where grass-roots conservatives hold considerable sway. In the 2012 presidential primary, former senator Rick Santorum beat the eventual Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, in this culturally conservative district, even though Romney carried the state.

Some prominent business leaders are lining up behind investment manager Brian Ellis, according to several GOP operatives here. Ellis declined to grant an interview but wrote in an e-mail: “I am taking a hard look at running in the Republican primary” and “will make up my mind in the near future.”

State Sen. Mark C. Jansen, seen as a pragmatic Republican, also is weighing a challenge to Amash, said Deb Drick, his chief of staff. “We get frequent calls from people encouraging Senator Jansen to run,” Drick said. “There’s got to be a reason he’s being approached so much.”

Meg Goebel, president of the Paul Goebel Group, an insurance agency, said she is “really, really unhappy” with the leading role Amash has played in tying the health-care law to overall government funding.

“I don’t see him as a collaborator, and I think that’s a huge problem,” Goebel, a former chair of the Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce, said. “People used to say, ‘I don’t like the Congress, but I like my congressman.’ I don’t think that’s the case anymore.”

There are similar sentiments 140 miles east in the tony Detroit suburbs of Oakland County, where businessman David Trott is waging a well-funded primary campaign to defeat Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R), a former high school teacher and reindeer rancher now dubbed by fellow Republicans the “accidental congressman.”

After longtime Rep. Thaddeus McCotter’s reelection bid collapsed in 2012, Bentivolio was the only Republican on the ballot — and, in the GOP-leaning 11th District, he won.

Although Bentivolio aligns with tea party conservatives, he has not been as much of a thorn in the side of House leadership as Amash has; Boehner hosted a fundraiser for Bentivolio in the summer. But Bentivolio is struggling to prepare for reelection and has just $42,000 in cash on hand, according to campaign finance records. His spokesman did not respond to several requests for comment.

Trott, a longtime party donor and fixture, announced last week that he had raised $425,000 in the 26 days since launching his campaign. But Trott’s campaign is sensitive to any suggestion that he represents the establishment taking on the tea party. “This is not some establishment creation,” said Stu Sandler, Trott’s general consultant.

In Tennessee, tea-party-aligned Rep. Scott DesJarlais faces a GOP primary challenge from state Sen. Jim Tracy, who has won over donors and other supporters who abandoned DesJarlais after a series of personal scandals. In DesJarlais’s divorce records, released too late in the 2012 campaign to impact the result, the congressman revealed that he had multiple affairs with co-workers and patients while he was chief of staff at a hospital and that he counseled a mistress and his wife to get abortions.

In coastal North Carolina, Taylor Griffin, a former aide to George W. Bush who has backing from the Washington establishment, launched a primary challenge last week against Rep. Walter B. Jones, an outspoken iconoclast who has repeatedly antagonized Boehner.

Former Ohio congressman Steven C. LaTourette, who runs the Main Street Partnership, a group that helps promote moderate Republicans, said there is no coordinated effort to mount primary challenges to tea party allies.

“It’s people popping up organically in these districts,” LaTourette said. “The traditional governing wing of the Republican Party is fed up with this dysfunction, this ‘no’ to everything, this refusal to engage the other side to find solutions.”

Here in Amash’s Grand Rapids district, several well-known executives who are said to have promised their support to Ellis did not respond to requests for interviews. But Katie Packer Gage, a former senior aide to Romney and a Michigan GOP operative, said, “The business community in Grand Rapids has been completely disenchanted with Amash.”

LaTourette said some Wall Street donors called him after reading reports of a possible primary challenge to Amash and said they were “ready to go.” LaTourette noted that, before Amash, the district was represented by moderate Republican Vernon J. Ehlers, a former nuclear physicist. “It’s not bad ground for the center-right of the party, the governing wing of the party, to stake out its claim,” he said.

But the business establishment here is hardly united against Amash. One of the biggest names in this city, Douglas L. DeVos, president of Amway and son of the multinational corporation’s founder, is actively supporting the congressman’s reelection.

DeVos recently wrote a letter to Michigan business leaders urging them to give the maximum $5,200 to Amash right away. The donations, DeVos wrote, would help Amash avoid an “unnecessary and expensive challenge.” In the most recent filing, Amash had just $164,000 in his campaign account.

“I know all the power brokers here in town, and some people might consider me one,” said Dave Mehney, an Amash supporter and chief executive of Skytron, a medical equipment manufacturer. “They can put all the money they want into it and find somebody to run, but they won’t beat Justin because he’s got the grass roots.”

In 2012, Amash faced no primary opponent and won the general election 53 percent to 44 percent. His spokesman, Will Adams, said that Amash is regarded as “a principled conservative who gets things done” and that his high-profile stance this summer against the National Security Administration’s surveillance programs has been especially popular.

“We’re not worried,” Adams said.

Amash declined an interview request. “Because I do not fit neatly in the Republican box, some establishment Republicans and pundits think I am extreme,” Amash told Washington Post columnist George Will this year. But, he added, “I am moderate,” because “the point of the Constitution is to moderate the government.”

DeVos, who is neighbors with Amash’s parents and has known the congressman since his childhood, said in an interview that he is “developing very strongly.”

“You’ve always got to stand on principles,” DeVos said. “Without that, how can you ever negotiate or talk to people about anything?”"

On Wednesday, the Court heard arguments in Town of Greece v. Galloway, which Breitbart News explained in detail yesterday. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does not allow government to establish a national religion, and the plaintiffs in this case argued that allowing opening prayers does just that.

As Breitbart News explained in our previous report, the Supreme Court upheld this practice–called legislative prayer–in the 1983 case Marsh v. Chambers. Today, the plaintiffs sought to have the Court say that Marsh only permits prayers that have no faith-specific content (such as mentioning the name of Jesus Christ), or that only Congress and state legislatures are permitted to have such prayers, not local government.

The plaintiffs here evidently knew they did not have five votes on the Court to overrule Marsh, so they sought instead for the Court to rule that all governmental bodies need to adopt a policy forbidding prayer-givers from making faith-specific references.

Justice Antonin Scalia spent considerable time discussing the problem with that argument that there are no statements with which all people agree because some are atheists. Justice Samuel Alito proved this point even among those who believe something, by challenging the plaintiffs’ lawyers to specify some prayer with which followers of every religion would agree. Their lawyer could not find one.

The critical swing vote in this case is Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has previously spoken favorably of public prayers but was the decisive vote in 1992 in declaring prayers unconstitutional at public school graduation ceremonies when children are likely present.

Justice Kennedy possibly tipped his hand today when he said the plaintiffs’ proposed rule “involves the state very heavily in the editing and censorship of prayer.” As a rule of thumb, when Justice Kennedy says that your proposal involves “censorship,” that means you lost.

Breitbart News will publish a full report on the argument later today.

The financial impact of allowing potentially millions of immigrants onto state and local public assistance could overwhelm these programs’ budgets.

Senate Budget Committee ranking member Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) uncovered this loophole in the bill and many others, and he will circulate a memo detailing the gaps in the bill on Tuesday. Breitbart News exclusively obtained a copy of the memo before its public release.

“The Gang of Eight made a promise that illegal immigrants will not be able to access public benefits,” Sessions said in a statement to Breitbart News. “We already know that, once granted green cards and ultimately citizenship, illegal immigrants will be able to access all public benefit programs at a great cost to taxpayers. We have, however, identified a number of loopholes that would allow illegal immigrants to draw public benefits even sooner than advertised.”

If the bill were signed into law, America’s 11 million illegal immigrants would be legalized within six months, when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano submits her border security plan to Congress. Illegal immigrants would immediately be eligible for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, making them legal to live and work in the country.

As Sessions’ staff points out in the memo, “state laws frequently extend benefits to anyone ‘lawfully present’ in the U.S.” The Sessions team points to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) brief that details how the only requirement many state and local governments have with regard to immigrant access to public benefits is that they are “lawfully present.” The term “lawfully present” is a legal definition.

According to page 91 of the bill, all illegal immigrants granted legalized RPI status would legally be considered “lawfully present.” That section reads as follows: ”(4) TREATMENT OF REGISTERED PROVISIONAL IMMIGRANTS.–A noncitizen granted registered provisional immigrant status under this section shall be considered lawfully present in the United States for all purposes while such noncitizen remains in such status, except that the noncitizen– ”(A) is not entitled to the premium assistance tax credit authorized under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; ”(B) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in subsection (e) of such section; and ”(C) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in section 1402(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18071).”

In evaluating whether an illegal immigrant qualifies for RPI status, Sessions’ staff points out, the legislation “explicitly forbids” the Department of Homeland Security from using current law, which blocks entry to those who could become “public charges,” i.e. dependent on government welfare programs.

“Therefore, when those here illegally who are unable to support themselves are legalized, much of the immediate fiscal burden will fall on state and local governments,” Sessions’ staff wrote in the memo.

In addition to that loophole, Sessions and his staff found several more loopholes that allow current illegal immigrants access to public benefits even on the federal level before the promised wait time of 13 years from the bill’s passage.

In the memo, Sessions’ staff notes that current illegal immigrants who are “granted RPI status will immediately become eligible for federal benefits through citizen and permanent resident dependents, with no requirement that they support their household as a condition of receiving or maintaining legal status.” That means any current illegal immigrant who subsequently has dependent children, who are, by right of birth, U.S. citizens would qualify for federal welfare benefits through them."

Pat Quinn, who mentioned Pendleton during his annual State of the State speech on Wednesday as he called for tougher gun control measures. Quinn said he spoke to the teen's family this week.



""There are no words in the English language, or any language, to relieve the pain of parents who lose a child,"" said Quinn, who has two adult sons.



A White House source said senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Education Secretary Arne Duncan also will attend the funeral. Both are Chicagoans.



Community activists had urged the Obamas to come to Chicago to speak out about recent violence. A petition on the White House website had called on the Obamas to attend Pendleton's funeral.



The president reached out to the family last week to offer his condolences, according to people close to the family. Early on, the family had expressed concern that the president's attendance would overshadow the funeral and make it difficult for Pendleton's many friends to say their goodbyes to her.



After learning today that the first lady planned to attend, Shatira Wilks, a cousin who serves as the family's spokesperson, said they are still committed to making the funeral a celebration of the teen's life.



""It's a nice gesture and we appreciate it,"" Wilks said. ""But that is who we are.""



Those close to the family said the parents are still trying to come to grips with what has happened.



""It's a lot to take in. It's an overwhelming experience,"" said LaKeisha Stewart, Hadiya's godmother. ""We are very thankful the people are coming to support the family. We realize that this young lady has touched a lot of people and this goes beyond us.""



Pendleton was killed at Harsh Park on Jan. 29, near the end of the deadliest January for Chicago homicides in a decade. There is a $40,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest in the teen's death."

THE PRESIDENT: This is a season for millions of Americans to be together with family, to continue long-held holiday traditions, and to show our gratitude to those we love. And along the way, some of us might even watch a little basketball or eat some Christmas cookies, too.

THE FIRST LADY: Here at the White House, over the past few weeks, we’ve had about 70,000 people from all across the country come visit us and look at our holiday decorations.

This year’s theme was “Gather Around: Stories of the Season.”

And in every room of the house, we tried to tell a story about who we are as Americans and how we celebrate the holidays together.

And we made certain to highlight some of the most powerful stories we know – the stories of our outstanding troops, veterans, and military families and their service and sacrifice for our country.

THE PRESIDENT: Our extraordinary men and women in uniform are serving so that the rest of us can enjoy the blessings we cherish during the holidays. But that means many of our troops are far from home and far from family. They’re spending some extra time on the phone with their loved ones back home. Or they’re setting up video chats so they can watch as the presents are opened. So today, we want all of our troops to know that you’re in our thoughts and prayers this holiday season.

And here’s the good news: For many of our troops and newest veterans, this might be the first time in years that they’ve been with their families on Christmas. In fact, with the Iraq war over and the transition in Afghanistan, fewer of our men and women in uniform are deployed in harm’s way than at any time in the last decade.

THE FIRST LADY: And that’s something we all can be thankful for.

And with more and more of our troops back here at home, now it’s our turn to serve – it’s our turn to step up and show our gratitude for the military families who have given us so much.

And that’s why Jill Biden and I started our Joining Forces initiative – to rally all Americans to support our military families in ways large and small.

And again and again, we have been overwhelmed by the response we’ve gotten as folks from across the country have found new ways to give back to these families through their schools, businesses, and houses of worship.

THE PRESIDENT: That’s the same spirit of giving that connects all of us during the holidays. So many people all across the country are helping out at soup kitchens, buying gifts for children in need, or organizing food or clothing drives for their neighbors. For families like ours, that service is a chance to celebrate the birth of Christ and live out what He taught us – to love our neighbors as we would ourselves; to feed the hungry and look after the sick; to be our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper. And for all of us as Americans, regardless of our faith, those are values that can drive us to be better parents and friends, better neighbors and better citizens.

THE FIRST LADY: So as we look to the New Year, let’s pledge ourselves to living out those values by reaching out and lifting up those in our communities who could use a hand up.

THE PRESIDENT: So Merry Christmas, everyone. And from the two of us, as well as Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo…

THE FIRST LADY: And Sunny, the newest Obama.

THE PRESIDENT: We wish you all a blessed and safe holiday season.

THE FIRST LADY: Happy holidays everybody, and God bless."

""The Prince has arrived in this strange city, whose streets of ill-built houses connect to the most noble public buildings, and where one has to admire the city as a city always in the future tense,"" the London Times correspondent wrote of Washington. ""It will and must in history be one of the greatest capitals the world has seen, but as yet it seems to want a deal of building, alterations, and improvements, before it can be a worthy legislative center of this great empire.""

If anything, the reporter was too sanguine in his description. The city that awaited Lincoln that fall remained a far cry from the populous, gleaming capital that it would become after -- and largely because of -- the Civil War. It was, as author Margaret Leech wrote in her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ""Reveille in Washington, 1860-1865,"" ""a mere ambitious beginner, a baby among capitals.""

""Built to order at the dawn of the century, it gave after sixty years the impression of having been just begun,"" she wrote. ""Washington was merely a place for the government. It was an idea set in a wilderness.""

That wilderness was a dirty and disagreeable swamp of a place, where pigs and cattle roamed freely, where alleys reeked with the stench of raw sewage, where dysentery and diarrhea inflicted their annual toll, where saloons and brothels and gambling parlors easily outnumbered restaurants and theaters. The unpaved streets stayed muddy in the winter and dusty in the summer, always marked with ruts from wagons and carriages and always littered with the manure of the horses that pulled them.

The Capitol dome was three years from completion, and herds of cattle grazed at the stump of the Washington Monument, which sat less than a third finished. The handful of grandiose structures, among them the White House, the Treasury Building and the Smithsonian Institution, sat amid vast open spaces largely unpopulated and uncultivated.

There were islands of social life, such as dinner parties in the dignified mansions of Georgetown and grand cotillions on Capitol Hill and by the Navy Yard. At Willard's Hotel at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, society women and boisterous men mingled in the smoke-filled bar, and much of the business of government took place in hushed conversations. But mostly, Washington remained a backwater. Diplomats from Europe considered it a hardship post.

""It was a Southern town, without the picturesqueness, but with the indolence, the disorder and the want of sanitation,"" Leech wrote. ""Its lounging Negroes startled Northern visitors with the reminder that slaves were held in the capital. Hucksters abounded. Fish and oyster peddlers cried their wares and tooted their horns on the corners. Flocks of geese waddled on [Pennsylvania] Avenue, and hogs, of every size and color, roamed at large, making their muddy wallows on Capitol Hill and in Judiciary Square. People emptied slops and refuse in the gutters.""

The 1860 Census counted 75,080 souls in the District of Columbia, including 61,000 in the city proper, 8,700 in the separate village of Georgetown and the remainder in the rural areas of the district, which began just north of Florida Avenue. Nearly a quarter of Washington's residents came from Virginia or Maryland, and even the city's natives often had strong ties to families from the surrounding Southern countryside. Most of the city's 12,484 immigrants came from Ireland and Great Britain, although a few had ventured from as far as Australia, Russia and Turkey. The vast majority of residents were white, though more than 3,000 slaves and more than 11,000 ""free colored"" people called Washington home.

""Poverty, squalor, prejudice, and violence"" existed in abundance, author Constance McLaughlin Green wrote in her exhaustive history, ""Washington: Village and Capital, 1800-1878."" ""Class distinctions were clear-cut, but a family's place in the social structure of the city rested less upon money than upon accomplishments and manners . . . Whatever the community's vices, pretentiousness was not one.""

The fledgling city consisted of bakers and blacksmiths, fishermen and farmers, carpenters and government clerks. There were three veterinarians, six undertakers, 17 milkmen, 67 innkeepers, 148 doctors, 180 lawyers and 242 tailors. Smith's on Seventh Street sold the season's latest hats and caps. Charles Shafer worked in his watch shop, not far from the Washington Carriage Factory, which was on D Street between Ninth and 10th. Benter's Restaurant on C Street advertised its fish and oysters, as well as its wine, liquor and cigars. The studio in which Mathew Brady would photograph the most famous faces of the Civil War was already up and running in a building on Pennsylvania Avenue, halfway between the White House and the Capitol.

But despite the growing bustle, it remained ""a pretty sleepy place,"" said Ernest B. Furgurson, a former Baltimore Sun correspondent and author of 2004's ""Freedom Rising: Washington in the Civil War."" ""It really was not as cosmopolitan as a lot of other cities in the country. It was still very much a place under development."""

Today, the jury was hearing testimony as to whether Spooner was sane at the time of the shooting.



Spooner mostly spoke in a calm voice but sounded anguished as he recounted how he confronted Darius and shot him in the chest. He recalled that someone had stolen four shotguns from his home two days earlier, and he was frustrated by a limited police response. Gimbel asked him what caused him to shoot the boy. ""I wanted my guns back,"" Spooner replied, squeezing his eyes shut and resting his head against his fingertips. ""I just wanted them back so bad.""

A Milwaukee man who killed his 13-year-old neighbor last year testified Thursday the shooting was ""justice"" because he thought the teen had broken into his home and stolen weapons... A prosecutor alleged that Spooner traded the boy's life for guns in a desire for revenge. ""I wouldn't call it revenge. I would call it justice,"" Spooner said defiantly, drawing audible gasps from the courtroom. Darius' mother, Patricia Larry, threw up her hands and muttered, ""Oh my god.""

Darius died a few moments later across the street, in his mother's arms.

Williams asked whether Spooner felt bad about taking Darius' life.

""Not that bad,"" he replied softly.

Why had Spooner, handgun aimed, shot Darius as he was backpedalling away from Spooner with his hands up?It doesn't get any worse than this.Or does it?-----

UPDATE: Spooner Found to Be Sane.

(CNN) – It seemed like White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was waiting for the question when he was asked Thursday about Jay-Z's newest rap, which focuses on his U.S. government-approved trip to Cuba with wife Beyonce last week.

In the rap, Jay-Z suggested their clearance came from the White House, when it actually came from the Treasury Department.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""I turned Havana into Atlanta… Boy from the 'hood, I got White House clearance. ..Obama said 'chill you gonna get me impeached.' (But) you don't need this – expletive – anyway. Chill with me on the beach,"" the lyrics stated.

In one of the most bizarre exchanges in the White House press briefing room, a reporter read the lyrics to Carney, asking about the White House approval. And Carney, without missing a beat, hit back.

""I guess nothing rhymes with Treasury,"" he said.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew was nominated by President Barack Obama earlier year and subsequently confirmed by the Senate.

(Actually, secretary kind of rhymes with treasury.)

Pressed further on whether the president had a conversation with Jay-Z, Carney shot down the speculation.

""I am absolutely saying that the White House and the president on down had nothing to do with anybody's personal, anybody's travel to Cuba,"" he said. ""That is something the Treasury handles.""

Due to the U.S. government's travel embargo with Cuba, Americans are prohibited from visiting the communist country for tourism. U.S. citizens can apply for licenses to go anyway, provided they show substantial proof they intend to visit for specific reasons, such as for business or education. And they must also provide a detailed itinerary.

After two members of Congress called for an investigation of the power couple's controversial trip and explanation of the type of travel license issued, the Treasury Department responded in a letter, giving more details about the licenses.

""It is our understanding that the travelers in question traveled to Cuba pursuant to an educational exchange trip organized by a group authorized by OFAC [the Office of Foreign Assets Control] to sponsor and organize programs to promote people-to-people contact in Cuba,"" the letter read.

Funeral directors say the mass shooting last month is unforgettable

Unfathomable work for funeral service workers

Looking for solace of their own%2C funeral directors hold a service

SOUTHBURY, Conn. (AP) — As she recalled the afternoon of Dec. 14, Nicole Paquette, past president of the Connecticut Funeral Directors Association, stopped to compose herself, but the tears kept running down her face.

""I will never forget reading the fax,"" Paquette said. ""We all knew young children were killed, but when we saw their names, then the comma, and then the numbers 6 or 7 after their names, for their age, we all broke down.""

Paquette and dozens of funeral directors who served or volunteered to help the families of 20 students and six educators killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown held a moving service Saturday during which they recalled the shooting and acknowledged how they all came together for the unfathomable work before them.

About 80 funeral directors from the more than 11 Connecticut homes that served the Newtown families and others who volunteered their services shed tears and hugged each other as they gathered in Southbury for a service of remembrance and reflection.

Before the service, 26 candles were lit while people filled the room.

John F. Cascio, executive director of the funeral directors association, began the service by reading the name of each of the victims.

""In our world a lit candle signifies remembrance,"" he said. ""Let this tiny light also represent our rebirth; we reach out to each other and look to the promise of the future. Today we gather, remember and reflect.""

For the association's president, Pasquale S. Folino, the images are unforgettable.

""For all of us that were involved with Newtown, the names and faces of those children are forever etched in our memories,"" he said.

""The town of Newtown was shaken to its foundation,"" Folino added. ""Life oftentimes is not what it's supposed to be, it is what it is. But what is important is how we react to it.""

Folino, the funeral director at Neilan Funeral Home in New London, acknowledged the 160 funeral directors across the state who answered the call, saying they did whatever they had to do for the families.

Specifically recognized was Dan Honan, of Honan Funeral Home in Newtown, the only funeral home in Newtown. Fellow funeral directors called his efforts heroic.

Honan, who spent all of his life in Newtown, had the unspeakable task of laying to rest 11 first-graders in five days.

""A funeral for a child is always the most difficult,"" he said. ""Newtown is changed forever, but we are forever closer as a community.""

Monsignor Robert ""Bob"" Weiss of St. Rose of Lima Church in Newtown, where eight of the children's funerals were held, had praise for the funeral directors.

""You are truly stewards of your profession,"" he said. ""The families found hope and great consolation in your compassion and attention you paid to every last detail. You were there for those families.""

Laura Soll, communications director for the Connecticut Funeral Directors Association, said the response from funeral directors around the country was incredible. The association represents 220 funeral homes in the state.

Soll said the group got together within hours of the shooting to figure out how to offset the pressure their colleagues were facing in the wake of the tragedy."

Will: What Obama and the tea party share,"Much is wrong with Washington these days, including much of what is said about what is wrong. Many Americans say there is “too much politics” in Washington. Actually, there is too little. Barack Obama deplores “politics as usual” here. But recently Washington has been tumultuous because politics, as the Framers understood it, has disintegrated. Obama has been complicit in this collapse.

His self-regard, the scale of which has a certain grandeur, reinforces progressivism’s celebration of untrammeled executive power and its consequent disparagement of legislative bargaining. This is why Obamacare passed without a single vote from the opposition party — and why it remains, as analyst Michael Barone says, the most divisive legislation since the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act.

Obama and his tea party adversaries have something important in common — disdain for the practice of politics within the Framers’ institutional architecture. He and they should read Jonathan Rauch’s “Rescuing Compromise” in the current issue of National Affairs quarterly.

“Politicians,” Rauch notes, “like other people, compromise because they have to, not because they want to.” So Madison created a constitutional regime that by its structure created competing power centers and deprived any of them of the power to impose its will on the others.

The Madisonian system, Rauch says, is both intricate and dynamic: “Absent a rare (and usually unsustainable) supermajority, there is simply not much that any single faction, interest, or branch of government can do. Effective action in this system is nothing but a series of forced compromises.”

Rep. Tom Cole, who represents southwest Oklahoma, has a PhD in British history and studied at the University of London, says some of his colleagues in the House of Representatives “think they are in the House of Commons.” That is, they have not accepted the fact that, in the Madisonian system, legislative and executive powers are separated.

By this separation, Rauch writes, Madison built “constant adjustment into the system.” His Constitution is a “dynamic political mechanism” under which no faction ever prevails with finality. This is because there is no finality:

“Forcing actors to bargain and collaborate slows precipitous change while constantly making negotiators adjust their positions. . . . The requirement to bargain and find allies provides new ideas and entrants with paths into politics and ways to shake up the status quo. But that same requirement prevents upheaval by ensuring that no one actor can seize control, at least not for long.”

Obama, who aspires to be Washington’s single actor, has said of his signature achievement: “I would have loved nothing better than to simply come up with some very elegant, academically approved approach to health care, and didn’t have any kinds of legislative fingerprints on it, and just go ahead and have that passed. But that’s not how it works in our democracy. Unfortunately, what we end up having to do is to do a lot of negotiations with a lot of different people.”

Obama wanted something simple rather than a product of Madisonian complexity. He wanted something elegantly unblemished by “any” messy legislative involvement, other than Congress’s tug of the forelock at final approval. It is, Obama thinks, unfortunate that he had to talk to many people.

He and some of his tea party adversaries share an impatience with Madisonian politics, which requires patience. The tea party’s reaffirmation of Madison’s limited-government project is valuable. Now, it must decide if it wants to practice politics.

Rauch hopes there will be “an intellectual effort to advance a principled, positive, patriotic case for compromise, especially on the right.” He warns that Republicans, by their obsessions with ideological purity and fiscal policy, “have veered in the direction of becoming a conservative interest group, when what the country needs is a conservative party .”

A party is concerned with power , understood as the ability to achieve intended effects. A bull in a china shop has consequences, but not power, because the bull cannot translate intelligent intentions into achievements. The tea party has a choice to make. It can patiently try to become the beating heart of a durable party, which understands this: In Madisonian politics, all progress is incremental. Or it can be a raging bull, and soon a mere memory, remembered only for having broken a lot of china. Conservatives who prefer politics over the futility of intransigence gestures in Madison’s compromise-forcing system will regret the promise the tea party forfeited, but will not regret that, after the forfeiture, it faded away.

(CNN) - It started with one, then two, and the next thing you know, it was a flash mob.

Students at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University surprised former President George H.W. Bush with a ""Bush-whack Boogie"" flash mob during Bush's first visit to the school since his recent hospitalization.

""We as students, we always try to find some sort of way to honor him to thank him for everything he's done for us,"" Carly Hilley, one of the student organizers of the ""Bushwhack Boogie,"" told Soledad O'Brien on Thursday on CNN's ""Starting Point.""

Hilley said they came up with the idea to do a flash mob as a tribute to the former president last fall and began practicing about a month and a half ago.

Bush was visiting the school that bears his name on March 1 when country duo Brooks & Dunn's song ""Boot Scootin' Boogie"" started playing. A young man yells, ""Yeehaaaww,"" and starts line dancing in front of Bush. Soon others join in.

The 88-year-old Bush sat on his red mobility scooter looking a bit bewildered at first, but soon the confused look turned into a smile. Barbara Bush pulled out her iPhone and started recording the dance.

""That's a flash mob, Grandpa,"" Jenna Bush Hager can be heard telling her grandfather at the end of the performance.

""Of all the flash mobs I have ever seen this was the best,"" NBC reported Bush saying to his granddaughter, a correspondent for the ""Today"" show.

Bush Hager says to him, ""The best?""

Bush says, ""Yes, the very best.""

Bush Hager asks, ""Was this the only one you've seen?""

It was also the only flash mob Bush had ever seen.

The Bushes enjoyed the tribute so much that they stayed an extra 30 minutes to shake hands with the students.

Bush was recently discharged from a hospital in Houston where he spent several weeks receiving treatment for bronchitis, a bacterial infection and a persistent cough.

While in the hospital, Bush cheered on the Texas A&M and the Houston Texans football teams to victories and enjoyed a special performance by the Oak Ridge Boys via telephone. His exchanges with doctors and nurses included singing, spokesman Jim McGrath said."

In January, after the election of Pat McCrory as governor, Republicans took control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since Reconstruction. Since then, state government has become a demolition derby, tearing down years of progress in public education, tax policy, racial equality in the courtroom and access to the ballot. The cruelest decision by lawmakers went into effect last week: ending federal unemployment benefits for 70,000 residents. Another 100,000 will lose their checks in a few months.

I also saw that Amy Goodman included the Moral Monday protests in yesterday's Democracy Now broadcast. As this movement is building in North Carolina, the national attention it is getting, and that it is bringing upon the actions of the Republican legislature and governor, is growing as well. This is, after all, not just a North Carolina story.

This is a part of the story that is unfolding in Texas, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, and other states where the more extreme elements of the Republican party have gained power on the state level and are exacting laws that, to use the words of the Times editorial board, are doing grotesque damage; and where the people are standing up and pushing back. This is a national story, and a national movement. We are bringing awareness to the people of this country to what happens when Republicans are given power at the state level; and we are encouraging them to think a bit more deeply, and to take action.

For more on these protests, see today's diary by Leslie Salzillo and yesterday's diary by MsSpentyouth.

Thank you New York Times and Amy Goodman for increasing national attention; and thanks to everyone who is supporting this movement, if North Carolina, in Texas, in every state where folks are standing up and pushing back.

Federal government to stop printing nautical charts","The federal government is going into uncharted waters, deep-sixing the giant paper nautical charts that it has been printing for mariners for more than 150 years.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Tuesday that the traditional brownish heavy paper charts won't be printed after mid-April.

Capt. Shep Smith, head of NOAA's marine chart division, said the agency will still chart the water for rocks, shipwrecks and dangers, but mariners will have to see the information using private on-demand printing, PDFs and electronic maps.

""Think of them as the roadmap of the ocean,"" said Smith, who grew up with charts of Penobscot Bay on his boyhood Maine bedroom walls. ""The navigational charts tell you what's under the water, which is critical for navigation.""

But now most people use the on-demand maps printed by private shops, which are more up-to-date and accurate, Smith said.

Still, NOAA sells about 60,000 of the old lithographic 4-by-3 foot maps each year, for about $20 apiece, the same price it costs to print them.

The trouble is that NOAA doesn't print them, but the Federal Aviation Administration does. And the FAA doesn't want to print them anymore, to save some money, Smith said. The FAA took over federal chart-making in 1999, and on Oct. 15 it told NOAA it was going to stop the presses, according to the ocean agency.

It costs NOAA about $100 million a year to survey and chart the nation's waters. It will still spend that much money, but provide the information in the less traditional way.

Sea dogs say they'll miss the charts, which also get used as decorations.

""It's the nautical history, you know pirates and ships,"" said Newburyport, Mass., harbormaster Paul Hogg, who has a chart on his office wall. ""It seems more nautical. There's just kind of, like, a feel to it."""

The suggestions seemed obvious to most but signaled a new tone for the Republican Party.

“Don’t use the term’anchor baby’ or phrases like ‘send them all back,’” said the memo from a Republican-aligned advocacy group, the Hispanic Leadership Network. “Do acknowledge that ‘our current immigration system is broken and we need to fix it.’”

Changing the way the party talks about immigration is about all House Republicans have to show for their efforts over the last 11 months — and even that effort has notable exceptions.

Though Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio has insisted recently that immigration reform is not dead, the House is about to finish the year without progress on a topic that is a priority to Latino voters, an electorate the GOP desperately needs to woo before the next presidential race.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

In fact, the House’s most visible immigration-related action was a measure to defund an Obama administration program to defer deportations of young immigrants, a vote that increased Latino animosity even though it failed to become law.

The legislative sputter stems from Republicans’ focus on the 2014 midterm election. As lawmakers burnish their conservative credentials for potential hard-right primary challenges, they are betting they will have time to court Latinos before the 2016 election.

But the inaction raises questions about whether Republicans have learned from their electoral losses last year and can broaden the party’s base to appeal to more minorities. And it’s not only immigration reform. GOP promises to be more inclusive to women and gays also have produced few results.

“It’s foolhardy,” said Alex Nowrasteh, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “On the one hand, Republicans have improved their rhetoric and they’ve moved much more toward embracing immigration reform. On the other hand, immigration reform was passed in the Senate and was dropped in the House of Representatives, and that makes them look like they’re opposed to reform, which in a way, they are.”

In last year’s presidential election, Mitt Romney — whose comment about “self-deportation” infuriated immigration advocates — lost the Latino vote by a 44-percentage-point margin, the largest deficit of any Republican presidential candidate since the Clinton era. Alarmed GOP insiders jump-started congressional talks toward a bipartisan immigration overhaul, and Boehner announced the time had come for Congress to act.

But the speaker has refused to take up the Senate’s sweeping bipartisan overhaul of immigration laws, even though it would probably pass the House with Democratic support; nor are House Republicans expected to vote on their own measures any time soon.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

Divisions within the House GOP have left the party at a standstill. More Republican lawmakers than ever — nearly two dozen, by some counts — support the cornerstone of an immigration overhaul, which is a path to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

But many more oppose legalization efforts. Most House Republicans represent conservative districts, configured to include few minority voters. The handful of exceptions, including several from California, have already come under pressure in their districts, but most have little interest in the subject.

“There’s just no cohesion there yet,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has tried to persuade Republicans to take action. “All I hope is that they realize that the issue is not going away — that we need to act on it — that we’d be glad to consider any proposals or ideas they have.”

Hedging the political risks, House GOP leaders continue working behind the scenes with lawmakers to draft a series of bills that could be brought forward next year.

Together, they would resemble the main ingredients of the comprehensive Senate bill.

One, from Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, would provide a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. Another would allow adult immigrants to apply for legal status as border security is ramped up.

President Obama has extended a hand to Boehner several times by saying he would be open to the House GOP’s piecemeal approach rather than the Senate’s big package.

“It’s Thanksgiving; we can carve that bird into multiple pieces,” Obama said during a speech in San Francisco on Monday. “A drumstick here, breast meat there. But as long as all the pieces get done — soon — and we actually deliver on the core values we’ve been talking about for so long, I think everybody is fine with it.”

PHOTOS: The debate over immigration reform

House Republicans, though, have resisted most White House initiatives. Many Republicans prefer to use the months ahead investigating what went wrong with the healthcare law. And some House members seem to have missed the memo on new talking points.

In March, after the memo was distributed on Capitol Hill, one of the House’s longest-serving Republican members, Don Young of Alaska, used a racial slur to describe the migrants who once worked on his family’s California farm.

Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who sponsored the legislation to allow deportation of young immigrants to resume, said some of them had “calves the size of cantaloupes” from hauling drugs across the border.

Longtime immigration advocate Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, warned that Republicans would face another election defeat if they failed to translate their new talking points into legislative action.

“Boehner, if he kills off immigration reform, will be remembered as the speaker who killed the GOP,” Sharry said.

His argument for redrawing the California map: The state is underrepresented in Washington. He’s looking to get an initiative on the California ballot.

He told TechCrunch: “It is about time California was properly represented with senators in Washington. Now our number of senators per person will be about average.”

California has a long history of secessionist fervor. Now Silicon Valley is coming up with its own version, fueled by growing anti-government sentiment.

In October at Y Combinator Startup School, one tech entrepreneur called for Silicon Valley to secede from the United States altogether.

Balaji Srinivasan, co-founder of San Francisco–based genetics company Counsyl, gave a talk to aspiring entrepreneurs about “Silicon Valley’s ultimate exit,” which outlined his vision of a tech world free of the constraints of government.

“We need to build opt-in society, outside the U.S., run by technology,” Srinivasan said.

This techno-utopian vision of a world insulated from big-government intrusion is not new to Silicon Valley, which has some deep libertarian roots.

Google CEO Larry Page, during his Google I/O keynote in May, spoke of his desire to set aside a place in the world where technological experimentation can be conducted unfettered by regulation. (“There are many exciting things you could do that are illegal or not allowed by regulation,” Page said.)

Investor Peter Thiel has championed the “seasteader” movement, which would create floating societies off the coast of California just beyond the clutches of the U.S. government.

And the Blueseed project wants to put foreign-born workers on a cruise ship off the coast of Northern California in international waters to evade immigration laws.

Draper recently said he would not participate in his investment firm’s next fund, so he has some time on his hands to devote to this new six-state project. He’s holding a news conference Monday.

Under his proposal, the northernmost new state would be called Jefferson and would encompass these counties: Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Plumas, Siskiyou, Shasta, Tehama and Trinity.

Just south of that, Northern California state would encompass these counties: Amador, El Dorado, Marin, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba.

The state called Central California would be the only one to have no coastline, and it would encompass Alpine, Calaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Mono, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tulare and Tuolumne counties.

Silicon Valley state would encompass these counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Monterey, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz.

The state named West California would encompass these counties: Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura.

And finally, South California state would encompass Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties.

What do you think of Draper’s plan for California? Let us know in the comments.

Bill Richardson said Sunday that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father was a Cuban immigrant, should not be ""defined as a Hispanic"" because of his stance on immigration legislation.

Richardson, a former Democratic presidential candidate who also is Hispanic, criticized the freshman Texas senator during the web portion of the ABC ""This Week"" program on Sunday.

Asked for his thoughts on Cruz, Richardson said, ""I'm not a fan.""

""I know he's sort of the Republican latest flavor. He's articulate. He seems to be charismatic, but I don't like his politics,"" Richardson said. He alleged that Cruz adds a ""measure of incivility in the political process,"" though he is a ""force"" in the GOP.

Richardson was then asked if Cruz represents most Hispanics with his political views. Richardson said, ""No, he's anti-immigration.""

""Almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform. No, I don't think he should be defined as a Hispanic,"" Richardson said. ""He's a politician from Texas, a conservative state. And I respect Texas' choice. But what I don't like is when you try to get things done -- it's okay to be strong and state your views, your ideology, but I've seen him demean the office, be rude to other senators, not be part of, I think, the civility that is really needed in Washington.""

Richardson later said that controversy surrounding his comments was a ""misunderstanding."" He told Fox News that he was ""misinterpreted"" and that he was trying to say Cruz should not be defined ""just"" as a Hispanic.

Cruz's father came to the United States from Cuba in the 1950s; his mother is of Irish-Italian ancestry.

Cruz's rising political star in the Republican Party has stoked talk of a possible 2016 presidential run.

In his four months in the Senate, the Texas senator has repeatedly made headlines -- with his tough questioning of Chuck Hagel during his confirmation hearing for Defense secretary, and with his participation in Sen. Rand Paul's 13-hour filibuster over drones.

He also has been critical of newly released immigration legislation, objecting to the bill's pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants already in the country."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/12/christie-defends-wife-against-sandy-relief-criticism/,2013-03-12 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Christie defends wife against Sandy relief criticism,"8 years ago

Washington (CNN) – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is defending his wife against criticism that the charity she helms is not distributing money fast enough to help victims still suffering after superstorm Sandy.

The governor's comments are raising eyebrows for what some see as an unfortunate irony: earlier this year Christie blasted Congress for not acting fast enough to provide relief funds for New Jersey's affected communities and businesses.



On Monday, the Republican governor addressed a weekend report in the Asbury Park Press that said out of millions of dollars raised by the Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund, not a penny has yet helped victims over four months after the storm tore through the Garden State. The governor's wife – Mary Pat Christie – chairs the nonprofit organization.

A spokesperson for the fund told CNN it has raised $32 million. When it does disburse its funds, the money will only go to non-profit relief groups and not to individuals. The spokesperson insisted $1 million has been disbursed already, but could not vouch for whether or not the money has actually helped victims.

The governor was asked about the report during a Monday press conference in North Brunswick. His office provided CNN a transcript of the governor's remarks.

""What I can tell you is I know in broad strokes they raised somewhere between $32 and $33 million, was the number I had, was given. I know that they've approved grants for over a million dollars,"" Christie said.

""Whether those grants have gone out the door yet, I don't know. It seemed the story over the weekend seemed to indicate they haven't gone out the door. But I know they've been approved because Mary Pat told me they were approved."" Christie added that he is ""really proud"" of his wife's helming the fund.

""I think she's been very clear and was very clear over the weekend that her concept of this fund from the beginning, which all the donors were told, was that this would be a long-haul organization, not one that would jump in and throw a lot of money at the problem early, but one that would be there for the next two years or so.""

Mary Pat Christie is not part of the fund's panel that awards grants. But as chair of the overall group, she defended its pace of financial disbursements in an interview with the Asbury Park Press.

The wife cited groups like the American Red Cross and Robin Hood that have provided immediate relief to those hit hard in New Jersey.

""They've been out there already executing their relief strategy,"" the wife said. ""And I think that, especially Robin Hood has been really wonderful at helping us bridge this gap.""

Mary Pat Christie cited another reason for the slow pace of disbursement from her group.

""Admittedly we're learning how to do this. But I also was willing to take our time and be careful because I knew the Red Cross was there,"" she said.

""Non profit money is out there,"" she added. ""I actually think that we're going to, you know, be distributing this money at a really opportune time because some of those organizations will have moved on.""

""We're going to be here until, you know, the state's recovered,"" the wife added.

She also cited challenges of starting a charity from the ground up and designing processes to ensure no money is wasted.

Yet some feel the hurricane relief fund needs to move faster.

Comments on the group's Facebook page vary in intensity.

""Release the money…we are desperate down here for food and shelter for many!!!"" wrote a poster named Cyndi Laughlin.

Frank Riehl, another frustrated poster, wrote: ""Really more than half of the town of Ocean Gate was destroyed during the storm. You raised millions of dollar in relief aid for victims of the storm. But some one in one of the most heavily damaged town is not eligible for aid. Okay so what you are saying is that you have Millions of Dollars and you are NOT handing it out? Since you are NOT handing it out. What are you doing with it?""

The fund's pace of distribution is also receiving scrutiny in light of the governor previous blasting of Congress for not providing aid to affected residents fast enough.

In January, just over two months after Sandy, a frustrated Christie criticized House Speaker John Boehner and Congress for not allowing a vote on Sandy Relief. The governor also alleged a double standard: saying that much faster relief had been given to victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Andrew.

Shortly after, Congress passed a $50 billion aid package for Northeastern states hit hard by the storm.

With $1 million disbursed so far, the Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund moves next to doling out $5 million in grants to non-profit relief groups. The fund hopes to get out that money by the end of March, the group's spokesperson said."

Sen. Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles), wrapping up a Wednesday meeting with Gov. Jerry Brown, mentioned his disappointment that the measure was stalled. He thought the governor was wary of it, because the bill’s author, Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville), planned to shelve it.

Brown seemed surprised.

“Send me the bill,” the senator recalled the governor saying. “I’ll sign it.”

Later that day, De León huddled with a fellow champion of immigrant rights, Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens). Immigrant advocates and their allies in the Legislature had spent more than a decade pushing this issue, and they didn’t want to miss an opportunity while they had a governor on their side.

So, Lara, said, “we did a little covert operation.”

In an unusual gambit, the senators quietly decided to move the driver’s license bill forward — with or without Alejo. The strategy worked, and the measure cleared the Legislature late Thursday

The wrangling over the bill provided a glimpse of the fast-moving and unpredictable gamesmanship that characterizes the closing days and hours of the legislative session.

Lawmakers passed scores of bills in recent days, approving measures to raise the minimum wage, require overtime pay for domestic workers and tighten restrictions on assault rifles. They even found time to name a span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge after one of their own, the colorful and controversial Willie Brown, a former Assembly leader.

But little this year sparked as much drama as the driver’s license bill. Lara called it “a political soap opera.”

Advertisement

Part of the issue was concern from labor groups, who worried the measure wasn’t strong enough. In particular, they were hesitant that licenses issued to immigrants in the country illegally would be marked differently — the prefix before the license number would say “DP” instead of “DL.”

Brown insisted the change was required by federal law, even securing written guidance from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to make his case.

“There was such disagreement with stakeholders about what’s the right language, what’s the best way to make sure this license is in compliance with federal law, that’s where I was willing to hold off,” Alejo said in an interview on Friday.

But the senators, buoyed by De León’s conversation with the governor, moved forward anyway.

Advertisement

“The people can’t wait for lawyers and activists to debate the esoteric, abstract virtues of a pure license,” De León said in an interview. “People in my community want and need driver licenses now, not tomorrow.”

Alejo, who said Wednesday that he would table the bill, said he didn’t know the senators planned to revive the it a vote.

“That surprised a lot of people,” Alejo said. “It surprised me.”

The Senate passed the measure 28-8, with two Republicans voting in favor. Former Sen. Gil Cedillo, who pushed the issue over and over while he served in the Legislature, helped rally support for the measure from a distance even as he mourned the death of his father earlier in the week.

Alejo changed course and agreed to present the bill, AB 60, in the Assembly, where it passed 55-21 at about 9:30 Thursday night, winning the support of two Republicans in that house.

De León, Lara and Alejo posed for celebratory photos and posted them on Twitter.

During his 2010 campaign for governor, Brown opposed driver’s licenses for Californians in the country illegally, for governor, saying he hoped the federal government would enact comprehensive changes to the country’s immigration system. But he told reporters Friday that he had changed his mind after watching “foot dragging” in Congress.

“I think they need a good push, and that’s what I think this driver’s license bill does,” the governor said. “It says California recognizes these human beings are very important to our communities, to our economy — and hopefully the people in Washington will get the message.”

Brown signed a bill last year granting licenses to young undocumented immigrants who qualify for President Obama’s temporary work-permit program.

The Legislature completed work on several other bills in the waning hours of the session Thursday night:

Advertisement

— They voted to loosen some environmental regulations. SB 743 by Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) would make it easier to develop mixed-use and commercial projects in areas accessible by mass transit. The bill is expected to help the construction of a new arena for the Sacramento Kings basketball team.

— AB 128, by Assemblyman Steven Bradford (D-Gardena), would increase the authority of officers at the Los Angeles World Airports, allowing them to remove unsafe vehicles from the street and seize explosive and incendiary devices. The measure is in route to the governor’s desk.

Advertisement

— Lawmakers approved AB 1186, by Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla (D-Concord), which would require that the state develop safety measures for young people who compete in pankration, a limited version of mixed martial arts.

— Amid all the other business, the Legislature named part of the Bay Bridge after Willie Brown. Sen. Alex Padilla (D- Pacoima) joked that he could tell his colleagues stories about Brown ruthlessly wielding power in the Capitol, but they were “not appropriate” to repeat on the Senate floor. The bill does not require the signature of the governor, who objected to it.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-exhorts-good-deeds-morehouse-graduates-160712553.html,,[],Obama exhorts good deeds by Morehouse graduates,"ATLANTA (AP) — President Barack Obama, in a soaring commencement address on work, sacrifice and opportunity, on Sunday told graduates of historically black Morehouse College to seize the power of their example as black men graduating from college and use it to improve people's lives.

The president said his success was due to ""the special obligation I felt, as a black man like you, to help those who need it most, people who didn't have the opportunities that I had — because there but for the grace of God, go I. I might have been in their shoes. I might have been in prison. I might have been unemployed. I might not have been able to support a family. And that motivates me.""

Noting the Atlanta school's mission to cultivate, not just educate, good men, Obama said graduates should not be so eager to join the chase for wealth and material things, but instead should remember where they came from and not ""take your degree and get a fancy job and nice house and nice car and never look back.""

""So yes, go get that law degree. But if you do, ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and powerful, or if you can also find time to defend the powerless,"" Obama said. ""Sure, go get your MBA, or start that business, we need black businesses out there. But ask yourself what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood.""

""The most successful CEOs I know didn't start out intent on making money. Rather, they had a vision of how their product or service would change things, and the money followed,"" he said.

For those headed to medical school, Obama said, ""Make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too.""

Before Obama arrived in Atlanta, thunderstorms drenched hundreds of people who gathered on the campus lawn for the outdoor ceremony, forcing many guests to wear clear plastic ponchos over what amounted to their Sunday-best clothes. Rain began falling again, accompanied by more thunder and lightning, minutes after Obama began to speak.

Story continues

""I also have to say you all are going to get wet,"" he said. ""I would be out there with you if I could. But Secret Service gets nervous, so I'm going to have to stay here, dry. But know that I'm with you in spirit.""

Obama urged graduates to ""inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves.""

Obama used the speech to once again share his personal story of growing up without a father, confessing that along the way he made unspecified bad personal choices ""like too many men in our community.""

""Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down,"" he said. ""I had a tendency to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is, there's no longer any room for excuses.""

Speaking in personal terms as he often does when addressing predominantly black audiences, particularly of black males, the nation's first black president also spoke intimately of his desire to be a better father to daughters Malia and Sasha than his absent father was to him, and to be a better husband to his wife, Michelle.

He told the graduates to pay attention to their families, saying success in every other aspect of life means nothing without success at home.

""I was raised by a heroic single mother and wonderful grandparents who made incredible sacrifices for me. And I know there are moms and grandparents here today who did the same thing for all of you,"" he said. ""But I still wish I had a father who was not only present, but involved. And so my whole life, I've tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my father wasn't for my mother and me. I've tried to be a better husband, a better father, and a better man.

""It's hard work that demands your constant attention, and frequent sacrifice. And Michelle will be the first to tell you that I'm not perfect,"" he continued. ""Even now, I'm still learning how to be the best husband and father I can be. Because success in everything else is unfulfilling if we fail at family.

""I know that when I'm on my deathbed someday, I won't be thinking about any particular legislation I passed, or policy I promoted. I won't be thinking about the speech I gave, or the Nobel Prize I received,"" said Obama, 51. ""I'll be thinking about a walk I took with my daughters, a lazy afternoon with my wife, whether I did right by all of them.""

The speech was Obama's second commencement address of the season, following remarks last Sunday at Ohio State University in Columbus. His third and final graduation address will come Friday at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.

About 500 students received undergraduate degrees on Sunday and became ""Morehouse Men.""

After the speech, Obama joined about 100 people at a fundraiser at the office of the foundation of Arthur M. Blank, co-founder of Home Depot and owner of the Atlanta Falcons. It was the first of six money events that officials say he will headline for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is recruiting candidates and strategizing to keep control of the Senate in next year's midterm elections. Democrats will be defending more Senate seats than Republicans, including six held by long-serving Democratic senators who have decided not to seek re-election.

After briefly discussing the economy, early childhood education, energy independence, climate change and infrastructure, Obama said ""the good news is we've got good, common-sense solutions that we can implement right now,"" on those issues. ""The bad news is there's a shortage of common sense in Washington.""

He told the donors, who paid anywhere from $10,000 per couple to $32,400 per couple to attend the fundraiser, that their support is important because it will help elect more non-ideological senators like Michael Bennet, D-Colo., ""who don't come at this thinking there's just one way of doing things."" Bennet chairs the campaign arm for Senate Democrats and introduced Obama at the event.

""That kind of approach, if we get a critical mass in the Senate, and we can potentially get a critical mass of folks like that in the House, means that the sky's the limit,"" Obama said. ""Nothing can stop us.""

http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/28/us/arizona-firefighters-report/index.html,2013-09-28 00:00:00,['Leslie Holland'],Report details what led to loss of 19 firefighters,"Nineteen firefighters, part of an elite group called the Hotshots, died while battling a wildfire about 85 miles northwest of Phoenix on Sunday, June 30. Here are the 19 victims: Andrew Ashcraft, 29.

Story highlights NEW: Granite Mountain Hotshot team fully qualified, staffed and trained, report says NEW: Radio communications were challenging Not since 9/11 had the nation lost so many firefighters in one day. Arizona State Forestry Division commissioned the interagency report.

(CNN) —

Though an in-depth report released Saturday assigned no blame in the death of 19 elite Arizona firefighters, it did raise some key issues about the day the men died.

The firefighters, known as the Granite Mountain Hotshots, died on June 30 fighting wildfires in Arizona. The fire was started by a lightning strike, rapidly spread from one-half acre to several hundred and destroyed more than 100 structures. It took the lives of the 19 hotshots before it was contained.

The interagency report, commissioned by the state, detailed what went wrong in the Yarnell Hill Fire and made recommendations to improve the future safety and efficiency of fire crews, both in Arizona and nationwide.

Who were the firefighters?

The report found the crew was fully qualified, staffed and trained.

But it said fire personnel dealt with radio communications issues throughout that day.

The report also detailed that during a critical part of the day, there was a 30-minute communication gap between the hotshot team and the command center. The communications issues throughout the day resulted in confusion about the hotshot crew’s intentions, movements and location, officials said.

Earlier in the day, the crew had been in one area, but later moved from that point, and officials said they may never know why.

“We have no indication that Operations or anyone else asked the Granite Mountain IHC to move to a new location but we assume they decided this on their own, believing they could reengage and help defend Yarnell,” officials said in the report.

Lookout warned team before fire killed 19

The Yarnell Hill fire was discovered on the evening of June 28. Due to the dangerous terrain and the small amount of fire seen at that point, officials said the decision was made not to put fire personnel in the area at that time. The next morning, the fire had grown to several hundred acres, was moving toward the town of Yarnell.

Fire retardant was dropped on the area and some firefighters were dispatched, according to the report.

The hotshot team was deployed the morning of June 30. The day started with some radios not being programmed with the correct fire tones, which the firefighters were able to work around, officials said. The team then had about a 45-minute hike into the anchor point, which is the spot where they began their efforts.

According to the report, the hotshot team received several weather reports from the National Weather Service during the day; the reports warned of approaching storms and changing wind speeds and directions.

Opinion: When heroes face down fire – and fate

What we now know, from the report, is that the hotshot crew was on top of a ridge and making its way to a designated safety zone when the winds changed erratically again, causing the fire to split and accelerate dramatically, trapping all 19.

The officials who spent more than three months compiling the 116-page report personally delivered it to the families of the hotshot team before releasing it to the media and the public Saturday.

Not since September 11, 2001, had the nation lost so many firefighters in one day.

Gov. Jan Brewer said the deaths represented “as dark a day as I can remember.” A 100-mile procession brought their bodies from the state Capitol, through the community where they perished and back to their hometown of Prescott. Their loss felt especially acutely there as the 19 represented 20% of the city’s fire department.

Vice President Joe Biden spoke at a memorial service attended by thousands. The Granite Mountain Hotshots realized, Biden said that integrity “is measured by whether you respond to the needs of your neighbors.”

Opinion: Lasting compassion for fallen firefighters

Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring military personnel who died in the service of their country, particularly those who died in battle or as a result of wounds sustained in battle. While those who died are also remembered, Veterans Day is the day set aside to thank and honorthose who served honorably in the military – in wartime or peacetime. In fact, Veterans Day is largely intended to thankveterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to our national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all those who served – not only those who died – have sacrificed and done their duty."

This is one of the many interesting issues facing Congress that we probably will not have time to debate once Congress actually comes back next month. Then it’ll be nothing but Obamacare and government shutdowns and the occasional discussion about whether Senator Ted Cruz has managed to dispose of his recently discovered dual Canadian citizenship.

Which I am personally looking forward to a lot. But today let’s consider the American space program.

Space exploration is one of the extremely few areas in which there is a lot of bipartisan agreement in Washington. For instance, both parties believe that the United States should be trying to get to Mars. Eventually. Nobody thinks this will happen anytime soon — partly because the technology is so challenging and partly because Congress keeps cutting the space budget. So far, NASA has not shown any interest in the tactic being used by a Dutch company that hopes to establish a Martian colony in about 10 years, with money that would come in part from producing a reality series, somewhere along the lines of “Big Brother"" or perhaps “Real Housewives of the Red Planet.”

The third point of wide bipartisan agreement is that nobody wants their constituents to be clobbered by an asteroid. Really, this is a priority. The Obama administration is currently promoting an “asteroid grand challenge,” in which we’re invited “to find all asteroid threats to human populations” and figure out what to do about them."

Six Republican amendments approved%3B five Democratic

%22We%u2019re off to a good start%2C%22 Sen. Charles Schumer says

Sen. Chuck Grassley stills says legalization first is a problem

WASHINGTON — Senators who back a sweeping immigration law said Thursday they were heartened by the first big test of the proposal in which members of both parties were allowed to make changes to the bill.

The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee adopted eight amendments offered by Republicans and 13 from Democrats. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said some of the Republican amendments have helped strengthen the bill and should encourage more GOP members of Congress to consider voting for it.

""We all know this is going to be a long, hard road but we're off to a good start,"" Schumer said. ""I think our arguments are holding firm.""

But Republican critics said the bill still ignores important demands on border security that will make it difficult to pass the Senate and especially the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, saw the committee vote down one of his amendments that would have tripled the size of the Border Patrol and quadrupled the number of drones and sensors used to patrol the southwest border with Mexico.

""The American people want Congress to be serious about border security,"" Cruz said. ""That is true among Republicans and Democrats. It is true in red states and blue states. And it is with regret that the committee has consistently rejected any attempts to put real teeth in this bill to secure the border.""

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and the ranking member on the committee, echoed the concerns of many Republicans worried that the bill allows the nation's estimted 11 million unauthorized immigrants to get legal status before the nation's borders are secured.

""No one can dispute that this bill is legalization first and security second,"" Grassley said.

Cruz's measure was one of seven GOP amendments that was voted down, compared to Democrats who did not have any of their amendments struck down.

That prompted Dan Stein, president of the Federation of American Immigration Reform, a group that opposes the bill, to call the hearing ""a complete sham of a process."" Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, a group that supports the bill, said the senators fought off any ""poison pills"" that could doom the prospects of the bill.

The committee was focusing on the border security sections of the 867-bill during Thursday's hearing – the first of several hearings when senators are expected to vote on more than 300 amendments that have been filed.

One of the biggest changes to the bill was an amendment filed by Grassley that ensures that the Department of Homeland Security focus on securing the entire southwestern border. According to the bill, Homeland Security must monitor 100% of the border, and intercept 90% of people crossing, only in sectors deemed ""high risk."" That's defined as sectors where 30,000 people were apprehended in the previous year, and in 2012 would have included three of the nine border sectors.

Grassley's amendment requires the department to reach those goals in all border sectors.

The committee voted down a separate Grassley amendment that would have required that Homeland Security certify the entire border as secured before the nation's unauthorized immigrants can be granted temporary legal status.

The bill as written only requires that Homeland Security create and submit a plan to secure the entire border before those immigrants can apply to become ""Registered Provisional Immigrants,"" which would allow them to legally reside and work in the country.

The committee is now finished with the border security portion of the bill. They must still vote on portions that deal with legalizing the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants, enforcing immigration at work-sites and revamping the legal immigration system. The next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, and there are still several ways in which any momentum on the bill may be disrupted:

The committee is set to resume hearing amendments after the lunch break and will continue throughout the day, and there still exists several ways in which any momentum on the bill may be disrupted:

Same-Sex Immigration Rights

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., filed amendments to extend immigration rights and benefits to the spouses and families of LGBT couples who are in a ""long-term committed relationship."" Immigration activists lobbied the Gang of Eight to include such provisions in their bill, but members held off. And while the idea has support from Democrats on the Judiciary committee, Republicans have warned that including the topic on an already-controversial bill could ruin any chances it has at clearing both chambers. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said simply that adding LGBT immigration rights would ""kill the bill.""

Border Security Enhancements

Many Republicans say the bill doesn't do enough to fully secure the country's border. The last time Congress passed a comprehensive immigration bill in 1986, up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants were allowed to apply to become U.S. citizens. But the promise of border security didn't happen, leading to another wave of illegal immigration and more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country today. Republican senators, including Rep. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have filed several amendments to require the border be certified as secure before people can get green cards and U.S. citizenship. Democrats believe the 13-year path to citizenship is already long enough and worry about putting many more barriers in front of them.

Easier Path to Citizenship

Most of the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before Dec. 31, 2011, would be able to apply for a green card within 10 years, and U.S. citizenship within 13 years, after they have passed criminal background checks, paid taxes, learned English and civics and paid at least $2,000 in fees. But immigration activist groups, and some Democrats, feel that's too difficult a process. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., filed an amendment to move that cutoff date back to April 17, 2013, so recent arrivals aren't left out, and another one to allow young unauthorized immigrants to get a faster path. Adoption of those amendments could rankle Republicans and undermine the bill.

Who Can Benefit

The current Senate bill allows most of the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants to apply for temporary legal status and, eventually, full U.S. citizenship. But some Republicans, including Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., are trying to amend the bill to place some limits. Sessions, for example, has filed an amendment to bar anybody who could qualify for Medicare, Obamacare and other welfare programs from qualifying to get their green card. If the amendments prevent too many people from getting legal status, the bill could quickly lose the support of activist groups, Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration.

Workers vs. Relatives

Many of the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have filed amendments to change the focus of the nation's future legal immigration system. Some lawmakers, such as Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, want to make it easier for companies to hire foreign, high-skilled workers. The bill already increases the number of visas and green cards granted to people with advanced degrees, but Hatch and others believe it places too many barriers in front of U.S. businesses. Adding such provisions could upset some Republicans who are worried the bill already puts U.S. workers in jeopardy. The shift away from a family-based immigration system also worries some in Congress. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, filed an amendment to allow U.S. citizens the ability to petition for their siblings – a part of U.S. immigration law that is repealed by the Gang of Eight bill.

Playboy recently installed a 40-foot neon sculpture of its iconic bunny logo on the side of U.S. Highway 90 near Marfa, Texas, in an attempt to attract younger, hipper readers. It's perched atop a post and a concrete platform displaying a stylized version of 1972 Dodge Charger

The sign is part of a roadside art display designed by New York contemporary artist Richard Phillips and Playboy's creative director of special projects Neville Wakefield. They call it art. But some Marfa locals think it's just an advertisement.

One resident, Lineaus Lorette, filed a complaint with the Texas Department of Transportation.

""I thought it was a sign -- a corporate logo. And in Texas you can't put up signs without permits,"" Lorette told the Associated Press.

""I was really ambivalent. It's a beautifully made sign. The problem is that it's a sign. The rules have to apply to everybody.""

When residents complained about the giant bunny -- and what it represents -- officials were all ears and told Playboy to remove it within 45 days.

""The agency has ordered the property owner to remove this sign because the owner does not have a Texas License for Outdoor Advertising and a specific permit application for the sign was not submitted,"" Veronica Beyer, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Transportation, told the El Paso Times. ""Furthermore, the location at which the sign has been placed does not qualify for a permit.""

Playboy lawyers plan to fight the edict against the bunny sculpture.

""We do not believe the art installation by Richard Phillips violates any laws, rules or regulations,"" the company said in a statement released to NewsWest9.com. ""Our legal counsel is currently looking into this matter and we hope to resolve this issue satisfactorily and as quickly as possible."""

There was an awesome printed Lela Rose vest, an on-trend Burberry trench coat and a covetable utility jacket (seriously, we'd like to steal it). While we didn't love the oversized tunic she chose for a Riverdance performance, Michelle generally maintained a strong enough fashion game to compete with her increasingly-trendy daughters.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released his birth certificate on Sunday in an effort to curb speculation that he is ineligible to run for president.

The document, published by the Dallas Morning News, confirms that Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta to an American mother, immediately making Cruz a citizen of both the United States and Canada. As the Morning News points out, that means Cruz could run for office in Canada unless he later decided to renounce his Canadian citizenship.

However, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier denied the senator's dual citizenship.

“Senator Cruz became a U.S. citizen at birth, and he never had to go through a naturalization process after birth to become a U.S. citizen,” Frazier said. “To our knowledge, he never had Canadian citizenship, so there is nothing to renounce.”

Cruz, first elected to the Senate last fall, has sparked early presidential speculation by making visits to key primary states like Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire. He's also courted Republican donors at GOP functions in New York City and his home state of Texas.

Under the U.S. constitution, only ""natural born"" citizens are eligible to run for president. While this definition includes individuals born overseas to an American parent -- like Cruz -- some have continued to raise questions about the freshman senator's eligibility for office if he chooses to run in 2016.

During an appearance on ABC's ""This Week"" earlier this month, business mogul and unapologetic skeptic of President Barack Obama's birth certificate Donald Trump suggested that Cruz was ""perhaps not"" allowed to run for higher office.

""I don't know the circumstances. I heard somebody told me he was born in Canada. That's really his thing,"" Trump said."

It was, without a doubt, the administration's most cynical attempt (as of then) to divert attention from the numerous failings of Obamacare; not to mention the IRS and Benghazi scandals.

Unfortunately for the White House, the American people are not (for the most part) stupid; they immediately saw the ""deal"" for what it is—a smokescreen.

And so, this week, the administration was forced to up its game.

By arranging the calendar in such a way that Thanksgiving and the start of Hanukkah fell on the same day, they hoped to finally put Obama's second-term woes behind them.

However, all they ended up doing is proving how awesome modern conservatism is.

Or something.

The singer was joined by the United States Marine Band.

Clarkson's performance came with its own backstory. In December 2011, Clarkson endorsed Republican Ron Paul, citing his ""refreshing"" small-government views. The singer -- who describes herself as ""a Republican at heart"" -- then said she would vote for Obama ""again"" after he announced his support for gay marriage.

The ""American Idol"" alum counts Sen. Chuck Schumer among her Washington fans. Schumer, the chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, praised the singer in an appearance on HuffPost Live.

""I felt very good about myself, because I listened to her and I said, 'I really like her,' and then only later did I learn she had won 'American Idol,'"" Schumer said. ""So I was very glad that my tastes were the same as most of America's.""

On Monday, Schumer responded to Clarkson's performance with just one word: ""Wow!"" Here's what Clarkson had to say for herself:

Wow ....I was incredibly nervous and cold ha! I just wanna officially thank President Obama for opening for me haha! Just kidding :) — Kelly Clarkson (@kelly_clarkson) January 21, 2013



A host of other musicians and singers were spotted at events surrounding the actual inauguration. Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder and Usher were among those who scored inauguration weekend gigs.

One of the President's favorite genres was celebrated at the Hip-Hop Inaugural Ball, where rappers 2 Chainz and MC Lyte and singer John Legend were honored at the Sunday night event.

Their speeches were far better received than an impromptu one by rapper Lupe Fiasco, who was reportedly pulled from the stage after an anti-Obama rant of sorts at the StartUp RockOn concert.

Four years ago, Aretha Franklin sang ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee"" and The United States Navy Band ""Sea Chanters"" chorus performed ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Barack and Michelle Obama famously danced to Beyonce's cover of Etta James' ""At Last"" at an inaugural ball.

Updated at 2:46 p.m. ET on 7/29



(CNN) – As the nation's top diplomat, Hillary Clinton used to be a regular presence at the White House, but since leaving her post as secretary of state earlier this year, Clinton has been busy delivering speeches and launching her post-government initiatives.

On Monday, however, Clinton made a return to the building for lunch with President Barack Obama.





Plenty of issues – ranging from health care to Middle East peace talks – could have been conversation starters for the pair, though on Monday, Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said it was ""largely friendship that's on the agenda for the lunch today.""

""Much has been written about over the last four years how Secretary Clinton and the president have developed not just a strong working relationship, but also a genuine friendship,"" Earnest said, adding the lunch was an ""opportunity for the two, who saw each other on a pretty frequent basis over the course of the last four years, to have the chance to catch up.""

Clinton will also meet with Vice President Joe Biden Tuesday at his residence, the Naval Observatory, Clinton aides, as well as a White House official, told CNN. One person with knowledge said the meeting was ""long scheduled.""

As for her Monday meeting with Obama, Earnest said the president invited Clinton to the lunch, which had grilled chicken, pasta jambalaya and salad on the menu.

Current Secretary of State John Kerry was spotted arriving at the White House around the same time as Clinton, though Earnest said he believed Kerry did not join his predecessor and Obama for the lunchtime meeting. Clinton, however, did stop by to say hello while Kerry met with National Security Adviser Susan Rice, according to Clinton aides.

The White House is preparing for Middle East peace negotiations in Washington Monday night, and Earnest indicated it was more than possible that the talks could have come up come during the meal.

""The purpose of the lunch was chiefly social, but given that the president and Secretary Clinton worked on this pretty closely together over the course of the last four years, I'd be surprised if they didn't,"" he said.

According to Clinton aides, the lunch came together when Obama and Clinton saw each other at the George W. Bush Presidential Center dedication ceremony in April, where Obama and former President Bill Clinton gave brief remarks. With the president and the former secretary of state having busy schedules this summer, July 29th became the agreed upon date, the aides said.

Former rivals during their marathon battle for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, Obama and Clinton forged what most parties say was a strong working relationship during her years at the State Department. Since her departure, the pair met for dinner at the White House along with her husband, and for the dedication of the Bush library in Texas.

Clinton, a potential candidate for the White House in 2016, has spent her months post-State appearing at events focused on women's empowerment, as well as maintaining a healthy roster of paid speaking engagements.

She launched an initiative through the Clinton Foundation dedicated to early childhood development, and signed a book deal in April for a diplomacy-centered memoir to be released in 2014.

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, began an old-school, speak-until-you-can-speak-no-more filibuster on Wednesday just before noon, and was still going strong hours later.

Mr. Paul, who opposes the nomination of John O. Brennan to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, had previously said he would filibuster President Obama’s nominee after receiving a letter this month from Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. that refused to rule out the use of drone strikes within the United States in “extraordinary circumstances” like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

On Wednesday, Mr. Paul did exactly as promised, taking to the Senate floor to filibuster Mr. Brennan’s nomination.

“I rise today to begin to filibuster John Brennan’s nomination for the C.I.A.,” Mr. Paul began. “I will speak until I can no longer speak. I will speak as long as it takes, until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our Constitution is important, that your rights to trial by jury are precious, that no American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court.”



Mr. Paul is the first senator to use an actual filibuster after the Senate reached a deal earlier this year to take some basic steps to limit the filibuster.

As Mr. Paul’s filibuster — quickly nicknamed the “filiblizzard” by Twitter users, poking fun at the Washington snow storm that failed to materialize — entered its fourth hour, the senator from Kentucky got an assist from his friends, as Senators Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, joined him on the Senate floor to help with the effort.

Mr. Paul did not yield the floor — a move that would effectively end his filibuster — but he did, with some apparent relief, yield to take questions from his Republican colleagues.

Mr. Cruz began by making the obvious allusion, referring to Mr. Paul as a “modern day ‘Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,’ ” joking that his effort would “surely be making Jimmy Stewart smile.”

And, perhaps befitting of public stands, Mr. Cruz also took the opportunity to remind the chamber that Wednesday marks the 177th anniversary of the fall of the Alamo, noting with some pride that Mr. Paul “is originally from the great state of Texas.”

Mr. Cruz then proceeded to read from a letter written by William Barrett Travis, a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army who died at the Alamo, concluding, “Does that glorious letter give you any encouragement and sustenance on this 177th anniversary of the Alamo?”

Apparently it did, as Mr. Paul soldiered ahead, before again receiving some help, this time from an unlikely source — Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.

Mr. Wyden said that while he had voted in favor of Mr. Brennan’s nomination at Tuesday’s Senate Intelligence Committee meeting and plans to vote for him again on the Senate floor, he believed that Mr. Paul “has made a number of important points” about the administration’s lethal drone program and the potential for targeting American citizens on United States soil.

“I think Senator Paul and I agree that this nomination also provides a very important opportunity for the United States Senate to consider the government’s rules and policies on the targeted killings of Americans and that, of course, has been a central pillar of our nation’s counterterror strategy,” Mr. Wyden said.

He added that he felt that “the executive branch should not be allowed to conduct such a serious and far-reaching program by themselves without any scrutiny, because that’s not how American democracy works.”

And then, as the (now bipartisan) filibuster began to feel a bit like a Shakespearean drama, none other than Senator Marco Rubio of Florida entered from stage right, complete with a water joke — a reference to his recent State of the Union response, in which a video of a parched Mr. Rubio chugging water quickly went viral.

“You’ve been here for a while, so let me give you some advice,” Mr. Rubio. “Keep some water nearby. Trust me.”"

Gov. Peter Kinder says ""We are better than this""

(CNN) —

A rodeo stunt at the Missouri State Fair has come under criticism after a clown donned a Barack Obama mask and stuck on a broom that descended from his backside.

The stunt took place during the bull riding competition on Saturday night.

Rodeo announcer Mark Ficken, president of the Missouri Cowboy Rodeo Association and a school superintendent, announced a special guest: “President Obama.”

Another voice is heard over the loudspeaker working up the crowd and saying, “We’re going to stomp Obama now.”

“As soon as this bull comes out, Obama, don’t you move,” the second voice said. “He’s going to getcha, getcha getcha, getcha.”

“Hey, I know I’m a clown,” the second voice said. “He’s just running around acting like one. Doesn’t know he is one.”

The stunt sickened Perry Beam, who came to the fair in Sedalia with his wife and a student from Taiwan to “give him a little piece of Americana.”

Beam likened the atmosphere to a Klan rally.

Opinion: Racist taunts at Obama should worry us all

“It wasn’t clean; it wasn’t fun. It was awful; it was sickening,” Beam said, “It was racist.”

The student, Jameson Hsieh, recorded a video of the incident, but had little to say afterward.

“He didn’t say anything. We rode all the way home in silence,” said Beam, who lives 50 miles away in Higginsville. “We were just ashamed, and he didn’t ask any more questions. I think he had seen enough. It is just disgusting.”

Condemnation came from organizers and politicians alike. The Missouri State Fair Commission called it “unacceptable” and said the clown has been banned “from ever participating or performing at the Missouri State Fair again.”

“The commission reiterated that the statements and actions Saturday night were inappropriate and not in keeping with the fair’s standards,” the agency said in a written statement. “The Missouri State Fair apologizes for the unconscionable stunt.”

The board of directors at Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association also issued an apology.

“The Sport of Rodeo is not meant to be a political platform. We are taking measures by training and educating our contract acts to prevent anything like this from ever happening again,” a statement on the group’s website said. “All Members of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association are very proud of our Country and our President.”

And Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder called for those responsible to be held accountable.

“I condemn the actions disrespectful to POTUS” – president of the United States – “the other night,” he said in a post to his official Twitter account. “We are better than this.”

U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill echoed Kinder.

“The state fair is funded by taxpayer dollars, and is supposed to be a place where we can all bring our families and celebrate the state that we love,” she said. “But the young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong lesson about political discourse, that somehow it’s ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the president of our great nation.”

ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) — A federal judge on Friday cleared the way for horse slaughterhouses to resume operating in the U.S. as early as next week.

U.S. District Judge Christina Armijo in Albuquerque threw out a lawsuit by The Humane Society of the United States and other animal protection groups that alleged the Department of Agriculture failed to conduct proper environmental studies when it issued permits to Valley Meat Co. in Roswell, New Mexico, and an Iowa company to slaughter horses for human consumption.

The decision ends, for now, a two-year battle by Valley Meat to open the slaughterhouse.

The issue of horse slaughter has divided horse rescue and animal welfare groups, ranchers, politicians and Indian tribes about what is the most humane way to deal with the country's horse overpopulation and what rescue groups have said are a rising number of neglected and starving horses as the West deals with persistent drought.

The plants would become the first horse slaughterhouse to operate in the U.S. since Congress banned the practice by eliminating funding for inspections at the plants in 2006. It restored that funding in 2011, but the Department of Agriculture did not approve the first permits for horse slaughter plants until this summer.

The companies want to ship horse meat to countries where it is consumed by humans or used as animal feed.

The Iowa company converted to cattle because of the court fight. But attorneys say Valley and Rains Natural Meats of Gallatin, Missouri, are poised to open as early as Monday.

A temporary order blocking a return to domestic equine slaughter had expired Thursday night. Attorneys for the groups that sued the Agriculture Department over its permitting procedures then filed a motion Friday seeking an extension of the restraining order.

Blair Dunn, who represents Valley Meat and Rains Natural Meats, said he would fight any further attempts to keep the plants closed. He said he had calls into the Department of Justice, which represents the Department of Agriculture, to get inspectors dispatched to the plants.

""Rains Natural Meat in Missouri will be ready to go on Monday,"" he said."

The economy added an estimated 195,000 jobs in June, according to the monthly report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday morning. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.6 percent, though the report was highlighted by the jobs figure, which outpaced most forecasters’ estimates.

""The economy has now added private sector jobs for 40 consecutive months, and a total of 7.2 million jobs has been added over that period,"" said Alan Krueger, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. ""In spite of monthly volatility, over the past three years the pace of job growth has increased each year. So far this year, 1.23 million private sector jobs have been added.""

RELATED: Job creation revved up in June

To be sure, the report on Friday offered a modest political boon to President Barack Obama. Despite dire warnings about the effect of the ongoing sequester – the automatic, indiscriminate cuts to federal spending that were enacted earlier this year – the economy continues to add jobs, though not at the type of robust pace that would be needed to further reduce the unemployment rate.

But Republicans seized on some indicators of persistent economic weakness in the jobs report, namely a surge in part-time workers reflected in the statistics, and an uptick in the U-6 unemployment rate from 13.8 percent in May to 14.3 percent in June. The U-6 rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes discouraged workers and the underemployed.

“There’s some good news in this report, but economic growth is still tepid, the unemployment rate is far too high, and the president continues to promote policies that undermine robust job creation,” said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in a statement.

Boehner and other top Republicans used the June jobs report specifically to ding Obama over his administration’s announcement earlier this week that it would delay a key component of its health care reform law, the penalty for most employers who fail to offer insurance to their workers.

""ObamaCare has been predicted to be a drain on employment since before its passage and that outcome was confirmed by the Obama Administration’s delay of the employer mandate,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said in a statement. ""Delaying the inevitable for one year will bring no solace. We must have a permanent delay of ObamaCare before we can realize our full job creating potential."""

The segment on Friday at noon that referred to two of the pilots as “Captain Sum Ting Wong,” and “Wi Tu Lo,” has gone viral and drawn heavy criticism on the Internet.

“Apologies to all upset by a story on Noon News. A serious mistake was made @KTVU,” anchorwoman Tori Campbell wrote on Twitter. “My thoughts are w/ victims of Flt 214 & families.”

In a statement read on KTVU-TV on Friday night, anchor Frank Somerville said the station made several mistakes.

Somerville did not say how exactly the station got the names.

But “we never read the names out loud, phonetically sounding them out” before going on the air, he said.

Late Friday, the National Transportation Safety Board acknowledged that a summer intern confirmed the names to KTVU when a reporter from the station called about them.

“Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft,” the NTSB said in a statement. “Appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such a serious error is not repeated.”

Somerville said the station didn’t properly verify who at the NTSB was confirming the names.

The hoax prompted outrage from some Asian American activists and a journalism organization.

“Words cannot adequately express the outrage we … feel over KTVU’s on-air blunder that made a mockery of the Asiana Airlines tragedy,” wrote Asian American Journalists Assn. President Paul Cheung and MediaWatch Chair Bobby Caina Calvan. “We are embarrassed for the anchor, who was as much a victim as KTVU’s viewers and KTVU’s hard-working staff.”

The two said KTVU should explain where the names originated.

In a letter to Tom Raponi, KTVU/KICU vice president and general manager, retired KTVU reporter Lloyd LaCuesta, an Asian American Journalists Assn. member, said he was saddened by the airing of the prank names.

“Common sense indicates that simply sounding out the names would have raised red flags,” LaCuesta wrote in the letter.

Two teenage girls from China and another passenger were killed and more than 180 people injured when the Boeing 777 clipped a sea wall and slammed into a runway July 6 at San Francisco International Airport.

Asiana Airlines has identified the pilot and copilot as Lee Kang-kook and Lee Jung-min.

The KTVU newscast was captured in a video posted to YouTube in which the station displayed four incorrect pilot names on the screen and an anchor read them aloud.

“The NTSB has confirmed these are the names of the pilots aboard Flight 214 when it crashed,” the anchor said. “We are working to determine exactly what roles each of them played during the landing on Saturday.”

Another YouTube video showed an apology read by the same anchor.

“These names were not accurate despite an NTSB official in Washington confirming them late this morning,” the anchor said. “We apologize for this error.”

The station issued a statement Friday afternoon acknowledging it had “misidentified the pilots involved.”

“Prior to air, the names were confirmed by an NTSB official in the agency’s Washington, D.C., office,” the statement posted on the station’s website said. “Despite that confirmation, KTVU realized the names that aired were not accurate and issued an apology later in the newscast.”

“We sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites,” Raponi said in the statement. “Nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again.”

For years, antidepressants combined with talk therapy had enabled Bahnsen, whose first name is Beatrice, to function well, establishing a thriving public relations business in Washington followed by a career as a newspaper reporter. But those days had been supplanted by a prolonged suicidal depression that had proved impervious to electroshock treatments, periodic hospitalizations and a raft of psychiatric drugs. The phone call in which Bahnsen confided her desire to drink poison seemed to confirm the worst fears of one of her closest friends.

“I figured, well, she was one of those people who just was not ever going to get better,” said Paddy Bowman, a folklore specialist who lives in Alexandria.

Bahnsen, now 73, traces the beginning of her psychological slide to the mid-1990s, when she decided that, after two decades, she’d had enough of Washington. She moved back to her home state of Georgia and her life slowly began to unravel. She felt estranged from her large and devoted circle of friends, began having problems at work, and grew restless and increasingly depressed.

“I felt as though I was on a large island and everyone was slowly moving away and I was there by myself,” Bahnsen recalled. For the first time in her life, she said, she was intermittently psychotic. Periodic suicide attempts, some involving overdoses of prescribed sleeping pills, landed her in a series of mental hospitals.

In November 2006 she was hospitalized in Las Vegas, where she was then living with one of her sons. Doctors, baffled by her longstanding failure to improve, decided to take a closer look at her case. What they found resulted in an entirely different treatment, one that had a rapid and dramatic effect on her mental state.

Neurologist Dariusz Gawronski, who treated Bahnsen, said her case remains one of the most memorable of his 20-year career.

“It’s very rare in this country to see this,” said Gawronski, who attended medical school in his native Poland before finishing his training in the United States. “It does make you wonder why there was [such] inattention prior to her deterioration.”

Better after Prozac — at first

Bahnsen, who had endured a difficult childhood, was open with her friends about her struggle with depression. Until her move to Atlanta when she was in her mid-50s, she had never been hospitalized: Psychotherapy and antidepressants, especially Prozac, had been effective.

“Bebe had this really rich, interesting life,” said Bowman, her close friend since the 1970s. When she moved to Atlanta, Bahnsen quickly found work as a reporter at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a job she liked.

Restless and increasingly dissatisfied after a few years, Bahnsen moved to Sarasota, Fla., then to Pensacola and after that to Alabama, propelled by forces she did not understand. Each time, she remembers thinking that a move might be therapeutic — a fresh start.

“But I found it harder and harder to talk to people, and I was more depressed and more distant,” she recalled.

Bowman said she and other friends watched helplessly, unsure about what was fueling Bahnsen’s peripatetic existence and alarmed by her rambling, sometimes incoherent conversations. “She started being kind of paranoid about people at work, fixating on one woman to whom she ascribed ‘evil intent,’ ” Bowman said. “At times she seemed psychotic.”

“Friends started dropping her, saying, ‘She’s too crazy, I can’t deal with it,’ ” Bowman recalled. “She wore everybody out.”

In March 2002, while hospitalized in Mobile because of suicidal thoughts including her desire to drink drain cleaner, a doctor ordered an MRI scan of her brain. Bahnsen said she is not sure why the test was ordered, but she believes it was because the psychiatrist could not figure out why more than a dozen drugs she had taken in various combinations over the years had not alleviated her psychotic depression.

The MRI showed a small meningioma. One of the most common brain tumors — it is diagnosed in 6,500 Americans annually — meningiomas are typically benign. Depending on their location, they may cause no symptoms; many are discovered incidentally during a brain scan performed for another reason. Such tumors, which have been linked to exposure to radiation including from dental X-rays, often grow slowly.

Bahnsen remembers feeling terrified by the news she had a brain tumor. She said she asked the neurologist whether the mass might have something to do with her depression.

“I vividly remember he told me emphatically that had nothing to do with it,” she recalled. “He said, ‘It’s small, benign and don’t worry about it.’ So I didn’t.”

Bowman remembers Bahnsen calling her about the diagnosis and feeling disappointed it wasn’t the reason for her friend’s worsening mental illness. “I had never heard of a meningioma,” she said, “but the doctor said nothing needed to be done.”

Soon afterward, Bahnsen moved to Arizona to live with one of her sons, an arrangement that lasted only a few months. She moved back to Georgia, sometimes staying with friends or renting a short-term apartment.

“I struggled to eke out a living,” she said. Too disabled to work as a reporter, she cobbled together freelance writing jobs. In 2005 she underwent a series of eight electroshock treatments at an Atlanta psychiatric hospital, hoping they would jolt her out of her depression. The sessions, which resulted in memory loss, did little to relieve the blackness that had engulfed her.

The following year, she moved to Las Vegas to live with her other son.

“It’s just extremely difficult to express how horrible my depression had become,” Bahnsen said, adding that she was aware of becoming “more and more batty. I had never experienced anything like it.”

She was also terrified that her cognitive ability was slipping. She was having trouble expressing herself and feared she was developing dementia, even though she was barely 66.

Around Thanksgiving 2006, a serious suicide attempt landed her in a Las Vegas hospital. By now, she said, she also was falling, although doctors weren’t sure why.

While hospitalized, doctors took her off all medication, a technique known as a washout, to see if some of her symptoms might be drug-related. Seeing no improvement, Gawronski was called in as a neurological consultant to assess her for dementia.

Just in time

Gawronski, who now practices in Baton Rouge, remembers that Bahnsen was confused and not very alert; she spoke but could not formulate questions.

He ordered a brain MRI and quickly discovered the probable reason for her dementia: the meningioma, roughly the size of a peanut when it was discovered four years earlier, had grown to the size of a lime. The tumor was pressing on her left frontal lobe, the portion of the brain responsible for speech, movement, emotional regulation and reasoning.

Most alarming was the evidence of “mass effect”: The tumor appeared to be exacerbating her previously manageable depression, causing personality and mood changes. Doctors were most worried about herniation, an often fatal condition that occurs when the brain is squeezed and shifts out of position.

“She was deteriorating,” Gawronski recalled, “and if the downward pressure from the tumor increased, she could have lapsed into a coma.” Gawronski estimated that Bahnsen was “possibly days away from that.”

On Dec. 4, 2006, Bahnsen underwent an emergency operation to remove the benign meningioma. Days after surgery, she began feeling like herself again, although her memory of the preceding year remains hazy.

“I felt like I had my mind back,” she recalled. “It was the most amazing feeling.”

Bowman, who had learned about the surgery from Bahnsen’s son, was astonished by how transformed her friend sounded when Bahnsen called her a few weeks later.

“I thought, ‘Oh, my God, it’s you,’ ” Bowman remembers thinking. “It was like the old Bebe was back. I wish I had done some research after she told me about the meningioma the first time, but I believed that doctor, which is something I’ll always regret.”

Bahnsen said she does not remember that the neurologist who discovered the tumor in 2002 told her it needed to be monitored regularly, which is standard medical advice. And because he insisted that it was unrelated to her worsening depression, she did not think to mention it to doctors she saw subsequently.

After several weeks in the hospital, Bahnsen spent about a month in a rehab facility. On Feb. 27, 2007, the neurosurgeon who operated on her wrote that “she has made a remarkable recovery. She went from being completely unresponsive to a walking, talking normal human being again.”

Gawronksi said that even a meningioma that doesn’t cause problems should be tracked with regular brain scans. If it becomes too large or its location is problematic, surgery to remove it is often recommended.

Gawronski said he suspects that Bahnsen’s frequent moves may have led to “the continuity of care being fractured.”

Tumor redux

In 2007, Bahnsen returned to Georgia and has lived there since.

Last year, she underwent a second operation to remove a new meningioma. Smaller than the first, it was classified as atypical, meaning it is more likely to be cancerous if it recurs.

This second surgery involved a harrowing complication: Bahnsen developed a serious postoperative infection that required two additional operations, which left part of her face collapsed.

Bahnsen said she tries not to worry about what might happen in the future; most days she feels fine physically and cherishes her close relationships. She has begun writing again, and doesn’t like to dwell on the what-ifs — such as what if her tumor had been discovered sooner, sparing her years of misery and disability?

“When I think about that, I get extremely angry,” she said. “Luckily, it was so wonderful that Dr. Gawronski knew what to do.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/12/Horowitz-blasts-left-Heritage,2013-11-12 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Horowitz at Heritage Foundation: 'The Communist Party Is The Democratic Party',"On Tuesday, former Marxist-turned-conservative icon David Horowitz spoke at the Heritage Foundation to mark the launch of what will be a ten-volume compendium of his writings on leftism, The Black Book of the American Left. In his wide-ranging speech, Horowitz described his transition from left to right, and discussed the shortcomings of a conservative movement unwilling to deal with the ugly realities of what the American left represents.

Horowitz began by distinguishing the David Horowitz Freedom Center from other think tanks, instead characterizing it as a “battle tank.” He labeled himself “monomaniacal” in his focus on the left and its relation to communism. “There are hedgehogs and foxes. The foxes know many things. And the hedgehogs know one thing. I am a hedgehog,” he joked.

“My parents called themselves progressives,” Horowitz explained with regard to his communist parents. “The agenda was a Soviet America…the slogan of the communist party in those days was peace, jobs, democracy. Sound familiar?”

That was the theme of Horowitz’s speech as he continued: how the communists had taken over the Democratic Party. “The communist party is the Democratic Party,” Horowitz stated. “In The Great Gatsby, [F. Scott] Fitzgerald describes the rich as people who break things and leave them for others to clean up. That is a wonderful description of the left.” Horowitz, who began as a radical Marxist, said that the modern left had learned stealth from their failures in the 1960s: “The left have learned from the 1960s…we in the 1960s didn’t want to pretend to be Jeffersonian democrats…That’s why we failed in the 1960s. That’s why they’ve succeeded now.”

But the right, Horowitz pointed out, has failed to acknowledge that reality. On Obamacare, for example, Horowitz railed against the language used by the left: “single-payer.” Instead, he said, “it is communism,” pointing out that it was state ownership of the means of production. He added, “The left hate the Constitution because Madison designed it to thwart them.”

Horowitz then analyzed what he claimed were the four features of the leftist mentality. First, he said, the left and right are on opposite sides of the “fundamental divide of the modern age”: the left believes that human beings are inherently good and infinitely malleable, and so can be shaped by proper state guidance. Conservatives, by contrast, believe that human beings are responsible for social problems, and concentrating power in the hands of humans is dangerous.

Second, Horowitz said, the left are characterized by the belief that “history is a forward march.” Obama, Horowitz claimed, is a deep believer in this concept, all the way down to his carpet in the Oval Office, which assures those who enter that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. “Leftism is a crypto-religion,” he explained. “They see themselves as a savior. People who believe that redemption will take place in this life and I will be a part of it, that’s Hitler. That’s Mao…That’s the American left.”

Third, Horowitz said that the left was characterized by “alienation from this country… What weakens America is actually good.” Horowitz cited the Obama administration’s eager withdrawal from Iraq as evidence of that proposition: “Obama betrayed every American who gave their life for the people of Iraq.” He also slammed the Obama administration with regard to Benghazi: “Benghazi is the most shameful act in the history of the American presidency.”

Finally, said Horowitz, the American left “lie. And it’s not like politicians spinning…you cannot be a leftist without lying about the most basic strategic facts about who you are.”

Horowitz summed up pessimistically: “We are within reach of a totalitarian state in this country…These are very very dark days for this country.” But, Horowitz held out hope: “there’s been an earthquake on the conservative side since I switched sides…the tea party is the earthquake. The best thing that Republicans can do is stop the fratricide.”"

Updated 7/12, 8:01 a.m. ET

(CNN) - It's no secret that Jay-Z is close with President Barack Obama. The hip hop artist held big fundraisers for the president, and his megastar wife, Beyoncé, performed at Obama's second inauguration.

But Jay-Z said this week their friendship also plays out on the small screen–a very small screen. In an interview with New York radio station Hot97, the rapper confirmed that he and Obama exchange text messages.



""Yeah, I've spoken to him on the phone and had texts from Obama, of course,"" he said Wednesday.

Jay-Z stopped himself and quickly expressed regret for saying ""of course,"" acknowledging the term may sound arrogant.

""Yes, that's happened,"" he continued, referring to the text messages.

The song writer and designer said Obama is ""a regular guy"" who uses a lot of sports analogies.

""I don't know if this is like breaching national security, but he was like–when he was getting elected the second time–he was like 'Hey, you know, fourth quarter, just give me the ball.' I said 'word'.""

That conversation, Jay-Z added, happened in Cleveland when he performed at a rally for Obama shortly before Election Day.

He further admitted he gets a little star struck around the president, a big admission for one of the most successful musical artists in the country.

Jay-Z has previously hinted that he uses SMS with the president. In his 2009 song, ""On to the Next One,"" the rapper mentions that he chills with Oprah ""in the projects"" and has Obama ""on the text.""

Obama's relationship with the power couple also made headlines this year when Jay-Z rapped that the White House–rather than the Treasury Department–gave him and Beyoncé approval for their high-profile trip to Cuba.

In an unusual White House press briefing, Obama's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, was asked about the lyrics.

But Carney sharply denied that the White House gave the couple clearance for their travel.

""I guess nothing rhymes with Treasury,"" Carney said.

The bonds between the rapper and the president go back at least as far as the 2008 campaign, when candidate Obama said the way to handle political mudslinging was by brushing one's shoulders off – mimicking Jay-Z's trademark move. Jay-Z's hits shuffle on Obama's iPod, he said in July 2010 – alongside the likes of crooner Frank Sinatra and opera great Maria Callas. The couple also visited the White House earlier that year, and their VIP tour included a stop inside the Situation Room.

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has said he would sign the bill into law, after reaching an agreement with the legislature to include a provision that the law would not take effect unless four other states, at least one of which shares a border with Connecticut, passed similar regulations.

The Connecticut bill also hinges on those states including Northeastern states with a total population of at least 20 million.

“This bill strikes an important balance by ensuring the consumers’ right to know what is in their food while shielding our small businesses from liability that could leave them at a competitive disadvantage,” Mr. Malloy said in a statement issued over the weekend after negotiations on the necessary provisions."
http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/12/05/why-obama-cant-use-iphone/,2013-12-05 00:00:00,[],Why Obama can't use an iPhone,"Why can't President Barack Obama use an iPhone?

""I'm not allowed, for security reasons, to have an iPhone,"" Obama told a White House audience Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse. Instead, the news agency said, Obama has to stick to his BlackBerry, a valued brand in Washington due to its strict security controls and strong encryption.

That's not the entire story, however. BlackBerrys also offer a high level of organizational control and security that few other smartphones can match.

Command and control

Obama's model almost certainly sends and receives all its email and instant messages through a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), an in-house email forwarder controlled by the user's organization. Each BlackBerry-issuing organization can set its own security rules and procedures, and you can assume that the White House's would be pretty tough.

Consumer BlackBerrys, in contrast, send and receive messages through the BlackBerry company's own servers, which are fairly secure, but out of the White House and National Security Agency's controls — and, because BlackBerry is a Canadian company, often outside of the United States as well.

MORE: 7 Best Smartphones on the Market Now

Most iPhones and Android phones route email and instant messages through each message service's own servers — Apple for iCloud and Messages, Google for Gmail and Google Talk, Yahoo for Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Messenger — rather than through any single central control point.

Numerous reports from 2009 indicated that some months after taking office as president, Obama received a customized BlackBerry 8830 World Edition smartphone from BlackBerry maker Research In Motion. (The Waterloo, Ontario, company has since changed its name to BlackBerry.)

The handset reportedly incorporated voice-encryption software developed by the National Security Agency. Since Obama's phone is apparently one of a kind, there's a good chance that even more secure hardware-based encryption is also onboard.

Between his inauguration and the delivery of his custom BlackBerry, multiple reports indicated Obama may have used the military-grade Sectera Edge smartphone made by General Dynamics, though we couldn't find any photos of him using one.

Photo evidence

There are, however, dozens of photos from Obama's first term showing him checking email on what appears to be a BlackBerry 8830, and one from a trip abroad that shows him speaking into a BlackBerry Curve 8900. An Associated Press photo from Obama's second inauguration in January 2013 shows him checking messages on what looks like a flatter-bodied, later-model BlackBerry Q10.

Obama reportedly uses an email address known only to a dozen or so close aides and family members. Other reports state that each incoming email message is manually screened for malware and malicious links.

What few photos show is Obama actually speaking on a BlackBerry. Instead, when the president has been photographed speaking on a cellphone outside the White House or his presidential limousine, he's almost always using a flip or slider feature phone, possibly belonging to an aide or campaign worker.

It may be that the president isn't allowed to speak on his BlackBerry outside of controlled environments. BlackBerry voice calls are normally handled by regular cellular carriers, not a BES, but the White House and presidential limousine may have their own cellular networks.

As for feature phones, those relatively primitive models are more difficult to infect with malware or spyware than more sophisticated smartphones.

While the president may be forbidden from handling an iPhone, he does have an iPad, reportedly given to him personally by then- Apple chief Steve Jobs. It's a safe bet that iPad connects only to the White House Wi-Fi network."

The arrangements and compositions by living or 20th-century Russian and American Orthodox composers included on the lineup here — like Benedict Sheehan’s “Thrice-Holy” (2012) — had nothing in the way of harmonic twists or other contemporary markers to distinguish them from the traditional pieces on the program.

The polyphonic selections proved to be the highlights, in particular an arrangement by Sergius Trubachov of “Gladsome Light,” a type of chant that originated in the Valaam Monastery in northwestern Russia and blends features of Byzantine and Znamenny genres. The female, then male voices blended beautifully, quiet and reserved before swelling to a more sumptuous sound.

The program concluded with “Let God Arise,” a concerto by Dmitry Bortniansky (1751-1825), in which a lone soprano soared expressively above the choir."

USA TODAY

USA TODAY Review%3A **1/2 stars out of four

Stars%3A Channing Tatum%2C Jamie Foxx%2C Maggie Gyllenhaal%2C Richard Jenkins%2C James Woods%2C Jason Clarke

Rated PG-13%3B Runtime%3A 2 hours%2C 11 minutes%3B Opens in select cities Thursday and nationwide Friday

""Tour's over,"" yells a shotgun-toting terrorist who takes a group of Washington, D.C., visitors hostage in the preposterous White House Down.

But the fireworks have just begun.

With its well-choreographed mayhem, Down (* * ½ out of four; rated PG-13, opens in select cities Thursday and nationwide Friday) is an over-the top, Die Hard-style thriller that will make pulses race more than the recent, similarly themed Olympus Has Fallen. While director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) piles on outlandish scenarios, the chemistry of the lead actors mitigates the contrived setup and numbing explosions.

Just after President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) announces his plan to pull American troops out of the Middle East, an insurrection plot is set in motion.

After serving heroically in Afghanistan, John Cale (Channing Tatum) works as a police officer assigned to security for Speaker of the House Raphelson (Richard Jenkins). Cale is endearing thanks to his self-deprecating humor, low-key swagger and commitment to regain the love of his estranged 11-year-old daughter, Emily (Joey King). It also helps that he braves a legion of guerrillas to single-handedly protect the president, even after getting turned down for a spot in the Secret Service.

To ensure that this $150 million movie makes a killing overseas, the terrorists are homegrown. A motley crew of Americans unaffiliated with any ideology — other than wanting to blow stuff up — takes over POTUS' stately home and wreaks havoc.

Sawyer is overtly Obama-esque: He's an inspiring orator, a levelheaded leader and a devoted family man, and he is criticized for being too scholarly. He's even a former smoker. But this is Hollywood's D.C., so when enough has clearly become enough, the commander in chief whips off his wingtips, slips into athletic shoes and lobs a rocket launcher at the bad guys.

Foxx has just the right blend of dignity, smarts and affability to make us want to vote for him. Tatum is a consistently likable Everyman who proves his mettle à la Bruce Willis in the Die Hard movies — with less smirking.

Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Carol Finnerty, a Secret Service official who rejects Cale as a job applicant, despite his war-hero status, mostly because he got C's in college. Cue mass audience sympathy. Making him even more lovable, Cale has brought Emily along for a White House tour following his interview. That's why they're in the house, so to speak, when the rebels take over.

All disbelief must be checked at the theater door. Emmerich's White House has less security than the tiniest airport pre-9/11. A janitor is actually packing bombs, as are the alleged repairmen working in the president's private theater. A crowd watches a car chase with Cale and Sawyer in a presidential limo being shot at by rebels on the White House lawn.

None of the actions taken by administration officials during the takeover make a lick of sense. So it's best to simply sit back and enjoy the camaraderie of Tatum and Foxx as they narrowly avert disaster.

Who can resist a war hero willing to risk everything to protect his adorable daughter and his high-minded president in one movie? It's popcorn patriotism at its finest."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/15/Meese-Rove-off-the-mark-on-86-amnesty,2013-06-15 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Meese: Rove 'Way Off the Mark' on 1986 Amnesty,"Last week, GOP pundit Karl Rove wrote in The Wall Street Journal in support of the current Senate immigration bill, arguing it was much tougher on illegal immigrants than the 1986 law that granted amnesty to the three million illegals. Rove wrote that the ’86 law “essentially told those here illegally that if they had arrived in the U.S. prior to 1982 and wanted to become citizens, simply raise your right hand.” Ed Meese responded Friday that Rove’s description of the law was “way off the mark.”

In a letter published by the WSJ, Meese recalled that he was present in 1986 when the legislation was under consideration. He had examined the bill carefully at the time. He was, after all, US Attorney General then.

“The 1986 act didn’t turn illegal immigrants into citizens on the spot. It granted temporary resident status only to those who could prove they had resided continuously in America for five years,” Meese writes. “Advancement to citizenship was not automatic. Immigrants had to satisfy various requirements along the way. They had to pay application fees, learn to speak English, understand American civics, pass a medical exam and register for military selective service. Those with convictions for a felony or three misdemeanors were ineligible.”





Meese goes on to note another similar, and troubling comparison between the current Senate bill and the 1986 Amnesty law. “The ’86 reform bill also had supposedly ‘rigorous’ border security and immigration law enforcement provisions. So how did that pan out?”

The 1986 law is a troubling parallel to today’s debate. That law was also intended to permanently “solve” the problem of illegal immigration. In granting three million illegals immigrants permanent legal status, the government also promised the public that it would secure the border and increase internal enforcement.

That, of course, didn’t happen. Instead, within two decades, the number of illegal immigrants in the country had more than tripled to 11 million. Without hard triggers for border security, is there any rational reason to think our experience will be any different today?

Meese writes, “Amnesty “bends” the rule of law. And bending the rule of law to reach a “comprehensive” deal winds up provoking wholesale breaking of the law. Ultimately, it encourages millions more to risk entering the country illegally in the hope that one day they, too, might receive amnesty.”

Rove is spearheading an effort to get the GOP behind the Senate immigration plan. Not really because of any particular provisions in the legislation, but rather a simple political ploy to allow the GOP to merely say they supported reform. It is a misguided pandering that will sow the seeds for another illegal immigration problem in the future."

Detroit Free Press

The school%27s president said state officials visited his campus to see whether enough %27dark ones%27 were enrolled

Several Democrats found the comment offensive

Arnn said the college will accept students without regard to race

The president of Michigan's Hillsdale College took heat from several lawmakers during a hearing today in which he said state officials visited his campus to determine whether enough ""dark ones"" were enrolled.

Larry Arnn, the president of the private college, made the comments during a subcommittee hearing on Michigan's adoption of the Common Core State Standards. Arnn, who spoke in opposition of the standards, prefaced his comments by describing an experience when he began as president in the early 2000s in which state officials criticized his college for, as he said, not having enough ""dark"" students.

When it was time for lawmakers on the committee to question Arnn, several Democrats on the committee said they found his comments offensive.

""You're the president of a college. I would expect better out of you,"" said Rep. David Knezek, D-Dearborn Heights.

Arnn tried to explain that his school's charter says the college will accept students without regard to race. But he was cut off.

Later, subcommittee chair Rep. Tim Kelly, R-Saginaw Township, asked Arnn whether he wanted to clarify the comments.

He said the state of Michigan - several weeks before he became president in 2000 - sent a group of people to his campus with clipboards to ""look at the colors of peope's faces and write down what they saw.""

Arnn said his college doesn't keep those kinds of records.

""What were they looking for besides dark ones?"" Arnn said.

The conservative Hillsdale College, founded in 1844, is famous for rejecting all federal and state funding to help guarantee its independence. A 2012 Detroit Free Press story said it was the first U.S. college to prohibit in its charter discrimination by race, religion or gender.

Arnn, the 12th president of the college, began his tenure there in 2000. One of his previous jobs was as president of the Claremont Institute in California. While there, he was the founding chairman of the California Civil Rights Initiative, which pushed for the prohibition of racial preferences in state hiring, contracting and admissions.

Arnn is a 1974 graduate of Arkansas State University, where he received a bachelor's degree. He received a master's degree and a Ph.D. from Claremont Graduate School.

Michigan is one of 45 states that have adopted the common core standards, which for the first time provide common expectations of what students should learn from one state to the next in math and English arts. But state lawmakers have barred the Michigan Department of Education from spending state money on the implementation of the standards — and a test that will be given based on the standards — until the subcommittee can hold hearings on whether the state should move forward with the standards."

Golden in the fading light, the den was overflowing with stacks of videotapes, dusty transcripts, books and photographs.

“This used to be a really serene guest room with nothing in it, and now this is all Ann,” said Ms. Taylor, a veteran actress, referring to Ann W. Richards, the former governor of Texas. “All Ann. These papers are about Ann. These boxes are all full of Ann videos. These are speeches, pre- and post-governor. These are Larry King transcripts.

“I’m not sure what this is.” She paused before yet another pile, the raw material for what became her first play (and turned this guest room into an office). “Oh. Those are my transcripts of speeches that I have no written text for.” She sighed. “I can no longer organize it. I’m past that point.”

As she would be the first to admit, the 70-year-old Ms. Taylor is obsessed with Richards, a woman she met only once, when the gossip columnist Liz Smith insisted that the actress join them for lunch in 2004 at Le Cirque. She has spent the better part of four years studying every aspect of Richards’s life, interviewing her friends, her staff members and her four children, reviewing 150 hours of filmed appearances, listening to tapes of speech-writing sessions and absorbing the off-color candor and bawdy humor that made Richards anything but your average politician — a personality as suited for the stage as for “Meet the Press.”"

Several parts of the border, like one 25-mile stretch west of McAllen, are at times not being watched, so the number of migrants who cross from Mexico without getting caught is surging, too, three agents said in interviews last week.

“It’s really demoralizing because there’s so much traffic passing through here and we can’t do anything about it,” one agent said Friday while on patrol, asking that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “And when you try to do something and they won’t let you do it,” he added, having been ordered during recent shifts not to drive his truck, “it’s just really demoralizing.”

Corruption has also been a problem: two Homeland Security auditors, until recently based in McAllen, were indicted in April on charges that they falsified documents when they were supposed to be investigating a string of cases in which Border Patrol agents had been helping smuggle illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

Mike Salinas, an alderman in La Joya, Tex., a tiny city on the Rio Grande, said border agents there were frequently outnumbered. Last week, a single agent tried to round up a group of 20, most of whom he watched scatter and get away.

“People are just crossing without fear,” Mr. Salinas said, recalling crowds right in his backyard in recent weeks.

The holding cells at the McAllen Border Patrol station are often filled beyond capacity, and dozens of migrants are temporarily held in a truck garage. As many as 50 adults are detained for up to a week in a single holding area, with no shower, agents said."

The next day, in a reminder of the importance of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear an appeal of a decision by two of the lower court’s Republican appointees that swept away one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s key air quality rules.

The impending confirmation of Millett and two additional Obama nominees to the D.C. Circuit, expected by Christmas, will give Democrats a 7-4 majority among full-time judges on a court that hears many of the most important cases on the powers of the federal government, ranging from labor law to banking regulation.

The court has been evenly split since Sri Srinivasan was confirmed in May, ending a Republican majority on the court. Republicans have fought tooth and nail to stop Democrats from taking control.

Senate Democrats last month voted to abolish the filibuster for most federal judgeships, obliterating a long-standing Senate rule that Democrats also had used during Republican presidencies to keep people they considered extreme off the lower courts. Many liberals are now hoping that President Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate will take the opportunity to fill numerous judicial vacancies nationwide without having to worry about Republican filibusters.

Initially, however, the impact at the D.C. court may be modest. Unlike most federal appeals courts, the D.C. Circuit rarely meets as a group to issue opinions. But like other such courts, it issues most of its decisions in three-judge panels.

But close observers of the D.C. Circuit say the addition of Millett, plus Georgetown law professor Nina Pollard and U.S. District Court Judge Robert L. Wilkins — who personally won a landmark settlement against the Maryland State Police for racial profiling — will over time counter the rising influence of two archconservatives appointed by President George W. Bush.

The observers, who did not want to be identified discussing the inner workings of the court, said that the arrival in 2005 and 2006 of former California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown and Brett Kavanaugh, a former top Whitewater prosecutor, changed the internal dynamics of the court.

Brown and Kavanaugh have been outspoken dissenters, which some feel has disturbed the tradition of comity on the court. And on panels where they teamed up with fellow Republicans to form a majority, as in the EPA case, they managed to pull the court’s decisions to the right.

The arrival of three Obama-appointed judges will probably change that, White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler said in an interview. “I think it’s really great for a very important court that decides issues of national importance,” she said.

Theoretically, the change in the filibuster rule will also improve Obama’s ability to influence other appeals courts and district courts across the country. But in most states, he is already encountering a new problem. Republicans are retaliating for the filibuster rule change by using another powerful tool to block nominees to other courts.

There is another arcane Senate tradition called the blue slip, for the colored piece of paper that both senators of a nominee’s home state are asked return to a Senate committee considering a nominee from that state.

An unfavorable comment from a nominee’s senator, or no opinion at all, has traditionally been enough to prevent a hearing and kill a nomination. And with at least one Republican senator in 31 states, some blue slips have already been withheld since the filibuster rule was changed. Republican senators in Arizona are even trying to block approval of judges they previously recommended.

“The reforms were wonderful, but no one thinks they ended anything,” said Nan Aron of the liberal lobbying group Alliance for Justice. “The fight goes on because the stakes are so huge.”

Even the White House acknowledged that despite all the hoopla about Obama’s potential ability to remake the federal judiciary, Republicans’ hold over the confirmation process has only been loosened, not broken.

“The filibuster rule itself was not … the only source of obstruction,” Ruemmler said. “I think in many ways the blue-slip rule is more problematic.”

Pressure is mounting on Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) to follow the filibuster change with modifications to the blue-slip tradition. Leahy has said he will continue to observe the tradition unless Republicans “abuse” their prerogatives.

But Ruemmler predicted the White House would have an easier time confirming judges in liberal states like California, New York and Maryland. In such states there would be no impediment to nominating even progressive judges who would not have been nominated previously because of fears they could not be confirmed.

“I think that it will make a pretty significant difference for courts of appeal from states with two Democratic senators,” she said.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/sailing/22494280,,[],America's Cup: Andrew Simpson's death reawakens safety debate,"Andrew Simpson's tragic death on the waters of San Francisco Bay has put the America's Cup under the microscope for all the wrong reasons.

Britain's double Olympic medallist, 36, died when he was trapped under the upturned hulls of his boat after a capsize during training.

Organisers, the police and Coast Guards have begun investigating, with attention from inside and outside the sport inevitably focused on safety concerns rather than on the thrilling spectacle of a prestigious old event.

quote This is such a tragedy. The only solace I can find is he died doing something he loved Ben Ainslie

The America's Cup has always been seen as the pinnacle of inshore yacht racing, known as much for controversy, complex rules, court-room wrangles and rich men posturing as cutting-edge design, world-class sailors and absorbing racing. In many ways, that was all part of the allure.

But the 34th America's Cup was supposed to drag the 162-year-old event, the oldest trophy in sport, into the 21st century.

The tag line for the 2013 edition is ""the world's fastest boats, the world's best sailors"".

Revolutionary, high-speed multihulls made with futuristic technology were devised to appeal to a new generation and make the sport more exciting to watch, both from the shore and on TV. The Cup is often described as the ""Formula 1"" of sailing but organisers want it to be more like Nascar, with similar thrills and spills.

However, Simpson's death has brought renewed questions about the new designs amid continuing concerns over safety. BBC Sport looks at the issues.

The boats

Traditionally, the America's Cup has been sailed in sleek, single-hulled yachts with deep keels, competing head-to-head. But the slow, tactical nature of the racing was perhaps more for the sailing purist than any wider audience.

""The past America's Cups have been like watching paint dry,"" said Jimmy Spithill, skipper for defending champions Oracle.

The new breed of radical catamarans, called AC72s, were brought in by US software billionaire Larry Ellison and four-time America's Cup-winning skipper Russell Coutts after their Oracle team won the last Cup in 2010.

AC72 specifications Length: 22m (72.2ft)

Beam: 14m (45.9ft)

Weight: 5,900kg (13,000lbs)

Maximum draught: 4.4m (14ft)

Mast height: 40m (131ft)

Wing area: 260 sq m

Jib area: 80 sq m

Gennaker area: 320 sq m

Top speed: 45 knots

Crew: 11+1 guest

The twin-hulled carbon-fibre giants - unique but designed within certain parameters - are 72ft long with a mast 131ft high and solid ""wing sails"" to improve speed and stability. The wing enables the boats to race in anything from five to 30 knots, maximising the chances of racing on any given day - essential for TV.

Recent developments have seen ""foils"", which lift the hulls out of the water to make them go even faster, sometimes more than twice the speed of the wind and up to 45 knots (50mph).

In the America's Cup World Series - events held around the world in the build-up to the Cup - crews raced in AC45s, vessels similar to the Cup version but smaller to enable the sailors to practise while the 72s were being built. The nature of these boats means supreme fitness is at a premium among the sailors.

But the cutting-edge design brings with it a host of unknown factors.

""These America's Cup boats are new, they're very high powered and the loads on them are huge,"" said British Olympic sailing team chief Stephen Park.

""That brings with it the excitement they were looking for in the America's Cup but these boats are untrodden waters for sailing. There are a lot of unknowns and things being tested.""

Safety

To put Simpson's death in context, it is only the second death of an America's Cup sailor during training after Spain's Martin Wizner was killed when he was hit by a piece of broken equipment in 1999. No-one has died in an America's Cup race since its inception around the Isle of Wight in 1851.

quote I lost my closest friend of over 25 years, the friendliest, kindest man I have ever met. I cannot believe he is no longer with us

But the capsize of Artemis is the second major incident involving an AC72. Last October, the Oracle team flipped their boat, destroying the wing. No-one was hurt, but it added to concerns that the new design could, in some circumstances, be too powerful to control. Artemis also reported structural damage to its front beam last year.

Catamarans are inherently stable, despite having no keel, but when the wind causes them to lean and sail on one hull it is the skill of the sailors that keeps them from tipping. With the size, speed and power of these yachts, a split-second delay can take them past the point of no return.

In certain manoeuvres, the downwind hull can get buried in the water, causing the yacht to ""pitchpole"" or flip end-over-end.

""The harder you push the accelerator, the faster you go, but there's a chance you hit the wall,"" said Spithill recently.

With only two months to go before the action is set to begin, sailors and designers are still learning the nuances of the beasts. And while the Artemis accident occurred in unexceptional conditions - 18-20 knots of wind and flat seas - July and August in San Francisco will see bigger breezes.

Paul Cayard, Artemis chief and tactician, recently predicted a repeat of Oracle's capsize.

""It would be a miracle if we get through the summer without it happening to somebody [else],"" he said. ""We're going to start pushing harder, we are going to race and those type of boats - catamarans - tip over.""

For safety, sailors wear helmets, life vests and body armour and carry knives to cut themselves free from fallen rigging. They also receive regular training in underwater survival and wear small oxygen bottles in case of being trapped. Divers and doctors follow in support boats.

It is not clear yet what caused Artemis to flip and break up or what exactly happened to Simpson.

The format

The event is scheduled to begin with the Louis Vuitton Cup, the head-to-head challengers' series from 4 July-30 August. The winner of this will go on to race holders Oracle for the America's Cup, a best-of-17 race series from 7-21 September.

Schedule 4 July-4 Aug: Louis Vuitton Cup round robin

6-14 August: Louis Vuitton Cup semi-finals

17-30 August: LV Cup best-of-13 final

7-21 September: America's Cup best-of-17 final v Oracle

Originally, Coutts envisaged 14 challengers, but only three - Sweden's Artemis, Emirates Team New Zealand and Italy's Luna Rossa - plus Oracle have made it this far. Most dropped out because of soaring costs, thought to be about $100m per campaign. Others disagreed with the concept.

British businessman Sir Keith Mills withdrew his Team Origin when he first saw the plans for the AC72s, forcing Simpson, Iain Percy and Ben Ainslie to pursue their America's Cup ambitions with overseas outfits. Percy, Simpson's Olympic partner, is sailing team boss with Artemis, while four-time Olympic champion Ainslie is racing for Oracle before launching his own team BAR for the next Cup.

""Based on the specs I saw in 2010, I was very concerned and I expressed my concerns,"" said Mills. ""But the Americans were determined to go ahead with this type of sailing, which I fundamentally disagreed with.""

Organisers boast the 34th America's Cup will be the most accessible to on-shore spectators in the event's history. The compact course will be close to the shore, inside the Golden Gate Bridge, and between Alcatraz Island and the waterfront district near Fisherman's Wharf.

The TV coverage will be similarly revolutionary, with sailors wearing microphones, onboard cameras and real-time on-screen graphics to provide an instant and understandable view of the boats' positions on the racetrack.

The future

With the investigations still under way, the future is unclear.

Options range from safety tweaks, to delaying the start of the Louis Vuitton Cup, to the nuclear option of cancelling the whole thing. Luna Rossa boss Patrizio Bertelli is reportedly conferring with his team over whether to continue their campaign.

Notable moments in Cup history 1851: US yacht America wins the inaugural event off the Isle of Wight, England

1983: Australia II, with a controversial winged keel, is first non-US boat to win since 1870

1987: Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes wins back Cup for United States in Fremantle

1995: Team New Zealand win for the first time and defend at home in 2000

2003: Switzerland's Alinghi, with many Kiwi sailors, beats Team New Zealand in NZ

2007: Alinghi defends the Cup in Valencia

2010: US team Oracle wins a controversial edition with a wing-sailed trimaran

2013: British Olympian Andrew Simpson dies in training in San Francisco

Scrapping the 2013 Cup would cause a huge knock-on effect in terms of cost, jobs, logistics and the reputations of Ellison and Coutts, but America's Cup Event Authority chief executive Stephen Barclay admits nothing is out of the question.

""Nothing is off the table,"" he said. ""We need to know what happened.

""After a tragedy like this, there will be a full and careful evaluation and we will be ready to act on any of the lessons learned.""

If the Cup does go ahead, Artemis has a second AC72 which could be in action next month. Oracle also has a back-up boat, but Team New Zealand and Luna Rossa do not.

The winners of the America's Cup get to choose the boats, format and venue for the next event, and it seems likely the AC72 will be scrapped.

On the other hand, another America's Cup organising official said the AC72 represents progress in sailing.

""It's what these guys want to do,"" said regatta director Iain Murray. ""They want to take sailing to the next level and these boats are part of that platform."""
http://news.yahoo.com/bush-cheney-friends-210240367.html,,[],"Bush, Cheney 'never quite friends,' new book reveals","President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were ""never quite friends,"" Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, writes in his upcoming book, “Days of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House.""



In an excerpt published on the Times website Thursday, Baker details what he describes as the ""final insult in the Bush-Cheney marriage"": the president's decision not to pardon ""Scooter"" Libby, Cheney's former chief of staff, who had been convicted of lying to federal officials investigating the leak of the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson.



When Bush informed Cheney of the decision, Cheney snapped: “You are leaving a good man wounded on the field of battle.""



“The comment stung,” Bush wrote in his 2010 memoir, ""Decision Points."" “In eight years, I had never seen Dick like this, or even close to this. I worried that the friendship we had built was about to be severely strained, at best.”



But according to Cheney, there really wasn't a friendship to strain.



“It was professional, more than personal,” Cheney told Baker shortly after leaving office. “We weren’t buddies in that sense.”



While Bush called Cheney “Dick,” Baker wrote, Cheney always called Bush “Mr. President” and referred to him with others as “the Man.”



Even more telling, according to Baker, is the new George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Texas:

There were exhibits featuring the first lady and their daughters, videos narrated by [former Secretary of State Condoleezza] Rice, [former White House chief of staff Joshua] Bolten and Andy Card, and even statues of the presidential dogs. There was little sign of Dick Cheney.





Baker's book also looks to dispel the notion that Cheney was pulling the strings behind the curtain.



“This whole notion that the vice president was the puppet master, I find laughable,” Gen. Richard Myers, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Baker. “He was an active vice president because I think he was empowered, but he wasn’t a dominant factor. The alpha male in the White House was the president.”



Cheney's reputation as the administration's ""evil genius"" was fueled, in part, because he embraced it:





Story continues

Once his friend David Hume Kennerly greeted him teasingly by saying: “Hi, Dick. Have you blown away any small countries this morning?” Without missing a beat, Cheney replied, “You know, that’s the one thing about this job I really love.” At another point, he tried on a Darth Vader mask his aides had bought and posed for a picture. When he later tried to put the picture in his memoir, his wife, Lynne, talked him out of it.





In reality, Baker writes, it was Rice who became Bush's top lieutenant:





No one in the White House had the relationship with Bush that Rice had. She worked out with him, talked sports with him, dined with him and Laura in the residence and spent weekends with them at Camp David.



Cheney says he wasn't even consulted on the decision to remove Donald Rumsfeld as defense secretary. “It wasn’t open for discussion by the time [Bush] came to me,” Cheney said."

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

And now, it appears establishment 'Pubs are willing to roll out the big guns in their battle with Randy and the Cruz-ers.

The New York Times reports this morning that the National Republican Senatorial Committee has given notice to longtime 'Pub ad house Jamestown Associates that the NRSC will not be contracting any ad campaigns with Jamestown this cycle. The reason? Jamestown has produced spots and bought time for candidates backed by Jim DeMint's Conservatives Fund, which has been targeting sitting GOP senators with right-side primary challenges.

Party campaign committees, while of dubious value in actually convincing voters to get to the polls, control impressive war chests, and the NRSC's shot across Jamestown's bow is a signal that establishment 'Pubs aren't going to take Tea Party primary challenges lying down, but are prepared to fight back with the biggest guns they've got--the green ones.

Meanwhile, the ongoing war of words between the factions continues unabated. A couple of choice quotes from the Times piece may amuse.



“We’re not going to do business with people who profit off of attacking Republicans,” said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the committee. “Purity for profit is a disease that threatens the Republican Party.”

“This is happening because Mitch McConnell is having a complete meltdown,” said Matt Hoskins, executive director of the conservative group. “He can’t defend his record so he’s threatening and attacking everyone who disagrees with him. He’s so rattled, he has decided to declare war on the entire conservative movement, which represents the very people he needs to win re-election. This isn’t the behavior of a confident person. It’s the irrational reaction of a power-hungry bully who isn’t getting his way.”

“S.C.F. has been wandering around the country destroying the Republican Party like a drunk who tears up every bar they walk into,” said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell’s chief of staff, now detailed to the National Republican Senatorial Committee through the election. “The difference this cycle is that they strolled into Mitch McConnell’s bar and he doesn’t throw you out, he locks the door.”

Stay tuned for more dispatches from the front. Or just wait for the rumble and the smell of powder."

Dan Bongino, who was a Secret Service agent under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told Breitbart News that his appearance to speak on Bashir’s program about his book, Life Inside the Bubble, “was booked in advance of his unfortunate comments,” and he could not in good faith appear on the program.

“In light of these comments I felt it only appropriate to cancel my appearance on the show. Governor Palin took a principled chance on me during my U.S. Senate campaign when few would,” Bongino told Breitbart News. “She put herself out there for me, risking her political capital, and chose to endorse me because she believed in me.

“In a political arena filled with bad actors it was refreshing to know that Governor Palin was willing to fight for the underdog. She deserves better than the treatment she received by Mr. Bashir and I cannot, in good faith, appear on the show, regardless of the number of books it may or may not sell.”

Bongino is the author of Life Inside the Bubble, which is getting bipartisan interest thanks to recent scandals and the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s assassination. As of this writing, it is No. 39 on Amazon.com’s bestsellers list. Bongino, a candidate for Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District who has said he would go to Washington and not let the city change him, turned down a chance to promote himself and his book on Bashir’s show during a week in more people may be watching due to the controversy surrounding Bashir’s comments.

Bashir apologized on Monday for his remarks, saying they were “offensive” and wholly inappropriate,” but MSNBC has not taken any action against him despite the network’s past history of disciplining its on-air talent for “offensive remarks.” Palin’s political action committee SarahPAC sent a letter to MSNBC President Phil Griffin and NBC News President Deborah Turness, which Breitbart News exclusively obtained, that asked the network what action it would take against Bashir, especially given that the network suspended Alec Baldwin for anti-gay comments he made off of the air.

“You fired Don Imus for offensive language in describing the Rutgers University Women’s Basketball team, you suspended Alec Baldwin, and yet nothing has happened to Mr. Bashir,” the letter reads. “Are we to assume then, that disciplinary procedures at your network take place based on the target of the remarks rather than the remarks themselves?”

The letter concludes, “Americans deserve to know that your network doesn’t condone violent and hateful rhetoric directed at anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or political persuasion.”"

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/senate-filibuster-reform_n_4316325.html,2013-11-21 00:00:00,"['Former Washington Bureau Chief', 'Senior Congressional Reporter']",Senate Votes For Nuclear Option,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pulled the trigger Thursday, deploying a parliamentary procedure dubbed the ""nuclear option"" to change Senate rules to pass most executive and judicial nominees by a simple majority vote.

The Senate voted 52 to 48 for the move, with just three Democrats declining to go along with the rarely used maneuver.

From now until the Senate passes a new rule, executive branch nominees and judges nominated for all courts except the Supreme Court will be able to pass off the floor and take their seats on the bench with the approval of a simple majority of senators. They will no longer have to jump the traditional hurdle of 60 votes, which has increasingly proven a barrier to confirmation during the Obama administration.

Reid opened debate in the morning by saying that it has become ""so, so very obvious"" that the Senate is broken and in need of rules reform. He rolled through a series of statistics intended to demonstrate that the level of obstruction under President Barack Obama outpaced any historical precedent.

Half the nominees filibustered in the history of the United States were blocked by Republicans during the Obama administration; of 23 district court nominees filibustered in U.S. history, 20 were Obama's nominees; and even judges that have broad bipartisan support have had to wait nearly 100 days longer, on average, than President George W. Bush's nominees.

""It's time to change before this institution becomes obsolete,"" Reid said, before citing scripture -- ""One must not break his word"" -- in accusing Minority Leader McConnell (R-Ky.) of breaking his promise to work in a more bipartisan fashion.

McConnell responded to Reid by changing the subject to the Affordable Care Act and accusing Democrats of trying to distract Americans from the law's troubled rollout. Getting around to fidelity, McConnell noted that Reid had said in July that ""we're not touching judges,"" yet he was now choosing to do so. Reid casually brushed off his suit coat and sat down.

McConnell compared the alleged duplicity to another Democratic piece of rhetoric. ""If you like the rules of the Senate, you can keep them,"" he quipped, as the GOP side laughed heartily, which encouraged a pleased McConnell to turn directly to his colleagues and repeat the joke.

He then turned to the Democratic side and said he understood why inexperienced young members who'd never been in the minority might want to change the rules. ""The rest of you guys in the conference should know better,"" he said.

Obstruction, McConnell said, began with the Democrats when they decided to filibuster Circuit Court nominees under Bush. ""They made it up. They started it,"" he said, arguing that Republicans were only following their lead. His argument, though, raises the question of why eliminating the filibuster on such judges, if it was never used before 2000, should be seen as an historic development in the first place.

""Stop trying to jam us,"" McConnell said, warning that it would come back to haunt them. ""You may regret it a lot sooner than you think.""

Normally rules changes in the Senate need 67 votes, but the majority can challenge an existing rule, and if the presiding senator rules against the challenge, the majority can then ask for a vote on the chair's ruling. If a simple majority votes to overrule the chair, it sets a new precedent.

Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) broke with their party and joined Republicans in opposing the move. Pryor is in an uphill reelection contest, which may explain his vote, but Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Mark Begich (D-Alaska), who are also top GOP targets in 2014, backed the rules change.

Levin, a Senate traditionalist, has long been the most outspoken opponent of rules reform, and led a successful effort to stymie the movement earlier this year. Manchin, meanwhile, has great reverence for the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), a fierce champion of Senate tradition, likely explaining his vote. (Byrd did make several attempts to change the rules himself when he served as majority leader.)

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who has long been skeptical of changing the rules, cast a critical vote very late in the process supporting the move. That left Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a recent convert to reform, to cast the 51st vote, with Reid casting the 52nd.

The move marks a significant win for the newer crop of Democrats -- like Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the lead proponent of going nuclear -- who have grown increasingly frustrated as McConnell expertly employed parliamentary procedures to stall Democratic nominees and initiatives. Sens. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) have also been longtime champions of filibuster reform, with Harkin's effort dating back more than two decades.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who chaired the Judiciary Committee back when it was Democrats trying to stall Bush's nominees, echoed McConnell, suggesting newer Democrats such as Merkley, who have never been in the minority, were not taking the long view.

""They're -- I want to say this the right way -- they're rustling their inexperienced feathers,"" Hatch said, calling the historic move a ""charade just to try and get off Obamacare.""

""It's raw power that they're exercising, that, like I say, is a very dangerous thing for them to do,"" Hatch said. ""They're going to rue the day they do it.""

But Merkley disagreed, arguing the reform is ""about clearing the decks of the Senate so we can actually spend time on legislation, we can actually address the cost of college, actually have job-creation bills on the floor, that we can address issues related to retirement security.""

""I feel great,"" Merkley said. ""Since I came here in 2009, I've been absolutely appalled by the dysfunction of this body."""

* Rival accused of copying elements of Air Force 1 sneakers

* Court: Already's claim mooted after Nike dropped own case

By Jonathan Stempel

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Nike Inc won a victory at the U.S. Supreme Court barring a smaller rival from suing to void the company's trademark for its top-selling Air Force 1 sneakers.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a unanimous court on Wednesday that Nike's promise not to pursue an infringement lawsuit against Already LLC, maker of Yums sneakers, meant that the Texas company could not pursue its own trademark challenge.

""Already's arguments boil down to a basic policy objection that dismissing this case allows Nike to bully small innovators lawfully operating in the public domain,"" Roberts wrote. But the argument did not justify letting its lawsuit proceed, he wrote.

Wednesday's decision upheld a November 2011 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.

James Dabney, a lawyer for Already, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did Nike.

Wednesday's decision may help companies such as Nike rival Adidas SE and luxury goods makers Coach Inc and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, which often sue to prevent alleged imitators from interfering with their revenue streams and customer goodwill.

The case began in 2009, when Nike claimed in a lawsuit that Already's Sugar and Soulja Boy shoes infringed Nike's trademark on the stitching, eyelet panels and other features of Air Force 1. Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, launched the low-cut Air Force 1 sneaker in 1982 and sells millions of them each year.

After Already countersued to void the trademark, Nike dropped its lawsuit, believing Yums was not a commercial threat, and gave a promise in the form of a covenant not to sue Already.

But Already, based in Arlington, Texas, refused to drop its own case and accused Nike of dropping the original lawsuit to deprive courts of jurisdiction.

DOROTHY'S RUBY SLIPPERS

Roberts, however, said that allowing Already's lawsuit to continue would encourage large and small companies to use litigation as a ""weapon"" rather than as a last resort to settle disputes, which could discourage innovation.

""Accepting Already's theory may benefit the small competitor in this case,"" he said. ""But lowering the gates for one party lowers the gates for all. As a result, larger companies with more resources will have standing to challenge the intellectual property portfolios of their more humble rivals - not because they are threatened by any particular patent or trademark, but simply because they are competitors in the same market.""

Roberts also agreed with Nike that Already was unlikely to produce any shoe that would not be protected.

""If such a shoe exists, the parties have not pointed to it, there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it, and we cannot conceive of it,"" Roberts wrote. ""It sits, as far as we can tell, on a shelf between Dorothy's ruby slippers and Perseus' winged sandals.""

Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred in the decision, saying that other companies should not assume they can automatically end rivals' trademark cases with covenants similar to Nike's.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor joined Kennedy's concurrence.

Two companies with well-known trademarks, clothing maker Levi Strauss & Co and automaker Volkswagen AG, filed briefs supporting Nike.

The case is Already LLC v. Nike Inc, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 11-982."

There are two types of current - direct and alternating. In a direct current , the flow of electrons is consistently in one direction around the circuit, in an alternating current , the direction of electron flow continually reverses.

Charge Electrons are negatively charged particles and they transfer energy through wires as electricity. Charge is a property of a body which experiences a force in an electric field. Charge is measured in coulombs (C). Since electrons are so small and one electron will not have much of an effect anywhere, it is more useful to refer to large groups of electrons. One coulomb of charge is equivalent to 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons.

Current In a closed circuit that includes a source of potential difference (voltage) there will be a current flowing around the circuit. curriculum-key-fact Electrical current in a metal is a flow of electrons When current flows, electrical work is done and energy transferred. The amount of charge passing a point in the circuit can be calculated using the equation: charge = current × time \[Q = I \times t\] This is when: charge ( Q ) is measured in coulombs (C)

current ( I ) is measured in amperes (A)

time ( t ) is measured in seconds (s) One ampere is the current that flows when one coulomb of charge passes a point in a circuit in one second. curriculum-key-fact 'Amps' is an abbreviation for 'amperes', the unit for current (also abbreviated as 'A') but the symbol for 'current' is 'I'. Example A current of 1.5 amps (A) flows through a simple electrical circuit. How many coulombs of charge flow through a point in 60 seconds? \[Q = I \times t\] \[Q = 1.5 \times 60\] \[Q = 90 \\ C\]

Question How much charge has moved if a current of 13 A flows for 10 s? Reveal answer up down \[Q = I \times t\] \[Q = 13 \times 10\] \[Q = 130 \\ C\] Question How much current flows when 10 C passes down a wire in 2 s? Reveal answer up down \[Q = I \times t\] \[I = \frac{Q}{T}\] \[I = \frac{10}{2}\] \[I = 5 \: A\]"

President Hints At Daughter Going On 'Dates',"First lady Michelle Obama speaks with her daughter Malia at the ceremonial swearing-in for President Barack Obama at the U.S. Capitol during the 57th Presidential Inauguration in Washington, Monday, Jan. 21, 2013.

It's been less than a month since the nation began speculating just how Sasha and Malia Obama's teenage milestones will play out during their father's second term. And already, the President is offering some clues.

During a stop in Georgia Thursday, where he pushed his education agenda, President Obama hinted that one of his daughters -- most likely the eldest, 14-year-old Malia -- is officially dating.

""I do have to warn the parents who are here, who still have young kids, they grow up to be, like five feet 10 inches. And even if they're still nice to you, they basically don't have a lot of time for you during the weekends,"" he told the crowd. ""They have sleepovers and dates. So all that early investment just leaves them to go away,"" he said.

A White House official declined Yahoo.com's request for comment and clarification on the president's remark, but it's safe to say that First Boyfriend watch is officially in effect.

In an interview with People magazine last month, the Obamas talked about the influence their marriage will have on their daughter's inevitable relationships with boys.

""The great thing about the girls is they've got a wonderful role model in their mom. They've seen how Michelle and I interact — not only the love but also respect that I show to their mom. So I think they have pretty high expectations about how relationships should be, and that gives me some confidence about the future,"" Obama said.

Case in point: The romantic Valentine's date the president said he and Michelle had planned last night.

""She made me promise to get back in time for our date tonight. That's important,"" Obama said during his Georgia stop, ""I've already got a gift, got the flowers,"" he went on to say.

During their father's second term, Sasha, 11, who arrived in the White House as a second-grader, moves on to middle school while Malia begins the many adventures of your average teen.

""Michelle is very good about making sure that we're creating a space for them where they can have sleepovers. They can go to the mall. They can go to the movies. They're going to homecomings at their school,"" Barack noted in an interview with radio host Ryan Seacrest last year.

But don't expect to see much about it in the media. According to White House officials, the unwritten rule guiding news coverage of the girls still stands.

In the meantime, we can only speculate on who Malia Obama's dates will be. Check out this roundup by The Atlantic's Richard Lawson for some thoughts."

Bush Presidential Center, a museum and library that contains the historic bric-a-brac of President George W. Bush's White House, is being dedicated today. In keeping with arcane traditions, all of the living presidents of these United States are in attendance to fete the occasion. Speeches have been made, songs sung, pleasantries exchanged, and now all you need to do is Google ""What time does the George W. Bush Presidential Center open on Saturday?"" to proceed with the next step in your lives.

I've not been paying very close attention to the celebration, other than to passively absorb the cable teevee coverage, which all seems to be coming straight from the lips of Dr. Pangloss to my captive ears. (A summary: Gatherings of presidents are neat-o! Look at them! They all seem to be great pals! Everyone is being so nice to President Bush. Nice things are nice!)

But scrolling around the web, I now see that I should have paid more attention, because according to The New York Times' Peter Baker, President Barack Obama faced a very ""delicate task"" at this ceremony. Which surprises me, because as near as I can tell, the George W. Bush Presidential Center is not, say, testing nuclear weapons or promising war with South Korea or threatening to destabilize an entire region. (Though I guess the day is young.)

Per Baker, here's why this library opening is actually a perilous moment for the Obama White House:

It has become an awkward ritual of the modern presidency that the current occupant of the Oval Office is called upon to deliver a generous historical judgment of the previous one. With the opening of each new presidential library, the members of the world’s most exclusive fraternity put aside partisan differences to honor the shared experience of running the nation in difficult times. The task in such moments is especially acute when, as with Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, the current and previous presidents come from opposing parties and such different sensibilities. The incumbent must hit grace notes without appearing inconsistent with past criticism or, worse, hypocritical. Sometimes a president goes through the motions, dutifully reading what aides put before him. Other times, library dedications have become bonding moments when presidents genuinely grow closer.

See, the problem facing Obama is that in key moments of his life as a politician, he has publicly assessed the Bush legacy as, you know, less than ideal. And now he has to stand in front of Bush at a big celebration and not issue a series of policy indictments. Awkward, right?

At least one person Baker has talked to thinks that the policies on which Bush and Obama agree are the thornier ones:

“He’s never going to say this,” [former Bush speechwriter Marc] Thiessen said, “but if he’s being totally honest, he would say that except for interrogations, he adopted almost the entire Bush counterterrorism policy, some of it voluntarily, some of it involuntarily, but most of it voluntarily.”

Ha, well, Thiessen is absolutely right that Obama has pretty much continued the bulk of Bush's counterterrorism policies and ""unitary executive"" outlook -- and even expanded upon them. I'm bewildered, though, as to why anyone should expect this to come up at a museum dedication. ""Yo, where my fans of targeted extrajudicial killings at? Can I get a what-what?"" doesn't seem like a sentiment Obama is likely to offer, though I suppose it would ""make news.""

And that's really the point, actually. If Baker was willing to be dead honest with his readers about the ""delicate task,"" he wouldn't couch his piece in all this gauze and mummery. He'd simply say, ""The media is going to scrutinize every detail of Obama's brief speech looking for gaffes and 'tells,' which we will then stretch into one-day stories.""

That's really what this is about. Baker's piece is basically a warning that it's up to Obama to keep this non-event from becoming a pseudo-event. Obama has to navigate this little bit of oratory without seeming insincere in his remarks, or saying anything that a pundit-necromancer can spin into a dig, or doing anything funny with his gestures. Because what Baker means to say is that reporters are lying in wait to analyze his body language and pore over his word choice to divine dire meanings in preparation for articles titled, ""Obama did not use the word 'freedom'"" or ""Obama's hip-hop library dedication did not create jobs.""

And what if Obama fails? This is the extraordinary thing, actually. Unlike every other ""delicate task"" that Obama could fail at this day or this week or this year, should Obama's Bush library speech be deemed less-than-satisfactory, the result will be a hot sack of nothing at all. No one's lives will be affected by anything that happens at this library today. There aren't merely low stakes, there are no stakes.

I don't know why it's so hard to just admit this. Anyone who really thinks that this library opening is some sort of perilous moment for any of the attendees or speakers needs to get out more.

USA TODAY

President Obama met with congressional leaders Wednesday

The meeting came on the second day of a government shutdown

Obama also discussed debt ceiling and the government shutdown with a group of CEOs

WASHINGTON — President Obama told congressional Republicans on Wednesday he will not negotiate major budget issues until the government is re-opened and the debt ceiling is increased.

""The president remains hopeful that common sense will prevail, and that Congress will not only do its job to reopen the government, but also act to pay the bills it has racked up and spare the nation from a devastating default,"" said a White House statement.

The statement came shortly after Obama met with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders for 70 minutes at the White House.

Obama, who earlier in the day said he was ""exasperated"" by the shutdown, ""made clear to the leaders that he is not going to negotiate over the need for Congress to act to reopen the government or to raise the debt limit to pay the bills Congress has already incurred,"" said the White House.

Republicans criticized Obama's refusal to negotiate in the short term.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who again called for a one-year delay of aspects of the new health care plan as part of a new spending plan, told reporters at the White House, ""all we're asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., described the meeting with Obama as ""cordial, but unproductive.""

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who also met with Obama, echoed the president by saying that his chamber will negotiate with House Republicans on health care and other issues as soon as they vote to re-open the government.

Boehner ""cannot take yes for an answer,"" Reid told reporters at the White House.

Earlier in the day, Obama blamed Republicans for shutting down the government, and trying to ""extort"" a delay and defunding of the health care plan.

""Absolutely, I'm exasperated, because this is entirely unnecessary,"" Obama told CNBC in an interview.

As some GOP members seek to delay or de-fund the health care law as part of a budget deal, Obama told CNBC that an ""extremist wing"" of one party should not be allowed to ""extort"" concessions in way that delays funding for much of the government.

During the meeting with congressional leaders, Obama again asked House Republicans to pass a new spending plan without any restrictions on the new health care law.

Boehner repeated his call for a one-year delay of some provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

Despite the differences, members of both parties called the White House meeting valuable. Boehner called it ""polite,"" while House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said it was ""worthwhile.""

In a statement, McConnell said, ""while I appreciated the opportunity to speak directly with the President about this pressing issue, I was disappointed that he had little interest in negotiating a solution or in encouraging Senate Democrats to agree to the House request for a conference.""

The partial shutdown of the government began at midnight Monday, when the Republican-run House and Democratic-run Senate failed to agree on a new spending plan.

The House has passed several versions of a spending bill that includes a delay in the health care law; Obama and Senate Democrats say that is unacceptable.

Republicans have called for a House-Senate conference committee to resolve the impasse. Democrats have refused, saying the GOP is trying to use the budget process to gut the new health care law.

Obama told congressional leaders that the House should vote on a ""clean"" spending plan with no new health care provisions, the White House said, and he predicted that such a bill ""would pass a majority of the House with bipartisan support.""

The White House statement said that ""the House could act today to reopen the government and stop the harm this shutdown is causing to the economy and families across the country."" It also said Obama ""is glad that the leaders were able to engage in this useful discussion this evening.""

The White House meeting also previewed another looming showdown over the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling, which the Treasury Department says it will hit on Oct. 17.

Without an increase in the debt ceiling, Obama has said the government will be unable to borrow money to repay its obligations, creating a default that will harm the economy worldwide. He also said he will not negotiate with the Republicans over the need to raise the debt ceiling.

In his CNBC interview, Obama said that ""when you have a situation in which a faction is willing to potentially default on U.S. government obligations, then we are in trouble.""

The president also said that Wall Street should be concerned about both the shutdown and the prospect of a default.

Earlier in the day, Obama discussed both the debt ceiling and the government shutdown in a mid-day meeting with the Financial Services Forum, a group of CEOs.

Afterward that meeting, Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO of the Goldman Sachs Group, said it's fine for lawmakers to ""litigate"" political issues, but the debt ceiling should not be used a ""cudgel"" to seek concessions.

Failure to pay the nation's bills — default — would roil financial markets worldwide, and damage economic recovery in the United States, Blankfein said.

""There's a precedent for a government shutdown,"" Blankfein said. ""There's no precedent for a default."""

The Eisenhauer (German for “iron hewer”) family migrated from Germany. The Eisenhower family settled in York, Pennsylvania, in 1730, and in the 1880s they moved to Kansas. At some point the German name Eisenhauer was changed to a more American spelling of Eisenhower. Dwight’s father, David Jacob Eisenhower, was a college educated engineer. Eisenhower’s mother, Ida Elizabeth Stover, born in Virginia of German Lutheran ancestry, moved to Kansas from Virginia. She met David Eisenhower when they were both attending college, and they married in September 1885. David owned a general store in Hope, Kansas, but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished. The Eisenhowers then lived in Texas from 1889 until 1892, and later returned to Kansas, with $24 to their name. David worked as a mechanic with a railroad and then with a creamery. By 1898, the family was self-sustaining with suitable accommodations for their large family, and set about on doing just that. Eisenhower was born on October 14, 1890, the third of seven boys. All of the boys were called “Ike”, such as “Big Ike” (Edgar) and “Little Ike” (Dwight); the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name. As a child, Dwight was involved in an accident that cost his younger brother an eye; he later referred to this as an experience teaching him the need to be protective of those under him. Dwight attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909. He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college, though they lacked the funds. They agreed to take alternate years at college while the other worked, in order to earn the tuitions. Edgar went to college first while Dwight was worked as a night supervisor at a creamery. At the end of the year Edgar pleaded for a second year in college as he was enjoying it so much, and Dwight deferred to his brother and continued working. During that second year a friend was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school, since no tuition was required. Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S. Senator, Joseph L. Bristow. Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition, he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy. He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911. At West Point Dwight as at best an average student, and graduated in the middle of the class of 1915. Dwight was first stationed in Texas, and it was there that me met and fell in love with Mamie Geneva Doud, his beloved “Mamie”. He proposed to her on Valentine’s Day in 1916, and they were married on July 1 of that year, and remained married for the next 53 years, until Dwight’s death in 1969. Dwight had a very successful military career, continually promoted to higher and higher positions. In December 1943, President Roosevelt appointed Eisenhower Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Eisenhower planned and led the famous D-Day Invasion of Normandy, and the subsequent operations that led to the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany less than one year later.

General Eisenhower was immensely popular for his successes in WWII, and As the 1948 election approached, Eisenhower was repeatedly urged by both the Democrats and Republicans to run for president. President Truman even offering to serve as his Vice-President if he would agree to run as president on the Democratic ticket. Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time. He firmly declined all the offers and many believed he was foregoing his only opportunity to be president – Thomas E. Dewey was considered the probable winner, would presumably serve two terms, and Eisenhower, at age 66 in 1956, would then be too old. Despite a certain Chicago newspaper headline proclaiming otherwise, Truman defeated Dewy. In 1951 President Truman again pressed Eisenhower to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disdain for the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A “Draft Eisenhower” movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert Taft, who he narrowly defeated for the Republican nomination. Eisenhower ran a strong campaign and defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in a landslide, the first Republican elected President in 20 years. He also managed to bring with a Republican majority in Congress, also the first time in 20 years. Eisenhower’s campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, “I Like Ike”.



Eisenhower was reelected in 1956, defeating Stevenson a second time, in an even greater landslide. Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of a moderate, progressive Republicanism: He said: “I have just one purpose … and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country. If the right wing wants a fight, they are going to get it … before I end up, either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I won’t be with them anymore.” He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation and expanded Social Security programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. While President Truman had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948, actual implementation had been slow. Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union message in February 1953, saying “I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces“. When he encountered opposition from the services, he used government control of military spending to force the change through. The day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education, that segregated schools were unconstitutional, Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children. He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 and signed those acts into law. The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights. In 1957, the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision. Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order. When Faubus balked, the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division. They escorted and protected nine black students’ entry to Little Rock Central High School, an all-white public school, for the first time since the Reconstruction era.



We baby boomers look back at the Eisenhower years as a period of peace and prosperity, with strong economic growth and an ever increasing middle class. It was the time when television took it’s place in the American home, and families would gather round to watch shows like Leave it to Beaver, Ozzie and Harriet, The Honeymooners and I Love Lucy. It was Eisenhower who nominated Earl Warren as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, leading the “Warren Court” to make so many decisions that led to much greater equality and justice in our country: Brown v. Board of Education, that banned racial segregation of public schools. Gideon v. Wainwright, which that all criminal defendants receive publicly funded defense counsel if they could not afford one themselves. Miranda v. Arizona, which led to the “Miranda Warning”, that everyone charged with a crime must be advised of his rights to remain silent until he has been advised by an attorney. And two of Eisenhower’s greatest legislative achievements still foster and promote economic growth today. In cooperation with Canada, we built the St. Lawrence Seaway, a series of canals and channels that connected all the Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River, opening up ports deep in our Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean. And it was Eisenhower who pushed through and signed the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956. He managed to overcome opposition claiming the project was “too expensive” and that we “couldn’t afford it” (sound familiar?) by promoting it as essential to American security during the Cold War. It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war, hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers. But he also believed an interstate highway system would lead to greater economic growth, and he was right.

Although known for, and probably elected President, as a great military leader, Eisenhower knew first hand the horrors of war and deftly kept us out of war. And it was Dwight Eisenhower who first warned us of the dangers of the Military-Industrial Complex:

“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.""

On Fox News Sunday this morning former Senator and Republican Presidential Candidate Bob Dole said that he didn’t think he could make it in today’s Republican Party, and he didn’t think Ronald Reagan or Richard Nixon could either. I thinks he’s right, and would certainly add Dwight D. Eisenhower to the list. Dwight D. Eisenhower was a thoughtful man, a decent man, a man of principle, a man committed to doing what was right - right for the country, right for it's people, not what's just best for his own political party. And people like that need not apply to today's Republican Party.

But, I'll leave it at that. Memorial Day should not be a day for partisan politics. It is a day to honor people like Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Greatest Generation would saved us from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. It is day to honor the millions of brave men and women who serve and served with honor, distinction, and bravery wearing the uniform of our great nation. All gave some, and some gave all. God bless them, God bless their families. And may God bless every one else in this world, bless them and get them to see that war and violence should have no place in this world. More than enough have died, more than enough have suffered."

(CNN) – It seemed like White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was waiting for the question when he was asked Thursday about Jay-Z's newest rap, which focuses on his U.S. government-approved trip to Cuba with wife Beyonce last week.

In the rap, Jay-Z suggested their clearance came from the White House, when it actually came from the Treasury Department.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""I turned Havana into Atlanta… Boy from the 'hood, I got White House clearance. ..Obama said 'chill you gonna get me impeached.' (But) you don't need this – expletive – anyway. Chill with me on the beach,"" the lyrics stated.

In one of the most bizarre exchanges in the White House press briefing room, a reporter read the lyrics to Carney, asking about the White House approval. And Carney, without missing a beat, hit back.

""I guess nothing rhymes with Treasury,"" he said.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew was nominated by President Barack Obama earlier year and subsequently confirmed by the Senate.

(Actually, secretary kind of rhymes with treasury.)

Pressed further on whether the president had a conversation with Jay-Z, Carney shot down the speculation.

""I am absolutely saying that the White House and the president on down had nothing to do with anybody's personal, anybody's travel to Cuba,"" he said. ""That is something the Treasury handles.""

Due to the U.S. government's travel embargo with Cuba, Americans are prohibited from visiting the communist country for tourism. U.S. citizens can apply for licenses to go anyway, provided they show substantial proof they intend to visit for specific reasons, such as for business or education. And they must also provide a detailed itinerary.

After two members of Congress called for an investigation of the power couple's controversial trip and explanation of the type of travel license issued, the Treasury Department responded in a letter, giving more details about the licenses.

""It is our understanding that the travelers in question traveled to Cuba pursuant to an educational exchange trip organized by a group authorized by OFAC [the Office of Foreign Assets Control] to sponsor and organize programs to promote people-to-people contact in Cuba,"" the letter read.

Joe Scarborough joined Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC after Obama's speech on Wednesday. He criticized Republicans for being what he said was out of touch with Americans, an assertion he has made before, as well as the NRA.

He laid out what he saw as the GOP's two choices in the House of Representatives. ""They can either pass a comprehensive gun control package right now and shape it under Speaker Boehner, or they can wait two years when they lose the majority and have Nancy Pelosi write that bill,"" Scarborough said. ""There are no other choices.""

He went on to hammer Republicans for living in an ""echo chamber"" for the past year. Scarborough issued the same warning to his party immediately after the Newtown shooting. In December, he said ""we will lose"" if Republicans continued to defend Glocks and Bushmasters."

USA TODAY

The photographer who took the viral picture of President Obama's ""selfie"" with two other world leaders says Michelle Obama's expression has been distorted.

The AFP picture — shot Tuesday at Nelson Mandela's memorial service — shows Obama posing with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt, and Mrs. Obama off to the side with a disapproving look.

But, as AFP's Roberto Schmidt pointed out in a blog, ""photos can lie.""

Writes Schmidt: ""In reality, just a few seconds earlier the first lady was herself joking with those around her, Cameron and Schmidt included. Her stern look was captured by chance.""

Schmidt also discloses that Thorning Schmidt, the Danish prime minister, produced the smartphone in which the selfie is now presumably stored.

The photographer describes the incident, which occurred just after Obama's eulogy for Mandela:

""So Obama took his place amid these leaders who'd gathered from all corners of the globe. Among them was British Prime Minister David Cameron, as well as a woman who I wasn't able to immediately identify.

""I later learned it was the Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt. I'm a German-Colombian based in India, so I don't feel too bad I didn't recognize her! At the time, I thought it must have been one of Obama's many staffers.

""Anyway, suddenly this woman pulled out her mobile phone and took a photo of herself smiling with Cameron and the U.S. president. I captured the scene reflexively.""

Schmidt also pointed out that this was a memorial service, not a funeral: ""All around me in the stadium, South Africans were dancing, singing and laughing to honor their departed leader. It was more like a carnival atmosphere, not at all morbid. The ceremony had already gone on for two hours and would last another two. The atmosphere was totally relaxed -- I didn't see anything shocking in my viewfinder, president of the U.S. or not.""

The photographer also bemoans the viral attention — and criticism — the selfie has received:

""I took these photos totally spontaneously, without thinking about what impact they might have. At the time, I thought the world leaders were simply acting like human beings, like me and you.

""I doubt anyone could have remained totally stony faced for the duration of the ceremony, while tens of thousands of people were celebrating in the stadium. For me, the behavior of these leaders in snapping a selfie seems perfectly natural. I see nothing to complain about, and probably would have done the same in their place.""

He also said: ""I confess too that it makes me a little sad we are so obsessed with day-to-day trivialities, instead of things of true importance."""

For real. The Washingtonian has the scoop, reporting on Thursday that a Vogue crew was seen setting up camp in the White House residence, a.k.a. where President and Michelle Obama live. The Washingtonian also ""hears"" that photographer Annie Leibovitz is doing the honors, and that it might be for the March issue's cover.

Another tantalizing tidbit: President Obama's schedule is cleared for the day... meaning maybe he's involved in the shoot, too? Squeee!

The Washingtonian couldn't get a word out of Vogue reps, so no confirmation yet. But clearly the Obamas aren't opposed to posing for Vogue: Michelle Obama famously posed for the March 2009 cover with bare arms (!). The Obama family has also been snapped by Annie Leibovitz before for their official family portait in 2009, which was super adorable.

Will this upcoming Vogue shoot be a group photo with the kids? A loving couple portrait with the President and First Lady? A solo glam shot with Michelle alone? We're on the edge of our seats, waiting to find out...

UPDATE: Mark Knoller, CBS News' White House Correspondent, confirmed Vogue's presence in the White House today and also tweeted: ""Vogue also had a representative on the press plane to and from Las Vegas Tuesday."" See Michelle Obama's fashion!

The lead negotiators -- Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., and House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- detailed the specifics of the proposal at an evening press conference.

“I’m proud of this agreement,” Ryan said. “It reduces the deficit—without raising taxes. And it cuts spending in a smarter way. It’s a firm step in the right direction, and I ask all my colleagues in the House to support it.”

But the measure could face a tough climb, particularly in the House which is expected to take up the bill first. Ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, fiscal conservatives raised alarm that lawmakers were proposing to roll back sequester cuts.

The proposal would restore about $63 billion in funding that had been cut by the so-called sequester. Officials said the increases would be offset by a variety of spending reductions and increased fees elsewhere in the budget totaling about $85 billion over a decade, leaving enough for a largely symbolic deficit cut of $23 billion over the next decade.

However, fiscal conservatives warned that lawmakers were simply trading increased spending now for “promises” of cuts sometime in the future.

While Ryan predicted that conservatives would support the bill and GOP leaders praised the negotiators, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., came out against it.

“In the short run, this budget also cancels earlier spending reductions, instead of making some tough decisions about how to tackle our long-term fiscal challenges caused by runaway Washington spending,” he said.

President Obama praised the deal for replacing parts of the sequester cuts, which he said ""have harmed students, seniors, and middle-class families and served as a mindless drag on our economy over the last year.""

Calling the deal ""balanced,"" Obama said he also is pleased Congress was able to break the cycle of crisis-driven decision-making to reach a compromise.

""And because it's the first budget that leaders of both parties have agreed to in a few years, the American people should not have to endure the pain of another government shutdown for the next two years,"" he said.

The deal sets discretionary spending levels at just over $1 trillion, which is higher than the hard-fought level of $967 billion set in a 2011 budget pact.

One senior House Republican source predicted to Fox News that the party would have the votes to pass the deal, though they speculated the GOP may lose a “healthy chunk” on their side.

Both Murray and Ryan expressed confidence the deal would pass as well, and called upon their colleagues to do so.

“I'm confident we won't have 100 percent of the Senate or the House,” Murray said. “But I want people to know this Congress can work.”

The hesitation, and opposition, on both sides, though, indicates that congressional leaders still have a lot of convincing to do. Congress has until Jan. 15 to pass a new budget or they will trigger another partial government shutdown.

House Speaker John Boehner claimed Tuesday he was ""optimistic"" about the chances a deal would materialize, but the speaker may be reluctant to once again try to pass a bill that a majority of Republican members do not support. He resorted to passing a budget bill with a majority of Democrats in October, in order to end the partial shutdown.

The automatic cuts are the consequence of Washington's failure to follow up a 2011 budget pact with further deficit cuts. They would carve $91 billion from the day-to-day budgets of the Pentagon and domestic agencies when compared with sending limits set by the hard-fought 2011 budget agreement.

Tribune Purchase,"The recent plunge in ratings, readership, revenue, and credibility doesn’t frighten the media — but the idea of diversity-of-thought sure does. With the news breaking Monday that the Koch Brothers might be interested in purchasing the Tribune Co., the media campaign to stop that potential sale has already begun.

Media writer Jim Romenesko is currently offering anonymity to Tribune Co. “journalists” willing to comment on the news. As expected, in-between a bunch of nonsense about how important objectivity is in media, they’re obviously seething over the idea of working for the dreaded Brothers Koch:

To survive so much (and to have done some pretty damn amazing work in the process) it’s extremely disheartening to know serious bids are being entertained to sell to the Kochs.

Murdoch, for all his flaws, is a newspaper man. The Kochs are not. I have no faith in their belief in the importance of a free and robust watchdog press. Frankly, such a press seems antithetical to their goals and harmful to their influence in the political process.

Another:

The news is a bit terrifying given the idea that the Koch bros. pitched “media” as the third prong of a strategy to push their political and social ideals onto a wider audience.

It is pretty obvious that this will be The Narrative the media-collective as a whole will start to spin (Politico’s Dylan Byers is already tweeting it out) in the hopes of quashing any potential sale. What we’re talking about is a campaign of peer pressure within the provincial media to pressure the Tribune Co. to reject the Kochs’ offer (if there is one).

Naturally, this campaign will be disguised in the lofty ideal of “objective journalism,” which has been the media’s Big Lie for decades. But the real goal will be to bully one of their own into protecting the media’s ideological purity.

The most laughable concern is that of non-newspaper men purchasing newspapers. In today’s multi-national world, people without a background in media are going to end up as owners or part owners of media outlets. Furthermore, the Kochs probably own all kinds of successful businesses they lack a personal background in. But they are billionaires because they have hired the right people to run them.

This happens every day in business at this level. And shouldn’t “journalists” have at least a basic understanding of this reality?

Instead presenter Jack Nicholson cut to First Lady Michelle Obama, featured on a drop-down screen, flanked by military servicemen and women, to deliver a passionate monologue live from the White House.

""(These films) taught us that love can beat all odds,"" Obama said of the nominees. ""They reminded us that we can overcome any obstacle if we dig deep enough and fight hard enough and find the courage within ourselves.""

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the FLOTUS appearance was the work of Obama supporter and friend Harvey Weinstein and his daughter Lilly, who arranged for Academy representatives and show producers to secretly fly (via Disney's jet) to D.C. just two weeks ago to make the magic happen.

And let's not forget that last month former President Bill Clinton made an unexpected cameo and drew a standing ovation at the Golden Globes when he presented ""Lincoln."" That guest list addition was rumored to have been a last-minute favor pulled by director Steven Spielberg, one of the entertainment industry's most dedicated Democratic donors.

So not to be outdone, the Academy went for a one-up: a reigning White House resident.

""I was hallucinating at that point,"" Ben Affleck said backstage with regards Obama's presentation of the Best Picture Oscar to his film ""Argo."" ""I was asking people, 'was that Michelle Obama?' It was a huge honor, and the fact she was surrounded by servicemen and women. It was very cool.""

However, instead of inspiring, the surprising presenter instantly drew a few head shakes and loud groans from journalists backstage.

""This makes no sense, it adds nothing to the show,"" one industry expert told FOX411's Pop Tarts column with a bemused laugh, while another surmised it as something of a ""suck job.""

""They threw all the campaign parties, I guess it was Hollywood's way of acknowledging their continued love and support of the Obamas,"" said another. ""It was stupid and pointless.""

Indeed FLOTUS' presentation drew mixed reviews and ignited quite the debate in the twitterverse.

""Forget separation of church and state - we need a separation of Hollywood and state,"" conservative journalist Michelle Malkin retweeted, while others weighed in that it was ""tacky and tasteless"" and cheapened the Presidency.

Scores of other viewers gave Obama rave reviews, however, calling her appearance ""amazing,"" ""show stealing"" and placing her and her designer Naeem Khan gown at the top of the Oscars best dressed list."

Ms. Palin, the former Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential candidate, has returned to Fox News as a paid contributor, Roger Ailes, the channel’s chairman, announced on Thursday afternoon. Her first appearance will come Monday on “Fox and Friends,” the channel’s conservative morning show.

The announcement came about five months after Ms. Palin’s contract with Fox News expired. That contract, signed barely a year after Ms. Palin’s unsuccessful 2008 bid for vice president, was said to be worth $1 million a year, making her the highest-paid pundit at the channel.

Her new contract is almost certainly less costly for Fox, since Ms. Palin does not have the star power she once did. (Fox’s news release on Thursday noted that in 2010, the year she joined Fox the first time, Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world.)"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/food-stamp-cuts_n_3957509.html,2013-09-19 00:00:00,"['Senior Reporter', 'Senior Congressional Reporter']",House Votes To Cut Food Stamps By $40 Billion,"WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives on Thursday approved sweeping reforms to the nation's food stamp program that would cut some $40 billion in nutrition aid over 10 years and deny benefits to millions starting in 2014.

By 217 to 210, the House said yes to the measure, with its Republican backers arguing it would help more people find jobs.

""This bill is designed to give people a hand when they need it most. Most people don't choose to be on food stamps. Most people want a job,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) ""Most people want to go out and be productive so that they can earn a living, so that they can support a family, so that they can have hope for a more prosperous future. They want what we want.""

While most proponents of the bill similarly argued that they were just promoting work, there was also an undercurrent of accusation that many Americans are abusing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to sponge off taxpayers.

""If you're a healthy adult and don't have someone relying on you to care for them, you ought to earn the benefits you receive,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). ""Look for work. Start job training to improve your skills or do community service. But you can no longer sit on your couch or ride a surfboard like Jason in California and expect the federal taxpayer to feed you.""

That would be Jason Greenslate, the California food stamp recipient who likes to surf and play rock music but not look for work. Fox News profiled him last month in a segment that said America has been on an epic ""food stamp binge."" The network made sure everyone in Congress saw the segment.

The House vote sets up a showdown with the Democratic-controlled Senate, which previously approved a much more modest reduction in food stamp spending as part of a broader bill that included agricultural subsidies. A traditional ""farm bill"" likewise combining the two issues failed in the House during the summer, at which point House Republicans set nutrition aside and passed a bill with just the agribusiness subsidies.

House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) almost seemed desperate to get the measure passed, noting that it was only part of the process of passing the normally noncontroversial farm bill.

""I admit to you, this has been an unusual process. But it remains my goal to get a five-year farm bill enacted. I'm doing everything possible to make sure that happens this year,"" Lucas said, emphasizing the ""everything.""

Before the earlier attempt to pass a farm bill failed, Lucas had worked hard to accommodate conservatives by allowing an amendment that made the food stamp provisions harsher. Nearly all of them voted against the bill anyway, and the amendment cost Democratic supporters.

""We have a responsibility to get this done, and quite simply, and I repeat, quite simply, it shouldn't be this hard to pass a bill that ensures all of us in this economy has enough to eat,"" Lucas said. ""And that's what a farm bill does.""

Members from each chamber will have to reconcile the differences between their separate pieces of legislation in a conference committee this fall. The White House has repeatedly said it would veto the House GOP's food stamp demands.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the House legislation would deny benefits to 3.8 million Americans next year and save $39 billion over 10 years, or roughly 5 percent of the SNAP program's cost in that time. Enrollment doubled to 47 million in the wake of the Great Recession as incomes plummeted and more Americans qualified for benefits, which average $133 per month. Most beneficiaries are children, elderly or disabled.

The bill is packed with changes to SNAP: It would require more beneficiaries to pass income and asset tests to prove their poverty. It would allow states to require drug tests. It would allow states to deny benefits to able-bodied adults who don't work or enroll in training for at least 20 hours per week.

""Work is not a penalty,"" Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) said, citing the Book of Genesis. ""Work is a blessing.""

Regardless of what President Obama ultimately signs into law, benefits will drop for all SNAP beneficiaries in November after the expiration of a 13 percent benefits increase that had been granted by the 2009 stimulus bill.

Democrats called the House measure a useless assault on the poor.

""Today's exercise is nothing more than a waste of our time and an insult to every American in need,"" said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio). ""The fact that we are considering this legislation makes me question whether the Republican leadership even wants a farm bill.""

She added that the bill ""guts nutrition for those most in need and says to the poor, to hungry children, to the disabled, seniors and our veterans, 'You don't matter, you are not worthy of our help.' They deserve better.""

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) asked Lucas if he would try to spare veterans from the cuts in the probable conference committee, saying they deserve special support ""in these economic times."" Lucas argued that veterans were already protected.

However, a recent Huffington Post review of military records found military families rely on more than $100 million in food stamps a year. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated that 170,000 veterans would feel the pinch from the bill."

Despite efforts by RNC spokesperson Sean Spicer to walk those comments back, local conservative grassroots leaders–almost all of whom have been working hard for over four years with no compensation–remain unimpressed.

Ben Cunningham, founder of the Nashville Tea Party and one of the leaders of the decade earlier Tennessee Tax Revolt, told Breitbart News that “we are not about to be led by a bunch of timid Washington, D.C. Brahmins who are interested in making a buck off of people they see as naive. Either join us in the fight or get the hell out of the way.”

Cunningham added that “the problem for Washington, D.C.-based Republican consultants is they have become almost completely detached from the passion and purpose of the grassroots. To the grassroots Tea Party activist,” Cunningham continued, “the future of the country is at stake and they immediately distrust ‘consultants’ who feel uneasy about manifesting their passion and fighting for the cause. Tea Party activists have been demonized and vilified and called every name in the book by liberals for four years and it has only made us stronger and more determined than ever.”

Zan Green, founder of the Rainy Day Patriots, a local tea party in Birmingham, Alabama organized in February 2009, echoed Cunningham’s sentiments. “The RNC is welcome to join ‘We The People’ in our self funded, personal-time-spent efforts to restore our republic. We could use some team players and there is always room for more boots on the ground.”

Eric Olsen, co-founder of the 5,000 member Montana Shrugged Teaparty Patriots of Billings, Montana, told Breitbart News that “I take exception to all the reports coming from the Republican old guard. They do not realize it, but they are losing their base with such remarks.”

According to Olsen “the GOP should totally embrace the teaparty/grassroots followers as it is to their best interest. But they lack the political will to do so. Instead they demean the success of the movement. They purposely went out of their way last election cycle to disenfranchise the tea party, libertarian and Ron Paul supporters. We all know what happened then. They lost crucial elections across the nation while successful teaparty backed candidates like Ted Cruz won handily.”

Olsen called the RNC Autopsy report “a joke,” and added that “it shows the willingness of the old guard GOP to throw their platform under the bus giving in to the pressure from the extreme left.”

“Passion for America,” Olsen concluded, “is the only force that will resurrect real hope and change for the United States.”"

Detroit Free Press

In March%2C Kwame Kilpatrick was convicted on 24 of 30 counts of extortion%2C racketeering%2C bribery

Under sentencing guidelines%2C former mayor could have faced up to life in prison

Prosecutors had argued he deserved stiff sentence because he never thought he did anything wrong

DETROIT — Seven months after the historic conviction of Detroit's former mayor on wide-ranging public corruption charges, Kwame Kilpatrick was sentenced Thursday to 28 years in prison for running what the government called a money-making racket out of City Hall.

Kilpatrick had steered millions to himself, family and friends while an impoverished Detroit hobbled along, prosecutors said.

""The government has asked for a sentence of 28 years,"" U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds said. ""I believe that is in fact what his sentence should be."" The defense had requested a 15-year sentence.

Kilpatrick, 43, was found guilty March 11 on 24 of 30 counts of corruption, including five counts of extortion, racketeering, bribery and several mail, wire and tax fraud charges. On three counts he was found not guilty, and on the remaining three no verdict was reached.

In this case, the overarching issue is that public officials are responsible to the citizenry, Edmunds said.

""One thing is certain,"" she said. ""It was the citizens of Detroit who suffered.""

Edmunds said Kilpatrick took bribes, misused nonprofit funds and ""used his power as mayor ... to steer an astounding amount of business"" to his friend and co-defendant, Bobby Ferguson, who also was convicted on charges of running a racket out of the mayor's office.

Text messages and witnesses bolstered allegations that Kilpatrick's relationship with Ferguson — whom the government has called the key player in the pair's extortion scheme — was at the heart of the criminal activity. Federal prosecutors are seeking a maximum 28-year prison sentence for Ferguson, whose sentencing is Friday.

Edmunds said she will recommend Kilpatrick be sent to a prison in Texas, where his family lives, and told Kilpatrick that he can appeal. Restitution will be determined later, and a hearing will happen within 90 days.

The judge said Kilpatrick lived the high life, hosting lavish parties, accepting cash tributes and loading the city's payroll with friends and family.

Despite a speech in court Thursday in which the former mayor spoke in a soft voice, asked for a fair sentence and said he accepted responsibility, Edmunds said Kilpatrick largely has shown little remorse. Kilpatrick's defense team had wanted Edmunds to consider Kilpatrick's accomplishments as mayor.

""He chose to waste his talents on personal aggrandizement and enrichment,"" Edmunds said. ""We lost transparency. We lost accountability. ... That way of business is over. We're done.""

Detroit's present mayor, David Bing, echoed that sentiment.

""I'm glad that this negative chapter in Detroit's history has finally come to an end,"" he said in a statement. ""Today's sentencing sends a strong message to everyone in public office. As we move forward with Detroit's transformation, honesty, transparency, and integrity in city leadership will be paramount.""

After the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said the judge sent a powerful message: ""The people of Detroit will not tolerate this abuse of power.""

The involvement of city officials and others compounded the seriousness of Kilpatrick's crimes, Edmunds said. Thirty-four others, including Kilpatrick's father, have been convicted in this public corruption case.

Kilpatrick said in court that he respects the justice system and the jury's verdict though he disagrees with it. Kilpatrick admitted he lied about having an affair with his former chief of staff, Christine Beatty. He also said he was sorry to those he let down — including his wife, children and parents. They were not in court.

""I want the city to heal,"" he said. ""I want the city to prosper. I want the city to be great in the end. I want the city to have the same feeling it did in 2006 when the Super Bowl was here. ... Everybody felt like this was their town.""

Margaret Raben, one of Kilpatrick's lawyers, had objected earlier Thursday to a $9.6 million calculation that the federal government estimates Kilpatrick's conspiracy cost the city. That's how much the government said Ferguson made in illegal profits stemming from crooked contracts that Kilpatrick helped steer his way.

Raben argued that sources for the figure are unsubstantiated and that Kilpatrick's sentencing guidelines exceed what someone else might get for a violent crime.

After going through each of the contracts that were illegal, Edmunds took $5 million off the total, saying she would calculate the sentence based on a figure of $4.6 million. She had discretion to decide what she considered appropriate punishment, and Kilpatrick could have received as much as life in prison, according to sentencing guidelines.

Before the sentencing, Harold Gurewitz, another Kilpatrick lawyer, said the sentence that the government advocated — 28 years in prison at a minimum — ""goes beyond what's necessary.""

He said publicity in the case has made Kilpatrick a scapegoat for the past 50 years of the city's sins.

Gurewitz highlighted other cases where public officials got lesser sentences, including former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was sentenced to serve 14 years in prison on corruption convictions in 2011.

Speaking Thursday in court, Kilpatrick said all he ever wanted to be was Detroit's mayor. Before taking office in 2001, the Democrat had served in Michigan's House of Representatives. He is the son of former U.S. Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, D-Mich.

But months into his mayoral job, Kilpatrick said he hated it. He said managing a city ""is the hardest thing you can imagine."" Yet he ran for a second term, resigning only when he was forced to, on Sept. 27, 2008.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Chutkow called the Kilpatrick case one of the most significant cases of public corruption in the country.

While Kilpatrick was mayor, Ferguson received more than $127 million in contracts, according to the government. Of that, at least $76 million in contracts were obtained illegally through the pair's extortion scheme, which involved elbowing competing contractors out of deals and shaking down others to cut Ferguson in on their contracts.

""He was responsible for a lot of the buildings in and around here downtown even before Mr. Kilpatrick became mayor,"" Ferguson's lawyer, Mike Rataj, said of his client. ""He employed people. They contributed to the economy. He took care of people. He fed poor people. And we hope that the judge takes all that into consideration tomorrow.""

(CNN) —

If any doubt remains that the world stands shivering in a cold moral vacuum – devoid of meaningful leadership – they are quickly fading.

The starkest example came in Washington on Tuesday, when President Barack Obama, inarguably the world’s most powerful man, stood before the press and recited a series of positions, some of them built on solid moral arguments, only to conclude that there is not much he can do to turn them into reality.

Obama explained at length why the world cannot tolerate the use of chemical weapons in Syria, why the U.S. should not keep open the prison at Guantanamo Bay, why Washington is acting foolishly with the infamous “sequester” – the blunt and unjust budget cutter. But then he went on to explain just how difficult it is to do anything to solve these problems.

The president is smart and eloquent. But leadership, especially for someone who has achieved that level of power, requires three elements: It must communicate a clear vision and a commitment to its realization; it must mobilize and inspire others into action; and it must produce results.

Proclaiming high standards only to leave them unachieved demoralizes those you might have hoped to inspire. Rather than bending the arc of history toward justice, it unleashes a chain reaction of disenchantment.

Consider the Guantanamo prison. You might have thought Obama was a candidate again when he declared, just as he did years ago on the campaign trail that America must shut down the prison. Holding prisoners without charges and trial, he said persuasively, is “contrary to who we are.” It’s not just an ethical question, it is a practical matter. “It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.”

He might have added that Guantanamo is also the world’s most expensive prison, costing about $800,000 per prisoner per year, or some $800 million each year.

Everyone knows that Congress has made it difficult to close the prison. But legal experts say the Obama administration could do much more and, in fact, “has done little to make good on [its] promise” to shut down the prison. The executive branch, as legal expert David Cole notes, has a number of options, including prosecuting detainees or declaring the transfer of some detainees to other countries is “in the national security interest” of the U.S.

Obama came to office with a mandate to restore America’s standing in the world. He went a long way in achieving that simply by not being George W. Bush, but it’s difficult to point to real successes in fulfilling his pledge to exert moral leadership.

America and the rest of the world seem frozen in place with major institutions and personalities incapable of responding to challenges.

One can argue that it is not America’s job to fix the world’s problems, to stop the killings in distant lands even if, as we now know, those killings involve horrific weapons banned by international agreements that set a limit to our inhumanity even in times of war.

I am referring to Syria, which allegedly used chemical weapons in a two-year-old civil war. Taking action to stop the use of chemical weapons is in the interest of everyone on earth, with the possible exception of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Chemical weapons can kill in more brutal ways than other instruments of death. And if they are successfully used, dictators and terrorists will make more of them. They make us all less safe.

Since this problem is not just America’s, perhaps we should leave it up to others to act. But who?

Who in the world today has the moral standing and the practical ability to take meaningful action? It would be nice if the conscience of humanity had a way to express itself and make a difference. The obvious place would be the United Nations and its Security Council. But the UNSC is hopelessly mired in power struggles. On this as in so many other issues, the power politics involving Russia, China and the U.S. stop the world from speaking out with one voice.

Obama had repeatedly drawn a “red line” on the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, warning President Bashar al-Assad that using or moving chemical stockpiles was the one thing that would “change my calculus” on that war.

The “red line” has become an object of tragicomic ridicule, especially after Tuesday’s press conference. Cartoonists in the Middle East and elsewhere are joking about Obama and his red line, depicting the Syrian dictator painting a red line right over the American president’s face.

During his press conference, the president seemed to backtrack. What initially seemed like a clear, if controversial, position suddenly became so complicated and hazy that even the Washington Post editorial board called it a “muddle.”

Eventually, the United States will have to take a stand and help Syria’s rebels, without sending American troops into its civil war. But so far, Obama’s equivocations are exposing America’s self-proclaimed place as “leader of the free world” to ridicule.

Sure, Obama faces a stubborn Congress that makes his life difficult. And Americans’ exhaustion with wars overseas undoubtedly makes him more reluctant to act, but the president’s persuasive powers can be deployed to good effect, especially since meaningful results can be achieved without the proverbial American boots on the ground.

Of course, the problems he has to deal with are difficult and often offer choices between bad and worse. But the time is right for a new display of conviction, of effectiveness, of leadership.

Detroit Free Press

International Cat Association accepted the Savannah as an official breed in 2001

The group says these cats can be trained to walk on a leash and love to play fetch

The cat had been missing from its home for about a month%3B owners called rescue group

DETROIT — A big cat roaming Detroit's northeast side is dead, according to a feral cat rescue group that had been trying to find it for days.

The body of the 25-pound, 3-year-old Savannah cat named Chum was found in a trash can on Detroit's east side Monday evening, said founder Laura Wilhelm-Bruzek of Paws for the Cause, a feral cat rescue group based in Chesterfield Township, Mich.

A neighbor shot the cat days ago, she said. The all-volunteer nonprofit rescue group and advocates for feral cats had been searching for the cat, which was not feral but a family pet, since Saturday.

""I think people can't just go around shooting things they don't understand,"" Wilhelm-Bruzek said Tuesday. ""I think we need to be a little bit more respectful of the animals and human beings around us. I'd love to see someone look into it and investigate it. But I'm not holding out a lot of hope. This whole thing from the beginning has just been a mess.""

Neighbors said they had contacted the Michigan Humane Society and Detroit Police when the cat — called a Savannah — was seen roaming the neighborhood but both declined to investigate.

Paws for a Cause got involved last week, and the cat's owners called the group Monday, Wilhelm-Bruzek said. They said the cat, which did not have a microchip, had gotten out of their home about a month ago through a window.

The rescue group heard that the cat had been shot weren't able to find the cat's body until Monday when a member was shown where the cat had been thrown away, Wilhelm-Bruzek said.

""I simply asked them for the cat's body and they said it was across the street in a garbage can,"" she said. She was walked to the garbage can, ""and the cat — whose name is Chum — was there,"" she said.

Chum's owners, who had raised the cat since it was 4 months old, were devastated.

""They were hysterical,"" Wilhelm-Bruzek said, adding that they are having the cat cremated today.

A Savannah is a hybrid between a domesticated housecat and an African serval cat, according to the International Cat Association.

Wilhelm-Bruzek said Chum, about 2 feet tall from floor to head when sitting, was an F2 Savannah, or a second-generation hybrid.

""I don't think it was the size as much as the coloration that scared people,"" Wilhelm-Bruzek said. Savannah cats have long legs and exotic spots like a small leopard or wildcat, according to the association. They were first introduced to the public in 1997, are considered an official pedigreed breed, and are sold for thousands of dollars.

Michigan Humane Society spokesman Ryan McTigue said Tuesday that the agency was unaware of the cat's status.

""That's pretty terrible,"" McTigue said when told about the cat's fate."
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-18/news/ct-met-sign-language-20100416_1_american-sign-language-silent-dinners-foreign-language,2010-04-18 00:00:00,"['Angie Leventis Lourgos', 'Tribune Reporter']",Is American Sign Language a ‘foreign’ language?,"Twenty students are holding several animated small-group discussions, but no one in this Northern Illinois University classroom utters a word.

Their fingers weave in complex patterns as they converse in American Sign Language, which the university has declared an official foreign language.

To the students, the new label is fitting: They say that American Sign Language is distinct from spoken English and that its coursework provides a new perspective akin to the cultural immersion they'd experience in French, Spanish or other traditional language classes.

""It shapes how you view the world around you,"" said Christine Theobold, a sophomore from Streamwood who is taking the most advanced sign class at NIU. ""I guess it's how you view the word ‘foreign.'""

But the practice of awarding foreign language credit for American Sign Language coursework has been fiercely debated at universities across the country. Some educators argue an indigenous language by definition can't be considered foreign. Others say a language must have literature for proper study.

The University of Michigan-Flint several years ago denied a student's request of foreign language credit for American Sign Language proficiency, but the school reversed its stance in the past year after about 14 months of debate. Students at Boston University are now able to apply American Sign Language credits in this manner, but for years some school officials were against the practice because they said it lacked the same elements of culture as other foreign language courses.

""It's not a foreign language,"" said Robert Belka, a former chair of the foreign language department at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah. Belka, who is now retired, long opposed requests for American Sign to count as a foreign language, though he said the university eventually acquiesced.

""These are people … dependent on the English language,"" he said. American Sign Language ""is not sufficient to sustain a culture.""

Silent dinners

The Pizza Hut at NIU is loud during dinnertime, but one table of two dozen students is conspicuously quiet. The patrons don't speak. They order by pointing at the menu.

This is a ""silent dinner,"" one of many extracurricular events American Sign Language students attend for additional practice. Their instructor Sara Bianco, who is deaf, said these events give students a taste of deaf culture.

Kelsey Borg, a sophomore from Maple Park, is in the beginning American Sign Language class and described her first silent dinner as a bit nerve-racking. Signing felt different in public and she became lost when more advanced students had intricate conversations, she said.

NIU has offered American Sign Language since the 1970s as part of its rehabilitation counseling program, mainly for students in that program. But lately more students from other disciplines have asked to enroll because the skill is marketable in fields like teaching and health care.

This semester, 155 students there are taking American Sign Language, about three times the enrollment in spring 2005.

Vice Provost Gip Seaver said reclassifying the discipline as a foreign language wasn't controversial at NIU, in part because it has been accepted at so many other universities.

The Illinois General Assembly in 2009 passed legislation declaring American Sign Language a fully developed language and encouraged schools to accept its coursework for foreign language credit.

Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign allowed this long before the legislation was passed.

Eastern Illinois University accepts it as long as course work includes a cultural component, said Stephen Canfield, chairman of the foreign language department there.

He notes that many foreign language departments across the country are altering their names to ""world languages"" or ""classical and modern languages.""

""The whole idea of language being foreign is kind of disappearing,"" he said.

Structure differences

""APPEAR tooth = PAIN ++BAD DENTIST GO NEED""

This is written in gloss, a transcription of American Sign Language, and essentially means, ""It seems I have a toothache; I need to go to a dentist.""

While the sentence seems convoluted to most people who can hear, it makes sense to Joe Lellman, an NIU senior from Buffalo Grove. He uses the sentence to show how different American Sign Language grammar is compared with spoken English.

Lellman is considered legally deaf, but with a hearing aid, he can hear about two-thirds as well as the average hearing person. He was taught in a deaf school until third grade, when he entered regular public school. Though he continues to think in American Sign Language, he lost many of his signing skills and is now relearning much of the language at NIU — and embracing a part of himself that was lost.

American Sign Language is the fourth-most studied language other than English at colleges across the country, according to a 2006 Modern Language Association study.

At least 150 postsecondary schools offer it for foreign language credit, said Sherman Wilcox, chair of the department of linguistics at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. He said it's no less a foreign language than Navajo, which is also indigenous to the United States. He adds that most languages around the world, including many African languages, lack a written component.

Timothy Reagan, an education professor at Central Connecticut State University, said American Sign Language has a rich tradition of poetry, history and culture that shouldn't be dismissed.

""One of the worst things you can do to a human being is to say, ‘Your language doesn't count,'"" he said.

Fire Chief Brian Cummings to step down, mayor says","Los Angeles Fire Chief Brian Cummings will retire from his position as head of the city Fire Department, according to Mayor Eric Garcetti and a department spokesman.

Cummings had struggled to restore confidence in his management of the 3,500-employee department after officials admitted last year to misstating emergency-response times, making it appear that rescuers arrived faster than they actually did.

During his campaign, Garcetti said he lacked confidence in the fire chief’s leadership and second-guessed a series of the chief’s management decisions.

“By mutual agreement, we’ve come to an understanding on a leadership change with Chief Cummings,” Garcetti said in a brief interview as he walked into City Hall on Thursday morning. “He’ll be stepping aside as chief.”

Cummings previously said he would like to remain chief until at least 2018. His retirement was confirmed by an LAFD spokesman, Battalion Chief Armando Hogan.

When he took office, Garcetti called on the city’s top department heads to reapply for their jobs and explain how they would achieve key goals. So far, he has told at least seven they will get to stay, including Gina Marie Lindsey at Los Angeles World Airports and Michael LoGrande at the Department of City Planning.

One high-level executive, Geraldine Knatz at the Port of Los Angeles, announced last week that she will retire at the end of the year.

A second-generation firefighter with more than 30 years of service with the LAFD, Cummings was appointed chief by then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in 2011. Last year he earned nearly $300,000 as the agency’s top officer, city records show.

As an assistant chief, Cummings helped devise a data-heavy, cost-cutting plan to trim LAFD resources to help cope with fiscal constraints caused by the economic downturn, a measure Garcetti supported when he was president of the City Council.

When the previous fire chief retired, Villaraigosa picked Cummings to fill the job, praising him as the “visionary architect” of the new staffing plan.

That reputation was undermined after last year’s admission of faulty response times when a task force of experts concluded that fire officials charged with managing department statistics under Cummings were poorly qualified and that previous LAFD data analysis “should not be relied upon.”

Times investigations found delays in processing 911 calls and summoning the nearest medical rescuers from other jurisdictions, as well as wide gaps in response times in different parts of the city.

Many of those problems have been blamed on the department’s often outdated technology. Members of the city Fire Commission, the county’s Civil Grand Jury and the City Council have called for a sweeping overhaul of the department’s data systems.

Expensive upgrades are already in the works, including the installation of GPS devices on rescue vehicles, the replacement of the 911 call center’s faulty dispatch database and fixes to the alarm system that alerts rescuers at the department’s 106 fire stations.

The department is also developing a new data analysis unit, modeled on a highly-touted team at the Los Angeles Police Department.

With more than 3,500 employees, the LAFD is one of the largest municipal fire departments in the United States.

In the city budget, the amount of money directed to the Fire Department is second only to the LAPD. The department spends more than $500 million a year to pay and train firefighters, maintain a fleet with hundreds of special rescue apparatus, answer 911 calls, enforce fire codes and monitor hazardous waste.

He is using Craigslist and white power message boards to entice others in the movement to take refuge in Leith, about two hours southwest of Bismarck. On one board, he detailed his vision for the community — an enclave where residents fly “racialist” banners, where they are able to import enough “responsible hard core” white nationalists to take control of the town government, where “leftist journalists or antis” who “come and try to make trouble” will face arrest.

The revelations have riveted this community and the surrounding area, drawing a range of reactions from disgust to disbelief to curiosity.

“If that man wanted to live in Leith and be a good neighbor and be decent and not push his thoughts on the people, then he could live there,” said Arlene Wells, 82, a farmer and local historian. “But to come in and want to change everything and be the big dog — no. I don’t like bulldogs.”

President Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, to 16 recipients Wednesday morning, recognizing the achievements of a diverse group of Americans ranging from Ernie Banks and Benjamin C. Bradlee to Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.

Before bestowing the medals, Obama paid tribute to each recipient, saving his comments on Clinton for last and expressing gratitude for the former president’s advice and counsel, as well as his work to help the victims of natural disasters after he left office.

The ceremony in the East Room of the White House honored “individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors,” the White House said.

Since the medal was established 50 years ago by President John F. Kennedy, “more than 500 exceptional individuals from all corners of society” have received the award, according to the White House.

“I hope we carry away from this a reminder of what JFK understood to be the essence of the American spirit,” Obama said at the end of Wednesday’s ceremony. “Some of us may be less talented, but we all have the opportunity to serve and to open people’s hearts and minds in our smaller orbits. So I hope that everybody’s been inspired as I have been, participating in being with these people here today.”

Winfrey began her career as a broadcast journalist, but she is best known for her 25 years as the host of “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” She received the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award in 2002 and a Kennedy Center Honor in 2010. Jerome Delay/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

This year’s recipients included three Americans who were recognized posthumously: Daniel K. Inouye, a Democratic senator from Hawaii who received the Medal of Honor for his service in World War II; Sally K. Ride, the first American woman astronaut to travel into space; and Bayard Rustin, an openly gay African American civil rights leader who promoted nonviolent protest alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Inouye and Ride died last year; Rustin died in 1987.

Bradlee, 92, the legendary former executive editor of The Washington Post, “oversaw coverage of the Watergate scandal, successfully challenged the federal government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers, and guided the newspaper through some of its most challenging moments,” the White House said in announcing the awards.

Banks, 82, who played for 19 years with the Chicago Cubs, was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977, his first year of eligibility. Known as “Mr. Cub,” he was widely recognized for his enthusiasm for baseball; “Let’s play two!” became his typical catchphrase before a game.

Clinton, 67, who served two terms as president, from 1993 to 2001, later “established the Clinton Foundation to improve global health, strengthen economies, promote health and wellness, and protect the environment,” the White House said.

Winfrey, 59, renowned as a broadcast journalist and actress, was recognized for her long involvement in philanthropic causes and efforts to expand opportunities for young women. She has won numerous other honors during her career, including the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2011 and a Kennedy Center Honor in 2010.

Other awardees Wednesday included Daniel Kahneman, a pioneering scholar of psychology; Richard G. Lugar, a former Republican senator from Indiana; Loretta Lynn, a country music star; Mario Molina, a chemist and environmental scientist; Arturo Sandoval, a jazz trumpeter, pianist and composer originally from Cuba; Dean Smith, head coach of the University of North Carolina basketball team from 1961 to 1997; Gloria Steinem, a renowned feminist writer, magazine founder and activist for women’s rights; Cordy Tindell “C.T.” Vivian, a civil rights leader, minister and author; and Patricia Wald, a trailblazing federal judge who later served on the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.

In honoring Kahneman, who applied cognitive psychology to economic analysis and won a Nobel Prize in economics in 2002, Obama drew laughter when he said: “Now, all of us have moments when we look back and wonder, what the heck was I thinking? I have that -- quite a bit.” He said Kahneman “basically invented the study of human decision-making,” adding: “He has also been called an expert on irrational behavior, so I’m sure that he could shed some light on Washington.”

Obama noted that Bradlee served in the Navy during World War II and fought in more than a dozen Pacific battles.

“Since joining The Washington Post 65 years ago, he transformed that newspaper into one of the finest in the world,” Obama said. “And with Ben in charge, The Post published the Pentagon Papers, revealing the true history of America’s involvement in Vietnam, exposed Watergate, unleashed a new era of investigative journalism, holding America’s leaders accountable and reminding us that our freedom as a nation rests on our freedom of the press.”

Referring to Bradlee’s trademark banker shirts, Obama remarked: “And I also indicated to Ben, he can pull off those shirts, and I can’t. He always looks so cool in them.”

Honoring Winfrey, the president noted that early in her career, “her bosses told her she should change her name to Susie.” He went on: “I have to pause here to say, I got the same advice. Oh, they didn’t say I should be named Susie, but they suggested I should change my name.”

Obama said the talk-show icon was “living proof” of her own can-do spirit, having risen “from a childhood of poverty and abuse to the pinnacle of the entertainment universe.”

Of Clinton, Obama said: “As president, he proved that with the right choices, you could grow the economy, lift people out of poverty, we could shrink our deficits and still invest in our families, our health, our schools, in science, technology. In other words, we can go further when we look out for each other.”

Since leaving office, Obama said, Clinton has “helped lead relief efforts after the Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, the Haiti earthquake. His foundation and global initiative have helped to save or improve the lives of literally hundreds of millions of people.”

Referring to Clinton’s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who headed the State Department during his first term, Obama added: “And, of course, I am most grateful for his patience during the endless travels of my secretary of state.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/01/House-GOP-members-flooded-with-slanted-immigration-debate-pamphlets-from-leadership,2013-08-01 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Pamphlet Pushing Immigration Reform Distributed to House GOP Members,"On Wednesday, House Republicans each received a pamphlet described as an “Immigration Resource Kit” for members as they head home to face constituents on the issue of immigration reform throughout the August recess.

The last page of the pamphlet, which was distributed via the Wednesday morning GOP conference meeting, included a collage of what it described as “What Conservative Groups Are Saying.” Under that header, the pamphlet includes statements from Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) president Grover Norquist, Southern Baptist Convention ethics and religious liberty commission president Dr. Russell Moore, the American Conservative Union (ACU), and the American Action Forum (AAF).

Each of these groups supports amnesty, and each has endorsed the Senate immigration bill.

Norquist, who was cited twice on the last page of the pamphlet, helped champion the “Gang of Eight” bill through the Senate. He even testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of it, for which he received glowing praise from Democrat senators like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The ACU, which is chaired by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) ally Al Cardenas, also backed the Senate bill.

AAF and its sister group American Action Network are actually part of an aggressive public pressure campaign to get the House to take up the Senate bill. Finally, Moore is a member of the George Soros front group Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) that has been advocating in favor of the Senate bill as well.

That page also quoted a months-old article from Roll Call that pointed out the Club For Growth and FreedomWorks were not going to get involved in the immigration battle, suggesting a tacit endorsement from those two conservative watchdog groups by not fighting this battle.

The page included nothing from Tea Party Patriots or the Heritage Foundation, which are both adamantly opposed to the Senate bill, nor any of the statements from the litany of conservative groups that have come out against the Gang of Eight.

When asked about whether she specifically approved the distribution of this material to all GOP members via conference on Wednesday, GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers told Breitbart News’ Kerry Picket that she had approved it because she thought it was being done on behalf of the Judiciary Committee. “Well we did distribute it at conference,” McMorris Rodgers said in an interview with Picket on Capitol Hill. “But it’s a product of the Judiciary Committee. We allowed for it to be handed out at conference.”

Breitbart News then reached out to several of the House Republican members on the committee to see if they personally endorsed the literature. Almost a full day later, not one member has returned a request for comment.

The full packet opens with a “Dear Colleague” letter from House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). “This recess packet has been put together to help you communicate to your constituents the importance of immigration reform and the House Republican plan to produce solutions that actually fix the problems that plague our immigration system,” Goodlatte wrote. “The Committee welcomes your insight and input as we move forward together on this important issue.”

The pamphlet lays out several pieces of legislation individually supported by most immigration hawks, like the SAFE Act from Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and the Legal Workforce Act from Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX). But it also touts legislative proposals that do not have broad support like the Border Security Results Act from House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX).

The packet confirms the suspicions of many critics of comprehensive immigration reform by saying the House is working on an amnesty provision: “House Republicans are currently discussing a way forward on how to provide legal status to unlawful immigrants living in our country. However, the current unlawful immigrant population is diverse, so the solutions may vary.”

“For example, while some knowingly broke our immigration laws, others were brought illegally to the U.S. as children by their parents,” the writing claims. “These children came here through no fault of their own and many of them know no other home than the United States.”

The packet does, however, say that any amnesty would need to come after border security and interior enforcement are strengthened, but does not say whether any forthcoming specific proposals would actually do that. Proponents of the Senate bill had similarly originally said legalization, or amnesty, would come after border security and interior enforcement were improved. When the Senate bill was finally introduced, that talking point changed."

Four months after taking office, President Obama approved the firing of the four-star Army general leading the war in Afghanistan. The following summer, the president sacked his replacement, Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, for making intemperate remarks to a reporter. McChrystal’s successor, Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, often disagreed with Obama on troop levels and war strategy.

It was not until Marine Gen. John R. Allen took command of the war in July 2011 that Obama found a general with whom he clicked. Allen demonstrated more flexibility on troop numbers and shifts in strategy than his predecessors. Obama’s aides, in turn, were far more willing to listen to Allen’s views on how the war needed to be waged.

Obama had wanted to give Allen, who relinquished command in Kabul this month, the military’s most prestigious overseas assignment — supreme allied commander in Europe. But on Tuesday morning, Allen announced that he planned to retire from the military because his wife is seriously ill.

The decision deprives the president of a four-star general with whom he had built a close wartime relationship and forces the White House to find a new candidate to oversee U.S. and NATO operations in Europe.

“I told General Allen that he has my deep, personal appreciation for his extraordinary service over the last 19 months in Afghanistan, as well as his decades of service in the United States Marine Corps,” the president said in a statement after meeting with the general at the White House.

In an interview Monday evening, Allen said he wants to focus on helping his wife, Kathy, cope with a combination of chronic health issues, which include an autoimmune disorder.

“Right now, I’ve just got to get her well,” Allen said. “It’s time to take care of my family.”

In Afghanistan, Allen oversaw the strategic shift from troop-

intensive counterinsurgency operations to the development of local security forces. As he orchestrated that change, he managed the removal of 33,000 U.S. troops from the country and the response to a spate of attacks on coalition personnel by members of the Afghan security forces.

Allen, who relinquished command of the war nine days ago, said his decision was not influenced by a Pentagon investigation into e-mail messages he exchanged with Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, who was involved in the scandal that prompted Petraeus to resign as CIA director last year. Allen was cleared of wrongdoing last month after investigators combed through the messages.

Although senior Defense Department officials described the content of some of the missives as racy and flirtatious, the Pentagon’s inspector general determined that Allen had not violated military prohibitions against conduct unbecoming an officer. Allen’s allies have described the investigation as overblown, arguing that his e-mails to Kelley, which included words such as “sweetheart,” reflected nothing more than friendship.

The messages were uncovered during an FBI investigation into a set of harassing e-mails Kelley had received. The bureau eventually determined that those messages had been sent by Petraeus’s biographer, Paula Broadwell, and that Petraeus and Broadwell were having an affair.

“The investigation took a toll on her,” Allen said of his wife.

He said that his wife’s condition has been deteriorating for a few years and that he thinks it would have been problematic for her to receive the necessary medical authorization from the military to travel to Belgium, where NATO is based. The couple’s two adult daughters, who have helped to care for Kathy Allen, also live in Northern Virginia.

“For a long time, I told her, ‘When you can’t bear this anymore, just tell me and I’ll drop my [resignation] letter right away,’ ” Allen said. But he said he no longer wants to place the pressure of that decision on her. “Now I need to be the one who takes this out of her hands.”

Allen, 59, was the first Marine ever selected to command a theater of war. Leading the multinational military campaign in Afghanistan was “the honor of a lifetime,” he said.

He said the strategic shift away from counterinsurgency, the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the attacks by Afghan security forces and the months-long closure of supply routes through neighboring Pakistan “tried to wrench the campaign off the tracks.”

“We managed to hold on, but it was a herculean effort,” he said.

Even so, violence in Afghanistan is higher than it was before Obama ordered a surge of U.S. forces into the country, according to the most recent Pentagon assessment. The report also stated that just one of the Afghan army’s 23 brigades is able to operate without support from the U.S. military or NATO allies, making it difficult for the Afghans to take the lead in fighting the Taliban despite U.S. efforts to hand over that responsibility.

The path to the president’s decision to withdraw 34,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan by February 2014, announced during last week’s State of the Union address, illustrates the relationship between Obama and Allen, according to senior U.S. officials familiar with the matter. Allen’s staff had recommended that no more than 25,000 troops be removed this year, an assessment the general initially supported.

But when the White House made it clear to Allen that the president wanted to remove half of the 68,000 troops now in the country, the general developed a plan to satisfy Obama: Allen recommended the withdrawal of 34,000 troops, but he also asked Obama to push the deadline back by two months — from the end of the year to February 2014, allowing his successor, Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., to avoid pulling out more than 25,000 troops by the autumn, when Taliban fighters typically begin their winter rest.

Obama concurred with Allen’s plan. That allowed both parties to get what they wanted: White House officials could say that the decision to remove 34,000 troops was in line with Allen’s recommendation, while the general could remain close to his initial withdrawal target.

Allen, a native of Warrenton, was the first Marine to serve as the commandant of midshipmen at the Naval Academy. He spent two years in Iraq’s Anbar province, where he led an effort to reach out to Sunni tribal leaders to try to persuade them to stand against al-Qaeda militants — a shift that helped turn the course of the war in western Iraq.

Allen informed Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta several weeks ago that his wife’s condition might lead him to decline the Europe nomination, but Allen said he did not come to a final decision until the past few days.

His command responsibilities and other military assignments have kept him away from home for much of the past decade. He had only a week of leave between his Iraq and Central Command jobs and only a week off before he went to Afghanistan, much of which was spent moving and preparing for his confirmation hearing. He said he and his wife have not had a vacation since their daughters were young.

“All I am seeking now is time with Kathy,” he said. “I want to be home on a regular basis.”

You Be The 13th Juror (VOTE),"PHOENIX -- For more than four months, they listened to endless hours of testimony in the case of State of Arizona v. Jodi Arias. On Friday, the lawyers and witnesses finally stopped talking, and the case was turned over to the 12 jurors.

Now it is up to those dozen men and women -- some in their 20s, others well into retirement age -- to determine Arias' level of guilt or innocence.

As to which side, defense or prosecution, did a more persuasive job, the jury may have already tipped its hand.

On days 28 and 29 of the trial, jurors submitted more than 100 questions to Arias that suggested they were skeptical of her testimony, delivered over two highly emotional weeks. Arizona is one of only three states that allow jurors to ask witnesses questions. Panel members submit their queries to the judge, who reads them to the witnesses.

In her testimony, Arias gave highly detailed descriptions of her sex life with Travis Alexander, the former boyfriend she killed. She claimed that he became increasingly demanding and abusive, and that she feared for her life. The prosecution argued that she murdered Alexander in a jealous rage.

One juror asked, ""After all the lies you have told, why should we believe you now?""

Indeed, Arias changed her story several times. At first, she vehemently denied any involvement in the death of Alexander, whose body was discovered June 9, 2008, at his Mesa, Ariz., home. Alexander had been shot in the head and stabbed 27 times. His throat had been cut from ear to ear.

When DNA proved Arias had been there, she then claimed that she and Alexander had been attacked by two masked killers in a home invasion. She said she didn't go to the police because she was still in fear of them.

It was not until years after his death that she admitted to killing Alexander in what she said was an act of self-defense.

""Lying isn't typically something I just do,"" Arias told the court. ""The lies I've told in this case can be tied directly back to either protecting Travis' reputation or my involvement in his death ... because I was very ashamed.""

The defense team has attacked Alexander's character in an attempt to show he was a sex-obsessed womanizer who masturbated to photos of little boys.

Although accusations of abuse and pedophilia can prove detrimental, the defense in this case has one problem: All such allegations came from one source -- Arias, an admitted liar who is on trial for her life.

The prosecutors seemed to have an easier time. Although they did not have a murder weapon, they did have a motive, contending Arias was consumed with jealousy, and they had Arias' confession to the slaying. For a first-degree murder charge to stick, however, jurors will have to conclude that she acted with premeditation.

The defense had to try to explain why someone acting in self-defense would stab her assailant multiple times, shoot him and cut his throat. That challenge was compounded by the fact that Arias claimed memory loss covering much of the day that Alexander was killed.

The prosecution, meanwhile, argued that she made attempts to clean up the crime scene and disposed of the handgun used in the shooting.

Other issues likely to come up in the jury room:

THE CUTS: There were cuts on Arias' fingers. She said she nicked herself at work when she broke a glass. Prosecutors alleged those lacerations came while knifing Alexander. A blood-covered knife typically becomes slippery and slides through the hand of the person wielding it, often resulting in wounds.

THE FINGER: Arias had a broken and disfigured finger. She said it happened months prior to Alexander's death and was a result of his physical abuse. Prosecutors allege she hurt herself during the killing, and that's why the injury is not visible in photos shown to the jurors that were taken after she claimed the injury occurred.

GAS CANS: Arias took two gas cans with her and purchased a third when she went on her final road trip to visit Alexander. Arias testified the cans were a precautionary measure, so she would not run out of fuel while traveling through the desert. Prosecutors said she had them so she would not have to make fuel purchases that could tie her to the area. Arias said she returned one can to Walmart and received a cash refund without a receipt. Prosecutors said the exchange never occurred and presented a Walmart employee who testified there was no record of the transaction.

THE GUN: Prior to Alexander's killing, a .25-caliber handgun was stolen from Arias' grandparents' home. Alexander was killed with a .25-caliber firearm, but Arias claimed it was Alexander's own gun, despite the lack of evidence that he had ever owned a firearm.

What is bizarre about some of Arias' claims is that they are irrelevant in the grand scheme. Once she admitted she had killed Alexander, why argue about some of these little things? In the case of her finger, Arias' version of events was an attempt to show prior domestic abuse, but it might have served her better if she had played it differently. As for the gas can, what was the point in saying she'd returned one and then being contradicted by a witness?

It is all these details that Arias has woven into her story that could ultimately be her undoing.

Although the prosecution appears to be ahead, anything is possible. Prosecutors must prove their case, after all. Many trial watchers were convinced Casey Anthony would be found guilty of murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, but the jury held otherwise.

Nothing is certain until the moment the verdict is read, and in a death penalty case such as this, it could take a jury several days to weigh each factor."

USA TODAY

BINGHAMTON, N.Y. — Just another high school soccer practice in New York state in August — except for when the president dropped in.

President Obama and his bus, en route to a town hall at Binghamton University on Friday, stopped to chat with soccer players at Tully Junior-Senior High School in Tully, N.Y.

""I was driving by and I thought, you know, I need to kick around a ball a little bit,"" said Obama, who proceeded to do just that for a few minutes.

Three teams of Black Knights spoke with the president: girls junior varsity soccer, girls varsity soccer and boys varsity soccer.

""How's it going everybody?"" Obama asked. ""How long ago did practice start?"" (8 a.m.)

""How are you guys feeling?"" he said. ""Did you practice during the summer? ... What grade are most of you in?""

Obama, who will spend Friday wrapping up a two-day bus tour of New York and Pennsylvania, cited the reason for the trip: promoting his latest education plan.

""I'm traveling around the area talking about college, making sure that young people can pay for it,"" he said. ""I'm assuming everybody here's gonna want to go to college? So part of what we want to do is make sure that whatever school you decide to go to that you can afford to do it, get grants, loans and don't end up having too much debt.""

At the prodding of a coach, one girl told Obama that meeting the president had been on her ""bucket list.""

When Obama asked the girl how old she is, she said 9.

Obama said, ""Here's the general rule: When you're 9, you don't need a bucket list. When you get to be 52, then you might start wanting to draw one up. But you've got a lotta stuff going on ahead of you.""

Obama asked the girls' teams, ""Can you beat the boys?""

Yes, came the reply.

""If I go over there and tell them you said that, would that be OK?"" Obama asked.

One of the girls replied, ""Bring it!""

While visiting the boys' team, Obama said, ""Can I just say though, I hate to stir up trouble, but the girls said they could beat you. ... I'm just saying. That's what they said.""

The boys disputed that assessment.

When Obama repeated the comment about ""bring it,"" one of the coaches said, ""That was probably my daughter.""

On his way back to the bus, Obama greeted some school administrators and parents, one of whom asked about his soccer skills.

""They were trying to recruit me!"" Obama said. ""I told them I was too old.""

He added, however, ""I've got some game."""

(CNN) – The official in charge of an embattled Internal Revenue Service division will invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a Wednesday appearance before a House oversight panel, a spokesman for the committee said.

Lois Lerner, who oversaw the IRS division handling requests for tax-exempt status, made her intentions known in a letter to the committee's chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa. Lerner was the first IRS official to publically admit that the tax agency was using extra scrutiny on conservative groups applying to become tax exempt.



""The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner's lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions,"" the committee's spokesman Ali Ahmad wrote in a statement. ""Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow's hearing - the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs.""

Lerner revealed during a question-and-answer session at a meeting of the American Bar Association a week and a half ago that the IRS was targeting conservative groups when assessing applications for tax exempt status. Later, officials at the agency said the question that prompted Lerner's response was planted as a way for the information to become public.

Her disclosure came days before the release of an independent inspector general's report, which indicated Lerner learned about the conservative targeting in June 2011. While she took steps to stop the practice, lawmakers want to know why she didn't notify members of Congress.

“While we respect Ms. Lerner’s use of the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, we are disturbed she saw fit to trample over our First Amendment rights by harassing us and many other groups for our views,” Jenny Beth Martin, the co-Founder and national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, wrote in a statement Tuesday."

Republicans have two choices: Support comprehensive immigration reform or keep losing elections. Even the Tea Party darling Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., now supports reform. The other day, he stated that deporting 11 million people is not going to happen.

Steve Silversmith

For years, politicians have been milking illegal immigration while doing nothing. They keep talking about securing the border, but they never do. I think many more Americans would be in the mood to talk about ""immigration reform"" if we knew the southern border was actually secure.

Jim Antista

It is against the law to hire illegal immigrants; both parties share the blame equally for that law not being enforced.

I think if immigrants are not criminals and want to become citizens, then there should be options open to them. They shouldn't be fast-tracked, and there shouldn't be blanket amnesty, but there should be some options.

Letters to the editor:

The U.S. is lucky to have Texas. Between New York City's attempt to ban large sizes of sugary drinks and Los Angeles County's rule against throwing a Frisbee on the beach without a lifeguard's permission, we have the common-sense advice of Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas (""Immigration enforcement key to success: Column""). His plan to reform immigration is so simple that even members of Congress can understand it.

Whether they will implement a plan that's so practical, emphasizing enforcement of existing law, is most likely beyond them.

Chuck Curtis; Dallas

Amnesty will depress the wages of U.S. workers and encourage more illegal immigration and lax policies. Strong workplace enforcement, on the other hand, will deny them the ability to make a living in the U.S., rendering it unfeasible for many to remain here. This is the real solution to illegal immigration.

James Bowen; Lawrence, Kan.

Coming to this country is difficult for many; pursuing stronger legislation that will penalize the children of illegal immigrants only makes the issue worse.

America was once considered the great melting pot, but assimilation seems to have become the standard.

We force immigrants to know English and take a citizenship test that many Americans could not pass, and penalize young illegal immigrants who are trying to work or get an education. We must realize our nation is one of immigrants.

Chụp lại hình ảnh, Bộ trưởng Ali Haidar hoan nghênh thỏa thuận

Một bộ trưởng Syria gọi thỏa thuận Mỹ - Nga nhằm loại bỏ vũ khí hóa học của Syria là “thắng lợi” giúp tránh chiến tranh.

Bộ trưởng Hòa giải Dân tộc Ali Haidar nói với hãng tin Nga Ria Novosti: “Đó là thắng lợi cho Syria nhờ các người bạn Nga.”

Cùng ngày, Ngoại trưởng Mỹ John Kerry gặp Thủ tướng Israel Benjamin Netanyahu để tiết lộ chi tiết kế hoạch loại bỏ vũ khí hóa học của Syria.

Sau cuộc gặp, ông Kerry cảnh cáo Damascus: “Đe dọa dùng vũ lực là có thật.”

Syria có một trong những kho vũ khí hóa học lớn nhất thế giới, trong khi kế hoạch của Mỹ và Nga muốn loại bỏ toàn bộ kho này trước giữa năm 2014.

Thỏa thuận có được sau ba ngày họp giữa hai ngoại trưởng Mỹ và Nga ở Geneva.

Nó cho Tổng thống Syria Bashar al-Assad một tuần để nộp chi tiết về kho vũ khí.

Kế hoạch cũng yêu cầu cho phép chuyên gia kiểm soát vũ khí được vào Syria và kiểm tra 45 địa điểm trước tháng 11.

Tổng thống Mỹ Barack Obama đã hoan nghênh thỏa thuận giữa Mỹ và Nga về việc giải tỏa kho vũ khí hóa học của Syria trước thời hạn giữa năm 2014 và nói rằng đây là ‘một bước quan trọng’.

Tuy nhiên, ông cũng tỏ thái độ thận trọng rằng Mỹ mong muốn Syria ‘làm đúng theo những gì họ đã cam kết’.

Lạc quan thận trọng

Trong một tuyên bố của Nhà Trắng, Tổng thống Obama nói thỏa thuận Mỹ-Nga là một ‘bước đi quan trọng, cụ thể hướng tới mục đích đặt kho vũ khí hóa học của Syria dưới sự kiểm soát quốc tế để cuối cùng đi đến phá hủy chúng’.

Tuy nhiên, ông cũng cảnh báo rằng mặc dù Mỹ vẫn tiếp tục làm việc với Nga, Anh, Pháp và Liên Hiệp Quốc cũng như các nước khác để đảm bảo rằng quá trình tiêu hủy hay dỡ bỏ vũ khí hóa học có thể kiểm chứng được nhưng sẽ có ‘hậu quả nếu chế độ Assad không tuân thủ’.

“Nếu các biện pháp ngoại giao thất bại thì Hoa Kỳ vẫn sẵn sàng hành động,” ông nói.

Quân đội Mỹ đã xác nhận hôm thứ Bảy ngày 14/9 rằng Mỹ vẫn ở vị trí sẵn sàng tấn công vào Syria.

Trong một cuộc họp báo chung với người đồng cấp Nga Sergei Lavrov, Ngoại trưởng Mỹ John Kerry đã cảnh báo Tổng thống Syria Bashar al-Assad rằng họ chỉ có tuân thủ hoàn toàn thỏa thuận này.

Cả hai vị ngoại trưởng đều nói rằng nếu Syria bất tuân thì Liên Hiệp Quốc sẽ ra nghị quyết trong khuôn khổ chương 7 và chương 8 của Hiến chương để cho phép dùng vũ lực.

Tuy nhiên, ngoại trưởng Nga đã sốt sắng nói rõ rằng vũ lực chỉ là giải pháp cuối cùng.

“Trong những phương cách đã được thỏa thuận này không có nhắc gì đến vũ lực cũng như các biện pháp trừng phạt tự động. Bất kỳ sự vi phạm nào cần phải được chứng minh một cách thuyết phục hoàn toàn trước Hội đồng Bảo an,” ông nói.

Chụp lại hình ảnh, Mỹ và Nga đã cố gắng hết sức để giải quyết cuộc khủng hoảng Syria

Cả Nga và Mỹ đều đồng ý rằng Chính phủ sở hữu 1.000 tấn chất độc hóa học và chất tiền chế vũ khí hóa học, một quan chức Mỹ cho biết.

Mỹ tin rằng số hóa chất này được cất giữ ở 45 địa điểm và tất cả đều do chính quyền kiểm soát.

Tuy nhiên Nga được cho rằng không đồng ý với số lượng địa điểm này cũng như việc toàn bộ kho vũ khí này là do Chính phủ Syria kiểm soát.

Thỏa thuận yêu cầu các cuộc thanh sát tại chỗ ban đầu phải được hoàn tất trước tháng 11. Tất cả các phương tiện sản xuất vũ khí hóa học cũng phải được phá hủy trước thời hạn này.

Còn trong nửa đầu năm 2014 tất cả vũ khí hóa học và phương tiện sản xuất phải bị triệt tiêu hoàn toàn.

Thắng lợi của Assad?

Pháp, Nga, Liên Hiệp Quốc và Nato đều hoan nghênh thỏa thuận này.

Ngoại trưởng Pháp Laurent Fabius nói đây là ‘một tiến bộ quan trọng’ trong khi Ngoại trưởng Anh William Hague phát biểu trong một thông cáo yêu cầu chế độ Assad phải tuân thủ thỏa thuận hoàn toàn.

Tuy nhiên các phân tích gia thì lại chia rẽ về thỏa thuận này.

Ông Andrew Green, cựu đại sứ Anh tại Syria nhận định rằng mặc dù trên thực tế sẽ có nhiều khó khăn khi thực thi thỏa thuận này nhưng đây là vẫn là một tin ‘hết sức tốt lành’.

“Trước hết nó giúp tránh một hành động quân sự, ít nhất trong thời điểm hiện tại. Thứ hai nó thật sự loại bỏ khả năng chế độ Syria sử dụng vũ khí hóa học một lần nữa. Thứ ba và có lẽ quan trọng hơn, nó mở ra khả năng đối thoại và hợp tác với Nga,” ông nói.

Tuy nhiên, cựu Thứ trưởng Quốc phòng Mỹ Paul Wolfowitz cùng với các Thượng ngị sỹ John McCain và Lindsay Graham của Đảng Cộng hòa thì tỏ ra nghi ngờ về thỏa thuận.

“Cho dù thỏa thuận có đem lại điều gì đi nữa trong việc giảm nguy cơ vũ khí hóa học tiếp tục được sử dụng, rõ ràng cái giá của việc này là loại bỏ bất kỳ hành động nghiêm túc nào của Mỹ và phương Tây nhằm vào chế độ Assad. Đây là một thắng lợi lớn của ông ta và của những đồng minh Nga và Iran của ông ta,” Wolfowitz nói."

Lindsey Graham for supporting immigration reform, a GOP group came to his aid. So did the other team.

“We came up with the money,” said Frank Sharry, founder and executive director of America’s Voice, a Washington-based group with close ties to the Obama White House. “We were just frustrated that nobody was doing anything, and Graham was under attack. We said, ‘Fine, we will put money in.’”

Sharry’s group, knowing an ad sponsored by a left-leaning advocacy group could hurt Graham, donated $60,000 to Republicans for Immigration Reform, a super PAC started by President George W. Bush’s former Commerce secretary, Carlos Gutierrez, and GOP fundraiser Charlie Spies.

An unprecedented collection of political bedfellows has coalesced this year on the reform side of the immigration debate: liberal Latino organizations and Republican operatives, the Chamber of Commerce and labor unions, faith groups and high-tech companies. And as with the Sharry contribution, some left-leaning groups are financing Republican pro-immigration groups.

The result is a flood of money for advertising, lobbying and field organizing aimed at convincing Republicans in Congress to create a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, authorize more temporary work visas and increase security on the border with Mexico.

During the first half of the year, reform backers outspent opponents in advertising by more than 3 to 1: $2.4 million to $700,000, according to Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group. They also hired a battalion of lobbyists. In the second quarter, 527 businesses, advocacy groups and others reported lobbying on immigration, up from 389 in the first three months of the year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Some of that spending is about to show up in targeted campaigns in House districts. Advocates are trying to keep up the pressure when members are home during the five-week August recess — or “Action August,” as President Obama called it last month. But the biggest spending is likely to come this fall, when the House is expected to take up a series of immigration bills.

“We will see a significant ramp-up of activities in August and September,” said Tom Snyder, who runs the campaign effort for the labor giant AFL-CIO. Some Republican House members have already started to soften their opposition to reform, he said, especially in districts with tens of thousands of union members. “What you are seeing is not an avalanche but a stream starting to trickle in our direction.”

The last time Congress took up the issue, in 2007, anti-immigration groups mounted a fierce grass-roots campaign and succeeded in defining the bill as “amnesty” for lawbreakers. This time, advocates have launched a preemptive strike.

“I’ve heard it said, it could be lost in August but not won in August,” said Spies, a lawyer who formed Republicans for Immigration Reform to provide “political cover.”

The AFL-CIO has spent $418,998 to run ads in at least six states and plans to spend more than $1 million in August and September targeting 40 Republicans in the House. The Service Employees International Union started a $200,000 radio campaign aimed at Republican congressmen in 10 districts with growing Latino populations, including four Californians: Jeff Denham (Atwater), Howard P. “Buck” McKeon (Santa Clarita), Gary G. Miller (Diamond Bar) and David Valadao (Hanford).

Two moderate Republican organizations also have participated. The American Action Network spent $182,085 on television ads, and Americans for a Conservative Direction spent $105,251 for ads in six states, according to Kantar Media.

FWD.us, an advocacy group founded by Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and funded by top tech executives, announced plans last week to spend more than $500,000 on ads featuring a young Chicago man who wants to become a Marine but can’t because he came to the country illegally as a 7-month-old.

Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes boosting immigration levels, said his side was badly outgunned. The tide of corporate money has moved the debate away from the promise of the poem on the Statue of Liberty to welcome the tired, the poor and the freedom-seekers, he said.

“Now, it’s give us your industrial and farm workers who are low-wage and poorly educated, or give us the technical talent from somebody else’s economy,” Stein said.

The immigration debate has drawn attention, and money, from a vast array of businesses: notably the tech industry, which wants more H-1B visas for highly trained foreign workers, but also other industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor, including agriculture and hotels. Since March, companies and trade groups signed up 76 more lobbying firms, according to the Sunlight Foundation and the Center for Responsive Politics.

Microsoft Corp. has been among the most active. In addition to its in-house lobbying operation, the company has paid lobbyists from 15 firms this year to press the case on Capitol Hill.

Fred Humphries, vice president for government affairs, said Microsoft supported reform efforts that would increase high-tech visas because U.S. colleges do not graduate enough computer scientists. “In the U.S. today, Microsoft has approximately 3,500 research and engineering jobs we can’t fill,” he said.

The business lobby’s influence on Republican lawmakers was on vivid display this spring. In March, Utah’s Republican senators, Orrin G. Hatch and Mike Lee, urged the Senate to slow down on immigration reform. That didn’t sit well at the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce, where many members had been agitating to increase high-tech visas. At a news conference, the chamber’s president threatened to mount a recall of Hatch and Lee.

Hatch soon changed course. He became a key player in the talks that led the Senate to approve a bipartisan bill authorizing up to 180,000 high-tech visas — nearly triple the current number.

The business spending has been welcomed by immigration advocates.

“For the first time, I am seeing business actually put political muscle into this campaign. In the past, it was more like lip service,” said Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union and a key strategist for the immigration reform forces.

One congressman who has felt the squeeze is Rep. Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican elected in 2008 in the district once represented by the vociferously anti-immigration Tom Tancredo. In 2012, the district was redrawn to include Aurora, one of the most immigrant-dense cities in the state.

Among the pro-reform groups lobbying Coffman were evangelical church members, part of a grass-roots effort financed by Zuckerberg’s FWD.us, a Christian family foundation and a hedge-fund manager who is a major Republican donor.

“That has never happened before,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which was the conduit for the money. Noorani’s organization typically draws financial support from progressives.

During the Senate debate this spring, Coffman’s Colorado office was deluged with calls and petitions, said Dustin Zvonek, his district director. Ten days in a row, evangelical churchgoers held prayer vigils in the office.

Coffman endorsed comprehensive reform last month.

That decision brought him $275,000 worth of positive TV commercials from Americans for a Conservative Direction — also funded by FWD.us. “On immigration, too many members of Congress argue with each other, but our congressman, Mike Coffman, listened to us,” the ad said.

Rob Jesmer, campaign manager for FWD.us and a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said the group would run other such ads to back lawmakers who took a political risk:

“We want to be helpful to members of Congress who are willing to take a courageous leadership position.”

The Arizona Republic

Zirbel has written two self-published books on the assassination

He believes Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates in Texas were behind killing

Zirbel says public beginning to lose interest in assassination

PHOENIX -- LBJ did it.

He didn't pull the trigger, but he was in the thick of the conspiracy, according to a Scottsdale attorney who has written two books on the subject.

President John F. Kennedy was shot dead in Dallas 50 years ago Friday, and the attorney is certain that Lee Harvey Oswald's only involvement was as the fall guy.

On a recent morning, Craig Zirbel is sitting at a nondescript office in the Scottsdale Airpark, behind a desk that he says once belonged to Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin senator famous for his claims that Communists had infiltrated the government.

Zirbel has written two books on the Kennedy assassination, and, McCarthyesque government conspiracies aside, he says the public has but two choices on deciding what to believe about that November day: Either Lee Harvey Oswald, a man with no motive did it, or another theory must be devised.

A majority of people, according to polls, believe the conspiracy idea and have for a long time.

Zirbel delivers his conclusions with enthusiasm, waving his arms and raising his voice.

""I don't believe Oswald pulled the trigger,"" Zirbel says.

The attorney has been interested in the assassination for a long time.

Zirbel was in third grade when Kennedy was killed. He got a copy of the Warren Commission report on the assassination a year later, shortly after it was published. He says he did not understand much of it at the time, but he maintained his interest over the years.

The report, based on an investigation by a select government committee, concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy. That has been the official finding ever since.

But that has not stopped conspiracy theories from persisting.

Zirbel has self-published two books on the subject, ""The Texas Connection"" in 1991 and ""The Final Chapter on the Assassination of John F. Kennedy"" in 2010. The titles have been well-received by some people, criticized by others — typical of the contentious and eccentric world of Kennedy conspiracy theorists.

One of them, political strategist Roger Stone, is the author of ""The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case against LBJ,"" which came out this year.

""Craig Zirbel did some of the earliest and most important seminal work on LBJ's involvement in the murder of JFK,"" Stone said in an email. ""I have used his book, 'The Texas Connection,' with attribution. I have tried to build on the solid foundation built by Zirbel.""

Not all assassination buffs agree. It is easy to find numerous commentators who believe Zirbel misinterpreted some of the data.

The title of the book gives away Zirbel's position: that Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates in Texas were behind the assassination.

If Oswald did not pull the trigger — and Zirbel provides a list of reasons he believes he did not — then the explanation becomes more elusive.

Those who have interest in the case know the scenarios:

-- The Central Intelligence Agency, perhaps upset by changes in the agency that followed the failed Bay of Pigs invasion aimed at ousting Fidel Castro from leadership in Cuba.

-- The Mafia, arguably because of law-enforcement moves against organized crime by the Kennedy administration.

-- Anti-Castro Cuban exile groups, upset by the Bay of Pigs failure, perhaps working closely with the previous two groups.

-- Others, including the military industrial complex, a government agency such as the FBI, Southern segregationists, the Soviet Union or American conservatives.

Zirbel makes the case that Johnson, and only Johnson, had the motive, the means and the opportunity to mount a conspiracy against the president.

The motive: political gain. There were political differences, personal issues, Johnson's involvement in several scandals and his desire to become president before he got too old.

The opportunity: Kennedy's visit to LBJ's home turf in Texas. Johnson and his associates controlled many of the trip's details.

The means: shots by multiple gunmen firing from the direction of the now infamous grassy knoll. Hired perhaps by Johnson associates in the oil business, who had ties to the Mafia, Zirbel insists, there were at least two shooters.

He also emphasizes that as president, Johnson had the means to block any serious investigation.

And Oswald? His movements, his statements and his background make no sense if he was the lone gunman, Zirbel says. Even the site of the fatal shots was out of whack: Oswald would have had a much easier target several seconds earlier, as the motorcade slowed to turn twice, Zirbel notes.

It's the awkward turns, rather than the otherwise direct route the motorcade took, that strikes Zirbel.

""It's the thing that blows my mind away,"" he says. ""It's the first time a route ever was changed from what the Secret Service had established.""

The revised route took the motorcade directly past the Texas School Book Depository building and Dealey Plaza, site of the grassy knoll, from which many theorists believe the shots were fired.

Zirbel says John Connally, then Texas governor, had insisted upon the arrangement. Connally was an ally of Johnson. He, in fact, lost a fight over motorcade seating arrangements, was forced to ride with Kennedy and was wounded in the shooting.

Zirbel also points to statements by two known participants in his conspiracy: Oswald, who shouted, ""I'm a patsy!"" to nearby reporters at the Dallas jail, and Oswald's killer, Jack Ruby, who was quoted as saying, ""If you knew the truth, you'd be amazed.""

But it has been 50 years, and no conclusive evidence has emerged. Zirbel says the public is beginning to lose interest in the assassination. He says he never had interest in the ""minutae,"" and is losing interest generally.

He has begun to sell off his assassination memorabilia, including his replica of the car the president was riding in that fateful day. Media calls have slowed down, too, bumping back up only because of the significance of the anniversary.

He still wants the public to see the case for what it is.

""All I want to get out,"" he says, ""is that there was no lone assassin, and there was a conspiracy.""

He and his like-minded investigators in the field have to be gratified with their efforts, although the numbers have slipped over the last decade.

According to a recent survey from the Associated Press, conducted in mid-April, 59 percent of Americans think multiple people were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president, while 24 percent think Oswald acted alone, and 16 percent are unsure. A 2003 Gallup poll found that 75 percent of Americans felt there was a conspiracy.

The Oswald-acted-alone results, meanwhile, are the highest since the period three years after the assassination, when 36 percent said one man was responsible for Kennedy's death."

USA TODAY

Program has had problems with fraud and harrassment

Army says problems have been fixed

Key congressman still doubts its value

WASHINGTON — Army Secretary John McHugh defended the use of military social scientists on battlefields despite some initial ""command, training and personnel challenges"" with the program in its early years

McHugh sent a letter recently to Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., a member of the Armed Services Committee who had raised concerns with McHugh about the Human Terrain System after USA TODAY reported that an internal Army report had found team members falsified time sheets to inflate their pay and had engaged in racial and sexual harassment. The program, launched in 2007 with civilian social scientists, was aimed at helping commanders understand local populations and avoid antagonizing them.

Army internal reviews, including a 2010 report obtained by USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act were used to ""increase oversight, improve personnel selection and enhance effectiveness,"" McHugh wrote to Hunter on March 15.

Hunter said he's not convinced the program, which cost the military $58 million in 2013, is worth the investment.

""The problem here is that the Army's take on things overlooks an investigation that raises some serious concerns and doesn't account for program shortcomings and criticisms,"" Hunter told USA TODAY.

One key concern raised by the Army report was the systematic submission of fraudulent time sheets by members of Human Terrain Teams. One team manager said in a sworn statement that team members conspired to have the manager fired for refusing ""to bow to their wishes for unconstrained overtime and comp time hours.""

The manager surveyed managers of other teams in Afghanistan and found some teams were filing for ""extremely high number of hours for work performed on their Forward Operating base,"" so they were ""getting only three or four hours off PER DAY, just sleep time, which I knew from personal experience would not stand up to common-sense scrutiny.""

A 2010 memo to the deputy chief of staff for the Army's Training and Doctrine Command from the Army's investigating officer found overtime was ""excessive"" and determined that ""168 hours per pay period (i.e. 84 hours per week, or 12 hours a day/7 days a week) is either the de facto standard or the desired standard of HTS leadership.""

This standard, according to another memo, ""approximates a salary of between $224,000 and $280,000 per year and allows an employee to take nearly six months of paid leave at the end of a 9-month tour."" Military members of the teams earned 40% less and felt a ""sense of inequity.""

The Army says allegations of time sheet fraud have been investigated and were not proved.

Many of the problems were resolved when team members, who had been contractors, were converted to limited-term federal government employees in 2009, McHugh wrote. In 2010, leadership positions were staffed by government employees and soldiers.

""In spite of the administrative challenges, HTS has been a very successful program,"" McHugh wrote. ""Commanders in combat units supported by HTS in Iraq and Afghanistan have indicated that HTS adds significant value to their operations.""

The Army intends to maintain the human terrain teams to avoid a ""cold start,"" McHugh wrote.

Soldiers, not government employees, should provide that capability, Hunter said. As the military faces the need to cut $46 billion from its budget by the end of September, programs such as Human Terrain System need more scrutiny, he said.

""Even if HTS was 100% effective, which we know it's not, does it make sense to spend money, regardless of how much or how little, on something like this when training and operations are being cut back because of funding?"" Hunter said."

Texas GOP senator referenced Bataan Death March at end of his marathon health care protest

Thousands of Filipino and American soldiers were killed by Japanese in march to POW camp

Video of apology was posted on YouTube

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ted Cruz apologized to Filipino veterans for referencing the Bataan Death March during his marathon protest last week of President Obama's health care law.

""I apologize for causing offense. I should not have said what I did,"" the Texas Republican said during a meeting with Filipino veterans of World War II.

Cruz mentioned the Bataan Death March near the end of his 21-hour, filibuster-style protest last week as he thanked Senate aides, Capitol police officers and other staff who were at work as he controlled the Senate floor from Sept. 24 into Sept. 25.

Specifically, Cruz said that he wanted ""to thank the men and men who have endured this, this Bataan Death March.""

After the Battle of Bataan in World War II, Japanese forces killed more than 10,000 Filipino and American soldiers during the forced 65-mile march to a prison camp. Tens of thousands of other Filipino and American soldiers who survived the march were held as POWs, and many died because of lack of food, poor conditions and abuse by their captors.

Cruz met with Celestino Almeda and Jesse Baltazar, both in their 90s, and other representatives of the American Coalition for Filipino Veterans, which had asked for a public apology. Video of the meeting was posted Tuesday on YouTube.

""I was trying to say they (staff) endured a long period of suffering not of their choosing, but I understand that that comment caused offense and I apologize. That was not my intention to do so,"" Cruz said after explaining the context of his remarks.

The 2016 presidential election is more than three years away, but potential candidates and their supporters are already contemplating the next campaign. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas—now well-known for his role in the recent federal shutdown—and California’s celebrity former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger are among those whose names are circulating. But neither Cruz nor Schwarzenegger was born in the United States, and the Constitution provides that “[n]o person except a natural born citizen, or a Citizen at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President.”

Cruz640

For Cruz, Schwarzenegger, and a number of other potential candidates, the Natural Born Citizenship Clause raises a critical question: Is anyone born outside the United States constitutionally eligible to serve as president?

Senator John McCain, who was born in the Panama Canal Zone, faced the same question with respect to his natural-born citizenship status in his 2008 presidential bid, and purported concerns about President Obama’s constitutional qualifications led “birthers” to file lawsuits challenging his natural-born credentials on the basis of a variety of far-fetched theories during the last several years. A new natural-born citizenship debate is already simmering, and it seems likely to heat up a great deal before the 2016 election takes place.

The Constitution does not define the term natural born citizen. Even so, Governor Schwarzenegger is clearly out of the running. Given that he was born in Austria to Austrian parents, there is no basis for arguing that he is a natural-born citizen of the United States.

For Senator Cruz—who was born in Calgary, Alberta, to an American mother and a Cuban father—the question is more complicated. There is a strong argument that anyone who acquires United States citizenship at birth, whether by virtue of the 14th Amendment or by operation of federal statute, qualifies as natural born. The Supreme Court, however, has never ruled on the meaning of the natural-born citizenship requirement. In the absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling—or a constitutional amendment—the parameters of the clause remain uncertain.

Story continues

The origins of the Natural Born Citizenship Clause date back to a letter John Jay (who later authored several of the Federalist Papers and served as our first chief justice) wrote to George Washington, then president of the Constitutional Convention, on July 25, 1787. At the time, as Justice Joseph Story later explained in his influential Commentaries on the Constitution, many of the framers worried about “ambitious foreigners who might otherwise be intriguing for the office.”

“Permit me to hint, whether it would not be wise & seasonable to provide a strong check to the admission of Foreigners into the administration of our national Government; and to declare expressly that the Command in chief of the American army shall not be given to nor devolve on, any but a natural born Citizen,” Jay wrote.

Washington thanked Jay for his hints in a reply dated September 2, 1787. Shortly thereafter, the natural-born citizenship language appeared in the draft Constitution the Committee of Eleven presented to the Convention. There is no record of any debate on the clause.

While it is possible to trace the origins of the Natural Born Citizenship Clause, it is harder to determine its intended scope—who did the framers mean to exclude from the presidency by this language? The Naturalization Act of 1790 probably constitutes the most significant evidence available. Congress enacted this legislation just three years after the drafting of the Constitution, and many of those who voted on it had participated in the Constitutional Convention. The act provided that “children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond the sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural-born citizens.”

There is no record of discussion of the term natural born citizen, but it is reasonable to conclude that the drafters believed that foreign-born children of American parents who acquired citizenship at birth could and should be deemed natural born citizens.

Although subsequent naturalization acts dropped the natural born language, members of later Congresses proposed many bills and resolutions designed to clarify, limit, or eliminate the Natural Born Citizenship Clause; none succeeded. In April 2008, however, amid challenges to Senator McCain’s eligibility to serve as president, the Senate passed a resolution declaring that “John Sidney McCain, III, is a ‘natural born Citizen” under Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution of the United States.”

The resolution—co-sponsored by a number of McCain’s Senate colleagues, including rival presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama—undoubtedly offered Senator McCain some comfort, but it had no real constitutional significance.

Challenges to presidential qualifications are not new. In 1964, for example, questions arose as to the natural-born credentials of Republican nominee Senator Barry Goldwater, because he was born in Arizona prior to statehood. In 1968, legal actions were threatened against former Michigan Governor George Romney, who was born to American parents in Mexico, when he sought the Republican nomination.

Despite the shadow that lawsuits may cast over a presidential bid, the obstacles to successful litigation of natural-born citizenship challenges are formidable. These matters raise a wide array of justiciability concerns. Standing issues led to the dismissal of lawsuits filed in federal courts in New Hampshire and California challenging Senator McCain’s natural-born status in 2008 (Hollander v. McCain, Robinson v. Bowen), as well as to the dismissal of claims brought by a Guyana-born naturalized citizen who argued that the Fifth and 14th Amendments effectively repealed the natural born citizenship clause (Hassan v. Federal Election Committee).

Standing is not the only obstacle to adjudication of natural-born citizenship issues. Claims that a candidate lacks the requisite natural-born citizenship credentials are unlikely to ripen until a nominee is chosen, or perhaps even elected, and federal courts may be reluctant to delve into the merits of challenges to a candidate’s natural-born citizenship status on political question grounds.

What can we expect if Senator Cruz or another similarly situated candidate runs for president in 2016? Undoubtedly, the controversy will continue with passionate advocates on both sides of the issue. A scholarly consensus is emerging, however, that anyone who acquires citizenship at birth is natural born for purposes of Article II.

This consensus rests on firm foundations. First, given Jay’s letter and the language of the 1790 naturalization act, it seems evident that the framers were worried about foreign princes, not children born to American citizens living abroad. Second, the 14-year residency requirement Article II also imposes as a presidential prerequisite ensures that, regardless of their place of birth, would-be presidents must spend a significant time living in the United States before they can run for office.

Finally, the natural born citizenship clause is both an anomaly and an anachronism. The way in which the clause differentiates among United States citizens is contrary to the overall spirit of the Constitution; the risk that foreign nobility will infiltrate our government is long past; and place of birth is a poor surrogate for loyalty to one’s homeland in our increasingly mobile society and our ever more interconnected world. The best solution would be to amend the Constitution, as many legislators on both sides of the aisle have proposed over the years. In the absence of an amendment, the clause should be narrowly interpreted.

Sarah Helene Duggin is Professor of Law and Director of the Law and Public Policy Program for the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America. She has authored several academic articles on the natural-born citizenship proviso.

It seems vlear to me that they are determined to destroy science and replace it with their own thing which is a sophisticated, modern propaganda and mind control machine. We already know that the press is easily used by these people, but Mann has exposed some of the depths to which it has descended.

I want to credit him for his willingness to tell his own story in a way that helps us see beyond him as an individual player in all this and turns our eyes toward the extent of the threat his experience has taught him about. His book is a warning. It can be a call to action, in spite of the fact that that is not his mode.

In case you do not yet know who he is :

Michael E. Mann is a member of the Penn State University faculty, holding joint positions in the Departments of Meteorology and Geosciences and the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute (ESSI). He is also director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center (ESSC). He received his undergraduate degrees in physics and applied math from the University of California at Berkeley, an M.S. degree in physics from Yale University, and a Ph.D. in geology and geophysics from Yale University. He also received an outstanding publication award from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and, in 2002, was named one of fifty leading visionaries in science and technology by Scientific American. He was awarded the 2012 Hans Oeschger Medal of the European Geosciences Union, and in the same year was inducted as a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union. With Lee Kump, he coauthored the book Dire Predictions: Understanding Global Warming, and is a cofounder and avid contributor to the award-winning science website, www.RealClimate.org. Along with other scientists who participated in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

In its 2001 report on global climate, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations prominently featured the “Hockey Stick,” a chart showing global temperature data over the past one thousand years. The Hockey Stick demonstrated that temperature had risen with the increase in industrialization and use of fossil fuels. The inescapable conclusion was that worldwide human activity since the industrial age had raised CO2 levels, trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and warming the planet. The Hockey Stick became a central icon in the “climate wars,” and well-funded science deniers immediately attacked the chart and the scientists responsible for it. Yet the controversy has had little to do with the depicted temperature rise and much more with the perceived threat the graph posed to those who oppose governmental regulation and other restraints to protect our environment and planet. Michael E. Mann, lead author of the original paper in which the Hockey Stick first appeared, shares the real story of the science and politics behind this controversy. He introduces key figures in the oil and energy industries, and the media front groups who do their bidding in sometimes slick, bare-knuckled ways to cast doubt on the science. Mann concludes with an account of the “Climategate” scandal, the 2009 hacking of climate scientists’ emails. Throughout, Mann reveals the role of science deniers, abetted by an uninformed media, in once again diverting attention away from one of the central scientific and policy issues of our time.

First, I would like to summarize some of the recent developments in the controversy over whether or not humans have created a climate catastrophe. One of the key aspects that the United Nations, environmental groups and the media have promoted as the “smoking gun” of proof of catastrophic global warming is the so-called ‘hockey stick’ temperature graph by climate scientist Michael Mann and his colleagues. This graph purported to show that temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere remained relatively stable over 900 years, then spiked upward in the 20th century presumably due to human activity. Mann, who also co-publishes a global warming propaganda blog reportedly set up with the help of an environmental group, had his “Hockey Stick” come under severe scrutiny. The “hockey stick” was completely and thoroughly broken once and for all in 2006. Several years ago, two Canadian researchers tore apart the statistical foundation for the hockey stick. In 2006, both the National Academy of Sciences and an independent researcher further refuted the foundation of the

“hockey stick.”



Hardly the credentials of a modern hero? Wait just a bit and I'll explain why he is. His book is described this way by Columbia U. Press:You can google your heart out and you will find garbage like thisThis is but one example of the lies and deceit out there on the web. These blogs and postings are part of a coordinated effort financed by the oils and coal industries, among others, linked into a right wing dominated set of publications and news channels.

Mann describes the way they work. It is something that makes the Nazi propaganda machine look primitive. To counter this, without the massive amounts of funding the deniers have, Mann created RealClimate, a blog where rapid responses to the lies and organized attacks could be countered.

RealClimate is a commentary site on climate science by working climate scientists for the interested public and journalists. We aim to provide a quick response to developing stories and provide the context sometimes missing in mainstream commentary.

NSF IG report on Michael Mann investigation: “No research misconduct. Case closed.” Don't bother telling Rick Perry.

Posted on August 22, 2011 by Rick Piltz

This is getting old. Completing yet another investigation of the co-author of a seminal study of the 1,000-year temperature record (commonly referred to as the “Hockey Stick”), the National Science Foundation Inspector General concluded: “Finding no research misconduct or other matter raised by the various regulations and laws discussed above, this case is closed.” But don’t waste your breath telling that to global warming denialist Rick Perry, oil-money governor of Texas and would-be president. See Joe Romm, Climate Progress: Climate Secret: NSF Quietly Closes Out Inspector General Investigation with Complete Vindication of Michael Mann Two things we know with extremely high confidence: 1. Recent warming is unprecedented in magnitude and speed and cause (so the temperature history looks like a Hockey Stick).

2. Michael Mann, the lead author on the original Hockey Stick paper, is one of the nation’s top climatologists and a source of first-rate analysis. We know these things because both the Hockey Stick and Mann have been independently investigated and vindicated more times than any other facet of climate science or any other climate scientist.

The investigation after investigation all over the world have been going on for years and often have to be duplicated because the deniers simply ignore their results. here's one example from Climate Science watch I could go on and on but by now you should have the picture. Please read this book. It is the scariest story ever written as a straightforward narrative of modern history. We can tell which way the wind is blowing by reading this weatherman!"

USA TODAY

It took nearly five years to overcome Republican edge

But %22senior%22 judges give GOP continued advantage

Republicans block confirmation at nation%27s No. 2 court

WASHINGTON — The federal judiciary — long the province and priority of Republicans — is turning more Democratic.

The number of full-time federal judges named by Democratic presidents will draw even Friday with the number named by Republicans, following two retirements. The next of President Obama's nominees to replace a Republican-named judge will tilt the balance in Democrats' favor; that majority will grow for the remainder of his term.

The trend is particularly noteworthy at the nation's 13 appeals courts, 10 of which had a majority of Republican appointees by the end of George W. Bush's presidency. Although the Supreme Court remains 5-4 in Republicans' favor, judges named by Democratic presidents now dominate seven appeals courts, and two more are split down the middle.

""It is an important milestone,"" says Kathryn Ruemmler, the White House counsel. ""It is a good indicator that the president is making his mark on the courts.""

The federal courts — particularly the appeals courts — often set precedents in areas ranging from national security and economic regulation to abortion, immigration, voting rights, affirmative action, gun control and gay marriage.

""The impact that the president can have on the federal judiciary is perhaps the single-most important legacy issue for any president,"" says Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal advocacy group.

Both parties have fought wars over judicial nominees since 1987, when Democrats blocked Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. The arch-conservative Bork was replaced by the more moderate Anthony Kennedy, now the GOP appointee who most often sides with liberals.

So fierce is the battle for judicial control that, on Thursday, Senate Republicans blocked confirmation of Obama's top choice to fill a vacancy on the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia Circuit. That is the nation's second most powerful court, with vast jurisdiction over federal agencies and regulations.

The court has eight active judges, split among Democratic and Republican appointees, and three vacancies. There are six ""senior"" judges who usually serve part-time — five of them appointed by Republican presidents.

Obama, who had one nominee for that court blocked by Senate Republicans before winning confirmation of Sri Srinivasan in May, introduced three more nominees in June. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to confirm them, but Senate Republicans maintain the court doesn't need any more judges. On Thursday, they blocked action on Patricia Millett, 50, who has argued the second most cases before the Supreme Court among all female litigants.

""The reason they want to put more judges on the D.C. Circuit is not because it needs them,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said. He quoted an administration ally who had acknowledged that ""the president's best hope for advancing his agenda is through executive action, and that runs through the D.C. Circuit.""

Liberal activists have another explanation for GOP obstruction. ""It's the farm team,"" says Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, of the court's historic role as stepping-stone to the Supreme Court. ""Republicans have always fought holy wars over filling those seats.""

Despite that setback, Democrats' steady progress on other appeals and district courts has not been denied. It's been a long time coming; Obama, preoccupied by two Supreme Court nominations in his first two years, got a slow start on filling lower court vacancies. Senate Republicans have been even slower to confirm his nominees.

Lining the federal bench with judges who enjoy lifetime tenure is one of the most significant perks of the presidency. Two-term presidents generally appoint nearly 40% of the 874 federal judges. George W. Bush's preference for ideological conservatives remade the judiciary in his image. Obama, with 208 confirmed judges so far, has preferred moderates.

Even as Democrats are poised to pull ahead, however, Republican nominees will maintain an outsize influence because of the number of judges over 65 who take senior status and continue to decide cases. While the number of active judges are tied at 390, there are 322 senior judges nominated by Republican presidents — more than half named by Reagan — compared with 233 Democrats.

For years, the problem for Democrats has been Republicans' dominance in presidential politics. GOP presidents have held the White House for 20 of the past 33 years and 28 of the past 45, dating to the Nixon administration.

""Their policy preferences should not be what's driving their decisions,"" says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. ""Unfortunately, we have a very politicized approach to the judiciary at this point, and that's detrimental.""

Nationally, a few appeals court nominees have been blocked on both sides, and the pace of Senate confirmations has slowed with each new administration. About 10% of the nation's 179 appeals court and 677 district court judgeships remain vacant, a level not seen for two decades, according to the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.

While squabbling with Senate Republicans over those delays, Obama has been able to remake the judiciary in another way. Forty-two percent of his confirmed judges are women and 37% are minorities, far greater proportions than those of his predecessors.

That's of lesser concern to conservative groups than Democrats' emerging majority, one that can only grow through 2016. If the next president is a Democrat — say, Hillary Rodham Clinton — the impact would be huge.

""At that point,"" says Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice, ""there would be very few Republicans left on the courts.""

No governor in America is more like Reagan than Chris Christie

The winning combination starts with a willingness to work with people who disagree with you

With Christie at the helm%2C the New Jersey miracle could be repeated across the country

""Die-hard conservatives thought that if I couldn't get everything I asked for, I should jump off the cliff with the flag flying – go down in flames,"" a well-known Republican leader once said. ""If I can get 70 or 80 percent of what it is I'm trying to get, I'll take that and then continue to try to get the rest in the future.""

What would be considered heresy in today's GOP was uttered by Ronald Reagan. As a governor in cosmopolitan California, he balanced the budget by compromising on tax increases. Rather than eliminating welfare, as was his preference, he worked with California's Democrats to overhaul it. He signed into law the nation's first no-fault divorce legislation over conservative opposition.

Even more shocking than this heresy is another: No governor in America is more like Reagan than Chris Christie. This week, the New Jersey governor will offer a desperately needed lesson in political genius to a party currently going the way of the Whigs.

It is well past time for the rank-and-file GOP to forgive Chris Christie. The once GOP rising star rankled conservatives by daring to embrace Barack Obama during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Rush Limbaugh, for example, said Christie played ""the role of Greek column"" for Obama's campaign. But the truth is that Christie's actions were those of the smartest Republican leader America has seen in decades. Without sacrificing a single ideological principle, he brought relief to his state and established himself as a leader above the petty politics Americans deplore.

Compare Christie's model to the campaign of gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, a rigid ideologue who appeals only to his conservative base and who looks on track to lose in once reliably red Virginia to, of all things, a Clintonite.

Christie is not a perfect messenger, to be sure. Only a few years ago, he seemed almost certain to face a tough re-election fight due to his outspokenness, a sense of extremism and his girth. But while he has maintained a record as a rock-solid conservative, Christie has shown he knows how to govern in an arctic-blue state that Republican presidential candidates haven't won since 1988, and as he'll show next week when he is re-elected by a landslide, he also knows how to win.

The winning combination starts with a willingness to work with people who disagree with you. Reagan had a great relationship with the Democratic Speaker of the California Assembly, and as president with Speaker Tip O'Neill. Similarly, Christie's relationship with New Jersey's heavily Democratic legislature has made possible the passage of spending cuts, pension reform, public employee benefits reform, and teacher tenure reform. For Reagan, cooperation made possible his economic revolution. For Christie, it has saved a state budget that was spiraling toward catastrophe.

To win elections, you need to show people that you're for them, even if they're not (yet) for you. Reagan did this so effectively that a new term entered the political lexicon: Reagan Democrat. Likewise, Christie appealed to Hispanics by endorsing a ""clear path to citizenship"" and in-state college tuition for illegal aliens. He also appealed to moderates and law enforcement by telling a disappointed and combative Sean Hannity, ""I favor some of the gun-control measures we have in New Jersey."" And he appealed to the gay community and young voters who support gay rights by abandoning a hopeless legal challenge to defend traditional marriage.

The governor also appealed to voters beyond his base when he lambasted the Republican Congress for delaying a disaster-relief bill for victims of Hurricane Sandy. His message to New Jersey's residents was that they mattered more to him than politics or partisan loyalty. Christie sent the same message by spending countless hours touring the battered Jersey shore, hugging survivors, speaking emotionally about his state's loss, and – most controversially – praising Obama for his help just days before Obama's re-election.

If Republicans want to avoid becoming a regional party condemned to a minority status, our best and brightest should hop on a train to Trenton, get out their notepads, and ask Christie for help. After that, they should make him Chairman of the Republican National Committee. With Christie at the helm, the New Jersey miracle could be repeated across the country – just in time for what might otherwise be a surprisingly dismal 2014 midterm election.

TRENTON, N.J. — Rutgers University President Robert Barchi says he wants to bring an end to the school's practice of paying huge settlements to exiting employees. He started Thursday night with disgraced basketball coach Mike Rice.

The school and Rice agreed to cutting the coach's settlement payment to $475,000, less than half of the $1.1 million for termination as stipulated in his contract.

Barchi earlier in the day had testified before the Assembly Budget Committee and vowed to fight Rice's claim to the full amount. Less than three hours later, the school announced the revised terms.

""Tonight's agreement is in the best interests of the university, and I am pleased this issue has been resolved,"" Barchi said.

Rice could not be reached for comment.

Barchi told lawmakers at the hearing that he was willing to challenge the payout because the contract was breached. ""Let me assure you that I signed no settlement whatsoever with Mr. Rice.""

""My personal position — I'm not a lawyer — is that the university was damaged by his actions. My personal position is that his conduct was unethical, not acceptable to the university's standards, and frankly I'll have that discussion in court if I have to. I'm going to be pretty hard to budget,"" Barchi said.

Barchi on April 5 gave little hope that the school could avoid paying the full settlement when he told reporters, ""The coach was not fired for cause. The outside says that could not be done.""

Rice's tenure at the school ended after video surfaced of him throwing basketballs at players and screaming profanities and slurs during practices.

Rice's boss, athletic director Tim Pernetti, resigned and was given a $1.2 million payout, and general counsel John Wolf will receive a $420,000 exit package when he leaves later this year. Wolf advised the school to suspend Rice last fall instead of firing him then.

Barchi said reports that Wolf would also receive free tickets to Rutgers football games in the future are not accurate.

""He would have the opportunity to purchase his tickets, the same seats (he had the past 30 years). Not that we were giving him any tickets,"" Barchi said.

Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-Mercer, said she was heartened by Barchi's testimony but added, ""I remain very concerned that Rutgers has doled out so much money to ousted top officials. Consider that based on the in-state tuition and fees listed on the Rutgers website, for every $1 million spent on these deals, the university could have provided 76 students with a scholarship covering full tuition and fees for one year. Rutgers needs to do better.""

Per-capita firearm homicides are about average compared to other U.S. states, and Connecticut actually gets high marks from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, whose score card rates it fifth best in the nation for its legislative efforts to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of criminals.

As Congress and the states examine ways to toughen gun laws in the wake of the elementary school rampage that left 20 children and seven adults dead, figures like that aren’t very encouraging. If horrors like the Sandy Hook massacre can happen even in states that do a decent job of controlling guns, what’s the point of forcing states with looser laws to crack down? Researchers have for years been trying to answer the question of whether gun violence drops in states that approve strict gun laws, only to produce studies that contradict each other or provide mixed results.

The problem probably stems from the fact that the United States is a patchwork of 50 governments with widely differing ideas about how to regulate firearms; and there is such a thing as interstate commerce -- if you can’t buy a gun in your home state, you can drive across the border to a more permissive one. This is an argument for strong federal rather than state restrictions, but of course the power of Congress in this area is limited by the 2nd Amendment.

Even if statistics don’t point to a cure for America’s gun epidemic, they do show some interesting things about where gun violence is concentrated. It’s not where you might think. Urban states with heavy gang populations such as California and New York aren’t particularly high up on the list of per-capita gun killings, though of course in terms of absolute numbers, they look like murder capitals because of their big populations. Mid-size Southern states seem to be the places people are trigger-happiest -- and where, of course, political opposition to gun control often runs strongest. Perhaps that’s because most of the bloodletting happens in Southern cities, and it’s in rural areas -- where gun violence is slight -- that gun rights are held most sacred.

The 10 states that follow are ranked based on the number of gun homicides per 100,000 population. For the crime statistics, I used this chart from the FBI, which has pluses and minuses; on the plus side, it’s more up to date than most of the gun-crime data available, using murder rates from 2011. On the minus side, two states are missing from the chart, apparently because the FBI couldn’t get the numbers from them: Alabama and Florida.

She Also Writes A Weekly Column.']",Ruth Marcus: Boehner is leading from behind,"It’s time for the speaker to start leading or leave. With some ingenuity, he might even be able to lead and keep his speakership.

We tend to think of John Boehner as the helpless pawn of an ungovernable caucus, under the thumb of ideologues who prevent the otherwise sane speaker from being the dealmaker he is at heart.

In this view, Boehner has little choice — he must capitulate to the anarchists’ demands or lose his speakership.

Two responses:

First, so what? Is the title worth the hassle? Does Boehner want to be remembered as the speaker who led his party — or, more accurately, followed it — over the cliff of shutdown and default? Let Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz be speaker if he wants the job.

Boehner has been practicing the tantrum theory of leadership: letting the crazies in his caucus have their meltdown until they’ve gotten it out of their system and are ready to listen to reason.

In the current situation, you could imagine that having the tantrum over funding the government could be usefully cathartic, clearing the decks for more reasonable behavior over the debt ceiling. Except that Boehner has been ginning up his caucus for a debt-ceiling fight, where he believes Republicans will have more leverage with the president (maybe) and suffer less political damage (doubtful).

Perhaps the fallout from a shutdown — among voters and in the market — would be chastening enough to convince Republicans to back away from the far more cataclysmic prospect of leaving the government unable to borrow enough money to cover its debts.

But as every parent eventually discovers, sometimes you have to step in and tell the kids to cut it out. Now. Because if you don’t, you will lurch from tantrum to tantrum, forever at the mercy of tiny terrorists. And these tiny terrorists have nuclear weapons in the form of a default on the debt.

Which brings me to the second response: Maybe Boehner has more power than he seems to believe. What if Boehner brought his proposed solution for funding the government to the House floor — even if it would require giving up relying on only Republican votes and instead relying on Democrats to help it pass?

Let Boehner dare his caucus not to follow him. How naïve, you’re thinking. He’d be out as speaker before you could say Eric Cantor.

Maybe not. In the history of the House, no speaker has been forcibly removed from office. The closest things came, according to Catholic University political scientist Matthew N. Green, an expert on the speakership, occurred in 1910, when Republican Speaker Joe Cannon faced a revolt from a group of progressive Republicans and the Democratic delegation, which ended up stripping the heavy-handed speaker of some powers.

Ann Telnaes animation: Countdown to government shutdown (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

Notably, when Cannon requested a vote to remove him from office, the rebels caved, with Republican insurgents unwilling to accept a Democratic speaker and Democrats feeling similarly. “I was given more votes than at the beginning of Congress,” Cannon observed in his autobiography.

Likewise, when Speaker Newt Gingrich faced a brewing coup in 1997, he simply refused to resign his speakership and warned the plotters (among whom was one John Boehner) that they risked ending up with a Speaker Dick Gephardt, the Democrats’ leader. That was not likely to happen, or if it did, to last for very long, but the insurrection quickly evaporated.

In the current situation, there’s no doubt that House Republicans seeking to oust Boehner could bring that effort to the floor; under House procedures, it would be a privileged motion entitled to speedy consideration.

But even if it were to succeed — presumably with a combination of Democrats and tea party Republicans — Republicans would have to worry about what happens next. Under House practice, the speaker is chosen by a majority of those present and voting.

If Democrats voted present, Boehner could regain the speakership with a mere majority of his caucus — not a majority of the entire House.

If Democrats voted for Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, it’s unclear that traumatized, fractured Republicans would be able to summon a majority of the whole House for one of their own — Majority Leader Cantor , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy or Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan.

Challenging the speaker is risky business. Which is why it’s time for this speaker to start taking some risks — for his country as well as his legacy.

Follow Her On Twitter']","Samuel L. Jackson disses Obama's pronunciation: ""Be f**king Presidential ... stop trying to 'relate'""","Samuel L. Jackson has some words of wisdom for President Obama when it comes to his deliberate dropping of “g’s” off the ends of words to seemingly sound like Joe Average.

“First of all, we know it ain’t because of his blackness, so I say stop trying to ‘relate.’ Be a leader. Be f**king presidential,” Jackson told Playboy magazine. “Look, I grew up in a society where I could say ‘It ain’t’ or ‘What it be’ to my friends. But when I’m out presenting myself to the world as me, who graduated from college, who had family what cared about me, who has a well-read background, I f**king conjugate.”

The 64-year-old actor, who stars this fall in the highly-anticipated remake of “Oldboy,” is also known in social media circles as the “grammar police.”

“On Twitter someone will write, ‘Your an idiot,’ and I’ll go, ‘No, you’re an idiot,’ and all my Twitterphiles will go, ‘Hey, Sam Jackson, he’s the grammar police.’ I’ll take that,” he continued. “Somebody needs to be. I mean, we have newscasters who don’t even know how to conjugate verbs, something Walter Cronkite and Edward R. Murrow never had problems with. How the f**k did we become a society where mediocrity is acceptable.”

Raised in Tennessee, Jackson went on to note that he’s finally proud to acknowledge his Southern roots, and how his strict family upbringing put him in good stead.

“Looking back, I love the South so much, even though there was a time when I didn’t feel so proud of being from there. The sense of community there is unheard of in this day and age. The idea that it takes a village to raise a child—it works,” he said. “The one thing my family insisted on was, don’t embarrass us. Don’t make us come to jail, because though we will come to see you, we’re going to leave you there. It just wasn’t an option for me. I was more afraid of the people I lived with than the people I ran with.”

The famed actor also staunchly defended director Quentin Tarantino’s controversial use of the “N” word in last year’s hit “Django Unchained.”

“These 20-somethings can’t turn around and tell me the word n**ger is f**ked-up in ‘Django’ yet still listen to Jay Z or whoever else say ‘n**ger, n**ger, n**ger’ throughout the music they listen to,” he told the men’s magazine. “You can’t have it one way and not the other. Saying Tarantino said ‘n**ger’ too many times is like complaining they said ‘kike’ too many times in a movie about Nazis.”

However, there are a couple of things he says won’t do onscreen – not even for his buddy Tarantino. Maybe.

“Probably dress up as a woman and kiss another guy. I don’t think people want to see me do that,” Jackson added. “He hasn’t asked me, but you know what? If it’s done right and the story is good, I might.”"

The number of American “patriot” extremist groups has reached a record level, according to a new study, and experts are warning of a wave of anti-government violence.

A report released Tuesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center counted 1,360 “patriot” extremist groups in 2012 – up by 7% from 2011. The study defines patriot groups as anti-government militias driven by their fear that authorities will strip them of their guns and liberties.

“They believe the Constitution is being raped. With hate groups, things are going to get worse because they feel like they’re in battle,” said David Gletty a former FBI informant who spent time undercover with various militia and extremist groups. “It’s not surprising with their hatred of President (Barack) Obama that there are even more hate groups out there.”

The study said California has the most patriot extremist groups, with 81.

The SPLC report also offers a bit of good news: The number of “immigrant-bashing” extremist groups – so-called nativism organizations – is way down from 2011, falling by 88%.

The new statistics come after a string of crimes linked to extremist groups. A year ago, a Michigan militia leader and his son pleaded guilty to federal gun charges. Last August, a 40-year-old ex-soldier-turned singer for a white supremacist rock band shot up a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six people, before taking his own life. A few weeks later, a group of Georgia men was linked to an anti-government militia plot to assassinate Obama.

Obama’s election as the first African-American president and his pro-gun control stance have fueled the increase in anti-government groups, according to the report.

“We are seeing a huge reaction to the potential for gun control, and that reaction is so angry that it’s hard not to be afraid of what’s coming down the road,” said Mark Potok of the SPLC.

Domestic terror: Are we doing enough?

The rise in such groups echoes a period almost 20 years ago, around the time when Congress passed the 1993 Brady Bill and the 1994 ban on assault weapons, the SPLC said. That legislation came near a period of infamous and deadly anti-government violence in Waco, Texas; Ruby Ridge, Idaho; and Oklahoma City, “and led to the first wave of the patriot movement,” the report said.

Extremists, Gletty warned, “are in a battle in their minds. Their backs are against the wall.”

Skeptics

But Jesse Walker, of the Reason Foundation and author of an upcoming book, “The United States of Paranoia: A Conspiracy Theory,” said counting groups isn’t a good way to measure the threat. “It’s dubious to assume growth in numbers is related to violence.”

Also, the center’s definition of hate groups has changed in the past year, kicking up a controversy. Critics accused the group of unfairly bundling together organizations with vastly different points of view – and painting them all as potentially violent.

For example a North Carolina-based group calling itself “Granny Warriors” appears on the SPLC list of active “patriots.”

But founder Linda Hunnicutt says her organization is harmless.

“I am deadly!” she joked. “I’m 74 years old. I have COPD. I have congestive heart failure. I’m sewing a quilt.”

Hunnicutt acknowledges she’s no friend of the federal government, but, she wishes no harm on anyone.

“All these people that want to bomb places and kill children, come on,” she said. “Who would be in sympathy with them?”

Hunnicutt said she and her group just want Uncle Sam to leave them alone. When Granny Warriors showed up on the SPLC list, Hunnicutt said she wasn’t surprised. But it made her wonder, “Is this all they have to do?”

Nonetheless, Hunnicutt’s thankful to be on the list because she said it increases her group’s notoriety.

Fringe elements

Gletty said most of the fringe elements characterized in the report hate the government more than they do specific races. They hate everyone, Gletty said.

Now a private investigator, Gletty spent years undercover as an FBI informant watching the internal workings of white supremacist groups.

The groups named in the SPLC study came from information compiled from “field reports, Patriot publications, the Internet, law enforcement sources and news reports.”

Other highlights of the report include:

– The state with the most neo-Nazi groups: California, with 9.

– The state with the most Ku Klux Klan groups: Texas, with 26.

– The report breaks out a group it calls “Christian Identity,” which the SLPC defines as “a religion that is fundamentally racist and anti-Semitic.” Texas has the most, with five.

– Another category in the report, called “General Hate,” is defined as groups that are anti-gay, Holocaust deniers, racist musicians or radical traditionalist Catholics. California has the most such groups, with 37.

“The country needs to do better,” Potok wrote in an editorial. The Department of Homeland Security, he said, needs to act to avoid a repeat of the kind of hate-based violence the nation saw in the 1990s."

A longtime White House reporter said on Monday that the Obama administration has been more ""extreme"" about keeping the press away than any she's ever covered.

Ann Compton, the ABC journalist who has reported on every president since Gerald Ford, told Politico that the way the White House press corps was treated by the Obama administration was a ""disgrace.""

""The president's day-to-day policy development ... is almost totally opaque to the reporters trying to do a responsible job of covering it,"" she said. ""There are no readouts from big meetings he has with people from the outside, and many of them aren't even on his schedule. This is different from every president I covered. This White House goes to extreme lengths to keep the press away.""

The awkwardness between the Obama administration and the White House press is nothing new -- this past summer, for instance, reporters blanched at White House attempts to edit a press pool report. But the latest fracas -- over the lack of access to a golf game that Obama played with Tiger Woods on Sunday -- has brought the journalists' anger out into the open again. Obama eventually had a brief off the record conversation with reporters on Monday night but, judging by Compton's comments, journalists see a deeper issue.

Ed Henry, the White House correspondent for Fox News who is also president of the White House Correspondents' Association, made the rounds on Monday to defend the press corps' indignation at being kept from covering the game. He told HuffPost's Michael Calderone on Monday night that the protest was about having a ""minimal level"" of access to Obama, not about a desire to watch him play golf.

Two people who see a tempest in a teapot? Henry's Fox News colleagues Bill O'Reilly and Charles Krauthammer. The anchor and pundit dismissed Henry's objections during a conversation on Monday.

""It is a trivial issue,"" Krauthammer said. ""The guy wants to play golf. The guy deserves a couple of days off. He wants privacy. Big deal. This is -- this is the biggest non-media, non-story that the media have created since the Kardashian weddings.""

""The press being banned from covering his leisure activities, you don't care?"" O'Reilly asked.

""Absolutely not,"" Krauthammer said. ""You want to watch him shank and slice?""

""I'm kind of with you on this, I don't care,"" O'Reilly said.

The recent news about the FBI’s seizure of the phone and email records of Fox News employees, including James Rosen, calls into question whether the federal government is meeting its constitutional obligation to preserve and protect a free press in the United States. We reject the government's efforts to criminalize the pursuit of investigative journalism and falsely characterize a Fox News reporter to a Federal judge as a ""co-conspirator"" in a crime. I know how concerned you are because so many of you have asked me: why should the government make me afraid to use a work phone or email account to gather news or even call a friend or family member? Well, they shouldn’t have done it. The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time. We will not allow a climate of press intimidation, unseen since the McCarthy era, to frighten any of us away from the truth.

I am proud of your tireless effort to report the news over the last 17 years. I stand with you, I support you and I thank you for your reporting with courageous optimism. Too many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of press freedom. We can’t and we won’t forget that. To be an American journalist is not only a great responsibility, but also a great honor. To be a Fox journalist is a high honor, not a high crime. Even this memo of support will cause some to demonize us and try to find irrelevant things to cause us to waver. We will not waver.

As Fox News employees, we sometimes are forced to stand alone, but even then when we know we are reporting what is true and what is right, we stand proud and fearless. Thank you for your hard work and all your efforts.

Sincerely,

Roger Ailes"

Hochschild, a professor of government and African-American studies at Harvard. “The court, or some clever clerk, doesn’t really want to use the word white in part because roughly half of Hispanics consider themselves white.” She added, “White turns out to be a much more ambiguous term now than we used to think it was.”

There are a number of terms that refer to various degrees of blackness, both current and out of favor: African-American, mulatto, Negro, colored, octaroon. There are not a lot of options for whites. In Texas, they say Anglo. And there is the pejorative we were so pithily reminded of when a witness in the racially charged George Zimmerman trial said the victim, Trayvon Martin, had called Mr. Zimmerman a “creepy-ass cracker.”

IN the South, I was often asked about my ethnic origins, and I had a ready answer. “My father is from India,” I would recite, phrasing it in such a way as to avoid being mistaken for an American Indian. “And my mom is white.” Almost invariably, if I was speaking to black people, they would nod with understanding. If I was speaking to white people, I would get a puzzled look. “What kind of white?” they would ask. Only when I explained the Norwegian, Scottish and German mix of my ancestry would I get the nod.

I theorized that this was because blacks understood “white” as a category, both historical and contemporary — a coherent group that wielded power and excluded others. Whites, I believed, were less comfortable with that notion.

But Matthew Pratt Guterl, the author of “The Color of Race in America, 1900-1940,” had a different take. “They’re trying to trace your genealogy and figure out what your qualities are,” he said. “They’re looking in your face, they’re looking in the slope of your nose, the shape of your brow. There’s an effort to discern the truth of the matter, because all whitenesses are not equal.” In other words, they weren’t rejecting the category, they were policing its boundaries.

Such racial boundaries have increasingly been called into question in the debate over affirmative action, once regarded as a form of restitution to descendants of slaves, but now complicated by all sorts of questions about who, exactly, is being helped. “What if some of them aren’t poor, what if some of them don’t have American parentage, what if some of them are really stupid?” Ms. Painter, the historian, asked. “There’s all kinds of characteristics that we stuff into race without looking, and then they pop out and we think, ‘I can’t deal with that.’ ”

Doubtless, this society will continue to classify people by race for some time to come. And as we lumber toward justice, some of those classifications remain useful, even separate from other factors like economic class. Caucasian, though? Not so much."

Journalists and celebrities gathered in D.C. for the annual event, where the president takes the stage to roast the White House press corps.

""I know CNN has taken some knocks lately, but the fact is I admire their commitment to cover all sides of the story just in case one of them happens to be accurate,"" Obama joked on Saturday.

He also took aim at MSNBC, noting, ""Now David Axelrod works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace, since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod.""

Later on, Obama's remarks turned more serious as he remembered the bombings at the Boston Marathon. He praised the Boston Globe for its coverage of the tragedy, saying, ""If anyone wonders if newspapers are a thing of the past, all you need to do is pick up or log on to papers like the Boston Globe.""

He also gave a shoutout to NBC News' Pete Williams, who drew accolades for his reporting during the bombings. People in the newsroom refer to him as ""Big Papi,"" Obama joked.

Earlier, Obama zinged NBC News, saying that he played basketball after this year's Easter Egg roll. He said he made ""2 hits, 20 misses. The executives at NBC asked, 'What's your secret?'""

He speculated that the History Channel was not at the dinner because they were ""embarrassed"" for comparing him to Satan in ""The Bible."" ""Of course, that never kept Fox News from showing up,"" Obama joked.

The president's first target after walking out on stage to rap music was none other than Rush Limbaugh, who he joked ""warned you about this — second term, baby. We're changing things around here a little bit."" BuzzFeed also got a mention when Obama cracked, ""I remember when BuzzFeed was just something I did in college around 2am."""

Because it was so funny, many will miss the dual message.

The first was the necessity for regulation not only on food but for the burning of coal. The second was an environmental message.

Unlike times when his rants seem a bit overdone with his attacks on our food being poison (high fructose corn syrup, GMO, insecticides, and other chemicals), this rant had a prescient point.

Bill’s opening remark puts the onus on the citizen.

If you are one of the millions of Californians who voted against labeling genetically modified food, you can't complain when it turns out there is horse meat in your hamburger.

He goes on to make the case that much of the food being eaten is mislabeled, in a funny and satirical manner.

Did you know your Chilean sea bass is neither Chilean, nor bass, nor from the sea? …. And your Mahi-Mahi is really made of mercury drenched bottom feeders like tile fish …. And if you like sushi, you really don’t know what you are eating because those fish are mislabeled 74% of the time.

He then proceeds to show that many countries we will view as not as advanced in food safety, actually require precise labeling (e.g., Saudi Arabia, China, Japan). He then proceeds to use reverse reasoning for America’s failure to take food labeling & safety as serious as it should.

It’s actually a good thing America don’t care what they put in their mouth. Because in the future, thanks to overpopulation, and overfishing, and global warming, and Chris Christie, we are running out of the food we do like to eat… You know why there is so much fish mislabeling now? They don’t have the heart to tell you the fish you like are gone…. You know where fishermen can no longer find cod? Off of Cape Cod.

His closing line?

Enjoy eating your chemically process crap now America because it won’t be long before lunch is dung beetles and soylent green, and when all that runs out, I am afraid it’s Papa Johns.

His erstwhile oratory was a melee of cringe-inducing lines ripped straight from a sit-in.

Contrary to the claims of both sides%2C Obama is not a liberal visionary.

Finally%2C he said the word %22deficit%2C%22 but don%27t hold your breath for anything there.

If the State of the Union address Tuesday night is any indication, it appears President Obama's chief speechwriter has been replaced by a cliché-generator circa 1960. His erstwhile oratory was a melee of cringe-inducing lines ripped straight from a sit-in.

The commander in chief waxed about children being important for our future and how we should be a country where ""if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead."" Which we are for the most part, anyway. Also, isn't there a rule about how many times you can use the same line in a speech? Doesn't basic etiquette and decency prevent us from ever hearing this again: ""A tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries."" Yes, we know: Warren Buffett is your friend and his secretary pays a higher tax rate that he does. Is this really the only way to demonstrate the tax code needs to be reformed?

The president has only a few opportunities to speak to the nation, and he blew this one. It was so hackish, so devoid of any theme or purpose, that it makes one wonder whether part of Obama just wants to see how bad he can be before his cultists in the news media can see it. Every speech is exactly what they wish it to be, regardless of reality. His mainstream inaugural speech was treated as a liberal call to arms when it was no such thing. Of course, conservatives thought that. If Obama had announced he just joined the Tea Party, Rush Limbaugh would have seen it as proof that he was a socialist. But why liberals would confuse a boilerplate middle-of-the-road inaugural speech with Das Kapital will be forever befuddling.

Contrary to the claims of both sides, Obama is not a liberal visionary with deep desires to institute a progressive agenda. If he is, he's a miserable failure. You need look no further than his own record (starting with foreign policy) and then Tuesday night's speech for evidence. Banalities and tropes are not a governing philosophy or a plan. The immigration piece was good, but hardly a profile in courage. After all, even the GOP wants immigration reform now. There is also the small fact that Obama promised to deal with immigration in his first term.

The edict on climate change was despotic, not liberal. I believe climate change is a problem and humans contribute to it. However, 'either do what I say or I will just start issuing executive orders' that make green energy companies rich is not the kind of governing we should be lauding, regardless of party or ideological bent.

His plea on gun control was manipulative and empty. It worked thematically, but failed on substance. The only point was to make Republicans look bad, while simultaneously lecturing about compromise and the importance of working together.

Finally, he said the word ""deficit,"" but don't hold your breath for anything there. He spoke of it as if it had just magically appeared yesterday when, in fact, he has been ignoring it for four years while running it up. In that way, he's just like George W. Bush and the GOP-run Congress of yore.

That this underwhelming State of the Union – substantively and stylistically – will be treated as a serious effort reveals the bad shape our country is really in.

Airports would stay open%2C but pilots would have to talk to each other

More towers at more airports can still be affected

Smaller communities say closing their towers can hurt local economies

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration announced Friday it would close 149 air-traffic control towers that direct flights at smaller airports across the country.

The airports range from Phoenix Goodyear airport in Arizona to Ithaca Tompkins airport in Ithaca, N.Y. Also to see their towers shut: Sacramento Executive airport in California's state capital, St. Louis (Mo.) Regional and Philip Billard Municipal in Topeka, Kansas' state capital.

The towers will close April 7, as part of $85 billion in federal spending cuts across the government. The closures are part of $637 million that FAA must cut by Sept. 30.

""We will work with the airports and the operators to ensure the procedures are in place to maintain the high level of safety at non-towered airports,"" said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta.

An additional 16 federal contract towers under the ""cost share"" program will remain open because Congress sets aside funds every fiscal year for these towers.

""We heard from communities across the country about the importance of their towers and these were very tough decisions,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said. ""Unfortunately, we are faced with a series of difficult choices that we have to make to reach the required cuts under sequestration.""

For a full list of affected airports, go to: http://www.aaae.org/?e=showFile&l=TDDZKA

The announcement affects towers operated under contracts with FAA that have fewer than 10,000 commercial arrivals or departures and 150,000 general-aviation operations per year.

""Contract towers have long been an integral part of the FAA's system of managing the nation's complex airspace, and the decision to shutter these critical air-traffic control facilities on such an unprecedented and wide-scale basis raises serious concerns about safety — both at the local level and throughout the aviation system,"" said Spencer Dickerson, executive director of the U.S. Contract Tower Association.

Despite a lack of controllers, airports could remain open with pilots communicating with each other for landing and taking off. But airport officials and controllers warned the closures would reduce safety and hurt local economies and military operations that depend on the smaller airports.

The FAA has also announced that most of its 47,000 workers will have unpaid furloughs one day for every two-week pay period through the end of September.

The furloughs taking effect in April could cause flight delays at the busiest airports during the busiest times of day, which transportation officials warn may also prompt airlines to cancel flights.

The FAA is also expected to close up to 43 towers with fewer flights where agency controllers work. But the agency hasn't yet announced which ones or where midnight shifts will be eliminated for controllers.

Doug Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the FAA would have to give the union one year's notice in order to close towers staffed by the FAA.

Closing the towers raises some safety concerns, despite the small number of annual flights.

One airport on the list, Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in Central Florida, warned that the closure would hurt a Sun 'n Fun aviation event involving 5,000 aircraft and 200,000 visitors between Tampa and Orlando.

The event is scheduled to start two days after the closure, from April 9 to 14. But in the past FAA has sent 50 air-traffic controllers and technical-operations staffers to the airport to help manage 15,000 takeoffs and landings during the event.

""The tower at LAL is not a luxury but rather is essential to the operation of this facility,"" Eugene Conrad III, the airport director, wrote in a letter to the FAA.

Many of the contract towers support military training and emergency medical flights.

Another airport on the list, Lonestar Executive Airport north of Houston, supports training for 24 Apache Longbow helicopters that rotate to Afghanistan. The military flies 10 missions and five maintenance flights each day — half of them at night, according to Lt. Col. Michael Odom, who commands the 1-158th Attack Reconnaissance Battalion.

""In summary, the closure of the … tower would result in a less safe airport and a less beneficial training environment,"" Odom wrote to the FAA.

Lonestar is also home to aviation units for Customs and Border Protection, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

""Consequently, it is clear that the national interest is being served each and every day at this airport,"" Alan Sadler, a county judge wrote to FAA in support of the airport."

(CNN) - Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will return to familiar ground.

The Fox News Channel announced Thursday that Palin will rejoin the network as a contributor, less than five months after the two parted ways.



Viewers will start seeing Palin on their screens again Monday, chairman and CEO Roger Ailes said in a statement.

He added that he had several conversations in recent weeks with Palin about the possibility of her rejoining as a contributor.

""I have great confidence in her and am pleased that she will once again add her commentary to our programming. I hope she continues to speak her mind,"" he said.

Known for her outspoken and folksy demeanor, Palin was often considered a ratings goldmine.

Palin said in the statement she was ""pleased and proud"" to return the network.

Fox and Palin split in January, after the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee turned down an offer to renew her contract that ended in 2012, a source close to Palin told CNN.

The departure came after the two had hit a few rough patches. Since leaving Fox, Palin kept a relatively low profile, appearing at only a few major conservative gatherings.

Shortly after it became public that Palin was leaving Fox earlier this year, she said in an interview published by the conservative news outlet Breitbart that she wanted to share her message ""more broadly"" rather than ""preach to the choir.""

""The message of liberty and true hope must be understood by a larger audience,"" she said.

Palin had not been exclusive to Fox television properties. Palin and her family also starred in a one-season reality show – ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"" on TLC – and Palin appeared as a featured ""guest host"" on NBC's ""Today Show."" She spoke to CNN moments after casting her ballot in the Alaska Republican primary last March.

Her family has found their way onto other media properties: her daughter competed on ABC's ""Dancing with the Stars"" and taped a reality-style show, Lifetime's ""Life's a Tripp.""

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/prison-overcrowding_n_4235691.html,2013-11-08 00:00:00,[],10 Ways To Reduce Prison Overcrowding And Save Taxpayers Millions,"America’s federal prisons are in trouble.

They’re so crowded they’re endangering the lives of inmates and corrections officers, the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Charles Samuels Jr., testified at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. And the immense cost of confining so many people is draining vital resources from from other public safety endeavors, including investigations and prosecutions.

Politicians across the political spectrum, from Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to Rand Paul (R-Ky.), increasingly agree that something has to be done.

Now, a report from the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank for social and economic policy research, examines a host of specific suggestions, including several proposals awaiting a vote in Congress.

The study, released this week, concludes that the federal government could save billions and significantly ease the overcrowding crisis by adopting strategies that include cutting fixed sentences for drug offenses in half, retroactively applying a law that lessens the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences, and offering early-release credits to inmates who participate in programs designed to keep them from committing new crimes after they're released.

“The current situation with respect to the prison system is unsustainable,” said Julie Samuels, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center and one of the authors of the report (no relation to the prisons director). “I think what we’ve tried to do is lay out the array of options that we have to change that.”

Not everyone agrees that it’s in the country’s best interests to pursue these options. At the Senate hearing where the prisons chief spoke, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a former U.S. attorney, attributed the dramatic reduction of violent crimes over the last three decades to the growth of the prison population. The more murderers and rapists “you have in jail, the fewer murders and rapes you are going to have,” he said. “That’s just a fact.”

But supporters of prison reform argue that it’s possible to reduce overcrowding without compromising public safety. Below are 10 key proposals examined by the Urban Institute and how they may help save money and empty prison beds over the next decade.

1. Send fewer people to prison for drug crimes.

The problem: There are 219,000 inmates in the federal prisons system -- compared with 25,000 in 1980. About half are there for drug offenses.

The fix: In a major speech in August, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would try to ensure that fewer people spend years behind bars for non-violent drug crimes, in part by directing prosecutors to bring fewer drug cases to federal court.

Potential savings: If prosecutors and judges send 20 percent fewer drug offenders to prison, the federal government would save $1.29 billion and the prisons would save 125,000 “bed years.” (A bed year is a year’s worth of prison time for one person.)

2. Allow drug offenders to serve shorter sentences.



The problem: Why are so many people locked up for drug crimes? The answer has a lot to do with federal mandatory-minimum sentencing laws. Under one law, judges are required to sentence drug offenders to prison terms ranging from 5 years to 20 years, depending on the type and quantity of the drug. Before this 1986 law, one-quarter of all federal drug offenders were fined or sentenced to probation, the study notes. Today, 95 percent end up behind bars.

The fix: A recent bill introduced by Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) in the Senate, and an identical proposal unveiled last week by Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), among others, would cut the length of those mandatory prison sentences in half.

Potential savings: The report concludes that this reform would have “a monumental effect,” saving the government $2.49 billion over 10 years while reducing overcrowding to “its lowest level in decades.”

3. Give judges greater discretion over sentencing.



The problem: Even under the current law, judges don’t always have to subject defendants to minimum sentences. A judge can deviate from this protocol, but only if the defendant has been convicted of a nonviolent drug crime and has a very clean criminal record.

The fix: The bill introduced by Durbin, Lee, and Leahy would expand this “safety valve” to include drug offenders with slightly greater criminal histories who pose little danger to the public.

Potential savings: 53,000 bed years, $544 million.

4. Give judges even greater discretion.



The problem: That “safety valve” only applies to drug offenders, not to people who face mandatory minimum sentences for offenses that have nothing to do with drugs, like some white-collar crimes.

The fix: Create a new “safety valve” that could be offered to everyone facing a mandatory minimum sentence.

Potential savings: 81,000 bed years, $835 million.

5. Lower the “truth-in-sentencing” requirement.

The problem: Current law says that everyone in the federal prison system must serve at least 85 percent of the time to which he or she is sentenced, known as the “truth-in-sentencing” requirement.

The fix: Require offenders instead to serve 70 percent of their sentences.

Potential savings: 150,000 bed years, $1.55 billion.

6. Make sure that people aren’t disproportionately punished for using crack instead of powder cocaine.

The problem: A sentencing law passed in the 1980s dictated that that people caught dealing or posessing crack would go to prison for much longer than people caught with powder cocaine. Many criminal justice advocates have argued that this law essentially targeted blacks, since crack is cheaper than powder cocaine and more popular among low-income people. Carl Hart, an associate professor of neuroscience at Columbia University and an expert on illegal drugs, writes that “there are no pharmacological differences between crack and powder cocaine to justify their differential treatment under the law.”

The fix: The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 decreased the disparity between crack and powder cocaine punishments for anyone sentenced after the law was passed. By applying this law retroactively, to people now serving crack-related prison time, the government would extend its benefits to people who were sentenced before the law was adopted.

Potential savings: 22,000 bed years, $229 million.

7. Allow more prisoners to reduce their sentences through credit for good behavior.



The problem: Many federal prisoners are eligible to get months or years chopped off of their sentences, but only if they participate in a particular drug treatment program.

The fix: Expand the number of rehabilitation programs that offer credits toward early release for those who participate. (This option also offers the benefit of providing more inmates with skills that could help them stay out of trouble after they’re released.)

Potential savings: 22,000 bed years, $224 million.

8. Give prisoners a full year off their sentences for participation in a drug rehabilitation program.

The problem: Federal prisoners who graduate from the system’s main drug program are supposed to get a full year off their sentences. But thanks to overcrowding, the line to get into the program is so long that many offenders have less than a year of their sentences left by the time they graduate.

The fix: Expand the program so that every graduate receives a full year off his or her sentence.

Potential savings: 880 bed years, $9.1 million.

9. Release more elderly prisoners from Bureau of Prisons custody.

The problem: After the age of 55, people who are released from prison are highly unlikely to commit new crimes, according to many studies. Yet 17,400 people in federal prisons are older than 55, according to the report.

The fix: Release some of them before their sentences are up. (The report assumed that fewer than half would be promising candidates.)

Potential savings: 700 bed years, $7.8 million.

10: Send more foreign inmates back to their home countries.

The problem: 54,200 federal prisoners aren’t U.S. citizens.

The fix: Streamline the “international transfer” program so that twice as many prisoners are sent to prisons in their home countries.

Potential savings: 670 bed years, $6.9 million."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/12/20/Scott-Rasmussen-Slams-WaPo,2013-12-20 00:00:00,['Robert Wilde'],Scott Rasmussen Slams WaPo for Calling Congressional Critics 'Haters',"Scott Rasmussen, the prolific pollster, criticized the Washington Post’s characterization of Americans unhappy with both Republican and Democrat performances in government as “haters.” Rasmussen said, “Tens of millions of Americans disapprove of the way both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are doing their jobs. According to the hometown paper for America’s political class, this makes them ‘Haters.'”

In a recent poll conducted by the Washington Post, there are three teams in America: the Democrat team, the Republican team, and the Haters Team. Rasmussen says that “This wasn’t just a casual reference by a lazy journalist. Not only did the paper of the political elite produce tables and graphics with the ‘Haters’ label; they wrote an entire article about how ‘Haters Gonna Hate.'” Rasmussen added, “It truly boggles my mind to think that this is the label it intentionally and thoughtfully chose.”

Rasmussen thinks there are much better labels for those who don’t feel an affinity for either of the first two teams, such as “the adults needed to supervise the behavior of Congress.” Rasmussen believes that many in Congress entered politics with good intentions but that they find themselves in a “corrupt and dysfunctional institution.” He maintains that, no matter what you call those that don’t approve of Republicans or Democrats, you need only to recognize the ineptitude of politicians of both parties to distance oneself from supporting them.

In Rasmussen’s view, Congress can’t produce a budget, can’t produce a workable health care law, both parties prop up crony capitalism, and Republicans and Democrats alike supported the NSA’s domestic spying. But what disturbs Rasmussen more than Congress’ poor performance is that the Washington Post stigmatizes those who disagree with their elitist political class world view as “haters.” The Post is wrong, according to Rasmussen. “We don’t need to hate anybody to recognize that Congress is doing a lousy job,” he remarks. “Those of us who disapprove of both parties in Congress are simply waiting for Congress to do something worthy of our approval.”"

(CNN) - Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly sparked outrage this week by insisting that Jesus and Santa Claus are both white, saying it's ""ridiculous"" to argue that depicting Christ and St. Nick as Caucasian is ""racist.""

""And by the way, for all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white,"" Kelly said, ""but this person is arguing that we should also have a black Santa.""

Kelly was responding to an article in Slate that said St. Nick needs a makeover from fat, old white guy to something less ""melanin-deficient.""

The Fox News host would have none of it.

""Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it has to change,"" Kelly said. ""Jesus was a white man, too. It's like we have, he's a historical figure; that's a verifiable fact. As is Santa, I just want kids to know that. How do you revise it in the middle of the legacy, in the story, and change Santa from white to black?""

Arguing about St. Nick, who was originally Greek before Currier & Ives got their hands on him, is one thing. But as for Jesus, people have been arguing about his skin color since the earliest days of American history. You might even call it an American tradition.

What's new about this latest brouhaha is how swiftly Kelly’s remarks were attacked. Thousands of people have rebuked her through blogs, articles, Twitter posts and Facebook updates.

Comedian Jon Stewart accused Kelly of ""going full Christmas nog.""

“And who are you actually talking to?"" Stewart said on ""The Daily Show."" ""Children who are sophisticated enough to be watching a news channel at 10 o’clock at night, yet innocent enough to still believe Santa Claus is real — yet racist enough to be freaked out if he isn’t white?”

It seems that now, if you want to call Christ — or even Santa — white, you should expect a fierce fight.

The immediate and widespread rebuttal showcases how much America has changed over the past few decades. The nation not only has a black president, but also has refused to endorse the Christian savior as white.

Since the earliest days of America, Jesus was thought of as a white man.

When white Protestant missionaries brought Bibles and whitened images of Jesus to Native Americans, at least a few mocked what they saw.

Taking the imagery seriously, the Shawnee warrior Tecumseh asked future President William Henry Harrison, “How can we have confidence in the white people? When Jesus Christ came upon the earth you kill’d and nail’d him on a cross.”

It was not until around 1900 that a group of white Americans explicitly claimed Jesus was white.

Concerned that large numbers of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, especially Jewish immigrants, were “polluting” the nation, anti-immigrant spokesmen like attorney Madison Grant asserted the whiteness of Jesus to justify calls for exclusionary legislation.

Making Jesus white was a means to distance him from Judaism.

“In depicting the crucifixion no artist hesitates to make the two thieves brunet in contrast to the blond Savior,” Grant wrote in his xenophobic best-seller ""The Passing of the Great Race.""

“This is something more than a convention,” Grant continued, and suggested that Jesus had “Nordic, possibly Greek, physical and moral attributes.”

Even Martin Luther King Jr. claimed that Jesus was white, after being asked why God created Jesus as a white man.

King responded that the color of Christ’s skin didn’t matter. Jesus would have been just as important “if His skin had been black.” He “is no less significant because His skin was white.”

Challenges to Christ’s whiteness have a long history, too.

Famed evangelist Billy Graham preached in the 1950s, and then wrote emphatically in his autobiography ""Just As I Am,"" that, “Jesus was not a white man.”

But Graham was far from the first American to contradict the whiteness of Jesus. That honor goes to Methodist and Pequot Indian William Apess.

In 1833, he wrote to white Christians, “You know as well as I that you are not indebted to a principle beneath a white skin for your religious services but to a colored one.”

Almost 100 years later, the Jamaican born, “back-to-Africa” spokesman Marcus Garvey told his followers, “Never admit that Jesus Christ was a white man, otherwise he could not be the Son of God and God to redeem all mankind. Jesus Christ had the blood of all races in his veins.”

In our age, the color of Christ has become both politically dangerous and the butt of jokes.

In 2008, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s words “God damn America” and “Jesus was a poor black boy” almost derailed then-Sen. Barack Obama from winning the Democratic primary.

Now, Kelly bears the brunt of attacks and, in no surprise, was pilloried by comedians like Stewart and Stephen Colbert.

Few Americans went on public record against King when he asserted Jesus had white skin in the 1950s. Today, thousands upon thousands from virtually every race and tribe of Americans have taken Kelly’s words seriously and seriously disdained them.

All the chatter about Jesus being white (or not) shows how much America has changed. There used to be “whites’ only” restaurants and schoolrooms. Now, even Jesus cannot be called white without repercussions.

What the debate hides, however, is what Jesus of the Bible actually did and how he related to people.

The gospels are full of discussions about Jesus and bodies. He healed the blind and those who suffered from disease. He touched and was touched by the sick. His body was pierced by thorns, a spear and nails. And he died.

READ MORE: What all those Jesus jokes tell us

The phenotype of Jesus was never an issue in the Bible. Neither Matthew, nor Mark, nor Luke, nor John mentioned Christ’s skin tone or hair color. None called him white or black or red or brown.

Obsessions about race are obsessions of our age, not the biblical one. When asked what mattered most, Jesus did not say his skin tone or body shape. He instructed his followers to “love the Lord your God with all your heart” and to “do unto others as you would have done unto you.”

Maybe this Christmas season, we can reflect not so much on whether or not Jesus was white and instead consider what it meant for him to be called the “light” of the world.

During the roll call on the tax bill, I walked into the cloakroom, and Boehner was sitting there. I said, 'This Sandy thing is really important. We've got to do something.' He said, 'Not tonight.' I asked if we were going to do it tomorrow, and he said no. He said, 'After this mess, I just can't do it tonight.'

LaTourette: He had expended a lot of political capital to get the 85 votes [on the fiscal-cliff deal], and he felt a little betrayed that the other members of the elected leadership walked on him. And the last piece was, as you saw during the Speaker election [Thursday], this sort of insurrection was forming against him.

Melvin Watt (D-North Carolina), to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He also nominated ex-telecom lobbyist Tom Wheeler as the head of the FCC. (The Washington Post)

President Obama named Rep. Melvin Watt (D-North Carolina), to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He also nominated ex-telecom lobbyist Tom Wheeler as the head of the FCC. (The Washington Post)

President Obama on Wednesday nominated telecom industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler to head the Federal Communications Commission and Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.) to be the next director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Wheeler, a venture capital investor and friend of Obama’s, will take over an agency struggling to keep up with enormous changes in the telecom industry as consumers turn to mobile devices and ultra-fast broadband Internet for news, communications and video entertainment.

Watt will be the first permanent director in nearly four years for the obscure but powerful housing regulator that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants that were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008 and today control more than half of the mortgage market. Fannie and Freddie wield great power over who gets a loan and at what cost — and, for struggling borrowers, who gets relief.

In nominating Watt, Obama noted that the congressman has served on the House Financial Services Committee during entire his 20 years in office. In that capacity, “Mel has led efforts to rein in unscrupulous mortgage lenders. He’s helped protect consumers from the kind of reckless risk-taking that led to the financial crisis in the first place. And he’s fought to give more Americans in low-income neighborhoods access to affordable housing,” the president said. “So Mel understands as well as anybody what caused the housing crisis.”

The president drew laughs as he later introduced his new FCC chairman, after praising the work of outgoing chairman Julius Genachowski.

“Now, if anybody is wondering about Tom’s qualifications, Tom is the only member of both the cable television and the wireless industry hall of fame. So he’s like the Jim Brown of telecom, or the Bo Jackson of telecom,” Obama said. “And that’s because for more than 30 years, Tom has been at the forefront of some of the very dramatic changes that we’ve seen in the way we communicate and how we live our lives.”

Obama noted Wheeler’s private- and public-sector involvement in the tech industry. “He was one of the leaders of a company that helped create thousands of good, high-tech jobs. He’s in charge of the group that advises the FCC on the latest technology issues. He’s helped give American consumers more choices and better products. So Tom knows this stuff inside and out.”

Wheeler comes to the FCC with deep ties to the nation’s biggest telecom lobbying groups. He has served as head of the wireless industry’s CTIA trade group and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, among the most powerful and deep-pocketed lobbying groups in Washington.

Those connections have raised concerns among critics of the nomination. “I am skeptical that the former chief lobbyist of the wireless and cable industries will be capable of holding his former clients accountable for their ongoing shortcomings,” said Sascha Meinrath, head of the Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation think tank.

Wheeler sits on the board of EarthLink, and his investment firm, Core Capital Partners, has invested in wireless equipment and data center technology firms.

Some experts say that range of industry experience may benefit an agency in need of greater technological and business expertise.

“He can’t be pigeonholed,” said Gigi Sohn, president of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. “He’s had a wide variety of experiences and has worked with competitive companies as well as incumbents. I truly believe he will be independent and thoughtful.”

Outgoing chairman Genachowski, who made the expansion of broadband a priority, leaves Wheeler with much unfinished business. Genachowski is expected to leave after the agency’s next public meeting on May 9.

Wheeler will inherit a contentious and drawn-out battle to auction television airwaves to wireless carriers to expand their networks. It is unclear whether TV stations are willing to sell this spectrum to make the auction, expected to take place next year, a success.

As chairman, Wheeler may also have to weigh in on the fast-changing television landscape, where traditional business models of cable and broadcast networks are being shaken up by online video providers.

Several mergers will also come before the FCC chairman for consideration, including a bidding war between Japan’s SoftBank and Dish Network over the nation’s third-largest wireless provider, Sprint.

And later this year, a federal appeals court will rule on arguments made by Verizon Wireless and MetroPCS that the FCC does not have the ability to regulate broadband Internet providers.

The agency has been under attack by phone giants who have argued that the FCC should not strap new rules to the fast-growing broadband market. But consumer groups have demanded more oversight of Internet service providers to prevent rising cable and wireless bills and a troubling lack of competition.

At the FHFA, acting director Ed DeMarco has clashed repeatedly with Obama’s economic advisers and over how far Fannie and Freddie should go to assist struggling homeowners. Obama’s team has pushed DeMarco to embrace a plan to partially forgive mortgage debt for hundreds of thousands of struggling borrowers; DeMarco has resisted, saying the move would cost the companies, and therefore taxpayers, too much.

Watt is likely to be friendlier to the administration’s views — a stance that could prompt Senate Republicans to oppose his nomination, even though he hails from Congress, a point that would augur in his favor. In Obama’s first term, Republicans refused to confirm North Carolina banking regulator Joseph Smith as Obama’s FHFA nominee, and he eventually withdrew.

After being terribly bruised in the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie have made a strong recovery and are posting billions in profits. They still owe taxpayers well over $100 billion, however, and many industry officials say there needs to be a transformation of the mortgage market in coming years so it less reliant on federally owned companies.

If confirmed, Watt would be a principal actor in this effort. He has spent 20 years on the House Financial Services and Judiciary committees, and during that time has emphasized fighting deceptive lending and financial practices. He was a key participant in crafting the Dodd-Frank act.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) applauded the nomination of Watt to head the agency, which has been without a permanent director for nearly four years.

“Congressman Watt has deep expertise in housing policy and a record of distinguished service on the House Financial Services Committee,” Cummings said.

But Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) sharply criticized Obama’s choice, saying he “could not be more disappointed in this nomination.”

“This gives new meaning to the adage that the fox is guarding the hen house,” Corker said. The FHFA should focus first on how to rein in the power of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Corker, who sits on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.

“Before any nominee should be considered for this post, regardless of their qualifications, the administration should explicitly lay out how they will unwind these entities,” he said.

One the opposite side of the political spectrum, some liberals are concerned that Watt is too close to banking interests in his home town of Charlotte to be effective at the helm of the FHFA."
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/04/23/immigration-will-continue-to-benefit-all-americans/,2013-04-23 00:00:00,['Marco Rubio'],Here's the truth about my plan for immigration reform,"Americans believe in the value of immigration. We are the most generous nation on earth to immigrants, allowing over one million people a year to come here legally. They come here in pursuit of what we recognize as the American dream – the chance to live in freedom and have the opportunity to work hard to make a better life for themselves and their families.

The problem is that our legal immigration system has been broken for decades. It has enabled 11 million people to come here illegally or overstay visas. It is a bureaucratic and inefficient system that does not address the needs of our economy.

All this has further deepened the American people’s mistrust in the ability of their government to perform basic functions.

Leaving in place a broken immigration system -– and the millions of people whose identities are a mystery to us –- is simply not an acceptable option. This must be fixed.

That is why I am advocating for securing our borders, improving enforcement, modernizing our legal immigration system and changing it so that it prioritizes welcoming people to the U.S. based on skills, not just on whether they have a family member already living here.

And that is why I support a process to identify and register those who are here illegally. They will have to submit biometric data in order to pass multiple national security and criminal background checks, pay $2,000 in fines, pay taxes, and learn English and American civics. They won’t be able to get any federal benefits like welfare or ObamaCare.

Before they can even apply to become permanent residents, they will have to wait at least ten years. They will have to get in line behind those who are trying to come the right way.

They will have to wait until we have a system in place to prevent illegal immigrants from being hired.

They will have to wait until we have a system in place to track people who overstay their visas.

And they will have to wait until we implement plans to spend at least $5.5 billion dollars to secure the border through more border patrol officers, more technology and more fencing.

I thought long and hard before taking on this issue. I understand how divisive it can be. I’ve seen how the left has used it to accuse opponents of their version of reform of being bigots and racists. And I would much rather be having a debate on the more fundamental ways we can grow our economy and get our debt and spending under control. But with or without us, the president and the Democrats who control the Senate were going to bring this issue up.

And I believe conservatives need to fight for the ideas and policies we believe are critical to fixing our immigration system.

The opponents of reform raise important points about not rewarding the violation of the law. I, too, have felt the frustration many feel that our nation’s generosity has been taken advantage of by some.

But policy-making is about solving problems. And to pick the right solution, you have to weigh the realistic alternatives. Deporting all illegal immigrants is not a practical solution. But ignoring the fact that they are here is just as bad.

For example, passing a law that only focuses on modernization and enforcement and leaves for another day the issue of those here illegally is not a good idea. Because as the enforcement measures kick in, millions of people living here illegally will be unable to work and provide for themselves and their families. The resulting humanitarian impact will then force us to scramble to address it. It is better to address it now as part of an orderly and measured process.

The only solution I know that can work is to reform legal immigration in a way that is good for the economy, do everything we can to secure the border, and allow illegal immigrants to eventually earn permanent residency by passing background checks, paying a fine, learning English and waiting at the back of the line for at least 10 years, at the same time that border security and enforcement measures are put in place to prevent this problem from happening again.

The bill I helped write is a good starting point, but it is not a take it or leave it proposition. I am open to any ideas others may have on how to do this, and I’ve been listening to the legitimate concerns people have raised with the expectation that we will be able to improve the bill as this debate continues.

We must do something to end today’s de facto amnesty, and conservative Republicans should lead on this issue. Because without conservatives at the table and in the fight, we are ceding this issue to President Obama and his allies in Congress. And as the last four years have proven, that is never a good idea."

Alexis had been hearing voices in his head and had been treated since August by the Veterans Administration for his mental problems, the officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the criminal investigation in the case was continuing.

Alexis, 34, was discharged from the Navy two years ago after serving hitches in Texas and Illinois.

He was reportedly armed with a shotgun and two handguns. Alexis sprayed bullets from the fourth floor down to the cafeteria area in the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters in southeast Washington.

The attack began just after 8 a.m. Alexis died later as he traded shots with responding police, although it was unclear if he killed himself or was brought down by cops.

He most likely gained entry into the facility with a CAC card, or a common access card. The system does not require workers to pass through a metal detector and usually only requires employees to show the card. Senior military officials tell Fox News that he most likely shot his way into building 197, because that building requires a separate pass he did not have.

Washington Mayor Vincent Gray said there was still no motive for the shootings and no indication of terrorism ""although we haven't ruled that out.""

While some neighbors and acquaintances described him as ""nice,"" his father once told detectives in Seattle that his son had anger management problems related to post-traumatic stress brought on by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He also complained about the Navy and being a victim of discrimination.

The former Navy reservist had a string of misconduct problems during his nearly three years in the military, but he received an honorable discharge.

The officials say Alexis had bouts of insubordination, disorderly conduct and was sometimes absent from work without authorization. The offenses occurred mainly when he was serving in Fort Worth, Texas, from 2008-2011, and were enough to prompt Navy officials to grant him an early discharge through a special program for enlisted personnel.

Officials said the bad conduct was enough to make it clear Alexis would not be a good sailor, but not enough to warrant a general or less-than-honorable discharge.

Late Monday, police searched a Residence Inn hotel in Southwest Washington, where Alexis had been staying for at least two days prior to the shooting. WRC reported that he had been staying with a group of five other civilian contractors, four of whom had been interviewed by police. The station also reported that Alexis' rental car had been found near the scene of the shooting and authorities were working on obtaining a search warrant for the vehicle.

In New York, the FBI interviewed Alexis's mother at her home in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.

In Fort Worth, Texas, where Alexis lived for part of his Navy stint, those who knew, or claimed to know the gunman put forth their own theories. One told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that Alexis was upset with the government because of a dispute over benefits. Another acquaintance told The Associated Press that Alexis would complain about being a victim of discrimination.

That acquaintance, Oui Suthametewakul, said Alexis lived with him and his wife from August 2012 to May 2013 in Fort Worth, but that they had to part ways because he wasn't paying his bills.

Others expressed wonder that Alexis would be linked with such a crime at all.

""Oh boy, I can’t believe this,"" Somsak Srisan, Alexis' former landlord, told the newspaper. ""He was always very polite to me.""

After leaving the naval reserves, Alexis worked as a waiter and delivery driver at the Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White Settlement, a suburb of Fort Worth. A convert to Buddhism who had visited Thailand in the past, Alexis was able to converse with Thai customers in their native language and made several friends in the local Thai community.

Hewlett-Packard issued a statement Monday saying that at the time of the shootings, Alexis worked for The Experts, a subcontractor on an HP Enterprise Services contract to refresh equipment used on the Navy Marine Corps Intranet network. The FBI said he had legitimate access to the Navy Yard ""as a result of his work as a contractor.""

Gray said those killed ranged in age from 46 to 73. Eight others were injured — three by gunshots and the other five by non-shooting causes like stress and falls.

D.C. police identified all 12 victims: Arthur Daniels, 51; Mary Francis Knight, 51; Gerald L. Read, 54; Martin Bodrog, 54; Richard Michael Ridgell, 52; Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61.

Throughout the morning and early afternoon, helicopters circled above the sprawling complex. People still trapped inside the building, where some 3,000 work every day, were told to ""shelter in place,"" as helicopters dropped baskets to pick up the wounded.

Alexis, of New York, was a Navy aviation electrician's mate, third class, who spent time in Texas and Illinois before leaving the Navy in early 2011. It was unclear why he left or if he was voluntarily discharged. He had a ""history of misconduct,"" a senior defense official told Fox News.

While stationed in Fort Worth, he was arrested on Sept. 4, 2010, after an upstairs neighbor reported that he had fired shots up into her apartment.The neighbor said Alexis had often angrily confronted her about making too much noise, and she told police he scared her.

""[The neighbor] told me that she is terrified of Aaron and feels that this was done intentionally,"" the arresting officer wrote on the police report.

In 2004, Alexis was arrested in Seattle for shooting out the tires of a construction worker's car in an incident he later described as ""an anger-fueled blackout.""

He also told Seattle police he had witnessed the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and ""how these events had disturbed him,"" according to a police report.

Alexis' father told police in 2004 his son had participated in rescue efforts during 9/11 and had suffered post traumatic stress disorder, which could not be independently confirmed.

Opponents of the bill sat in the gallery holding hangers. Among the changes Davis and others opposed: requiring abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical center and requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

In preparation for hours of speaking, Davis wore a pair of pink sneakers in place of her dress shoes. Her shoes became a symbol for abortion-rights activists.

It took not one but two special leglative sessions for the measure to pass; the first attempt was blocked following a lengthy filibuster by sneaker-wearing Sen. Wendy Davis in a near empty Senate chamber.

Texas has long been a hotbed of abortion protests, but the issue drew national attention in 2013 when new abortion restrictions were debated and then passed in the legislature. Above, opponents of the measure walk around supporters at the Capitol.

Story highlights NEW: The case would head next to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel strikes down the law's admitting privileges requirement He delivers a somewhat mixed verdict on medication-induced abortions ""Today's decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life,"" says Gov. Perry

(CNN) —

A federal judge struck down key parts of a new Texas abortion law, considered among the most restrictive in the country, on Monday, one day before they were scheduled to take effect.

The lawsuit – filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women’s health care providers across Texas – alleged the law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions.

The lawsuit specifically targets requirements under the new law that doctors obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they’re providing abortion services, and usage controls on RU486, a drug that induces abortions.

U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel blocked the law’s admitting privileges requirement, arguing that it “places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her.”

He also blocked a part of the law that deals with medication-induced abortions but allowed restrictions on the same issue to move forward. Provisions such as requiring strict use under Food and Drug Administration protocol and mandatory follow-up visits remain in place.

“The medication-abortion provisions may not be enforced against any physician who determines, in appropriate medical judgment, to perform a medication-abortion using the off-label protocol for the preservation of the life or health of the mother,” Yeakel wrote.

Abortion-rights groups say the judge did not go far enough on the issue of medication-induced abortion, believing doctors should be able to use it with few restrictions.

“Today’s ruling marks an important victory for Texas women and sends a clear message to lawmakers: it is unconstitutional for politicians to pass laws that take personal, private decisions away from women and their doctors,” Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.

“While this ruling protects access to safe and legal abortion for women in many parts of the state, part of this ruling will make it impossible for many women to access medication abortion, which is safe and effective early in pregnancy,” she said.

Conservative groups were disappointed by the ruling.

“Blocking this law only puts vulnerable women in greater danger. We are very disturbed that a judge would partially block a law that is grounded in the latest science and in common sense,” said Anna Higgins, director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council.

The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Texas Gov. Rick Perry then called the legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill.

In response to the judge’s ruling, Perry vowed he and others will keep fighting.

If the state decides to appeal, the case would head next to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

“Today’s decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life and ensure the women of our state aren’t exposed to any more of the abortion-mill horror stories that have made headlines recently,” the governor said.

He added: “We will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly-elected officials of our state, laws that reflect the will and values of Texans.”

Separately, the law prohibits abortions past 20 weeks of gestation. That ban takes effect, as scheduled, on Tuesday.

Sept. 27: “SNL” cast member Jay Pharoah tells the Grio website that he thinks the show is “too white.”

Oct. 14: Longtime cast member Kenan Thompson tells a TV Guide interviewer that he doesn’t want make up the lack of diversity in the cast on “SNL” anymore by playing black female characters.

Thursday: Civil rights group ColorofChange pens a letter to “SNL” producer Lorne Michaels asking him to address the paucity of diversity in the cast. Michaels tells the Associated Press that finding black female performers for the show is “a priority.’

Saturday: “Scandal” star Kerry Washington is the first woman of color to host the show since early 2012 (Season 37.)

On the set: movies and TV

Washington and the show’s writers wasted no time in addressing the issue in the episode. In the cold open, Washington played a luminous Michelle to Pharoah’s Barack Obama (“I feel like it’s been years since I’ve seen you!” he said to her pointedly.) However, when the script called for Oprah Winfrey to enter the scene, it became clear that Washington would have to play her as well as any other black female characters who were part of the sketch. Washington directly mentioned Thompson’s refusal to don drag, and while she quick-changed off-camera into her Winfrey costume, the show scrolled an explanation for why the sketch was occurring.

One might have expected that Washington was going to have to hurriedly come out in an increasingly disheveled array of costumes and wigs, but ultimately she only portrayed the two women (although the possibility of a Beyoncé impression was raised.) Instead, the writers made the most of their white male surplus, sending out six “All right, all right, all right”-ing Matthew McConaugheys instead. The scene was capped by a very svelte Al Sharpton addressing the audience with a stately, “What have we learned from this sketch? As usual, nothing.”

Was the scene a step in the right direction of “SNL” tackling its diversity issues, or to use Sharpton’s words, did it contribute “nothing” to the discussion (or even make light of the situation?) Obviously it would be impossible for Michaels and the “SNL” team to modify its casting decisions immediately, but pretending the tense last few weeks didn’t occur would also not be wise. It will be interesting to hear how the scene came to be written and what, if any, input Washington had in it.

Race was mentioned a few other times in the episode after the cold open, once in a talk show called “How’s He Doing?” featuring Thompson, Pharoah and Washington as “nonpartisan” black intellectual talking heads addressing the likelihood that President Obama would ever lose their support (answer: highly unlikely.) The poor, innocent television recapper was written into the sketch too, as the characters referenced how much white people love the television show “The Wire:” “I had a white friend who wrote episode recaps of the ‘The Wire’ on the Internet. Can you imagine? He would watch it, write about it, and then other people would read it!” Hey! What did TV recappers ever do to you, “SNL”? (Oh ...)

In miscellaneous but of-note news from the episode, Kanye West may not want to queue up the show on his DVR, as he was targeted twice. At the end of “How’s He Doing?” the next installment of the fake talk show promised to address, “Kim [Kardashian] and Kanye: Who do you think is the difficult one in the relationship?” Also, on Weekend Update, when discussing West’s claim that he’s reappropriating the confederate flag, Cecily Strong flashed a photo of West with Kardashian, quoting him as saying, “Whenever I see something that upsets people, I make it mine.”’

Additionally, the ghost of Miley Cyrus still cannot rest peacefully, as she was invoked in the monologue. When Vanessa Bayer came to Kerry Washington (using the skills as a fixer she picked up playing Olivia Pope), for help after punching a bouncer at “da club,” Washington advised her to leave town. “But who will play Miley?” asked Bayer. “Haven’t you played Miley enough lately?” Washington replied. The additional reminder of Cyrus’ existence was balanced out, however, by a short tribute to Lou Reed with a clip of him performing on the show.

Lady Gaga returns as host and musical guest Nov. 16. She will probably not wear anything interesting.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-predecessors-mark-opening-george-w-bush-library-165532698--politics.html,,"['Click Image To See More Photos.', 'Alex Wong Getty Images']",Obama and predecessors mark opening of George W. Bush library,"DALLAS—President Barack Obama praised his predecessor George W. Bush as a “good man” who should be commended for his resolve in trying to keep the country safe after the 9/11 attacks, and for his foresight in leading the fight for immigration reform.

Obama’s remarks came as he and the other four living presidents along with dozens of state, federal and foreign dignitaries gathered here to mark the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library on the campus of Southern Methodist University.

Obama, who has been a fierce critic of Bush’s handling of the country, and his colleagues followed the tradition of past presidential library ceremonies by putting political differences aside. Obama praised what he called Bush’s “compassion,” “generosity” and “personality,” and said, “To know the man is to like the man.”

Remarking on the rare gathering of all five presidents, Obama spoke of the “exclusive club” that he shares with Bush as well as Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter—who were also in attendance. But, he said, “it’s more like a support group.”

He recalled finding a letter in his desk from George W. Bush upon arriving in the Oval Office in 2009 offering his successor advice.

“He knew I would come to learn what he had learned,” Obama said. “Being president above all is a humbling job. There are moments when you make mistakes. There are times when you wish you could turn back the clock.”

But, Obama noted, “We love this country and we do our best.”

Obama’s remarks came after former Clinton and Carter offered similar praise of Bush. Among other things, they touted Bush’s efforts to stop the spread of AIDS in Africa.

But Clinton’s remarks seemed more like a roast of his successor, as he spoke warmly of Bush and talked about how close he had gotten to the Bush family after he defeated George H.W. Bush. He joked of being “the black sheep son” and said his mother had told him not to speak too long at the event, turning to acknowledge former first lady Barbara Bush, who giggled in response.

Story continues

He also praised George W. Bush’s recently discovered artistic skills as a painter, saying Barbara Bush had shared portraits her son had painted of animals. “I thought they were great,” Clinton said, adding that he had considered asking Bush to paint his portrait.

Clinton said he had hesitated, however, after seeing Bush’s self-portraits in the bathroom. “At my age, I think I should keep my suit,” Clinton said, as Bush laughed wildly.

A bittersweet moment came when George H.W. Bush briefly addressed the crowd, thanking them for coming. The elder Bush was hospitalized in December, and the family worried he might not make it to see his son unveil his presidential library.

From the podium later, George W. Bush praised his father for “teaching him how to be a president, but first teaching him how to be a man,” and said it was the first time in history that father-and-son presidents had attended the opening of each other’s libraries.

Addressing the crowd of more than 8,000 supporters and former staffers, Bush repeatedly became emotional as he thanked those who had turned out to mark the library’s opening. At one point he joked, “There was a time in my life when I wasn’t likely to be found in a library, much less founding one.”

In praising his ex-staffers, Bush said, “History is going to show I served with great people.” He then gave a shout-out to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who is barely mentioned in the library’s exhibits, telling him, “I’m proud to call you a friend.”

In brief remarks, Bush recalled the goals that led him while in office.

“In democracy, the purpose of public office is not to fulfill personal ambition,” he said, echoing a line that he’s used throughout his career. “Elected officials must serve a cause greater than themselves. The political winds blow left and right, polls rise and fall, supporters come and go. But in the end, leaders are defined by the convictions they held.”

At the end of his speech, Bush audibly choked up. With tears in his eyes, he returned to this seat, where he smiled and threw three fingers in the air in the shape of a”W.”"

Beyonce, James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson to sing at Obama inauguration

They'll be performing the patriotic songs, including national anthem

Public swearing-in ceremony to take place Jan. 21 at the Capitol

Beyoncé, James Taylor and Kelly Clarkson will perform the patriotic songs at the second inauguration of President Obama on Jan. 21, the inauguration committee will announce today.

Beyoncé, who's also starring at the Super Bowl halftime show next month, will sing the national anthem, always a tough tune to pull off well.

Taylor, the Sweet Baby James icon of '70s folk-rock, will sing America the Beautiful.

And Clarkson, the first winner of American Idol (2002), will sing My Country, 'Tis of Thee, the song with different lyrics but the same tune as the British national anthem. At the first Obama inaugural ceremony in 2009, soul diva Aretha Franklin sang it while wearing a memorable hat.

More announcements about entertainment at the inauguration are expected in coming days.

All this will take place during the public swearing-in ceremonies on the Capitol steps, when President Obama delivers his second inaugural address before a crowd likely to top more than 1 million.

Obama will officially take the oath of office at the White House on Jan. 20, as per the Constitution, but the repeat swearing-in ceremony, the inaugural parade, the lunch with Congress and the inaugural balls will take place on Monday.

In 2009, an estimated 1.8 million people turned up on the National Mall to watch the historic inauguration of the nation's first black president; this time, in light of the economic situation, the inauguration will be more low-key, with fewer people expected and only two official balls."

Editor’s Note: David Frum, a CNN contributor, is a contributing editor at The Daily Beast. He is the author of eight books, including a new novel, “Patriots,” and a post-election e-book, “Why Romney Lost.” Frum was a special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002.

(CNN) —

“Do the Republican and Democratic parties do an adequate job of representing the American people, or do they do such a poor job that a third major party is required?”

A record 60% of Americans now yearn for a third major party, according to Gallup. Independents, unsurprisingly, are most likely to favor a third party, but a majority of self-described Republicans say yes, too. But what do they mean by that “yes”?

Obviously, they mean many different things. Some yearn for a third party representing the Michael Bloomberg center: fiscally conservative and socially liberal like the New York City mayor.

Chuck Kennedy David Frum

But here’s a caution about third parties in American history: They are much more likely to arise on the fringes of the political system, not the center. America has seen third-party efforts by socialists and segregationists; by right-to-lifers and libertarians.

This is why you now hear so much “third party” talk coming from tea party Republicans rather than (as you might expect) the party’s subordinated pragmatists. The sensible center is much more likely to exert itself inside existing parties, as Dwight Eisenhower did for Republicans in the 1950s and as Bill Clinton did for the Democrats in the 1990s.

Pragmatists want to change the GOP so that it can win elections and govern effectively. Tea party Republicans prefer to express their principles regardless of consequences, which is why the Pew survey in September found that 71% of them favored a government shutdown even though nearly 40% of them expected that shutdown to have a “major” impact on the economy.

Third-party threats frighten Republican leaders. They remember that Ross Perot’s independent challenge badly hurt George H.W. Bush’s re-election campaign in 1992.

Canadian conservatives were locked out of power for nearly 15 years by a party split in the 1990s. British Conservatives fear that a rise in support for the United Kingdom Independence Party could drain support from Britain’s Conservative-Liberal governing coalition.

Yet politics is a complicated business, and it’s not always true that a party is weakened by the departure of its most extreme supporters.

Consider, for example, the case of the Democratic Party in the election of 1948. That year, the Democrats faced two groups that bolted.

To protest President Harry Truman’s turn to support civil rights, southern Democrats coalesced as a “States’ Rights” party and nominated South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond for president.

Left-liberal Democrats angered by Truman’s tough Cold War foreign policy created an “American Labor” party and nominated former vice president Henry Wallace.

Together, Thurmond and Wallace took almost 5% of the vote in 1948. Thurmond carried four Deep South states and 7% of the Electoral College.

Yet Truman survived. In fact, there’s a reasonable argument that Truman was actually helped by these third- and fourth-party challenges.

In 1948, African-Americans remained very much a swing constituency. Hundreds of thousands of black Americans had moved north and gained voting rights in the 30 years between 1917 and 1948. As a group, they tended to prefer the New Deal policies of the Democratic Party, but they deeply distrusted that party’s Southern white supremacist wing.

Truman was a card-carrying member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans who had adopted the civil rights cause late in his career. Could he really be trusted? Truman’s willingness to face down Thurmond convinced many Northern blacks that he could be. He carried an estimated 77% of the black vote in the North, and those votes provided the margin of victory in the three crucial states of California, Illinois and Ohio. Those three states provided 73 electoral votes in total, and they were each won by Truman with a margin of less than 1%.

Meanwhile, the Wallace challenge helped Truman with more conservative voters. Truman had initiated the Marshall Plan and the Berlin Airlift, yet some questioned whether the Democrats were tough enough on communism – an important question among voters of eastern European origin in states like Wisconsin and Michigan.

With Wallace vehemently denouncing Truman as too tough on the Soviet Union – sometimes in speeches that echoed the editorials of the newspaper of the American Communist Party – Truman gained the same kind of political cover on his right flank that Thurmond had provided him on his left.

The result, everybody knows.

Right now, tea party extremism contaminates the whole Republican brand. It’s a very interesting question whether a tea party bolt from the GOP might not just liberate the party to slide back to the political center – and liberate Republicans from identification with the Sarah Palins and the Ted Cruzes who have done so much harm to their hopes over the past three election cycles.

It’s worth repeating over and over again. Add Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, Sharron Angle in Nevada and Ken Buck in Colorado, Christine O’Donnell in Delaware and Joe Miller in Alaska – and you have half a dozen Senate races lost to the GOP by extremist nominations.

Maybe the right answer to the threat, “Shut down the government or we quit” is: “So sad you feel that way. Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.”

Editor’s Note: Amanda Reiman is the California policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance and a lecturer in the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley.



(CNN) —

Today, April 20, is “420: International Marijuana Day.” Festivals and marches are planned around the world. The number 420 reflects the date, but it also represents the term’s clandestine origin in the 1970s, brought about by laws that still plague cannabis consumers today.

In 1971, a group of high school friends, the “Waldos,” invented 420 as a code word for smoking pot. Referring to 4:20 p.m. after school, the friends from San Rafael, California, would meet to smoke marijuana in their secret spot next to a wall – the origin of their nickname. In the 40 years since, 420 has spread to become an international symbol for using marijuana, and it’s a part of the cannabis consumer’s vocabulary.

Threatened with jail and unemployment, people who use marijuana in most states must hide their activities. In 2011, more than 750,000 people were arrested for marijuana possession and sales in the United States. In 2010, 86% of those charged for possession in New York City were black or Latino. That, even though these groups represent about half the city’s population and use marijuana less than whites.

Amanda Reiman

But, slowly, support for cannabis regulation is growing.

A recent Pew research poll found that 52% of Americans support taxing and regulating marijuana, a historic high. It isn’t that more people are using marijuana – those rates have remained stable – it’s that more people feel they can come out of the closet about their support for marijuana policy reform.

Websites like the Marijuana Majority feature statements from celebrities and politicians in favor of marijuana policy reform, across the political spectrum, from Bill Maher to Pat Robertson. No longer a part of a fringe, those who see a better way to regulate marijuana are casting aside the secret codes and openly declaring support.

The marijuana flag was waving proudly on Election Day, when Colorado and Washington became the first states where voters approved taxing and regulating marijuana for adult use. Two recently introduced pieces of federal legislation would protect medical marijuana states from federal interference and end federal marijuana prohibition.

As can be imagined, the April 20 celebrations across Colorado and Washington, as well as other “marijuana friendly” states like California and Oregon, will be joyful, well attended and burgeoning with cannabis products. It might even feel as if marijuana is already legal – but it isn’t, and, in some states, the need for secret codes is still very much alive.

In Oklahoma, manufacturing hash carries a mandatory two-year prison term but can also mean life in prison. Under Louisiana law, a second pot possession conviction is classified as a felony offense, punishable by up to five years in prison. Three-time offenders face up to 20 years in prison. And in Florida, possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana, as well as the cultivation of even a single plant, is a felony offense and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

What this means, despite Colorado and Washington, is that April 20 brings a chance to stop and reflect on the draconian marijuana laws still threatening so many Americans.

In addition to the lives harmed by arrests and incarceration, the economic costs of prohibition are enormous. The war on drugs has cost at least $1 trillion since it was announced in 1971 by President Nixon.

The term 420 began as a secret code. But 40 years later, in some states the need for a code has given way to “cannabis pride” and open celebration. In other places, people will smoke or otherwise consume pot in private parties. And for those in prison and jails and for their loved ones, it will be just another sad day.

Make this April 20, as the numbers of pro-legalization supporters swell, the day to join the Drug Policy Alliance in promoting the legalization of marijuana for all adults and an end to the war on drugs.

At least five other states also sell the specialty plates: Arizona, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. But in Virginia, the tag ranks No. 2 among such plates approved in the past five years and ninth among more than 200 total.

The tag was issued to roughly 21,800 Virginia-registered vehicles in just the first 20 months of sales, according to state figures reported by The Virginian-Pilot newspaper.

“It is a symbol of frustration … a symbol of disgust with the government,” David Dwyer, a former Hampton Roads Tea Party chairman, told the newspaper.

The sales figures for the “Don’t Tread on Me” plates indicate more than just Tea Party members are buying them, which Dwyer suggests is an indication the movement’s mantra of less-government and no new taxes resonates with many Americans.

“I’m seeing [the tags] everywhere now,” added Hampton Roads Tea Party chairman Keith Freeman.

The state approved the logo, which resembles the rattlesnake-emblazoned historic Gadsden Flag, in 2011, after the movement helped Republicans win back the House a year earlier in the landslide, mid-term elections.

However, this was a tough year for conservative voters in Virginia. Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe in November in a race many political strategists called a test case for the 2016 elections.

Several other Virginia specialty plates with political themes are less popular, compared to the one with the Revolutionary-era “Don’t Tread on Me” flag.

Roughly 1,600 vehicles have the abortion-rights “Trust Women/Respect Choice” plate while about 5,400 have the anti-abortion “Choose Life” message, according to the paper.

The state’s specialty plates cost an additional $10, though some revenue-sharing tags cost more."

Yes, it was sad that the mail carrier wouldn’t be dropping off letters on Saturday anymore, but scaling back to five days was a necessary concession to the agency’s financial problems and a reflection of changes in communication wrought by the Internet.

But not everyone saw it that way: The unions representing postal employees and their champions on Capitol Hill were especially determined to block the change, and a continuing resolution passed by Congress last month prohibited the USPS from curtailing service. On Wednesday, the Board of Governors of the Postal Service bowed to Congress’ will, while warning that it will be impossible for the agency to meet its cost-reduction goals without changes in the delivery schedule.

Unless Congress is willing to approve an infusion of government funds for the service — which receives no taxpayer support for its day-to-day operations — it should back off and allow the Postal Service to introduce sensible efficiencies. By moving to five-day delivery of mail (while continuing parcel delivery six days a week), the Postal Service hoped to save $2 billion a year. That would be a significant contribution to the service’s solvency.

Before the advent of email, eliminating one day’s mail delivery would have imposed a significant hardship on American households. That wouldn’t be the case today, when Americans can communicate on their telephones as well as their computers.

The advent of email and the emergence of private delivery companies have deprived the Postal Service of revenue. That fact, combined with the Postal Service’s responsibilities for retiree health benefits, has already required it to make significant cutbacks. Even so, the agency lost nearly $16 billion last year and the Board of Governors has directed management to try to reopen contract negotiations with unions.

Although critics of the elimination of Saturday mail couched their objections in terms of customer service, much of the opposition actually reflects the desire on the part of workers and their union to preserve hundreds of thousands of relatively well-paying government jobs. But the Postal Service’s primary purpose isn’t to serve as an employment agency; it’s to provide an appropriate level of service to its millions of customers. As we have observed before, the scope and nature of that service needs to be reconsidered, perhaps radically. Rightly or wrongly, Congress has entrusted the responsibility for that reappraisal to a quasi-independent agency that is responsible for managing its own financial affairs.

Boehner declined to answer whether he supports what many on the left have come to term a “pathway to citizenship” for illegal immigrants during his appearance on CBS News’ Face The Nation on Sunday morning. For conservative lawmakers, that does not assuage fears that he and his deputies House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Whip Kevin McCarthy, and Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan could be working behind the scenes cut a deal with Reid and President Barack Obama to achieve amnesty for illegal immigrants in America.

“We are scared to death of what we figure is already Boehner’s end game,” a senior congressional GOP aide told Breitbart News. “There are so many forces within the GOP establishment pushing for their interests that it’s hard to conceive that Boehner will not cave to them.”

Boehner could “conference” any bill or group of bills the House passes related to immigration with the Senate’s controversial immigration bill. In conference, representatives for House GOP leadership would negotiate with Senate Democratic leadership, and potentially the White House, on what they would call a “compromise” on immigration reform.

Conservatives do not trust Boehner and his team to stand up to Senate Democrats in conference, so they are advocating the House refuse to pass any legislation for fear it could be molded into a “compromise” that looks just like or is identical language to the Senate bill.

Many conservatives fear that such a compromise would only get a short amount of time for actual review, and votes would be whipped up and sold using talking points just like how the Senate bill passed. They point to comments from Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), whose amendment with Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) made a series of massive changes to the bill, where he argued that it is acceptable for senators to work with because they “will have more than 72 hours to read and review the proposal before any votes.”

“The worry among Capitol Hill conservatives was that Boehner would take any House-passed bill with the word ‘immigration’ in it and set up a conference that would produce a bill with the trappings of compromise that would be politically difficult to oppose,” conservative journalist Neil McCabe, a former senior reporter for Human Events, wrote in a recent column for Town Hall magazine.

McCabe’s column, titled “Stockman calls out Boehner gambit to save amnesty agenda,” focuses on efforts Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) has led to uncover how the Senate immigration bill is unconstitutional on the grounds that it raises revenue. As Breitbart News reported last week, House Ways and Means Committee chairman Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), the House authority on tax and revenue issues, agreed with Stockman’s analysis and similarly labeled the bill unconstitutional.

However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid can protect the bill, and a future deal with House GOP leaders, by using a procedural trick in which he holds on to the bill in his chamber of Congress and does not send it over to the House. Though the bill passed the Senate several weeks ago now, Reid has not yet delivered it to the House.

Boehner has not agreed to refuse to salvage the Senate bill, as conservatives like Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) have requested. All indications are that such a conference would not happen until sometime after the August recess, as the opposition to amnesty has slowed proponents of the effort.

Conservative columnist and best-selling author Ann Coulter, who has been warning for months about such a conference strategy by amnesty advocates, believes the House should not pass any immigration bills, regardless of their individual merit. She argues that pro-amnesty lawmakers may use a conference as a vehicle to get the Senate bill or something like it to President Barack Obama’s desk, where he can sign it into law.

“Right now, people who don’t want amnesty have to call the House and say they don’t want any immigration bill until we have a Republican Senate,” Coulter said in a late-June appearance on Fox News Channel’s Hannity. “If they pass a bill that does nothing but enforce e-verify, does nothing but enforce the fence, it will go into conference with the Senate and it will come out an amnesty bill.”

Coulter added that she suspects Boehner “secretly wants” amnesty for illegal immigrants:

Nothing will happen with a vote to enforce E-verify, which by the way is a one-page simple bill; they could do that right away if they were serious about enforcing the border. But I don’t trust and perhaps I’m wrong, I hope he will prove me wrong. I think John Boehner secretly wants the amnesty and he want as fig leaf to make it took like, “Oh, no we just voted on the fence.” No, a vote on the fence in the House is a vote for amnesty.

“Ann Coulter got it exactly right,” added that senior GOP congressional aide who warned that Republicans are “scared to death” about what Boehner could do."

Christie blames speaker for delay in hurricane aid vote

Governor seeking re-election this year

'I love my party,' he says

TRENTON, N.J. -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's excoriation of House Speaker John Boehner commanded national attention Wednesday — carried live by CNN, making his last name one of the top trending words on Twitter for the rest of the day, analyzed and deconstructed by countless pundits and columnists.

One question raised in some quarters was whether Christie, a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, had hurt himself in GOP circles by bashing his party's House speaker, who already was politically wobbled from the conclusion of the ""fiscal cliff"" showdown.

Christie said in a Friday interview that he has no concerns that he damaged himself among Republicans nationally.

""I think what right-thinking Republicans will understand is that I'm representing my people, and that that's got to be my first and most important job,"" Christie said. ""I think the second thing that right-thinking Republicans will come to the conclusion of is that the speaker made a mistake, not only by pulling the vote but by pulling the vote and not even discussing it with anybody first.""

On Wednesday, Christie blamed the ""toxic"" nature of Congress and ""palace intrigue"" in Washington for Congress' failure to vote on aid to those affected by Hurricane Sandy.

""There's only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims: The House majority and their speaker, John Boehner,"" Christie said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon in Trenton.

Congress approved $9 billion in aid Friday.

Within New Jersey, the comments are unlikely to hurt Christie, who is seeking re-election this year.

""I don't have to worry ... too much. I think if you try to think about these things too hard, you wind up not being yourself. And I have no interest in not being myself,"" Christie said. ""If it angers some Republicans, I'm sorry. I don't think it should. I think they'd want their governor to do exactly the same thing in the same circumstances. In fact, they would expect him or her to do that, so they shouldn't have any different expectations of me.

""I love my party. I'm a Republican,"" he said. ""I have great respect for the speaker, but he just was wrong on this one.""

The governor said his office received 800 supportive emails and 1,000 phone calls from New Jersey residents the afternoon of the news conference and only a few negative reactions, all from out-of-state."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/16/justice/witness-protection-program/index.html,2013-02-16 00:00:00,['Gabriel Falcon'],Inside the witness protection program,"Story highlights Federal witness protection program helps government witnesses get new identities People in program need protection because they've testified against criminals Most people in the program aren't law-abiding citizens, program's creator says ""These people truly are in danger,"" a U.S. Marshals Service official says

Ever imagined what it would be like to be someone else for a day? How about for the rest of your life?

That’s the reality for the thousands who have entered the federal witness protection program since it started in 1971.

Officially called the Witness Security Program, it provides protection for government witnesses who are at risk due to testimony they’ve given about terrorists or criminals.

“No one knows what we do to protect witnesses, and it’s good for us,” said David Harlow, associate director for operations with the U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees the vast program.

“It’s about taking people and changing their way of life,” Harlow added. “These people truly are in danger.”

More than 18,400 men, women and children have participated in it, and not one of the 8,500 witnesses or the 9,900 family members has been harmed, according to the U.S Marshals Service. “It’s a big feather in our cap,” Harlow said.

The program has made some limited information available to the public on its website: It provides 24-hour protection to all witnesses while they are in a high-threat environment; witnesses receive financial assistance for housing and subsistence for basic living expenses and medical care; the program also provides for job training and employment assistance.

In an interview with CNN, Gerald Shur, who created the program, offered insight into the inner workings of this secretive government service.

Shur was an attorney in what was then the Justice Department’s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section in the 1960s when he developed the idea to protect witnesses.

“It occurred to me that we have to have a way that if a guy is in danger because of his testimony, we have to get him out of there, and in a second,” said Shur, 79, who is now retired.

But the transition to a new life doesn’t always come easily, he said.

“It takes time for them to adjust, ” Shur said. “(A witness) not only has to deal with leaving his entire family, but he has caused his wife to leave her family; he’s caused his children to leave their grandparents. They can’t communicate. They can’t see each other. But the driving force is ‘If I go back, I’ll be murdered.’ ”

Most witnesses who enter the program are not law-abiding citizens, according to Shur.

“Ninety-five percent of them are what we call criminals,” he said. “Not everybody is a killer or a member of the Hell’s Angels or the mob, but there are people who are doing business with criminals.

“They might say they were legitimate businessmen, but they would bribe people,” Shur said, recalling the case of an engineer who bought off a mayor.

“He said it wasn’t bad because that’s how you do business in the city. In his mind, he wasn’t doing anything criminal,” Shur said.

While most witnesses are familiar with the criminal justice system, their loved ones are not and often must accept being completely cut off from everyone they know. “You’re talking about wives, children, grandchildren – they are the really innocent people,” Shur said, “They are in it for life, as far as I was concerned.”

The program is also completely voluntary. While witnesses and their family members are free to return to their former identities, they do so at their own peril, Shur said.

“I’ve had witnesses ask me if it’s safe to go home. I never said yes. I always felt there was a risk still there,” Shur said, “and that if a defendant against whom they testified is dead, there may be a family member out to get revenge or somebody within his organization who wants to be a hero of some sort and kill him.”

Shur recalled two instances when witnesses refused protection. “(One witness) went back to his home and turned the doorknob and it blew up. And there was another witness – we tried to talk her into it. She refused and she was murdered.”

Henry Hill, the gangster who was the inspiration for the 1990 film “Goodfellas,” opted out of the witness protection program, as did mob turncoat Sammy “the Bull” Gravano.

But those witnesses’ decisions to leave the program make them the exception to the rule, Shur said.li

After a witness agrees to testify for the prosecution, he or she may be eligible to start receiving protection. Shur described an effective way of choosing where to relocate a witness.

“I would say to them, ‘Tell me what’s your favorite place in the U.S.?’ ” Shur said, “and they’d say, ‘I always wanted to go to Hawaii,’ or that they had family in Texas or Florida. And in my mind that’s three places that they are not going. Because when you tell me you want to go to Hawaii, I know you have told all your friends that.”

Deputy marshals take the witness and the witness’ family and move them to another area, Shur said. Sometimes, they start in a hotel. Sometimes, they are near other witnesses – although they’d never know it, he added.

“In the beginning when the witnesses were moved off to another city, we’d run into the problems you would expect – what to do about a driver’s license, Social Security cards, how do you get him a job, money, what happens if you need Medicare care, what about the house he owns, the furniture, and so on.”

Witnesses get help finding a job, but they aren’t always compensated.

“The program has nothing to do with reward money, nothing. They get money for a period of time, and then it stops,” Shur said. “We used a formula. If you are a family of four in New York, you would get more money than a family of four from Corpus Christi. It’s based on cost of living, and it wasn’t based on the value of the testimony.”

Shur said his work protecting witnesses put his family’s life in danger. “There was a threat against my wife. I was told that there was an individual who had my name and my wife’s name in his address book and that he had a contract from the Medellin Cartel to kidnap my wife and learn where a particular witness was living. And I immediately asked for protection for my wife.”

Today’s witness protection program faces the added burdens of the digital age. Facebook, Google, texting and the instant access to information via the Internet and smartphones provide new challenges to keep the identities of witnesses a secret.

“The modern world of technology, because there is more information out there, it’s that much more important for our people to be vigilant and for us to be vigilant,” said Harlow of the U.S. Marshals Service.

Vigilance plays a role, but Shur suggested another factor may also play an important role.

“Luck, you have to throw in some luck,” he said. “You can’t go this many years with this many witnesses without some luck in this thing.”"

A new Dove campaign says yes -- and offers proof, in the form of forensic sketches.

Dove recruited seven women of different ages and backgrounds and had FBI-trained forensic artist Gil Zamora create composite sketches of them based on descriptions of their own facial features. In the above video, produced for the campaign, you can hear the women use phrases like ""my mom told me I had a big jaw,"" ""I kind of have a fat, rounder face,"" ""I'd say I have a pretty big forehead.""

""We really weren't sure what was going on,"" Kela Cabrales, a 40-year-old technology teacher and digital artist who appears in the video, told HuffPost Women. ""They asked me to describe myself and use neutral terms and 'just the facts' sort of descriptions.""

Earlier in the day, the women had been asked to spend time with strangers, though neither party was told why. These strangers were later brought one by one into a room with Zamora and asked to describe the women who had been sketched earlier. The two resulting drawings of each woman were then hung side-by-side -- and the contrast is pretty stark. The tagline of the campaign is: ""You are more beautiful than you think."" (Scroll down for more of the sketches.)

It's worth noting that Dove is owned by Unilever -- the same company that owns Axe, king of misogynistic ads that use headless breasts and ""flirty girls"" to hawk its products. However, despite the obvious commercial intentions behind this campaign, the message rings true and is a refreshing departure from the many female-targeted ads that try to shame women into buying things.

And it's women's existing shame that the Dove campaign does a good job of exposing through its sketches. ""I probably beat myself up way more than I should,"" Cabrales acknowledged to HuffPost Women. ""I see my 8-year-old daughter, and she’s so happy and confident, and naturally exudes this beauty. And when I see her I feel like, 'Oh god, what pitfalls did I fall into, and how can I keep that from happening to her?' I don’t know what they are -- I wish I did. I really want to protect her.""

Chris Christie permitted under law to appoint temporary replacement

(CNN) —

Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat associated with major legislative achievements over five terms in the U.S. Senate and the chamber’s last surviving World War II veteran, died on Monday of viral pneumonia, his office said.

Lautenberg, 89, missed key Senate votes late last year during a weeks-long absence because of a cold that turned into what he called a “severe case of bronchitis with fluid in the chest.” He also battled stomach cancer in recent years.

He announced in a statement in February that he would not seek re-election next year, but he continued to push for stronger gun control laws.

After last month’s Boston Marathon bombings, Lautenberg said he would reintroduce legislation to require background checks for sales of explosive powder.

An influential businessman-turned-legislator, Lautenberg scored big victories in Congress, including a ban on smoking on airplanes, preventing domestic abusers from possessing guns, cracking down on drunken driving, and the “Toxic Right to Know” law about the release of pollutants into communities.

“Frank Lautenberg has been one of the most productive senators in the history of this country,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in December 2011 on the occasion of Lautenberg’s 9,000th vote, the statement by Lautenberg’s office said.

On Monday, political colleagues and foes lauded Lautenberg as a passionate advocate for the issues he championed.

Lautenberg: The last ‘swamp dog’

“He improved the lives of countless Americans with his commitment to our nation’s health and safety, from improving our public transportation to protecting citizens from gun violence to ensuring that members of our military and their families get the care they deserve,” said a statement by President Barack Obama, a former senator.

Secretary of State John Kerry, in remarks to reporters, called his longtime fellow Democratic senator “tenacious as a legislator” and someone who “never forgot where he came from.”

In particular, Kerry cited Lautenberg’s advocacy for environmental issues and his spirited defense of Kerry’s military record when it came under attack by Republicans in the 2004 presidential election campaign.

“He was as loyal as he was patriotic,” Kerry said, also noting how “during the years when Frank was going through chemotherapy and he was weakened by cancer, he was still down there on the floor of the United States Senate floor fighting on every environmental debate late into the night.”

New Jersey’s Republican governor, Chris Christie, told a GOP event on Monday that he often disagreed politically with Lautenberg, but he respected the senator’s battling spirit.

“We had some good fights over our time – battles on philosophy and the role of government,” Christie said. “I think the best way to describe Frank Lautenberg and the way he would probably want to be described to all of you today is as a fighter. Senator Lautenberg fought for the things he believed in and sometimes he just fought because he liked to.”

Lautenberg leaves tricky political question for Christie

According to New Jersey law, Christie can appoint a temporary replacement to serve until a special election in November or fill the rest of Lautenberg’s term, which expires next year.

With the likelihood that Christie will appoint a Republican, the Democratic majority in the 100-member Senate would decrease to 52, along with two independents who caucus with the Democrats.

Possible GOP appointees would include state Sens. Thomas Kean Jr. and Joe Kyrillos, a Christie ally who lost to Democrat Bob Menendez in the Senate race last year; Lt Gov. Kim Guadagno, and Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick.

On the Democratic side, Newark Mayor Cory Booker announced in January he intended to run for the Senate next year, which caused a public tiff with Lautenberg, who later decided against seeking re-election.

The son of Russian and Polish immigrants, Lautenberg grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, and enlisted in the military at 18, his office said. He was a member of the United States Army Signal Corps from 1942 to 1946, according to his biography.

After the military, he graduated from Columbia University with the help of the GI Bill, then joined with two boyhood friends to start payroll processing firm Automatic Data Processing, or ADP, which grew into one of the world’s largest computing services companies.

Lautenberg was first elected to the Senate in 1982 and won re-election twice. He did not seek re-election in 2000 when his third term expired, but was recruited to run again two years later after Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli quit his re-election bid weeks before the polls opened amid reports of ethical issues. Lautenberg was then re-elected in 2008.

Survivors include his wife, Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg; six children; and 13 grandchildren, the office statement said.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the same research that reportedly found that Hasselbeck's conservative perspective was alienating some viewers also found that co-host Joy Behar's liberal stances were not sitting well with audiences.

Last week, Behar made headlines when she announced she would be leaving ""The View"" when her contract expires in August. Behar cited her 16-year history on the show and said she looked forward to working on her stand-up and other projects. ""You can't stay forever on a show,"" she said on ""Good Morning America.""

One day after Behar's announcement, reports surfaced that Hasselbeck was also leaving ""The View"" after research revealed that her conservative perspective was clashing with audience members. On Monday's show, co-host Barbara Walters insisted that Hasselbeck was not leaving the show, but many in the media still believe that her contract will not be renewed. Walters also said that the program values Hasselbeck and her conservative points of view.

The Hollywood Reporter's Marisa Guthrie looked further into the research behind the sudden influx of announcements. She reported:

Earlier this TV season, ABC's The View commissioned a study that showed many viewers are turned off by the political debates that have defined the morning talk show ... Longtime panelists Behar and Hasselbeck on the left and right, respectively, were deemed too ""polarizing,"" according to several sources.

It's unclear if the research prompted Behar's decision to leave the show. Many names have been floated as Behar's replacement including Brooke Shields and Roseanne Barr."

""Late Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Teresa Heinz Kerry was taken by ambulance to Nantucket Cottage Hospital, accompanied by her husband, Secretary of State John Kerry,"" John Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson said in a statement. ""Once doctors had stabilized her condition, she was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, again accompanied by the Secretary. The family is grateful for the outpouring of support it has received and aware of the interest in her condition, but they ask for privacy at this time.""

Heinz Kerry was admitted into the emergency room at Nantucket Cottage Hospital after 3:30 p.m. Sunday, hospital spokesman Noah Brown said

Heinz Kerry arrived at the facility in critical condition, and remained that way early Sunday evening, although doctors had stabilized her, Brown said.

Brown said he could not immediately release any more details about the patient's condition or her illness.

Nantucket Police Lt. Jerry Adams said a call requesting medical aid was received just after 3:30 p.m. for a home on Hulbert Avenue, and an ambulance was dispatched. Online records show the property is connected to Heinz Kerry's family.

Heinz Kerry is the widow of former U.S. Senator John Heinz, heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune. She married John Kerry in 1995.

Doctors treated her for breast cancer in December 2009.

She previously has said she found in late September that year that she had cancer in her left breast after having her annual mammogram.

A month later, she underwent lumpectomies on both breasts at a Washington hospital after doctors also discovered what they thought was a benign growth on her right breast.

That diagnosis was initially confirmed in postoperative pathology, but two other doctors later found it to be malignant.

In November 2009, Heinz Kerry had another pair of lumpectomies performed at Massachusetts General Hospital.

John Kerry has been at the Nantucket home since returning from nearly two-week around-the-world diplomatic trip to the Mideast and Southeast Asia in the pre-dawn hours of July 3.

Before his wife's medical problem, he had planned to return to Washington on Monday and then co-host with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew high-level strategic and economic talks with senior Chinese officials on Wednesday and Thursday.

Kerry had also spoken of his desire to make his sixth trip to Israel as secretary starting at the end of the week. State Department officials said Kerry's schedule is now influx pending developments with his wife's health.

From comments:

From comments:



Shocking animal ooga booga's promoting other animal ooga booga's.

Thought Tom Perez was Radical? Meet Debo Adegbile:



But in the Obama Justice Department, the law is not as important as the cause. And with Adegbile, the cause is racialist.

We are already aware of the animus against Barack Obama's paternity, and the Kenyan father he never knew, along with the birther conspiracy theory about his nativity. So many of the racist depictions of him as an ape, simian-like, or a savage with a bone in his nose, are deeply rooted in ideations about the Dark Continent , used to maintain slavery and white supremacy.

There have been numerous studies that prove having a non-WASP name affects getting hired, an interview for a job, or entry to a specific college or university. Of course, historically that was true for names that sounded Irish or Jewish. I was fortunate to have the surname Oliver, though after marrying and becoming a hyphenated Velez, slurs of ""sp*c"", have increased.

Adegbile faces a formidable array of rationales for the vituperation unleashed against him. Bad enough to be black in America, a child of a mixed race union, and to have a clearly African first and surname, coupled with the hated resume of tenure with the NAACP, and his support of voting rights.

He expressed that support clearly in an interview done at NYU when he was chosen as Alumnus of the Month for July 2010.



Q: You also were involved in voting rights cases with the LDF during the 2000 presidential election and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. What draws you to these kinds of cases? A. Voting rights fascinated me when I studied the topic in my constitutional law class with Professor Christopher L. Eisgruber. Leaders like Martin Luther King and Thurgood Marshall knew that individuals’ ability to express their political voices was essential to take down the racial caste system of Jim Crow. So many of the civil rights leaders understood that having a vote—having an ability to pick leaders and to have a full measure of citizenship—was essential to ensuring equality, not just in the moment but in the future. That lesson was not lost on me. Q: How did you develop an interest and expertise in voting rights law? When I studied at NYU, I had a chance to take a couple of wonderful classes on race and the law in the United States and South Africa with the late, great A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., and later I practiced with him at the Paul, Weiss law firm. He was the former Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. He spent his career working as a civil rights lawyer and a federal judge, and was a passionate and unyielding voice for equality in the United States. He was very involved in a number of voting cases and was very passionate in defending the voting rights of African Americans, especially in the twilight of his career. I got to work with him as a summer associate and then as an associate at Paul, Weiss, and through that experience I participated in my first case with the LDF. So that experience set me on a path of not only caring deeply about these issues, but having an opportunity to become involved in the continuing struggle for equality.

In 1966, founders Gus and Marty Trowbridge set out to create an independent school where equality, social justice, a diverse community, and the inspiration of Martin Luther King, Jr. would form the basis for childrens’ education. Four decades later, at a school with no racial majority, that dream has become a vibrant reality for nearly 200 students every year.

A: I auditioned for Sesame Street during the first or second season the show was on the air. A big ""cattle call"" went out in New York City because they were looking for more kids. Off to the audition I went, and I guess I made it through without wrecking the set or acting too unruly. I filmed episodes for nine years. At NYU, I distinctly remember taking a workshop from placement services early in my time at NYU. Their advice was to take anything you’ve done that’s interesting or different and put it on your résumé, because law firms get a lot of résumés and after a while they all start to look alike. On the strength of that advice, I put Sesame Street on my résumé. And true to form, in almost every interview, it was a substantial part of the focus. I guess that talking about the show was a lot more interesting than my views on the law or my command of legal topics – I suspect that is still the case. So in some way, I owe my career success to attending that workshop and heeding that advice.

Adegbile was exposed very early in life to concepts of justice and equality. He is an alumnus of Manhattan Country School , and sits on their board of directors. The school's mission statement reflects the man he is:Of course his childhood association with Big Bird may not win him any applause on the right either ;)The good news on his nomination and future confirmation is that given the rules change in the U.S. Senate, he may not be blocked.

I never had the pleasure of seeing it before.” So said the abolitionist John Brown gazing out over the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, on a December morning in 1859. Americans have always reacted that way to their native land. It was their great possession. Europe had history stretching back into time. America had earth, here and now all potential, paradisally green.

And if people took this bounty for granted, were too busy to stop and look, that’s where artists came in, as they regularly did in the first half of the 19th century, to advertise the New Eden: illuminate it, enhance it, edit out flaws, say in paint, “This is ours!” In front of panoramic pictures by the likes of Alfred Bierstadt and Frederic Church even citizens who rarely ventured beyond city parks or their own backyards lingered, enthralled.

The enthrallment didn’t last much into the second half of the century. And for Brown it lasted only hours. He made his comment to the jailer who was taking him, in an open cart, to the gallows to be hanged for murder, treason and inciting slave rebellion after his Harpers Ferry raid. With his death, which many consider a spark that fired the Civil War, the American landscape began to change, topographically, politically and psychologically.

That change is the subject of a perspective-altering show called “The Civil War and American Art” at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, one of many events marking the 150th anniversary of the explosive 1863 arrival, during the Civil War, of the Emancipation Proclamation. On the surface the show looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs; they’re classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation’s single greatest internal catastrophe, and that’s what we learn here."

He sang carols, opened presents with his family, and visited a nearby military base to wish the troops “Mele Kalikimaka” — the Hawaiian phrase meaning “Merry Christmas.”

But the one thing the president and his family did not do — something they have rarely done since he entered the White House — was attend Christmas church services.

“He has not gone to church hardly at all, as president,” said Gary Scott Smith, the author of “Faith and the Presidency: From George Washington to George W. Bush,” adding that it is “very unusual for a president not to attend” Christmas services.

Historically, watching the nation’s first family head to church dressed in their Sunday best, especially around the holiday season, was something of a ritual. Yet Mr. Obama’s faith is a more complicated, more private, and perhaps — religious and presidential historians say — a more inclusive affair."

USA TODAY

Two dozen people died in last week%27s twister

An estimated 1%2C200 homes were destroyed

President toured storm damage and met with families

MOORE, Okla. — During a firsthand look Sunday afternoon at the devastation from last week's violent tornado, President Obama praised Oklahomans for their resolve while consoling victims and promising continued help.

""I'm just a messenger here today, letting everybody here know that you are not alone, that you've got folks behind you,"" Obama said. ""Obviously, the damage here is pretty hard to comprehend. Our hearts go out to the families who have been impacted, including those who had loved ones who were lost.""

Obama, who flew from Washington to nearby Tinker Air Force Base, spent several hours in the area. He walked through one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods in the Oklahoma City suburb and toured the ruins of Plaza Towers Elementary School, which was destroyed. He later visited a local fire station that has been used as a command post. There he thanked first responders and met with families of seven children who died at the school.

Twenty-four people died in the storm, which has been classified as a top-of-the-scale EF5 and which cut a path 17 miles long and was at times more than a mile wide, turning entire city blocks into one big pile of rubble. Officials estimate as many as 1,200 homes were destroyed.

""This is a strong community with strong character,"" Obama said during his brief remarks, delivered against a backdrop of twisted and torn metal and concrete of Plaza Towers Elementary. ""There's no doubt they're going to bounce back — but they need help.""

A few minutes earlier, Obama had walked along Eagle Drive, a block from the elementary school. Along with local officials, including Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and Moore Mayor Glenn Lewis, Obama walked slowly through the rubble, stopping several times to inspect the debris.

Obama spent a few moments with the Lewis family, which lost their home on SW 14th Street, just behind Plaza Towers Elementary. Before the tornado hit, Scott Lewis raced to retrieve son Zack, a third-grader at the school, in time to hunker down in the family's storm shelter.

""What a mess,"" Obama told Zack Lewis, adding, according to the Associated Press: ""You've got some story to tell. This is something you'll remember all your life.""

Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate also accompanied the tour. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in tow on Air Force One that 450 FEMA officials were working in the devastated area. In his remarks, Obama said 4,200 people had applied for disaster assistance and $3.4 million in payments had already been approved.

Fallin, a Republican, said Sunday she thanked Obama for visiting and for his support since the tornado struck. She noted that Obama signed a disaster declaration Monday night, within hours of the storm. Fallin also said she asked the president to ensure that FEMA's response wouldn't get bogged down by red tape as the focus in the Oklahoma City suburb of 41,000 turns to long-term recovery.

""The big thing is once the crowds leave we're going to continue to need help because this is not a one-time event,"" Fallin told reporters at Tinker Air Force Base as Obama departed. ""This is going to be ongoing for a long time.""

Obama said he was committed to continued support ""every step of the way,"" and assured Fallin: ""When we say we've got your back, I promise you, we keep our word.""

Obama also urged Americans to ""step up"" and donate to the American Red Cross disaster relief funds. As he arrived at what was left of the elementary school, he greeted Principal Amy Simpson, as well as Shelley McMillin, principal at nearby Briarwood Elementary, with hugs. In his remarks, he commended both school administrators.

""They were on the ground when this happened, and because of their quick response, their keeping a level head, their putting kids first saved a lot of people,"" Obama said. ""And they're still going through some tough times.""

Fallin called Obama's visit with families who'd lost children ""a very emotional time.""

""The families thanked him for coming and told him of their needs,"" Fallin said. ""He committed he would do whatever he could to help them.""

Noting that Moore is already printing new street signs to replace those ripped away by the tornado and highlighting the efforts of many volunteer organizations, Obama praised what he said has come to be known as the ""Oklahoma Standard,"" which he said Fallin described as an ability to respond to disasters ""and come out stronger on the other side.""

""That's what we've been seeing this week,"" Obama said.

Air Force One touched down at Tinker Air Force Base at 11:43 a.m., just ahead of schedule. Obama was greeted by local officials including Fallin and Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican who grew up in and lives in Moore.

Upon arrival and again just before departure, the president shook hands and spoke briefly with a group of Air Force personnel who were affected by the tornado. He also met with forecasters from the National Weather Service's Severe Weather Forecast Center. Obama credited their work — a tornado warning was issued 16 minutes before the tornado touched down, and 36 minutes before it struck Moore — with saving countless lives. Earnest said the average tornado warning time is 12 minutes.

Obama's visit caused traffic to come to a near standstill along nearby Interstate 35. As his motorcade rolled through Moore, hundreds lined the streets, waving and taking pictures.

Meanwhile, in the nearby neighborhoods, residents and volunteers continued clearing debris."

In reality, the chained CPI is a benefit cut for the oldest and most vulnerable Americans who would be least able to afford it.



Cutting benefits by adopting the chained CPI would cut the COLA by 3% for workers retired for ten years and 6% for workers retired for twenty years. This cut targets both current and future retirees. Three years after enactment, this translates to a benefit cut of $130 per year in Social Security benefits for a typical 65 year-old. The cumulative cut for that individual would be $4,631 or more than three months of benefits by age 75. While supporters claim the chained CPI is more accurate; you have to ask yourself, if this chained CPI really is more accurate, then why the need to offer an incremental benefit “bump” to some beneficiaries? The answer is simple. The chained CPI does not accurately measure these groups’ expenses; in fact, it makes most of the same errors as the current formula and adds a few. Adoption of this new formula is really about cutting benefits and raising taxes on average Americans to reduce the deficit. While supporters, including the White House, have attempted to wrap this benefit cut in promises to ‘preserve or protect’ Social Security, the stark truth is it’s actually a direct assault on the safety net millions of middle-class and poor seniors and their families depend on.”

“The current formula, the CPI-W, reflects the expenditures of about 31 percent of households nationally; specifically, wage and clerical households in urban areas. By definition, this population is employed, unlike most retired Social Security beneficiaries. Research has shown that spending patterns differ between the elderly and the general population, especially on health care. Seniors 65 and older spend more than twice as much on health care, and those 75 and older spend nearly three times more than younger consumers. Not only do health care expenditures steadily increase with age but health care costs consistently rise much faster than general inflation. The current price index (CPI-W) does not take these critical differences in the elderly population into consideration. The chained CPI doubles-down on that flaw. Even worse, the proposed chained CPI will cut COLAs immediately for current and future retirees, veterans, the poor and people with disabilities.



For millions of seniors living on fixed incomes and the average $14,000-per-year Social Security benefit, it's frankly unimaginable that some in Washington believe those benefits are too generous. Our nation faces an impending retirement crisis yet rather than address that issue head-on, Washington is instead proposing cuts to the only guaranteed source of income for many retirees, Social Security. It simply makes no sense -- unless your true goal is austerity not accuracy.” Max Richtman, Huffington Post

Draft legislative language released by the House Social Security Subcommittee last night would cut benefits for millions of middle-class and poor Americans still struggling in this economy by adopting a new formula to calculate cost of living adjustments. NCPSSM President, Max Richtman, reacted this way:Seniors won’t be fooled by Orwellian language which attempts to portray austerity as “accuracy”.This chained CPI proposal is just the first of many benefit cutting proposals the House Social Security subcommittee are expected to release in coming weeks. Incredibly, Chairman, Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI) says he wants your feedback. So we say, let’s give it to him. Email Chairman Camp at:

entitlementreform@mail.house.gov

Tell him how losing thousands of dollars in Social Security benefits will hurt you and your family. Tell the House GOP leadership “NO” to the chained CPI.

Republicans also used the short-messaging blog back then to heckle the new president as he delivered a speech to Congress. (Even the mom of Missouri Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill criticized her daughter for tweeting during the event, although her posts were about seeing Supreme Court Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg there after her operation for cancer.)

Other politicians were still finding their way on Twitter, including former Michigan congressman Pete Hoekstra, who blared to the world he was on a secret mission to Iraq by tweeting about it in 2009, and in 2011, former New York congressman Anthony Weiner took to Twitter to share lewd photos of himself with a lady friend.

Times have changed with Internet speed. As President Obama heads into his second term, most politicians are up to snuff on social media, or have at least hired helpers who know how to make the most of 140 characters or less. Twitter gaffes are no longer the norm. These days, politicians use Twitter to connect with constituents, provide updates on legislation, comment on big news stories and even share photos of their daily goings-on.

What's more, Twitter announced that all 100 members of the U.S. Senate now tweet, compared to 44 percent in 2011; and 90 percent of the members of the House of Representatives send out 140-word bits and bites (or at least their staffers do; it’s often hard to know who is really behind the tweeting). Still, with nearly all of Congress tweeting, why can't bill-writing be done with such brevity? (The Affordable Care Act would have looked a lot different if it had said: ""Everybody. Gets. Covered. The End."")

NBC News asked Twitter to tell us who are the “most followed” senators and representatives. They don’t have numbers quite like the Bieb (33 million-plus followers) or even the president (26 million-plus). But Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, leads this list, with an impressive nearly 1.8 million followers. Here are the top 5 from each branch of Congress:

SENATE

Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona

Followers: 1,791,300

Joined Twitter: Feb. 22, 2010

He lost the presidential race in 2008, but still holds tremendous sway as one of the Republican Party’s senior senators.

Twitter tendencies: Because McCain, 76, does appeal to both sides of the aisle, his comments carry weight, although his tweets can be a bit dry (again, it’s not known how many of them he posts himself, or whether an overworked staffer is doing that). But they seem heartfelt and sincere. “Impressive briefing from Afghan Army Gen. Waziri in E. #Afghanistan- heroes who've fought for their country for 30 yrs” “Very positive meeting with President Karzai yesterday - US must maintain enduring partnership with #Afghanistan if we are to succeed here” and “Does Eric Schmidt really think that any ordinary North Koreans will hear his call for Internet freedom?”

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida

Followers: 232,387



Joined Twitter: Aug. 6, 2008

The first-term senator is one of the Republican Party’s much-needed stars, and a Cuban-American who also has received props from the Tea Party.

Twitter tendencies: It could have been Rubio running as Mitt Romney’s veep candidate, although it was Rep. Paul Ryan who was chosen last summer. Many think Rubio’s year will be 2016, and commend his work on immigration, sure to be a big issue, as indicated by the president in his inauguration speech. Rubio’s tweets seem to be his own, including these: “#Esquire report on having less hair than I once did is sadly true. But good news is I am still in upper 2% in Senate.” And: “Man pleads guilty to smuggling birds into US from #Cuba, HIDDEN IN HIS PANTS!!!”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, Independent, Vermont

Followers: 136,187



Joined Twitter: April 7, 2009

Sanders is the Senate’s only registered Independent, and was recently re-elected to a second term after previously serving several years in Congress.

Twitter tendencies: Sanders titled his 1997 autobiography, “Outsider in the House,” and enjoys his role as an independent, with a focus on the financial problems of the nation, as well as on global warming. “In our closed-door (Democratic) caucuses, he's not one of the senators who wants to speak on everything,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont told the Burlington Free-Press in 2008. ""He picks his issues, and when he does speak, he has something valuable to say, and people listen."" That includes on Twitter, where Sanders often strikes out at large corporations and Wall Street. “Allowing Wall St CEOs to serve as @FederalReserve directors and hand-pick its members is a clear example of the fox guarding the henhouse,” he tweeted earlier this month.

The former “Saturday Night Live” comedian tackles serious issues, including advocating for better mental health care in the wake of the Newtown school shootings, while also sponsoring lighter events like the recent Secret Santa gift exchange to break tensions among his colleagues.

Twitter tendencies: Franken isn’t a laugh-a-minute; he’s quite Minnesotan: Down-to-business and purposeful. Some of that may be his honesty-in-labeling: “Official TeamFranken Twitter feed” is what his Twitter page says, indicating the tweets may not be all his. But he is focused on big issues, including Internet freedom and privacy. “One hurdle cleared! #Senate Judiciary Cmte passes Al's #privacy bill to stop Smartphone Stalking,” he tweeted last month, as well as last June, a what-should-be-common sense approach to electronic records and health care: “All laptops containing private medical information should be encrypted to protect privacy.”

Joined Twitter: Sept. 6, 2008

McCaskill won re-election in November after defeating U.S. Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri, whose comments about “legitimate rape” sent voters – and his proposed Senate election – over the edge.

Twitter tendencies: She is one of the few politicians who is personable and personal when she tweets, painting a picture for followers of real life in Washington, D.C. Among her tweets from the inauguration Monday: “Four years ago today I began tweeting. One of my first tweets was a comment on (Supreme Court Justice Antonin) Scalia's weird hat. Will he wear it again? Stay tuned.” That was followed up by a tweet — “Yup. There it is” — and sharing a photo she took.

The Speaker of the House is the BMOCH (Big Man on Capitol Hill), as the voice of the Republican Party.

Twitter tendencies: He’s a little drier than a roll of paper towels wrapped in plastic, but that’s probably what Americans expect of him. Tweets like “House bills are now available for bulk download in XML via @USGPO,” and “This @aei chart shows ‘above normal’ government spending is driving force behind our debt” don’t win tweeting prizes. It’s also a big clue that the down-to-earth congressman probably doesn’t do his own tweets as a rule.

Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, was Romney’s vice-presidential candidate, and impressed conservative voters with his approach to handling the deficit.

Twitter tendencies: His post-election tweets have been few and far between; he likely had his biggest gains in followers during the campaign, taking the president to task for his fiscal policies. But some signs of Twitter life have been showing in recent days, including these tweets: ""We must pay bills today & ensure we can pay bills tomorrow. To do that, we must cut spending & budget responsibly” and “Senate Democrats have refused to pass a budget. Time to hold them accountable for this legal and moral failure.”

Congress must now do its part to prevent gun violence,” she tweeted in recent days. But she is also personal when appropriate: “Saddened to hear of the passing of @PFLAG founder Jeanne Manford, who proved the power of a mother’s love can drive out hate,” Pelosi posted Jan. 10.

Sen. Marco Rubio calls plan %22a starting point%22

Bill allows those in country without documentation to apply for citizenship

Plan faces long struggle to get through Congress

WASHINGTON -- After more than two months of pain-staking negotiations behind closed doors, a bipartisan group of senators are ready to unveil their sweeping proposal Tuesday that would fundamentally alter the nation's immigration laws for the first time in a generation.

Members of the Senate's so-called Gang of Eight that have been crafting the bill took to the airwaves Sunday to begin selling the plan, and are scheduled to publicly unveil the 1,000-plus page bill this week.

""What we're working on is a starting point,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said on Meet the Press in one of seven appearances he made to begin explaining the bill. ""I think it's a very good piece of legislation, but obviously there are 92 other senators who have ideas of their own.""

The bill allows unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the U.S. on or before Dec. 31, 2011, to almost immediately apply for temporary legal status that would allow them to live and work in the country.

The focus would then shift to immigration enforcement, as the Department of Homeland Security would be required to monitor 100% of the nation's southwest border with Mexico, and intercept 90% of people trying to cross illegally. Business owners would be required to use the E-Verify system, which lets them check the immigration status of new employees, and the federal government would have to establish a program to identify each time a foreigner enters and exits the country.

If those benchmarks are reached, and after 10 years have passed, unauthorized immigrants could then apply for a green card. If approved, they could then apply for U.S. citizenship three years afterward.

The bill will be scrutinized almost immediately during a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled for Wednesday. And with a group of bipartisan members of the House developing their own bill, and the White House developing yet another version of the bill in case Congress moves too slowly, the Senate bill represents just the first step in a long, difficult path that should play out over several months.

Some of those senators wasted no time raising their concerns with the bill. Several GOP senators expressed dismay that the bill would grant the temporary legal status and work visas to unauthorized immigrants before the borders have been deemed secure. That is one of the biggest concerns for Republicans who fear a repeat of the 1986 immigration law, which allowed up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants to become citizens but did not fulfill promises of a secured border.

""So much of it is regaining the public's confidence that the federal government is actually doing its job (on border security),"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said on Fox News Sunday. ""So until that confidence is restored, on the basis of what the legislation provides, I would have difficulty supporting it."""

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)

A national group of atheists is amending the text of a large roadside billboard after admitting that it misquoted former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in a new campaign to encourage Americans to ""Go Godless Instead.""

American Atheists rolled out the new signage over the weekend ahead of their 50th anniversary celebration, set to take place at the end of the month.

One of the billboards featured Palin, alongside the quotation, ""We should create law based on the God of the Bible.”

The quote is a reference to a May 2010 appearance by Palin on Fox News, in which she denounced the backlash against the National Day of Prayer. At the time she suggested that critics were ignoring the Founding Fathers in their opposition to the large-scale expression of faith.

""I think we should kind of keep this clean, keep it simple, go back to what our founders and our founding documents meant,"" she advised. ""They're quite clear that we would create law based on the God of the Bible and the Ten Commandments.""

CNN reports that American Atheists public relations director Dave Muscato has admitted that the word ""should"" should not appear in quotes and has announced plans to make the correction.

But Muscato and American Atheists President David Silverman told CNN that the “intent and context” of the billboard remains accurate.

“Ms. Palin would stand by what we have quoted her as saying,"" Silverman claimed in a statement to CNN.

Palin isn't the only Republican politician being used to promote the group's event. Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) and former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich are both featured in other billboards, alongside accurate quotations.

American Atheists have drawn attention for their controversial displays in the past. In December, the group rolled out its latest version of a billboard opposing the religious celebration of Christmas in New York City's Times Square.

The White House responded Friday night to a petition on its website urging construction of a Death Star for job creation and national defense purposes by 2016.

Here's why, according to Paul Shawcross, chief of the Science and Space Branch of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote an epic response to the petition and its nearly 35,000 signatories:

The construction of the Death Star has been estimated to cost more than $850,000,000,000,000,000. We're working hard to reduce the deficit, not expand it.

The Administration does not support blowing up planets.

Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a Death Star with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship?

Shawcross did take the opportunity to explain what is being done already, instead of the government spending the the estimated $852 quadrillion (in case you were wondering what the above number was) to build the ultimate planet-destroying machine.

There's the International Space Station (which doesn't destroy planets). There's the two rovers on Mars (""one wielding a laser""). Oh yeah, here's the president wielding a light saber! Who knew -- the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is even ""supporting research"" on building Luke Skywalker's arm.

Shawcross closed by plugging a big initiative of the Obama administration: science, technology, engineering and math education:

If you do pursue a career in a science, technology, engineering or math-related field, the Force will be with us! Remember, the Death Star's power to destroy a planet, or even a whole star system, is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

(CNN) - It took no advice from the Imperial Senate to reach this conclusion: the U.S. government won't be building a Death Star.

A White House official responded Friday to an online petition on its website proposing the government turn what is “Star Wars” fiction into reality - you know, to boost the economy.

""By focusing our defense resources into a space-superiority platform and weapon system such as a Death Star, the government can spur job creation in the fields of construction, engineering, space exploration, and more, and strengthen our national defense,"" the petition read.

The White House response to the out-of-this-world proposal was grounded.

""The administration shares your desire for job creation and a strong national defense, but a Death Star isn't on the horizon,"" wrote Paul Shawcross, chief of the Office of Management and Budget's Science and Space Branch.

And plus, he wrote, there is ""something already floating in the sky.""

""Yes, we already have a giant, football field-sized International Space Station in orbit around the Earth that's helping us learn how humans can live and thrive in space for long durations,"" he wrote. ""Even though the United States doesn't have anything that can do the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs, we've got two spacecraft leaving the Solar System and we're building a probe that will fly to the exterior layers of the Sun.""

The spherical Death Star space station was the domain of the Galactic Empire and featured a super laser with sufficient power to destroy planets.

The petition picked up over 34,400 signatures since it was posted on November 14. The White House says it responds to all petitions on its “We the People” website which reach at least 25,000 virtual signatures.

The Office of Management and Budget prepares the president's annual budget proposal and scores the costs and deficit impact of executive branch proposals. True to form, the Death Star reply included a score, or cost projection, of the project.

""The construction of the Death Star has been estimated to cost more than $850,000,000,000,000,000. We're working hard to reduce the deficit, not expand it,"" Shawcross wrote, citing a calculation performed by students at Lehigh University's College of Business and Economics.

Also, Shawcross noted, ""The administration does not support blowing up planets.""

The child survived. John Minchillo/AP

Federal agents trying to stop the black Infiniti speeding between the White House and the U.S. Capitol fired seven shots at its unarmed driver, who had a toddler in the car with her, an uncommon tactic that occurred during a highly unusual chase.

Investigators believe that a Connecticut woman who was fatally shot by police Thursday after a car chase from the White House to the Capitol had grappled with mental illness and may have believed she was surreptitiously being monitored by President Obama.

Miriam Carey, 34, a dental hygienist living in Stamford, Conn., “may have thought President Obama was stalking her” when she steered her black Infiniti, with her 1-year-old daughter sitting in the back, onto some of the nation’s most highly guarded territory, according to a law enforcement official.

Carey had received a diagnosis of postpartum depression with psychosis, her sister Amy Carey-Jones said in a Friday interview on “Anderson Cooper 360°,” and had been treated with counseling and medication, but was reducing her use of medication under a doctor’s supervision. Carey-Jones said her sister “didn’t appear to be unstable.”

“We will never know what Miriam was thinking in those last hours before she died,” her sister told Cooper. “We can only speculate, and our real concern is why and were things done properly. Was there some other way that she could have been helped so that it didn’t end tragically?”

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the investigation has uncovered “a picture of a mentally disturbed woman.” Carey had been treated for schizophrenia, he said, but two of her sisters disputed his characterization.

This 2011 photo provided by Dr. Barry Weiss, from the website of Advanced Periodontics in Hamden, Conn., shows former employee Miriam Carey. (AP)

McCaul said her condition may have been exacerbated by a recent head injury and that her boyfriend had called police to say she believed her apartment was bugged and Obama was behind it. Carey’s sisters, however, said in their CNN interview that they had never heard her say anything of that nature. Valarie Carey called the boyfriend’s account “very questionable.”

For now, the biggest mystery is whether the incident that spun out 265 miles from Carey’s home was the culmination of a long, downward spiral or was sparked by some precipitating event.

Carey’s mother, Idella Carey, told ABC News that her daughter had not shown any violence in the past. She said she thought Miriam Carey was taking her toddler to a doctor’s appointment in Connecticut on Thursday.

Authorities are trying to trace Carey’s movements in Connecticut and Washington, where she apparently arrived only shortly before she approached a White House entrance and drove her car into a metal barricade just after 2 p.m. Thursday, then struck a uniformed Secret Service officer.

After speeding down Pennsylvania Avenue, she crashed at the Capitol grounds. Police scurried to carry the child to safety after her mother was shot several times.

In the New York City suburb of Stamford, about 100 law enforcement personnel from the U.S. Secret Service, FBI, Connecticut State Police and Stamford police searched Carey’s apartment in the Woodside Green complex overnight Thursday. They removed boxes, bags and at least one computer from the sprawling complex where a neighbor had seen Carey wheeling her daughter in a stroller.

The search involved hazardous-material teams, a bomb squad and a robot, Stamford Police Chief Jonathan Fontneau said. Under the assumption that something inside the apartment might pose a threat, police sent a robot through a window first and meticulously decontaminated people who went in and out of the unit, Fontneau said. In the end, they found just a “typical” first-floor two-bedroom apartment with “nothing out of the ordinary,” Fontneau said, and allowed evacuated residents to return to their units.

Until Thursday, the police chief said, Carey, too, “was nothing out of the ordinary that would draw attention to herself.”

Police had been called to the apartment once before, in December, but not for a criminal matter, Fontneau said. He did not have further details. A neighbor who declined to give his name said the tires were stolen from Carey’s car in the late spring or early summer and that Carey was somewhat upset at apartment officials about it.

“She was a little [irritated] about we’re paying all the taxes and common charges we pay and no security cameras,” the neighbor said. The encounter was the first and only time he met Carey. The neighbor said he found Carey fairly likable. “Very well-spoken,” he said. “She was obviously educated.”

People who were interviewed in the neighborhood Friday said they were still digesting the news that the woman at the center of the U.S. Capitol shooting was from their neighborhood. Charlie Clark, a 76-year-old crossing guard who chats regularly with Woodside residents, said that he was surprised that he did not recognize Carey’s photo when it was shown on television. “I kept looking at her, looking at her, I said, ‘See, that’s a beautiful lady,’ ” Clark said. “Hey, anything can happen. I’m just glad they didn’t kill that little baby.”

Mark Rosenbloom, who lives at Woodside, said he recognized photos of Carey’s car. It was always parked in an end spot in the complex parking lot and was especially well cleaned, he said. “You just notice sometimes cars that are shiny, especially when yours isn’t,” said Rosenbloom, 52. “I don’t think she wanted to get it scratched. Kept it in pretty good shape.”

Carey’s death also reverberated throughout several neighborhoods in Brooklyn, home to sisters Amy and Valarie, their mother, and other relatives.

On Thursday night, Carey’s friends and relatives congregated at the home of Valarie Carey, who lives in a two-story brick building on Marion Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.

Family members traveled to the District on Friday to identify Miriam Carey’s body and later returned to Brooklyn where they spoke with reporters.

“My sister was not a criminal,” Valarie Carey said. “My sister did not deserve to have her life shortened at an early stage. She had aspirations, she had dreams . . . she has a family that loved her.”

Two years ago when Tina Brown and Diane von Furstenberg first envisioned this conference, they asked me to do a play, a reading, called – the name of the play was called Seven. It was taken from transcripts, real testimony from real women activists around the world. I was the Irish one, and I had no idea that the real women would be sitting in the audience while we portrayed them. So I was doing a pretty ghastly Belfast accent. I was just – I was imitating my friend Liam Neeson, really, and I sounded like a fellow. (Laughter). It was really bad.

So I was so mortified when Tina, at the end of the play, invited the real women to come up on stage and I found myself standing next to the great Inez McCormack. (Applause.) And I felt slight next to her, because I’m an actress and she is the real deal. She has put her life on the line. Six of those seven women were with us in the theater that night. The seventh, Mukhtaran Bibi, couldn’t come because she couldn’t get out of Pakistan. You probably remember who she is. She’s the young woman who went to court because she was gang-raped by men in her village as punishment for a perceived slight to their honor by her little brother. All but one of the 14 men accused were acquitted, but Mukhtaran won the small settlement. She won $8,200, which she then used to start schools in her village. More money poured in from international donations when the men were set free. And as a result of her trial, the then president of Pakistan, General Musharraf, went on TV and said, “If you want to be a millionaire, just get yourself raped.”

But that night in the theater two years ago, the other six brave women came up on the stage. Anabella De Leon of Guatemala pointed to Hillary Clinton, who was sitting right in the front row, and said, “I met her and my life changed.” And all weekend long, women from all over the world said the same thing:

""I’m alive because she came to my village, put her arm around me, and had a photograph taken together.""

""I’m alive because she went on our local TV and talked about my work, and now they’re afraid to kill me.""

""I’m alive because she came to my country and she talked to our leaders, because I heard her speak, because I read about her.""

I’m here today because of that, because of those stores. I didn’t know about this. I never knew any of it. And I think everybody should know. This hidden history Hillary has, the story of her parallel agenda, the shadow diplomacy unheralded, uncelebrated — careful, constant work on behalf of women and girls that she has always conducted alongside everything else a First Lady, a Senator, and now Secretary of State is obliged to do.

And it deserves to be amplified. This willingness to take it, to lead a revolution – and revelation, beginning in Beijing in 1995, when she first raised her voice to say the words you’ve heard many times throughout this conference: “Women’s Rights Are Human Rights.”

When Hillary Clinton stood up in Beijing to speak that truth, her hosts were not the only ones who didn’t necessarily want to hear it. Some of her husband’s advisors also were nervous about the speech, fearful of upsetting relations with China. But she faced down the opposition at home and abroad, and her words continue to hearten women around the world and have reverberated down the decades.

…

She’s just been busy working, doing it, making those words “Women’s Rights are Human Rights” into something every leader in every country now knows is a linchpin of American policy. It’s just so much more than a rhetorical triumph. We’re talking about what happened in the real world, the institutional change that was a result of that stand she took.

…

Now we know that the higher the education and the involvement of women in a culture and economy, the more secure the nation. It’s a metric we use throughout our foreign policy, and in fact, it’s at the core of our development policy. It is a big, important shift in thinking. Horrifying practices like female genital cutting were not at the top of the agenda because they were part of the culture and we didn’t want to be accused of imposing our own cultural values.

But what Hillary Clinton has said over and over again is, “A crime is a crime, and criminal behavior cannot be tolerated.” Everywhere she goes, she meets with the head of state and she meets with the women leaders of grassroots organizations in each country. This goes automatically on her schedule. As you’ve seen, when she went to Burma – our first government trip there in 40 years. She met with its dictator and then she met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the woman he kept under detention for 15 years, the leader of Burma’s pro-democracy movement.

This isn’t just symbolism. It’s how you change the world. These are the words of Dr. Gao Yaojie of China: “I will never forget our first meeting. She said I reminded her of her mother. And she noticed my small bound feet. I didn’t need to explain too much, and she understood completely. I could tell how much she wanted to understand what I, an 80-something year old lady, went through in China – the Cultural Revolution, uncovering the largest tainted blood scandal in China, house arrest, forced family separation. I talked about it like nothing and I joked about it, but she understood me as a person, a mother, a doctor. She knew what I really went through.”

When Vera Stremkovskaya, a lawyer and human rights activist from Belarus met Hillary Clinton a few years ago, they took a photograph together. And she said to one of the Secretary’s colleagues, “I want that picture.” And the colleague said, “I will get you that picture as soon as possible.” And Stremkovskaya said, “I need that picture.” And the colleague said, “I promise you.” And Stremkovskaya said, “You don’t understand. That picture will be my bullet-proof vest.”

Never give up. Never, never, never, never, never give up. That is what Hillary Clinton embodies."

She Left In February A Los Angeles-Area Native', 'She Has Reported Across Southern California', 'Edited', 'Traveled The States']",Immigration bill would be largest such effort ever attempted,"WASHINGTON — After months of negotiations, a bipartisan group of eight senators is poised to offer a sweeping bill to rewrite the nation’s immigration laws this week, taking advantage of a changed political alignment that, for the first time in nearly a generation, appears to have opened the way for comprehensive legislation.

The bill would chart a 13-year path to citizenship for most of the 11 million people in this country without proper legal status, spend billions of dollars more on border security, create new legal guest worker programs for low-income jobs and farm labor, require new verification measures for most companies hiring new workers and significantly expand overall immigration to the U.S. for the next decade, according to an outline obtained by The Times’ Washington bureau.

The legalization program would amount to the largest such effort any nation has attempted, affecting more than three times as many people as the Reagan-era immigration reform law. But it is only one part of the legislation, and perhaps not the portion with the greatest impact.

The agricultural workforce — where half the workers currently have no legal status — would be transformed by a new guest worker program that is designed to bring more than 300,000 immigrant farmworkers to the nation’s fields over the next decade and provide field workers an expedited pathway to citizenship. A new visa program for housecleaners, landscapers and other low-skill occupations would be created, while high-tech industries would be allowed to double the number of foreign workers they use.

All told, the country’s current inflow of about 1 million legal immigrants a year could grow by half over the next decade.

The bill also would probably spur a spending spree on the Southwest border as the government rolls out more surveillance technology, including unmanned drones and military-grade radar, to detect people crossing into the United States.

Although Congress has deadlocked repeatedly on immigration policy, leading figures in both parties expect that the legislation, expected to run hundreds of pages, stands an excellent chance of approval in the Senate, which plans to begin debate on it next month, and that some version of it could become law by year’s end.

That would make the effort the first comprehensive immigration overhaul since the 1986 amnesty law signed by then-President Reagan.

“I think we are on the cusp of history here. This is a really big deal,” said Marshall Fitz, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. “We are operating in a Washington environment that is so dysfunctional, so political, so partisan and yet on this issue.... eight members came together on this from a full ideological spectrum — that is historic.”

Opponents warn that American workers will see their wages erode in the face of greater competition from migrants. Supporters counter that the bill would benefit the U.S. economy by bringing the current unauthorized population out of legal limbo and by providing a steady flow of legal workers for industries with labor shortages.

The legislative work in Washington reflects the changed dynamic in the country, as polls show a majority of Americans back some type of legal status for those living here without proper authorization.

Rather than viewing immigrants as a threat or burden to society, increasing numbers of Americans hold positive views of the contributions immigrants make, polls show.

Advertisement

That shift, along with the growing power of Latino voters, many of whom have made immigration reform a priority, appears to have broken a deadlock on the issue. After the overwhelming Latino vote for President Obama in 2012, many Republican strategists decided their party had little choice but to embrace reform. They tapped Sen. Marco Rubio, the rising tea party Republican from Florida, as their front man in talks with Democratic leaders and the handful of Republicans who had previously supported a legalization plan.

“What we have seen is, I think, a remarkable — in Washington — level of consensus between and support for bipartisan and comprehensive immigration reform,” said White House spokesman Jay Carney on Monday.

Advertisement

For months, the eight senators — four Democrats and four Republicans — have been meeting privately, often in the office of Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) steps from the Senate floor, as the contours of the bill took shape.

Securing the nation’s borders against illegal crossings has long been a cornerstone of reform efforts. The new plan requires a secure border with Mexico before the other provisions of the bill, including the citizenship proposals, could take hold. It provides $3 billion to increase surveillance, including the use of unmanned aerial drones. The Southwest border would be considered secure if, within five years, 90% of those attempting to cross illegally are turned back in areas that have had more than 30,000 apprehensions a year.

An additional $1.5 billion would go toward a double-layer fence constructed with help from the National Guard. Money would also go to local authorities to prevent border crossings, to triple prosecutions in some areas, and to dispatch 3,500 more customs agents.

After five years, if the border security goals remain unmet, a commission of border state governors and attorneys general will be given money and authority to implement further measures. “We’re confident it’s achievable,” Rubio said over the weekend in a Fox News interview.

Gaining citizenship would be a decadelong and costly process that would be tied to the border security provisions.

Six months after the bill becomes law, most of the 11 million people in the country without authorization — those who have been in the country before Dec. 31, 2011, and have no serious criminal record — would be eligible to apply for a new probationary legal status. That would allow them to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation. They would be required to pay a $500 initial penalty as well as an application fee and back taxes. The probationary status would be good for six years and could then be renewed after payment of another $500 penalty.

Advertisement

At the end of 10 years, if the border security targets have been hit, those on probationary status would be able to pay another $1,000 to apply for a green card, which provides permanent legal residency. Three years later, they could apply for citizenship. Those granted probationary status would not be eligible for government benefits during the decadelong wait.

If the government does not meet its border security targets, people could stay on probationary status, but would not be allowed to apply for citizenship.

Advertisement

Two groups would get a special expedited citizenship path — young people who were brought to this country illegally as children, and agricultural workers, who would become eligible for green cards within five years if they commit to keep working in the fields, and would be eligible for citizenship after that.

During the 10 years, the government would clear up the current backlog of people who have applied for visas to be reunited with family members already living in the U.S. Roughly 4 million such applications are on file, although government officials say an unknown number of those represent people who already have entered the country illegally or who have given up plans to immigrate.

Advertisement

With the new route to citizenship for some comes closed doors for others. Adult siblings of U.S. citizens will no longer be eligible for a family preference in the visa application process. The bill would eliminate 55,000 “diversity immigrant visas” that are awarded by lottery each year and go largely to migrants from Africa and Eastern Europe.

The U.S. already admits more immigrants than any other country in the world. It is poised to increase that by 50% over the first decade under the draft bill.

Advertisement

Representatives of labor and business hashed out a series of agreements for foreign workers that the senators have folded into their bill. A new visa system, negotiated between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, would bring in as many as 200,000 low-skilled workers for jobs in hospitality, meat packing and other industries.

The government would also set up a new start-up visa program for entrepreneurs and merit visas for high-achieving student workers.

Advertisement

The program would be run by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, with pay scales set at median industry wages and the number of visas determined by the U.S. unemployment rate and other factors.

Visas for the existing high-tech worker program could nearly double to more than 120,000 per year.

Advertisement

For farmworkers, as many as 337,000 new three-year visas — 122,333 each year for the first three years after the bill becomes law — would be available. After five years, the secretary of Agriculture would set an annual visa limit based on market conditions. Growers would also have to pay transportation and housing costs for workers, but workers’ spouses and children would not be eligible to join them.

The law would also require all employers to check new workers against an electronic-verification system. The requirement, which could cost the government $1.5 billion to implement, would be phased in over five years.

Advertisement

Passage in the Senate could give momentum to a similarly bipartisan group in the House, which is preparing its own bill.

“We need to design a system that is flexible going into the future so that immigration can serve as a real competitive advantage for us economically and as a society,” said Doris Meissner, who was head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993 to 2000, and is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington. “All the more reason to grab the moment.”

USA TODAY

President Obama met with congressional leaders Wednesday

The meeting came on the second day of a government shutdown

Obama also discussed debt ceiling and the government shutdown with a group of CEOs

WASHINGTON — President Obama told congressional Republicans on Wednesday he will not negotiate major budget issues until the government is re-opened and the debt ceiling is increased.

""The president remains hopeful that common sense will prevail, and that Congress will not only do its job to reopen the government, but also act to pay the bills it has racked up and spare the nation from a devastating default,"" said a White House statement.

The statement came shortly after Obama met with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders for 70 minutes at the White House.

Obama, who earlier in the day said he was ""exasperated"" by the shutdown, ""made clear to the leaders that he is not going to negotiate over the need for Congress to act to reopen the government or to raise the debt limit to pay the bills Congress has already incurred,"" said the White House.

Republicans criticized Obama's refusal to negotiate in the short term.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who again called for a one-year delay of aspects of the new health care plan as part of a new spending plan, told reporters at the White House, ""all we're asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., described the meeting with Obama as ""cordial, but unproductive.""

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who also met with Obama, echoed the president by saying that his chamber will negotiate with House Republicans on health care and other issues as soon as they vote to re-open the government.

Boehner ""cannot take yes for an answer,"" Reid told reporters at the White House.

Earlier in the day, Obama blamed Republicans for shutting down the government, and trying to ""extort"" a delay and defunding of the health care plan.

""Absolutely, I'm exasperated, because this is entirely unnecessary,"" Obama told CNBC in an interview.

As some GOP members seek to delay or de-fund the health care law as part of a budget deal, Obama told CNBC that an ""extremist wing"" of one party should not be allowed to ""extort"" concessions in way that delays funding for much of the government.

During the meeting with congressional leaders, Obama again asked House Republicans to pass a new spending plan without any restrictions on the new health care law.

Boehner repeated his call for a one-year delay of some provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

Despite the differences, members of both parties called the White House meeting valuable. Boehner called it ""polite,"" while House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said it was ""worthwhile.""

In a statement, McConnell said, ""while I appreciated the opportunity to speak directly with the President about this pressing issue, I was disappointed that he had little interest in negotiating a solution or in encouraging Senate Democrats to agree to the House request for a conference.""

The partial shutdown of the government began at midnight Monday, when the Republican-run House and Democratic-run Senate failed to agree on a new spending plan.

The House has passed several versions of a spending bill that includes a delay in the health care law; Obama and Senate Democrats say that is unacceptable.

Republicans have called for a House-Senate conference committee to resolve the impasse. Democrats have refused, saying the GOP is trying to use the budget process to gut the new health care law.

Obama told congressional leaders that the House should vote on a ""clean"" spending plan with no new health care provisions, the White House said, and he predicted that such a bill ""would pass a majority of the House with bipartisan support.""

The White House statement said that ""the House could act today to reopen the government and stop the harm this shutdown is causing to the economy and families across the country."" It also said Obama ""is glad that the leaders were able to engage in this useful discussion this evening.""

The White House meeting also previewed another looming showdown over the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling, which the Treasury Department says it will hit on Oct. 17.

Without an increase in the debt ceiling, Obama has said the government will be unable to borrow money to repay its obligations, creating a default that will harm the economy worldwide. He also said he will not negotiate with the Republicans over the need to raise the debt ceiling.

In his CNBC interview, Obama said that ""when you have a situation in which a faction is willing to potentially default on U.S. government obligations, then we are in trouble.""

The president also said that Wall Street should be concerned about both the shutdown and the prospect of a default.

Earlier in the day, Obama discussed both the debt ceiling and the government shutdown in a mid-day meeting with the Financial Services Forum, a group of CEOs.

Afterward that meeting, Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO of the Goldman Sachs Group, said it's fine for lawmakers to ""litigate"" political issues, but the debt ceiling should not be used a ""cudgel"" to seek concessions.

Failure to pay the nation's bills — default — would roil financial markets worldwide, and damage economic recovery in the United States, Blankfein said.

""There's a precedent for a government shutdown,"" Blankfein said. ""There's no precedent for a default."""

As a result, I have created such a list here, using the opinions that I have heard from tens of thousands of men during my years working as a matchmaker. The fact is, if you are a woman and you want to get married, you need to be smart about your dating. This means avoiding certain male types, but it also means recognizing what you are doing wrong in your dating and whether the type of woman you are putting out there to the male population attracts or repels them. To figure this out, you can start by considering the list below and whether you, at times, are any of these quite unattractive female types:

Miss ""Bossy Pants"": This woman usually can't help herself; she has bossy in her DNA. When a man first meets her, he might think this character trait is cute, for awhile. However, once he starts to feel like he is in grammar school being told what to do by his second grade teacher, he will give this woman her walking papers.

Miss ""Playing Games With His Heart"": This woman thinks that being a game player will help her land a man. However, even though a man might be intrigued by a hard to get lady in the beginning, as soon as he decides that he is interested in her, all he wants is an honest straightshooter. If this woman doesn't remove Battleship from her repertoire quite quickly, she will be shown the door before she can even sink his vessel.

Miss ""I Want To Change You"": This woman is lurking everywhere. She is the type of woman many men are the most leery of. (Of course, there are some men who love this woman because of their own insecurities.) She claims that she loves her guy just the way he is, but little by little, she chips away at just about everything about him. First, it's his wardrobe, then it's his taste in music. However, when she gets to his friends and his hobbies, she is usually kicked to the curb.

Miss ""Suspiciously Jealous"": This woman is on edge all the time because she is very distrusting. Many times, she has been burnt in the past, so she is on guard for anything that looks or feels wrong. When a man first meets this woman, he sees her as a damsel in distress and wants to reassure her that he is nothing like that guy in her past. However, once she accuses him one too many times, he will have no choice to leave her because he can't go through his life being prosecuted for somebody else's crimes.

Miss ""I Live For You And I Have Nothing Else Going On"": This woman is very difficult for a man to date, let alone marry. At first, he is flattered that she is so into him, but very quickly, he feels overwhelmed and suffocated by her. As a woman, you must have something going on in your own life so that you are not just waiting by the door for him to come home.

Miss ""I Have Daddy Issues"": This woman usually dates older men and deep down is looking for a father figure, not a boyfriend or husband. Initially, her guy might like how she looks to him for approval and the answer to all of her questions, but soon, he realizes that he wants to have sex with a real woman, not someone who is stuck in her teen years trying to get Daddy to notice her.

Miss ""I Speak To My Mother Five Times A Day About Everything"": This woman has her mother on speed dial and can't seem to make a decision or do anything without getting her opinion. When a guy first meets her, he thinks it's nice that she is so close to her family, but soon, he finds it to be way too much. A man just doesn't want to have to ask her mother's permission about things in his life.

Miss ""Shhh, I Shouldn't Really Be Saying This, But..."": This woman is like a human Page Six. She loves to gossip and talk about other people and she loves to hear things about other people as well. Initially when a guy meets her, he might be entertained by her anecdotes but eventually, he begins to wonder what she is saying behind his back.

Miss ""Keeping Up With The Joneses"": This woman needs to be at least as good as everyone else she knows. She is constantly talking about what the other people do and what the other people have. This places a lot of undue pressure on her guy and eventually, he justs gets fed up that she can't appreciate what they have instead of wishing she was someone else.

Miss ""I Don't Eat"": This woman picks at her food, is on a never-ending diet or doesn't eat pretty much everything that most people eat. When a man first meets her, he thinks to himself, at least she will never become overweight, but eventually he realizes that it's no fun to eat alone. The fact is men like to eat; they like steak, they like trying different foods, they like dessert and women should be eating too, at least sometimes.

Keep in mind that most men just want a happy and easy going woman who has good values, so just focus on putting the best YOU out there.

WASHINGTON, July 4 (Reuters) - At age 80, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, leader of the U.S. Supreme Court's liberal wing, says she is in excellent health, even lifting weights despite having cracked a pair of ribs again, and plans to stay several more years on the bench.

In a Reuters interview late on Tuesday, she vowed to resist any pressure to retire that might come from liberals who want to ensure that Democratic President Barack Obama can pick her successor before the November 2016 presidential election.

Ginsburg said she had fallen in the bathroom of her home in early May, sustaining the same injury she suffered last year near term's end.

""I knew immediately what it was this time,"" she said, adding that there was nothing to do but take pain killers and wait out the six weeks as her ribs healed. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said on Wednesday that the day after the May 2 incident, Ginsburg was examined at the Office of the Attending Physician at the Capitol and then went about her regular schedule.

The justice, who survived two serious bouts with cancer, in 1999 and 2009, is keeping up a typically busy summer of travel, at home and abroad, beginning next week with a trip to Paris. Ginsburg said she was back to her usual weight-lifting routine and recently had good results from a bone density scan.

Supreme Court justices are appointed for life and can be a president's most enduring legacy. Disputes over many social dilemmas come down to 5-4 votes, as was seen in the recently completed term on gay marriage and voting rights. A retirement decision rests with an individual justice, but history is rife with tensions between aging justices and anxious presidents. Ginsburg, the eldest justice on an ideologically divided court, was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

Political pressure is an age-old backdrop to Supreme Court appointments, and for Ginsburg it is likely to accelerate before the November 2014 congressional elections that could alter the Democratic dominance of the Senate.

Such talk is always subtle because a presidential administration never wants to be perceived to engage in politics over the judiciary given the bedrock American principle that separates the branches of government.

2012 PRESSURE

Before Obama's 2012 reelection, Harvard University law professor Randall Kennedy stirred public debate with an April 2011 essay for the New Republic urging Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer, now 74 and also appointed by Clinton, to retire to ensure a possible Republican president not fill their seats.

On Wednesday, Kennedy repeated his sentiment, telling Reuters he still thinks that ""the responsible thing"" would be for Ginsburg to step down. ""It seems to me that a justice should take into account the politics surrounding confirmation and not allow (an) opportunity to fall to a Republican,"" said Kennedy, who was a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall.

University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt, who has studied judicial nominations, said Wednesday he expected to see ""opinion leaders trying to shape attitudes"" among the public as well as ""efforts through back channels to increase the pressure for her to step down.""

In her interview, Ginsburg referred to past liberal commentary and predicted, ""That's going to start up again.""

Brushing off political calculations, she said, ""It really has to be, 'Am I equipped to do the job?' ... I was so pleased that this year I couldn't see that I was slipping in any respect."" She said she remains energized by her work as the senior liberal, a position she has held since 2010 when Justice John Paul Stevens retired, and calls being a justice ""the best job in the world for a lawyer.""

She has previously said she wanted her tenure to at least match the nearly 23 years of Justice Louis Brandeis, which would get her to April 2016, and said she had a new ""model"" in Justice Stevens, who retired at age 90 after nearly 35 years on the bench.

Reinforcing the message that she might not leave before her health requires it, she mused of another former colleague, ""I wonder if Sandra regrets stepping down when she did?""

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired in January 2006 at age 75 to take care of her husband, John, who had Alzheimer's disease. He died in 2009.

Ginsburg, who picked up the mantle of the liberals after Stevens' departure, took the unusual step of reading three dissenting statements from the bench in the final week of the term. Dissenting justices typically issue their statements only in writing. During one of them, on June 24, the media commented on the antics of Justice Samuel Alito, who had written the majority opinion in a job discrimination case Ginsburg was protesting, Vance v. Ball State University. As she spoke, he conspicuously rolled his eyes and screwed up his face.

Alito did not respond to a request for comment.

Ginsburg said she was oblivious, and only learned of his behavior from her law clerks. When she read another dissenting statement from the bench the next day, ""he did not make any faces.""

Was she insulted? Her answer appeared to allude to Alito's nationally televised grimace and mouthing of ""Not true"" in response to comments Obama made in his 2010 State of the Union speech about a court campaign-finance ruling.

""I'm in such good company,"" said Ginsburg. ""I'm in the company of the president.""

Amusement parks are outdated entertainment. Most of the rides look dangerous because they are dangerous.

I work at an amusement park. We check every harness, every time. We have a great team that walks every roller coaster inch by inch every day.

I feel sorry for the lady who got killed. If she didn't feel safe, why didn't she just get off the ride?

— Karen Hunt

What would it have taken for the attendant to recheck and secure the latch? Ten seconds? This park should be sued. All personnel should be retrained and made to realize that they hold people's lives in their hands.

— Claudia Thibodeau Gibson

The reality is weight likely played a role in this tragedy. Roller coasters can only be made for a certain range of sizes in order to protect riders from the 10-year-old skinny girl up to an adult. Many park workers are high school or college students, and they alone should not be judging safety and fit when a bigger person wants to ride.

The woman's death is sad, but it was an accident. You have a greater chance of dying while crossing a street than on a roller coaster. If people stop doing things because of possible dangers, why live at all?

I work at an amusement park, and I'm glad our employees check harnesses even on the ones you won't fly out of. Safety is key.

What is written for the most part is second hand salvos coming from some who were told by others or news articles that make good and disturbing readings. Today however, I read

the article I am posting here in my city newspaper. It is written by State Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison)...who was there, ""at the American Legislative Exchange Council conference, the nation's most influential conservative policy organization (""ALEC"".

Here is her response:

).

I recently donned a conservative blue suit and suppressed my political ideals to attend an American Legislative Exchange Council conference, the nation's most influential conservative policy organization. As a Wisconsin Democratic legislator, I was able to see the ALEC agenda in action.

ALEC is mostly funded by large corporations. While most legislators who attended the conference received corporate funded ""scholarships"" covering their travel, hotel, conference registration and food, I forked over nearly $1,000 out of pocket to become a member of ALEC and attend its 40th anniversary conference in Chicago in August.

ALEC is a ménage à trois of wealthy corporations, conservative think tanks and right-wing state legislators. I was simultaneously fascinated and horrified by the degree ALEC policy infests our country, maximizing corporate profits and free reign. One keynote speaker, Wall Street Journal columnist and Club for Growth founder Stephen Moore, summed it up: ""What we really need is more rich people.""

ALEC develops model bills on ""free market"" topics that legislative members introduce in their states. State legislators, corporations and conservative think tank members comprise task forces that create model bills. Corporate money coughed up in exchange for task force membership greases ALEC's wheels. As a result, private members run the ALEC show. In rare instances where state legislators raised concerns about policy positions, I witnessed think tank representatives and corporate lobbyists shoot them down.

The Citizens for Self-Governance, a special-interest group that ALEC promotes, demonstrated how the process works. Legislators were entreated to organize to ""save the Republic"" by amending the U.S. Constitution to abolish the Supreme Court and otherwise drastically limit the power of the federal government. In exchange, we were promised the support of a grass-roots army of tea party activists and home-school advocates in addition to bundled campaign contributions.

ALEC is well underway to privatizing public education. According to the Center for Media and Democracy, in 2013, 139 ALEC model bills to fund private and religious schools with taxpayer money were introduced throughout the nation. At the education task force meeting, the pro-voucher American Federation for Children boasted 20 states now funding some form of private school K-12 vouchers.

Other model bills aim to gut workers' wage protection and benefits, limit collective bargaining rights, limit your rights to sue and curb states' power to regulate certain professions.

ALEC advances these policies shrouded in secrecy, with no public list of corporate members. Photo ID, name badges and sign-in sheets at every event rigidly controlled conference participation. I saw only one outside press camera during the entire conference. Although ALEC members insist on accountability and transparency in the public realm, they loathe it when applied to their own influence over legislation.

But ALEC has an Achilles heel. An ALEC think tank member solicited my opinion about a constitutional amendment strategy requiring congressional approval of federal regulations. I replied that I didn't think it would inspire people to amend the U.S. Constitution. He explained that with Republican domination in so many states, and guaranteed corporate support, the consent of the people is unnecessary.

This is where democracy can win over special interest influence. In ALEC nation, people are irrelevant and democracy a burden. When the people's interests are truly represented by policy-makers, and the origin of bills exposed, ALEC fails.

ALEC's corporate funders, who are also campaign donors to many ALEC members, have shrouded themselves in secrecy for this reason. ALEC cannot otherwise exist. Concerned policy-makers and the public must ensure that ALEC's promotion of corporate profits over the needs of actual people leads to the downfall of ALEC nation.

State Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) will soon introduce the ALEC Accountability Act into the Wisconsin Legislature. Before being elected to the Assembly, Taylor, an attorney, served as public policy director for Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin.

And there are more.

The crucial point is that in some situations it’s just difficult for us to take in the relevant information and choose accordingly. It’s not quite the simple ignorance Mill was talking about, but it turns out that our minds are more complicated than Mill imagined. Like the guy about to step through the hole in the bridge, we need help.

Is it always a mistake when someone does something imprudent, when, in this case, a person chooses to chug 32 ounces of soda? No. For some people, that’s the right choice. They don’t care that much about their health, or they won’t drink too many big sodas, or they just really love having a lot of soda at once.

But laws have to be sensitive to the needs of the majority. That doesn’t mean laws should trample the rights of the minority, but that public benefit is a legitimate concern, even when that may inconvenience some.

So do these laws mean that some people will be kept from doing what they really want to do? Probably — and yes, in many ways it hurts to be part of a society governed by laws, given that laws aren’t designed for each one of us individually. Some of us can drive safely at 90 miles per hour, but we’re bound by the same laws as the people who can’t, because individual speeding laws aren’t practical. Giving up a little liberty is something we agree to when we agree to live in a democratic society that is governed by laws.

The freedom to buy a really large soda, all in one cup, is something we stand to lose here. For most people, given their desire for health, that results in a net gain. For some people, yes, it’s an absolute loss. It’s just not much of a loss.

Of course, what people fear is that this is just the beginning: today it’s soda, tomorrow it’s the guy standing behind you making you eat your broccoli, floss your teeth, and watch “PBS NewsHour” every day. What this ignores is that successful paternalistic laws are done on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis: if it’s too painful, it’s not a good law. Making these analyses is something the government has the resources to do, just as now it sets automobile construction standards while considering both the need for affordability and the desire for safety."

USA TODAY

On a rainy day%2C President Obama performs the traditional turkey pardoning

Obama also jokes about turkey pardons

Today marked the 66th annual presentation of the National Thanksgiving Turkey

As the wind blew and the rain fell, President Obama stepped outside the White House for five minutes today for a holiday ritual: pardoning a lucky turkey named Popcorn.

Obama also engaged in another White House tradition: Telling jokes about the turkey pardoning.

""The office of the presidency — the most powerful position in the world — brings with it many awesome and solemn responsibilities,"" Obama said during a ceremony on the North Portico.

""This is not one of them.""

Noting that Popcorn was one of 80 birds that competed for a pardon from the Thanksgiving table, Obama said: ""It was, quite literally, the Hunger Games.""

As daughters Malia and Sasha and official guests looked on, Obama asserted his presidential authority: ""Popcorn, you have a full reprieve from cranberry sauce and stuffing. We wish you well.""

As for runner-up Caramel — who is also being spared this Thanksgiving — Obama joked that ""he's already busy raising money for his next campaign.""

The president, first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters were scheduled to do a Thanksgiving-related public service event later on Thursday.

This was the 66th annual presentation of the National Thanksgiving Turkey, courtesy of the National Turkey Federation.

Voters across the country got to choose between finalists Popcorn and Caramel by casting ballots via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Caramel and Popcorn, both of whom are 20 weeks old and weigh about 38 pounds each, grew up on a farm in Minnesota. After the ceremony, they were driven to George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens for public viewing during the holidays.

Various organizations have been giving turkeys to presidents for years — the practice can be traced back to at least the 1870s — and Abraham Lincoln is said to have saved the life of a dinner-bound fowl that his son had taken a shine to.

In years past, many presidents have simply eaten turkeys presented to them.

The White House Historical Association pointed out that a Washington Post newspaper story used the terms ""pardon"" and ""reprieve"" when President John F. Kennedy said of the national turkey, ""let's keep him going.""

In 1989, President George H.W. Bush said: ""'Reprieve,' 'keep him going,' or 'pardon': It's all the same for the turkey, as long as he doesn't end up on the president's holiday table."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/02/pentagon-floats-plan-to-close-us-commissaries/,2013-12-02 00:00:00,['Justin Fishel'],Pentagon floats plan to close US commissaries,"The Pentagon is floating a controversial plan to close all U.S.-based commissaries in 2015 as part of a massive cost-saving effort after more than a decade of war.

The commissaries are grocery stores that offer food and other necessities at a discount to members of the military, their families and veterans. But as Congress tightens the purse strings, the stores could get caught in the budget battle.

Budget cutters say they don't yet know how much money the plan would save, but there are 178 commissaries in the United States -- and 70 overseas -- which receive a total of $1.4 billion in government funds.

The Defense Commissary Agency, responsible for administering all commissaries worldwide, says military families and retirees save an average of more than 30 percent on their grocery bills compared with those who shop at regular retail stores. The agency says those savings amount to thousands of dollars annually per family.

But families could also lose jobs if the stores close. Thirty percent of the employees at the commissaries are military spouses. The director of the Defense Commissary Agency says that they have already cut their budget by $700 million since 1993.

More On This...

Other military services -- including the Pentagon Channel and Stars and Stripes newspaper -- may also face cuts, along with Armed Forces Radio and Television, which broadcasts football games and news for service members overseas. Stars and Stripes, an independently edited military newspaper, has been around since the Civil War and has over 200,000 daily readers. It collects just $7.8 million a year in government subsidies. To put this number in perspective, the U.S. spent $135 million in fuel for the Afghan military this year -- part of the $4 billion the nation budgeted to support the entire Afghan military this year.

Defense officials say none of these cuts have been made yet and no final decision has been reached. But, according to Pentagon Spokesman Col. Steve Warren, ""everything has to be on the table.""

Still, Warren said: ""No commissaries have closed. No commissaries are about to close. As with every other program that's out there, we're taking a look at how we can save money. We're just taking a look. No one's decided to do anything.""

Any cuts to military benefits would ultimately have to be approved and passed by Congress.

Patrons offered mixed opinions about the proposed changes.

Officials at Joint Base Myer Henderson Hall in Arlington, Va., would not allow Fox News to interview shoppers at the on-post commissary, but passersby spoke to Fox News outside the Pentagon.

""I definitely think it's a bad thing to take away the commissaries, because that's a benefit that a lot of soldiers and family members utilize."" said Sgt Major Steven Scott. Scott said it's not only about lower costs, but it's also a matter of convenience for families who are able to shop on post.

Others who take advantage of the benefit, like Joseph Shubert, say it's a better option for cutting than some of the alternatives.

""I don't like it, but I understand that choices have to be made,"" Shubert said. ""So, if it's this or, say, cutting our retirement paychecks or things like that, you know one way or another I think this is one of the least bad options."""

Washington (CNN) - The tea party is more unpopular than ever, according to a new national poll that also suggests that even many Republicans now view the grass-roots conservative movement in a negative light.

A Pew Research Center survey released Wednesday also indicates that Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the ringleaders of the conservative push to tie dismantling the national health care law to the funding of the federal government, has seen his popularity jump among tea party Republicans and drop among non-tea party GOPers.



According to the poll, which was conducted October 9 through Sunday, 49% of Americans said they have a negative view of the tea party, a slight rise of four percentage points from June. Three in 10 questioned said they see the tea party in a positive light, down seven points from June.

The tea party movement was born in early 2009 to protest the Wall Street bailouts initiated under President George W. Bush a few months earlier. It also opposed the stimulus and other economic and health care policies of President Barack Obama, who succeeded Bush in the White House.

The poll indicates the drop in favorable views of the tea party is not coming just from Democrats and independents.

""The Tea Party’s favorability rating has fallen across most groups since June, but the decline has been particularly dramatic among moderate and liberal Republicans. In the current survey, just 27% of moderate and liberal Republicans have a favorable impression of the Tea Party, down from 46% in June,"" a release from the Pew Research Center said.

Cruz has become much more visible during the shutdown and the showdown leading up the shutdown. And the poll indicates Cruz's popularity among tea party Republicans has soared, from 47% in July to 74% now. But among those who say they are non-tea party Republicans, the freshman senator from Texas and possible 2016 GOP White House contender's unfavorable rating jumped from 16% to 31%.

http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/01/justin-bieber-photographer-experts-say-new-paparazzi-laws-not-needed.html,,[],Justin Bieber photographer: Experts say new paparazzi laws not needed,"As Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus called for stronger anti-paparazzi measures after a photographer trying to snap a picture of Bieber's Ferrari was killed Tuesday, experts said the laws already on the books are enough -- they just need to be enforced.

""We have plenty of laws,"" said Blair Berk, a Beverly Hills attorney who has represented numerous celebrities. ""Better enforcement of the existing laws is the answer.""

The photographer was killed Tuesday evening when he was hit by a car while crossing Sepulveda Boulevard near Getty Center Drive. A California Highway Patrol officer had pulled Bieber's sports car over for a traffic stop; the photographer arrived on scene, snapped photos and was struck as he returned to his own car.

A friend of Bieber's was driving the car at the time, officials said. The pop singer was not in the vehicle.

Law enforcement sources said Wednesday that it's unlikely charges will be filed against the driver of the car that hit the photographer.

In a statement Wednesday, Bieber went on the offensive, calling on lawmakers to crack down.

""Hopefully this tragedy will finally inspire meaningful legislation and whatever other necessary steps to protect the lives and safety of celebrities, police officers, innocent public bystanders and the photographers themselves,"" he said."

In 2010 at the Orlando park, killer whale Tilikum snatched trainer Dawn Brancheau from a platform and thrashed her around underwater until she died. Federal workplace investigators later cited SeaWorld, saying trainers were exposed to hazards because they were allowed unprotected contact with the killer whales.

In the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday, SeaWorld Entertainment’s attorney Eugene Scalia -- son of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia -- took issue with the way a clause in the Occupational Safety and Health Act was applied to SeaWorld.

The General Safety Clause requires that employers provide a workplace that’s free from hazards that could cause death or serious physical harm to employees. However, as the plaintiffs argue in briefs filed with the court, the clause “cannot be used to force a company to change the very product that it offers to the public, and the business it is in.”

For SeaWorld, its business is close contact, Scalia argued. Close contact is defined as trainers being more than knee-deep in the water.

“SeaWorld exists to offer the opportunity to view that close interaction between whales and people. That is its product that it’s offering,” Scalia said in court.

For that reason, he argued, OSHA can’t prohibit SeaWorld from allowing such contact between trainers and whales.

According to a recording of the proceedings posted on the court’s website, Scalia told the three-judge panel: “It’s as if the federal government came in and told the NFL that close contact on the football field would have to end because, after all, more people are injured in the NFL on any given Sunday than were injured in the 22-year period that OSHA looked at in this case.”

Amy Tryon, an attorney representing the Department of Labor, argued that close contact posed a serious risk to trainers.

On Feb. 24, 2010, Brancheau, an experienced trainer, was snatched by Tilikum while she was rubbing his nose after a show, then dragged underwater and killed as audience members watched. Tilikum had been involved in two other deaths, including one at the water park in 1999.

“SeaWorld’s training program does not take the predatory instinct out of these animals,” Tryon said, according to the recording.

Collectively, the SeaWorld parks in Orlando, San Antonio and San Diego house the world’s largest collection of killer whales.

Tryon agreed that making the NFL switch to tag or touch football would likely put an entire industry out of business. However, she said close contact isn’t essential to SeaWorld’s product.

Since Brancheau’s death, SeaWorld has continued to offer killer whale shows every day in all three SeaWorld parks, but trainers do not enter the water beyond knee-level, SeaWorld Entertainment communications vice president told the Los Angeles Times.

That change at SeaWorld, Tryon argued, proves that the ban on close contact does not run the risk of shutting down an industry. The Times reported in August that park attendance was down 6% in the first half of 2013.

“It has not put SeaWorld out of business,” she said.

The treatment of orcas in captivity has received increased attention in recent months with the release of the documentary “Blackfish,” which critically tracks the years Tilikum has spent performing in aquatic parks.

Arguments before the judges concluded Tuesday. A ruling will likely be reached in a few months.

""You may be as straight as an arrow, and you may have a friend that is as straight as an arrow,” she told the Journal. “Say you had a great job with the government where you had this wonderful health plan. I mean, what would prohibit you from saying that you’re gay, and y’all get married and still live as separate, but you get all the benefits? I just see so much abuse in this it’s unreal. I believe a husband and a wife should be a man and a woman, the benefits should be for a man and a woman. There is no way that this is about equality. To me, it’s all about a free ride.”

It's theoretically possible that such a scenario could happen, but there isn't any evidence of widespread fraud following the adoption of gay marriage in nine states and the District of Columbia. Though fictional, the premise of the 2007 Adam Sandler movie ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" was a pair of straight firefighters getting domestic partnership status.

Everhart does not note the possibility of marriage fraud among opposite-sex couples, though others have warned against marriage fraud committed in order to get immigration benefits. In reality, the number of proven cases of such fraud is extremely small.

Everhart also said she could not understand how two gay people could ever have sex. ""If it was natural, they would have the equipment to have a sexual relationship,"" she told the Journal."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/22/Report-Rogue-IRS-Agent-Claim-Unraveling,2013-05-22 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],Report: 'Rogue' IRS Agent Claim Unraveling,"An investigation by Cincinnati Fox 19 reporter Ben Swann finds that Obama Administration claims that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting of conservative groups was the work of two “rogue” low-level employees in Cincinnati, Ohio, strain credulity and are “falling apart.”

Swann reports that so far six IRS agents working out of the Cincinnati office–which is the central hub for processing tax-exempt applications–have been identified as sending scrutinizing letters to conservative groups. These include:

Mitchel Steele-IRS Agent

Carly Young-IRS Agent

Joseph Herr-IRS Agent

Stephen Seok-IRS Supervisor

Liz Hofacre-IRS Agent

Ms. Richards (full name unknown)-IRS Agent

These agents report to different managers, with a territory manager overseeing those managers.

Swann explains how the process works:

When an application for tax exempt status comes into the IRS, agents have 270 days to work through that application. If the application is not processed within those 270 days it automatically triggers flags in the system. When that happens, individual agents are required to input a status update on that individual case once a month, every month until the case is resolved. Keep in mind, at least 300 groups were targeted out of Cincinnati alone. Those applications spent anywhere from 18 months to nearly 3 years in the system and some still don’t have their non-profit status. 300 groups multiplied by at least 18 months for each group, means thousands of red flags would have been generated in the system. So who in the chain of command would have received all these flags? The answer, according to the IRS directory, one woman in Cincinnati, Cindy Thomas, the Program Manager of the Tax Exempt Division. Because all six of our IRS workers have different individual and territory managers, Cindy Thomas is one manager they all have common. It turns out Cindy Thomas’ name is one we have heard before. The independent journalism group ProPublica says in November of 2012 they had requested information on conservatives groups that had received non-profit status.

Cindy Thomas, says Swann, is the highest-ranking employee in the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Department in Cincinnati.

Democrats unleashed a barrage of pointed questions to IRS officials on Wednesday in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) said if witnesses today are not more forthcoming and continue to stonewall the committee, “it will lead to a special prosecutor” in order “to get to the bottom of this.” He warned that “there will be hell to pay if that’s the route we go down.”

“It is possible that criminal activity may have occurred,” said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George."

Updated: 2:06 p.m. ET, 10/17/2013

Washington (CNN) – Amid all the chaos of the last-minute deal in Washington, there was an unusual moment on the House floor moments after the bill passed.

A House stenographer and well-known employee calmly took to a microphone and began screaming.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""Do not be deceived. God shall not be mocked. A House divided cannot stand,"" she said, according to a House GOP aide. After a few seconds, she was escorted out by the Sergeant-at-Arms, but an audio recording by Todd Zwillich of Public Radio International captured the rest of her rant.

""He will not be mocked, He will not be mocked, (don't touch me) He will not be mocked. The greatest deception here, is that this is not one nation under God. It never was. Had it been... it would not have been... No. it would not have been... the Constitution would not have been written by Free Masons... and go against God. You cannot serve two masters. You cannot serve two masters. Praise be to God, Lord Jesus Christ.""

House members and aides were surprised and unsettled by the scene.

""I don't know, she just snapped,"" said a GOP aide.

CNN's Dana Bash spoke with several staffers who knew the woman well.

""She’s a well-known person, she’s a perfectly nice person, a good colleague, somebody who’s respectable and dependable, and this is very surprising to everybody who works with her,"" Bash reported on air.

""The Sergeant in Arms didn’t try to stop her because she works there and that’s where she’s situated,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told Jake Tapper. ""And she actually went up behind the podium where the president speaks from. They thought she was going to hand something to the speaker, and then they realized.""

Officer Shennell S. Antrobus of Capitol Police told CNN she wasn’t arrested or charged and was transported to a local area hospital by DC Fire for further evaluation.

In terms of an ongoing investigation or further action about the stenographer, Antrobus said no such action will be taken.

""There is nothing more, from our end, that we are going to do,"" Antrobus said.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/19/Fed-court-signals-AZ-Drivers-license,2013-05-19 00:00:00,['Ken Klukowski'],Federal Court Signals AZ's Denial of Driver's License for Illegals in Trouble,"U.S. District Judge David Campbell handed both sides a partial victory at the first stage in a case challenging Arizona Governor Jan Brewer’s executive order that her state will not issue driver’s licenses to illegal aliens allowed to stay in this country temporarily under President Barack Obama’s amnesty program of not pursuing deportation for many illegal aliens. But the judge also signaled that Brewer was likely to lose this case in the end, and these illegal aliens will end up with Arizona licenses.

In 2012 Obama issued an executive order creating his temporary amnesty program. After Congress refused to pass Obama’s proposed DREAM Act on enact an immigration bill granting amnesty to millions of foreigners who entered this country illegally, the president violated his constitutional duty to take care to faithfully execute the law by announcing that he would not deport large groups of illegals that he thinks should receive amnesty. A federal judge is Texas recently held the administration’s actions illegal, but that issue has not yet been resolved on appeal.

In response to Obama’s executive order and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano’s subsequent halting of deportations, Brewer issued an order to the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles ordering them to stop accepting federal documents from those illegal aliens granted temporary amnesty for purposes of issuing driver’s licenses. An advocacy group for illegal aliens filed a lawsuit challenging Brewer’s actions in Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer.

Brewer filed a motion to dismiss the suit, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Brewer’s actions while the lawsuit proceeds. On May 16, Judge Campbell denied both motions.

Campbell rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Brewer’s order violates the Supremacy Clause by conflicting with federal law. He correctly reasoned that Obama’s order and Napolitano’s follow-up actions carry no force of law under the Constitution, and therefore do not amount to a federal law that would trump state law.

However, Campbell held it was very likely that the plaintiffs’ alternative argument that Brewer’s order violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will ultimately succeed. Although he correctly held that the lowest form of judicial scrutiny–called rational-basis review–is the legal standard for a case like this, he then reasoned that Brewer’s order was likely to fail under even that deferential standard when he issues a final ruling on the merits of this case.

Campbell writes:

“The Governor’s disagreement with the DACA [amnesty] program may be a rational political or policy view in a broad sense–reasonable people certainly can disagree on an issue as complex and difficult as immigration–but it provides no justification for saying that an Arizona’s driver’s license may be issued to one person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status–say for an individual humanitarian reason–while another person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status under the DACA program is denied a license.”

The court noted that both groups of aliens have their deportation actions deferred through prosecutorial discretion, both have temporary status, both are federally eligible to work, and both have documents that have always been accepted by Arizona for driver’s licenses. Campbell noted that Arizona asserts four bases for why Brewer’s law is rational, but concluded that Brewer’s order blocking one group of illegal aliens from getting licenses, but not the other group, undermined the argument of why her order was reasonably related to advancing the public interests she asserted in court.

Campbell has the pedigree of a conservative judge. A Utah native, he clerked for Justice William Rehnquist (before he became chief justice) on the Supreme Court. The opinion is well-written and gives Brewer her due. It seems unlikely that he will change his mind later in this case, or that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will reverse his decision.

And so the latest fight between Obama and Arizona over immigration continues.

Perhaps Dwyane Wade can help President Obama make picks next year (USA TODAY Sports Images)

UPDATE (10:38 pm ET): Saturday night proved strong for the President. After correctly predicting Marquette's win over Butler, Obama has surged above the 50th percentile nationally and is heading towards the 60th, with plenty of chalky points remaining for Sunday.

UPDATE (2:20 pm ET): If President Obama's pick of Wisconsin yesterday — part of picking the Badgers to the Sweet 16 — was the nadir of his round of 64 picks, then he earns a measure of redemption today. Obama correctly picked Michigan over VCU, and has the Wolverines knocking off Kansas in the Sweet 16 to get to the Elite Eight. After the way Michigan dismantled VCU, that looks like a great pick right now.

After the round of 64, President Obama's NCAA tournament bracket picks are behind more than 60% of the country.

Friday's set of games featured one big high (picking LaSalle over Kansas State) and one modest upset pick (Minnesota over UCLA, which half the country predicted), but also some tough misses, most notably Wisconsin, one of the President's Elite Eight picks.

He was caught up in the Georgetown debacle — who wasn't? — but also missed the other game in that bracket pairing, picking Oklahoma instead of San Diego State.

His final round of 64 tally: 20-12, losing three Sweet 16 teams in the process (Wisconsin, Georgetown and New Mexico).

Looking ahead to the round of 32, the President went all chalk (the top four seeds in each region), besides Wisconsin. With most of the country picking the same way, he won't gain much ground, but any upsets mean he won't fall further behind, either.

It is too early to say that the president's bracket was busted in the tournament's manic first two days, but if nothing else, he gets to sit back and enjoy the ""Marshall Henderson vs. LaSalle for a Sweet 16 spot"" show unencumbered by bracket allegiances."

Maureen Dowd Knocks One Out Of The Park For Once,"The New York Times Columnist whom George W. Bush famously referred to as ""The Viper"" (and the author of ""Are Men Necessary?"" to boot) hasn't hit a home run with us in a long time. Most of the time she hasn't made it to second base. But today she (if you'll excuse this exercise in double entendres) nails it.

Excoriating the House Republicans' recent ""impeachment fixation,"" Dowd goes straight to the heart of the matter:

For some of the rodeo clowns clamoring for impeachment around the country, Barack Obama’s real crime is presiding while black.

Earlier this month, the president’s motorcade pulled into the Orlando Hilton and was greeted by about 50 protesters holding signs saying “Kenyan Go Home,” “Impeach Obama” and “Obama Lies.” BuzzFeed had a pictorial on the “Overpasses for Obama’s Impeachment” fad, where people hold up homemade signs on overpasses. And they reported on 100,000 preorders for the book “Impeachable Offenses: The Case for Removing Barack Obama from Office,” covering sore points from Benghazi to Obamacare to T.S.A. screenings.

“I stood 12 feet away from the guy and listened to him and I couldn’t stand being there,” he said of President Obama, “but because he is president I have to respect the office.” Bentivolio is the perfect avatar of the impeachment fever gripping a G.O.P. that’s unmoored from reality....

Not content with fighting off a popular immigration overhaul or threatening to shut down the government and set off the first federal default, hard-core Congressional Republicans want to nullify the election. Unlike when the Republicans did their nutty impeachment of Bill Clinton — (Newt Gingrich is back, starring in the “Crossfire” reboot) — they don’t even control the Senate. And as David Axelrod told me, there isn’t a “scintilla of justification.”

Perhaps the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington prompted her to train her venom where it really belongs. Whatever the cause, there's not a trace of the mocking ""Barry"" epithet she habitually throws out when criticizing the President. Instead, she focuses on the sheer rank idiocy of the GOP's obsessive campaign to impeach him, a campaign rooted in principle since he won the Democratic Primary in 2008 but one that now appears to be entering an even more virulent phase thanks to Fox News and right-wing talk radio:Her column castigates Michigan Congressman Kerry Bentivolio, who gratuitously advised us that he can't even bear being in proximity to President Obama and is one of the prime cheerleaders of the ""impeachment movement:""Dowd's verdict on this sorry Republican strategy is harsh:Of course she's right. But what she doesn't acknowledge is the likelihood that the Republicans know full well their impeachment talk is hollow, yet they persist in it to satisfy their core constituents who apparently thrive on a diet of racism and bile. Had she faced up to that uncomfortable reality, this column could have been a classic. But God knows we can't blame the constituents for the behavior of their Representatives, can we?

Still, she does get the point:

The Democrats never impeached W. and they had real grounds: starting a war on false premises and sanctioning torture. “The Republican Party is in a constant struggle between its ego and its id,” Axelrod says, “and the id has mostly won out lately.” It isn’t the president who should leave. It’s the misguided lawmakers trying to drive him out.

Except they're not ""misguided."" They're just playing to the impotent rage of the people who voted for them."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/12/05/Softball-Obama-Matthews,2013-12-05 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Date Night: Chris Matthews Tosses Softballs to Obama,"With President Obama’s approval ratings sinking thanks to the failing Obamacare rollout and the unpopular nuclear deal with Iran, Obama broke the media emergency glass to access the MSNBC host Chris Matthews. Matthews, who has compared Obama to Jesus and Henry V, and said that he was “the perfect American,” tossed Obama softball after softball, to which Obama gave stock answer after stock answer.

Matthews began by asking Obama about young people not signing up for health insurance. Obama said they should. Obama then made this stunning statement: “Sometimes on your station, MSNBC, I’ve been blasted for being too willing to compromise.” This nonsense passed without question from Matthews, who obviously was not in the mood to blast the president with anything but waves of hot love.

Matthews asked a question about National Security Agency surveillance. President Obama defended NSA activities, stating, “The NSA actually does a very good job about not engaging in domestic surveillance, not reading people’s emails.” He then added, wrongly, that outside of American borders, the NSA was “not constrained by laws.”

But that did not prompt a follow-on from Matthews. Instead, Matthews played a clip of John F. Kennedy speaking at American University, obviously attempting to link Obama with JFK. “”How do we get back to that confidence that we can solve our man-made problems and other problems?” Matthews drooled. Obama responded, “I have that confidence,” explaining that America was “on the brink of energy independence,” and stating that America is “still the envy of the world.”

Then Obama turned to the attack, stating that “Congress” is the big problem, since it “spends too much time worrying about the next election and not enough time worrying about the next generation.” Which part of the Congress? Obama explained: “The challenge we’ve got is we’ve got a faction of the Republican Party that sees compromise as a dirty word, that has moved so far to the right that it would be difficult for a Ronald Reagan to win the nomination of the Republican Party at this point.”

Matthews never uttered a word of disagreement. Instead, with all the subtly of a sledgehammer, Matthews goaded Obama on: “You’ve got three and a half more years to deal with this situation.”

And Obama took the bait, stating that in order for big things to happen, he had to have a Congressional majority. “The only thing that’s stopping [progress on issues like immigration] at this point is…a faction in the House Republican Party that is resistant,” Obama stated. He added that he believes that Republicans have “got to be embarrassed.”

Matthews, in full-on history professor mode, then turned to a 1964 poll showing that Americans believed that the federal government did the right thing most of the time. With forlorn hope in his eyes, he asked Obama, “What’s going to arrest that decline in that faith in you doing the right thing?” Obama solemnly intoned, “the cynicism and the skepticism is deep.”

Which brought the interview to the Bash Bush segment. Talking about the glories of the federal government, Obama praised the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Craig Fugate. “He’s really doing a good job, unlike his predecessor,” Matthews agreed, apparently referring to former FEMA head Michael Brown. Obama, picking up on the Bush-bashing, referred back to President Bush’s infamous statement that Brown had done a “heckuva job” in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina: Fugate, Obama said, was “doing a heckuva job.” That meant, Obama continued, that the federal government was great at doing things, but that the media never covered those wonderful accomplishments – an odd contention given the media’s nonstop coverage of the Obama administration’s handling of Hurricane Sandy just before Election 2012.

But that wasn’t Obama’s point. He wanted to argue that the media wasn’t paying attention to FEMA but was paying attention to the IRS scandal, in which the IRS targeted Tea Party 501(c)(4) organizations. The IRS had targeted those organizations, Obama explained, for “bureaucratic reasons,” and “suddenly everybody is outraged.” Matthews nodded, “501(c)4 law is tricky to begin with.”

Obama continued, “There are a couple million people working for the federal government…Someone at this very moment is screwing something up.” But Obama said that he’d try to rein in all of these nefarious actors: “I have to consistently push…how can we do things better?” He then called for “reorganiziation” of the government, saying that it was designed in 1934-35.

In completing his longwinded answer about why Americans had lost confidence in government, Obama blamed Ronald Reagan, who said government was the problem. That notion, Obama said, was damaging to the country: “Government’s not somebody else. Government’s us.”

Smiling warmly, Matthews then asked, “Let’s talk about the chief executive, you.” He continued, “There’s all kinds of theories about how to be president…There should have been a CEO assigned by you…to oversee the rollout of healthcare.” He finished, “It seemed like there wasn’t a strong, top-down authority structure from you…What is your system?”

Obama said that the failure of Obamacare’s rollout was an outlier. The government, he insisted, had worked beautifully in all of its other aspects under his administration.:”It is important to distinguish between this particular project, where it is obvious that we needed additional controls in place because it didn’t deliver on time the way we wanted, and how we’ve managed incredibly complex problems over the past five years.” Obama then said he’d hold “every cabinet member accountable” – although apparently not Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – and then laughably added, “I have an open door policy where I want people to be bringing me bad news on time so we can fix things. The challenge I think we have going forward is not so much my personal management style…it actually has to do with what I referred to earlier. We have these big agencies.” That open door policy has meant that according to the White House, Obama was out of the loop on the IRS scandal, the DOJ’s targeting of journalists, the security situation in Libya, and every other scandal undergone by the administration.

Then the interview got truly bad. Matthews read a Twitter question: “What can we do to stop #GOP rigging the vote state by state to disenfranchise our voters & destroy our democracy?”

Without challenging the premise of the question, Matthews then stated, “Everybody knows the game, Republicans often admit the game.” Obama answered by blasting voter ID laws.

Just before the commercial break, Obama wrapped up in typical Obama style: he blamed everyone else. “You may agree with me or disagree with me, but don’t make the mistake of thinking it all ends with me,” he said.

MSNBC then cut to break by playing a segment from Obama’s 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention in a blatant effort to breathe some magic into the wilting commander-in-chief.

Back from break, the awkward date continued. MSNBC played a clip of Obama saying he would run for president in 2007, followed by a clip of a slightly-less-frazzled Matthews, who proclaimed, “This is going to be remembered as a great day in American politics.”

Fast forward six years. Matthews hadn’t changed. He proceeded to ask Obama about his newfound focus on income inequality – and then he said that as a Roman Catholic, he found Obama’s redistributionism “So resonant with what the Holy Father…would say.”

Obama then blessed the Pope, stating, “I think Pope Francis is showing himself to be an extraordinarily thoughtful and soulful messenger of peace and justice.”

Finally, Obama turned to the role of government. As it turns out, Obama thinks the government can do virtually everything. Whether “creating the internet” or “curing diseases,” Obama stated, “there are some things we do better together, and we should take pride as a nation in our ability to work in concert.” He said that all of America’s future rested on American buying into the notion of government handling all of our big problems: “In fact the big challenges we have…those are not things that Chris Matthews or Barack Obama can solve for ourselves. By necessity we’re going to have to do those together. If we can at least agree on that…then we can figure out the specific policies and that’s where we can compromise or negotiate.” He then added, as an afterthought, “I won’t compromise” regarding the implementation of Obamacare.

Matthews, thoroughly pleased with how the interview was going, asked President Obama to answer “a little question you might not like to answer”: Hillary or Biden? Obama demurred, but stated that Biden would “go down in history as one of the best vice presidents ever.”

With the interview winding down, Matthews asked Obama the truly substantive question Americans were dying to hear answered: what’s the most important quality in being president? Obama gave his stock answer: “A sense of connection with the American people.” He then compared himself to Lincoln, FDR, Truman, and Kennedy, and added, “The interesting thing about now having been president for five years is it makes you humble as opposed to cockier about what you as an individual can do. You recognize that you’re part of a sweep of history, and your job is to push the boulder up the hill a little bit.”

Matthews finally asked Obama about running for office, praising him to the skies for sticking to politics after losing a Congressional race in 2000. “How many kids here want to go into politics. Are they right?” Matthews asked.

That essay question allowed Obama to wax poetic: “It continues to be a way to serve that I think can be noble. It’s hard. It can be frustrating, you have to have a thick skin.” He then said that he understood why Americans would join a nonprofit or start a business, noting, “We’re not completely government centered.” Then he said that he found it rewarding when people came up to him and said, “My kid’s alive because you passed that healthcare bill.” Really. “It’s pretty hard to get greater satisfaction than that,” he concluded.

The panel of Joy Reid, Howard Fineman, and David Corn then attempted to spin Obama back to the halcyon days of 2007, before he was president, with all three labeling Obama warm, open, and idealistic. Perhaps the only honest moment came from Fineman, who observed that Obama had now moved “from Superman to Sisyphus.”

Le président américain a invité les parlementaires à s'attaquer aux réformes de l'immigration et de l'agriculture et à s'entendre sur un budget durable. Les événements des deux dernières semaines à Washington, a-t-il poursuivi, ont infligé des dégâts ""totalement inutiles"" à l'économie américaine. ""Tous mes amis du Congrès doivent comprendre que la façon dont le travail est fait dans cette ville doit changer, parce que nous avons tous beaucoup de pain sur la planche."" Barack Obama s'exprimait une douzaine d'heures après avoir promulgué la loi sur le relèvement du plafond de la dette et la reprise de l'activité dans les services publics, qui ont été en partie paralysés pendant 16 jours. ""Maintenant que l'administration a rouvert et que cette menace pour l'économie est levée, nous devons tous cesser de nous focaliser sur les lobbyistes, les blogueurs, les animateurs de radio et les militants professionnels qui profitent des conflits pour nous concentrer sur ce que la majorité des Américains nous ont envoyés faire ici"", a-t-il ajouté. La loi qu'il a promulguée mercredi n'apporte qu'une solution temporaire et ne résout en rien la question du contrôle des dépenses fédérales ni celle du déficit budgétaire qui divisent profondément républicains et démocrates. Elle permet le financement des services fédéraux jusqu'au 15 janvier et autorise le Trésor à emprunter jusqu'au 7 février, en lui laissant une marge de manoeuvre supplémentaire si le Congrès ne parvient pas à un accord définitif au début de l'an prochain. Le compromis ne tient pas compte de la principale demande des républicains qui, sous l'influence du 'Tea Party', favorable à une forte réduction de la fiscalité et des dépenses publiques, voulaient remettre en cause l'ensemble de la réforme du système de santé, dite ""Obamacare"". FOLIE Les déclarations du président démocrate n'ont guère impressionné les républicains, qui lui promettent de nouvelles heures difficiles. ""Le président doit finalement prendre conscience que les républicains ont remporté la majorité à la Chambre et qu'il partage la responsabilité de gouverner"", a réagi Brendan Buck, porte-parole du président de la Chambre des représentants, John Boehner. ""Si le président persiste à refuser de négocier ou à effectuer la moindre véritable concession, je ne sais pas comment il espère qu'on parvienne à quoi que ce soit susceptible d'aider le peuple américain."" Un attaché parlementaire républicain de haut rang a aussi déclaré: ""Où était-il durant tout ce temps? Se montrer une fois que tout est fini pour venir donner des leçons, ça ne sert à rien."" L'échec des républicains à fragiliser l'Obamacare a semé la discorde au sein du Grand Old Party, auquel l'opinion impute la responsabilité de la crise. ""Nous avons mené bataille. Il est temps maintenant de nous replier et d'identifier les choses sur lesquelles nous pouvons nous entendre"", a estimé le député républicain Tom Cole, membre de l'équipe chargée des négociations à venir sur le budget. Plusieurs centaines de milliers de fonctionnaires mis en chômage technique pendant le ""shutdown"" des services publics ont repris le travail jeudi. Le vice-président Joe Biden a lui-même apporté des viennoiseries aux membres de l'Agence de protection de l'environnement (EPA), tandis que le secrétaire à l'Agriculture Tom Vilsack accueillait le personnel de son ministère. ""J'espère juste que nous ne vivrons pas ça de nouveau dans deux mois"", a déclaré une sous-traitante de l'EPA. La croissance économique américaine sera sans doute inférieure à ce qui était initialement prévu en raison de l'érosion de la confiance provoquée par la crise politico-budgétaire qui a sévi ces deux dernières semaines à Washington, montre une enquête Reuters publiée jeudi. (voir ) Le quatrième trimestre 2013 devait être celui de la transition vers une croissance plus solide, mais les économistes interrogés sont de moins en moins optimistes. ""La folie à Washington pénalise la confiance du consommateur et des entreprises. C'est une véritable entrave pour la croissance"", a estimé Joel Naroff, économiste en chef chez Naroff Economic Advisors. L'enquête réalisée auprès de plus de 70 économistes entre le 11 octobre et mercredi table sur une croissance de 2,3% du produit intérieur brut en rythme annualisé sur les trois derniers mois de l'année. En avril 2011, la quasi-fermeture de l'administration américaine avait déjà conduit à une impasse sur le plafond de la dette en juillet et en août suivants, ce qui mis les Etats-Unis au bord du défaut et leur a fait perdre leur précieux triple ""AAA"".

He had been urging his Senate colleagues all week to oppose ending debate as a way to force Democrats to accept language defunding the Affordable Care Act. But with the clock ticking toward a shutdown, an overwhelming bipartisan majority wanted to act quickly to move the spending bill back to the House.

The Senate legislation would almost certainly win approval, largely with Democratic votes, if it was put to a vote in the House, but conservatives warned that it could hurt the beleaguered speaker dearly if he took that step.

“I think it would be devastating to the speaker’s support,” said Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina, one of the members urging the Republican leadership to drive a hard bargain with the Senate.

“I think the question is, Do we go with the carrot or the stick strategy?” Mr. Hudson added. “Do we try to do something bad enough to force Harry Reid to negotiate with us, or do we do something that we think he can’t refuse?”

Republicans may also consider a simple bill to keep the government open for as little as seven days while the legislative jousting continues. That was sternly opposed by senior Republicans, like Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee."

Bill Maher: Ronald Reagan was an anti-government, union busting, race bating, anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-intellectual who cut rich people’s taxes in half, had an incurable case of the military industrial complex, and said Medicare was socialism that would destroy our freedom. It sounds to me like he would fit in just fine. …

Even though Reagan did a few things today’s GOP would not like, he wrote the playbook for them for every issue of consequence. Sure he raised taxes a few times, but when you look at where he started with taxes and where he ended, this is where our income inequality problems began. He invented voodoo economics. ...

On race his ideas could not be more ‘Tea Party’. He ran on states’ rights. He invented the notion that black people get all the breaks. …

He described the New Deal as Fascism, Medicare recipients as waiting for handouts, unemployment insurance as prepaid vacation for freeloaders. When they hold up signs that say no socialized medicine, where do you think they got it from? …

Ronald Reagan: And if you and I don’t do this, then you and I may well spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it once was like in America when men were free. …

Bill Maher: Worst of all Reagan inspired a whole generation of people who hate government to get into government. …

USA TODAY

Samuel L. Jackson is the Playboy interview for October and he has a lot to say. He talks about going to rehab in 1990, about having a sneaker ""fetish"" — he has ""hundreds"" of pairs — about golf as the perfect sport, about movies, good grammar, about wife LaTanya Richardson (to whom he's been married for ""40 (effing) years"") and more, including the six movies he has completed in 2013.

If we missed any of his expletives, forgive us. Jackson, 64, uses them freely and frequently.

Some highlights from the lengthy chat:

On never settling for mediocrity: ""On Twitter someone will write, 'Your an idiot,' and I'll go, 'No, you're an idiot,' and all my Twitterphiles will go, 'Hey, Sam Jackson, he's the grammar police.' I'll take that. Somebody needs to be. I mean, we have newscasters who don't even know how to conjugate verbs, something Walter Cronkite and Edward R. Murrow never had problems with. How the ... did we become a society where mediocrity is acceptable.""

On President Obama consciously dropping gs off the ends of words to sound like Joe Average: ""First of all, we know it ain't because of his blackness, so I say stop trying to 'relate.' Be a leader. Be (effing) presidential. Look, I grew up in a society where I could say 'It ain't' or 'What it be' to my friends. But when I'm out presenting myself to the world as me, who graduated from college, who had family what cared about me, who has a well-read background, I (effing) conjugate.""

On defending Quentin Tarantino's controversial use of the ""N"" word in Django Unchained: ""These 20-somethings can't turn around and tell me the word (n-word) is (effed)-up in Django yet still listen to Jay Z or whoever else say '(n-word, n-word, n-word)' throughout the music they listen to. You can't have it one way and not the other ...""

On whether only black directors can tell black stories: ""There is this whole thing of 'Nobody can tell our story but us,' but that's apparently not true, because the Jackie Robinson movie finally got made as 42. Spike (Lee) didn't make it, but people still went to see it.""

On the double standard that exists when telling black stories: ""These stories must be told. If Spike (Lee), the Hughes brothers or Carl Franklin had done it, it would have been right? Look, Quentin has this master storytelling ability, and a lot of criticism from a lot of people is straight (b.s.) jealousy because they can't do it themselves.""

On the one thing he won't do onscreen, even for Quentin Tarantino: ""Probably dress up as a woman and kiss another guy. I don't think people want to see me do that. He hasn't asked me, but you know what? If it's done right and the story is good, I might.""

On working with Josh Brolin (in upcoming Oldboy) and Julianne Moore: ""Josh is good, and he understands the fun aspect of the job. When they say 'Action,' you get serious. 'Cut,' boom. There are a few actors who are like that who are really great, like Julianne Moore. When we were doing Freedomland, Julianne was standing there saying, 'Sam, do you watch American Idol? Oh, it's so great.' They call 'Action!' and she's crying her eyes out; they call 'Cut!' and she comes right back over: 'As I was saying, this American Idol thing ... .' She's amazing.""

On bringing back his Mace Windu character in Star Wars: Episode VII: ""They should figure out a way to bring my (rear) back from wherever I went when I fell out that window, because you know a Jedi can fall from incredible heights and not die. I'd just come back with a fake hand like Darth Vader and my purple lightsaber.""

On the impression he hopes to leave after he's gone: ""That I was a hard worker and I generally gave people their money's worth. That's all you want from a movie star. I mean, I'm not trying to change the world. I'm just trying to entertain people."""

In recent months, he has announced new gun control measures, put in place limited immigration reform and made fixes to the Affordable Care Act — all without Congress. Many liberals who once worried about presidential overreach have applauded his robust use of presidential power.

Yet the president’s increasing unilateralism shouldn’t be cause for celebration. Bypassing Congress means bypassing democratic checks. It also means giving up on government’s ability to effectively address serious long-term challenges. The solution to a dysfunctional Congress isn’t an unchecked executive; it’s a Congress that actually works.

A first step in that direction was taken recently with the banning of filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges below the Supreme Court.

YEAR IN REVIEW: Washington’s 5 biggest ‘fails’ of 2013

The filibuster is not part of our nation’s constitutional design. To the contrary, the framers rejected supermajority requirements except in limited circumstances, such as impeaching the president and ratifying treaties. Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 22 that if “a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority,” there would be “tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.” As a result, the government would often be “kept in a state of inaction.” Sound familiar?

However, the framers certainly wouldn’t have approved of the president responding to this “state of inaction” by simply going around Congress and exercising unilateral powers.

When President George W. Bush was in office, Democrats criticized his go-it-alone approach — his insistence, for example, that he could launch military attacks without Congress’ blessing, or unilaterally tighten restrictions on the use of stem cells in federally funded research. But the last five years have shown that many on the left are willing to turn a blind eye to unchecked executive action when a Democrat is in the White House.

YEAR IN REVIEW: Highs and lows from Obama’s roller-coaster year

It’s no mystery why. Congress has proved a graveyard for serious action on almost every issue. Obama, a professor of constitutional law who once criticized executive unilateralism, has acted alone mainly because it’s the only way he can get anything done.

But while Democrats have the presidency now, they won’t hold it forever. In the meantime, they’re feeding a beast that will be extremely difficult to control in the future. And the policy achievements could prove ephemeral. Anything Obama can achieve alone, a successor can potentially undo.

Worse, the Democratic embrace of unilateralism feeds the cycle of dysfunction. It strips responsibility from Congress, removing whatever is left of the incentive for compromise. And some things near and dear to the hearts of Democrats, such as improving our anemic economy, simply can’t be achieved through executive fiat.

Republicans should also want to fix the status quo. The political branch where they’re strongest is increasingly weak, and things are only going to get worse. After all, even if filibuster reform applies only to judicial and presidential nominees, it will substantially increase the power of the man in the Oval Office they love to hate. He will find it much easier to fill vacancies in the executive branch and federal courts with appointees who will carry out and legally protect executive initiatives. That’s bad for Republicans and the republic.

So what can be done? First, end the filibuster for good — for everything. As we just saw, the majority of the Senate has the power to do this. Yes, the filibuster gives every senator enhanced power to grind government to a halt. But that very same power makes each senator part of an institution that is growing more unpopular and irrelevant by the day.

Second, fix the broken budget process. The federal government should run on last year’s budget if Congress can’t agree on a new one. That would end the opportunities for endless hostage-taking and prevent costly shutdowns. (And while we’re at it, it is well past time to eliminate the redundant debt-ceiling vote, which has caused so much havoc.)

Third, bring transparency to lobbying and campaign donations, and pursue efforts to reduce candidates’ reliance on big donors and powerful lobbyists. Congress won’t be truly accountable to the people until the pull of narrow, wealthy interest groups and intense party activists is weakened.

The hard part, of course, isn’t coming up with sensible reforms in these areas (and we’ve merely hinted at an agenda). It’s getting Congress to put them in place. No one should expect a short or easy struggle. But maybe the only thing the parties can agree on is that the president should not be governing the country alone. If so, there’s a chance filibuster reform could be just the start.

So they had a bunch of pow-pows where they decided that, well, the problem wasn't in their, but in how theythose policies.

Or something silly like that.

But let's see how their marketing efforts are coming along. Remember, Republicans lost the woman vote 55-44 in 2012. And to make matters worse, women made up 53 percent of all voters, far outperforming their male counterparts. So if you've got a double-digit deficit against the largest single voting group, you should do something about it, right?

Well, protecting abusers and rapists wasn't the answer, but that's what the majority of the GOP caucus tried to do today when voting on the Violence Against Women Act.

As Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a rare Republican woman, said in a statement after the vote:



Democrats wanted a hammer to beat over the heads of Republicans and far too many misguided Republicans provided them with that hammer. This is exactly why hardworking Americans are fed up with Congress.

Actually, Democrats wanted a sensible and once-uncontroversial piece of legislation to pass. It was Republicans who took that hammer and beat themselves in the face with it.

Then there's brown Americans, many of whom continue fighting for the same access to the voting booth enjoyed by their whiter counterparts. Yet just months removed from an election in which non-white voters had to wait hours to vote, fight efforts to purge them from voter rolls, and fight efforts to require overly restrictive voter ID laws specifically designed to disenfranchise them, you had a conservative SUPREME COURT JUSTICE (Scalia) say that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires federal pre-clearance of changes in voting laws in parts of the country with a history of racial disenfranchisement, enables the



perpetuation of racial entitlement.

The old coot doesn't even bother hiding his bigotry. Yet despite howls of protest from the Left, there was only crickets from the Right (and the occasional defense here and there). Given the GOP's inability to win any meaningful level of support from African American, Latinos, and Asians, you'd think they'd begin trying to address those deficiencies. But nope. Not interested.

And so concludes another day in the GOP's ongoing campaign to rebrand itself, which looks no different from the version of the GOP already relegated to the fringe of mainstream American opinion.

Sarah Palin for taking TODAY show host Matt Lauer “to the cleaners” Monday by refusing to buy progressive media’s talking points about Americans losing insurance and Republicans needing to appeal more to moderates than their base to win elections.

Regarding the five percent of Americans that the White House conceded were losing their health insurance plans after President Barack Obama had promised that would not happen under Obamacare, Limbaugh said these were merely just the “first wave of cancellations,” and eventually Obamacare will impact “everybody,” because all of the plans will eventually not qualify “by design.”

“Where do you get this five percent?” Palin asked Lauer.

It’s not five percent. It’s most Americans will not be able to keep the healthcare policy and programs that they had desired. The new programs that are being forced down our throat are unaffordable. Some of them are still being told, “Well if you like that insurance policy and that coverage, you still will be able to keep it, it’s just going to cost you a little bit more.” That’s the point. If it’s going to cost you more, then it’s not the same policy.

Limbaugh praised Palin for her response and then said she took Lauer “to the cleaners” for also calling him out on the misguided “trick” the mainstream media always use on Republicans to get them to nominate candidates who will lose in the general election.

“Remember that old saw what the Democrat consultants always used to tell the Republicans and they would believe it?,” Limbaugh said. “The Republican Party gets tricked so easily. They get tricked into not criticizing Obama, they get tricked into not being for what they should be for, and they even get tricked into campaigning for only 20% of the vote.”

Limbaugh blasted consultants for turning candidates “into squishy, linguini-spined moderates, on the theory that’s how you get the independents.”

“So the Republicans have been tricked into shutting up, and every four years they’ve been tricked into campaigning for 20% of the voting public, the independents,” Limbaugh said. “They’re winning the independents and they’re losing elections. You know why? Because they are abandoning their base, and the assumption is the base is always gonna be with you, but the Tea Party is not the case.”

Limbaugh made the point that now that independents are abandoning Obama, the media are calling them “moderates.”

“The independents–and I know who you are, and you independents know who you are, and you were made to feel special by the media. You were portrayed as the really smart people,” Limbaugh said. “You weren’t ideologues. You decided things issue by issue. You had open minds, not closed minds. You weren’t bigots like the Tea Party. Oh, no, no, no! You independents, you were the cream of the crop–until you stopped voting for Democrats. Now you’re dirt. Now you’re scum.”

He praised Palin for her response to Lauer, whom he blasted for repeating mainstream media talking points that his producer gave him.

“When you stand in the middle of the road, you’re going to get hit on both sides of the road,” Palin said. “We need to take a stand, especially on this Obamacare, and support those who are just fulfilling their campaign promises. So many politicians ran for reelection and for election saying they would do anything in their power to de-fund the statist socialized medicine program called Obamacare.”"

The third Mrs. Edwards will, on the night of Oct. 27, become “The Governor’s Wife,” to the uncertain benefit of A&E viewers. Depending on the perspective, it could be just deserts for a felon, a painful come-down for a man who used to run a state, or simply another “laissez les bons temps rouler” chapter in the 86-year wild ride that is Edwards’ life.

“Unwatchable and unmissable,” John Maginnis, a longtime chronicler of Louisiana politics, cracked about the show, though he could have been talking about Edwards’ long political saga as well.

As karmic payback for Edwards’ real or imagined sins, it’s a doozy. The video preview shows Edwards in prison garb and, separately, being spoon-fed by his wife, Trina. Promotional materials say the show will chronicle Trina’s efforts to “rehabilitate her gold-digger reputation.... Trina is wildly in love with Edwin and constantly turns to him for advice on everything from raising her teenage sons to devising her next harebrained scheme.”

And then there are Edwards’ grown daughters, almost twice Trina’s age, one of whom, Victoria, is described as “a seen-it-all former performer who is never far from her electronic cigarette.”

Not that Edwards, who could not be reached for an interview, has ever shied from out-there behavior. He is a throwback to old Louisiana, replete with characters who eschewed the buttoned-down earnestness of the state’s current leaders.

“He brings back something missing in Louisiana politics: personality,” said Maginnis, noting that an appreciation of Edwards was now safe, inasmuch as his civic debt is paid and he’s not running for anything, so far as anyone knows.

Still, some Louisianans are leery about the upcoming show and its potential to perpetuate stereotypes about the state to a national audience, Maginnis said. “Fun to have around, but not something you want to show the neighbors,” as he put it.

For all the raucous and rakish behavior, there was always an astute political side to Edwards. Even as he tried to beat back near-constant accusations of scandal in terms that he won from the 1970s to the 1990s, he gained swarms of supporters for what he has termed his “serve the needy, not the greedy” political philosophy.

His tax policy, arrayed against oil and gas concerns, created a windfall for the state that helped finance generous social programs. He appointed blacks and women to positions in numbers never before seen in Louisiana, streamlined the government and oversaw the completion of the Superdome.

And he reveled in a reputation that, in his 1991 race for governor against former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, featured bumper stickers imploring Louisianans: “Vote for the crook -- it’s important.”

Almost two decades after he left the governor’s office, the debate that shadowed that campaign still filters through public conversations: is he a criminal to be disdained, or a public servant to be honored? Or both?

The Gambit, a New Orleans weekly, denounced Edwards in a recent column, citing the “embarrassing” specter of the upcoming TV show, with its video inclusion of Edwards holding a sign reading “I’m innocent.”

“Edwin Edwards is many things, but ‘innocent’ is not among them -- and Louisiana is not the same state that elected him four times,” the online column declared. “The wink-and-nod casual corruption that was once accepted as the price of doing business here has receded since Edwards’ day (though it hasn’t totally disappeared).”

Not so fast, countered a commenter.

“A crook, yes, but a crook that put the people first, not like the crooks there now that say the public be damned and you will get what we decide to let you have,” the commenter wrote. “Louisiana at one time had the best politicians money could buy, now we just have politicians that can be bought.”

It recalled an incident Maginnis cited in a 1991 Los Angeles Times story about the epic election battle that featured Edwards, Duke and the then-incumbent, Buddy Roemer.

As Maginnis told writer Richard E. Meyer, Edwards had brought 10,000 believers to their feet on the Fourth of July at a church tabernacle, and Maginnis wanted to know why.

Maginnis asked the Rev. Clarence Bates, who before preaching had served as a bodyguard for another less-than-virtuous governor, Earl Long: “How can any church intent on holiness and morality support a man like Edwin Edwards, who is known to gamble, chase women ... and constantly be under investigation for corruption?”

Bates looked at Maginnis.

“Well,” he said, “he doesn’t drink or smoke.”

But teens weren’t the only sources of inspiration from that day -- host Chelsea Clinton also had some words of wisdom to share with the young audience.

While you probably know her best as President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea has made a name for herself as a special correspondent for NBC News, as well as in her efforts to speak out about the uncomfortable topic of diarrhea, which is related to 100,000 deaths in Nigeria each year.

HuffPost Teen caught up with the impassioned former first daughter at TEDxTeen this past Saturday in New York. Here are five powerful pieces of advice for Generation Y we took from our conversation with her.

1. Ask yourself what you can do for others.

""When [my grandmother and parents] would ask me, 'Well, what did you do today?' part of what they implied was, 'Well, what did you do for others?' It would not have been okay at the dinner table if I just didn’t have something to say ... That was the kind of world I grew up in. And being asked those questions really often helped me to always think, 'Wow, I have a real responsibility to define my life partly through what I can do for others and what I can learn from others.' I’m grateful that they set that example.""

2. You should care about the world around you.

“I think [there] is a big misconception that people who are younger are more apathetic or more disinterested or more tuned out. That’s just not true. People are more connected, feel more empowered and feel a greater responsibility for their world than ever before. And we see that in so many different ways. I mean, a greater number and a greater percentage of people than ever before volunteer on a regular basis, and they actually keep volunteering once they’re in college ... young people [also] donate small dollar amounts when there are crises, like the Haiti earthquake. So I think all of this says that young people are far from apathetic, actually feel quite engaged, and thankfully, [feel] quite empowered.”

3. Do what you can.

“I think all the time, 'What can I be doing?' and then, 'What should I be doing?' ... Because if we feel like, 'Oh my gosh, we can do everything and we should do everything' -- that’s overwhelming and disempowering. So I think about the things where I can make a difference.""

4. If you have a great idea, speak up.

“Let your idea out of your head. Have the courage to share your idea, whether it’s with your teacher, a friend, online -- like an online community that is already concentrated around something that you really care about. See what the reaction is, see what the response is. Hopefully that will help surface different ideas to make your idea even stronger.”

5. ""Get caught trying.""

“The best advice that my mom gave me was repeating my grandmother’s mantra: Life’s about not what happens to you, it’s about what you do with what happens to you. It really is this kind of galvanizing message in my family. [Also] 'get caught trying,' which is something that has really motivated my father’s life. It’s always better to have tried and failed than to never have tried at all.”"

Washington (CNN) – The third episode of the History Channel's miniseries “The Bible” was supposed to be remembered for the brutality of Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar, the strength of Daniel in the lion’s den, and the birth of Jesus Christ.

But after viewers claimed there was a striking resemblance between Satan’s human form and President Barack Obama, that probably won't be the case.

Buzz on Twitter quickly grew. According to Topsy.com on Monday, there were an estimated 20,000 tweets containing the words “Obama” and “Satan” since the 9:00 p.m. ET hour on Sunday, the hour in which Satan appears in the two-hour show.

In a statement, miniseries producer Mark Burnett called claims there was a resemblance ""utter nonsense.""

Burnett said the actor who played Satan, Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, ""is a highly acclaimed Moroccan actor. He has previously played parts in several Biblical epics - including Satanic characters long before Barack Obama was elected as our President.""

Ouazanni has had roles in two biblical TV movies - ""Jeremiah"" and ""The Ten Commandments.""

Executive producer of the miniseries Roma Downey, Burnett's wife, added, ""Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our President, who is a fellow Christian. False statements such as these are just designed as a foolish distraction to try and discredit the beauty of the story of The Bible.""

Satan appears during the miniseries’ retelling of the Temptation of Christ, when Jesus fasted for 40 days in the Judean Desert. Satan tests Jesus’ faith, asking him to make bread out of stone and jump from a cliff, but he refuses each temptation and returns to the Sea of Galilee to begin his ministry.

In the desert, Satan is draped in a long, black, hooded robe and with a slight silver tint to his face.

Both Downey and Burnett supported Obama's first campaign for president in 2008, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Downey gave $5,000 to the Obama Victory Fund and $2,700 to the Democratic National Committee in 2008. Burnett also donated to Obama's first campaign - $2,300 in 2007.

Neither gave money to Obama's 2012 campaign.

While the show was airing, tweets poured in noting the resemblance.

After three episodes, the show has scored strong ratings. Its first episode drew 13.1 million viewers, ratings that trumped CBS’s “60 Minutes” and AMC’s “The Walking Dead.” The second episode drew 10.8 million viewers.

Ratings for the third installment in the five-week miniseries have not been released.

CNN’s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories

The project has been a three-and-a-half year process for The History Channel and for Burnett and Downey. Burnett - who is better known as a king of reality television, with “Survivor,” “The Voice” and “The Apprentice” all under his name - told CNN earlier this month that this project was “personal.”

“It was time for an updating, adding fresh visual life to a sacred text,” Burnett said.

Both Downey and Burnett were raised Catholic, Burnett in England and Downey in Ireland. They still regularly attend Mass in Los Angeles. Growing up, both watched the classic biblical films that the Hollywood of yesteryear churned out, like “The Ten Commandments” and “The Greatest Story Ever Told.”

To film their Bible series, the duo set off for the southern tip of Morocco with a crew of around 400 people.

CNN Belief: Reality TV Goliath takes up Bible miniseries challenge, hopes for better outcome

Burnett and Downey consulted a wide range of pastors and academics, including a major evangelical leader and a Catholic cardinal.

Their advisory panel consisted of many people from varied backgrounds familiar with sharing the stories of the Bible, rather than a who’s who of biblical academics.

Joel Osteen, a popular television preacher and pastor of the 30,000-member Lakewood church in Houston, was among those consulted. Osteen and Burnett are friends and were developing a television series together that went on the back burner during the production of this series. Osteen even took his family to Morocco during some of the filming.

While the History Channel owns the exclusive North American rights to the project, Burnett and Downey own the rights to global distribution and theatrical airings, which are in the works. The project also has a book tie-in, games and apps.

Rucker Also Is Co-Author Of', 'A Very Stable Genius', 'A No. New York Times Bestseller']",Obama grants pardons to 17 people for nonviolent offenses,"President Obama pardoned 17 people for nonviolent offenses Friday, a rare move that nearly doubled the number of pardons he has granted since taking office just over four years ago.

The individuals came from 13 states and were sentenced years if not decades ago for such minor federal offenses as falsely altering a U.S. money order, possessing an unregistered firearm, embezzling bank funds and acquiring food stamps without authorization.

Among those pardoned was a Massachusetts fishing magnate who pleaded guilty more than 20 years ago to laundering Canadian fish and selling them to the Defense Department as American fish.

Two Washington area residents were on the pardons list released Friday. Jamari Salleh of Alexandria, a former foreign service officer, had been sentenced for submitting phony lodging vouchers to the State Department. Robert Leroy Bebee of Rockville is an accomplished biotechnology inventor whose offense was concealing information about a felony.

The pardons, the first of Obama’s second term, are significant because this president so infrequently grants clemency.

Before Friday, Obama had granted 22 pardons; he had received petitions from 1,333 individuals, according to the data maintained by the Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney. He granted his first batch of pardons, totaling nine, in December 2010, and granted eight in May 2011 and five in November 2011.

By contrast, former president George W. Bush received 2,498 petitions and granted 189 pardons, while former president Bill Clinton received 2,001 petitions and granted 396 pardons, according to the data.

Dafna Linzer of ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news organization, reported last year that Obama has granted clemency at a lower rate than any modern president. Among the hundreds of people who have been denied pardons by Obama, Linzer reported, are a former brothel manager who helped the FBI bust a national prostitution ring and a retired sheriff who inadvertently helped a money launderer buy land.

Obama has come under criticism for not using more frequently his constitutional powers to pardon people for federal crimes. Some academics argue that the president could have more impact by pardoning younger people with more recent crimes.

“He’s not only being extremely stingy, but he’s giving pardons to people who arguably need them the very least,” said P.S. Ruckman Jr., a political scientist at Rock Valley College in Illinois who blogs about presidential pardons. “The people who need pardons are people in their 30s and 40s and 50s who are trying to get jobs and raise families.”

Jeffrey Crouch, a political science professor at American University, said the pardons announced Friday mirror those Obama granted in his first term.

“The president’s pattern has been pretty much to go for the safe route — look for older offenses, nonviolent offenses — and using the pardon power in some cases just enough to not be criticized for not using it at all,” said Crouch, author of “The Presidential Pardon Power.”

The White House on Friday offered no information about why Obama selected these 17 individuals for pardons other than that he believes they will lead productive lives.

“As he has in past years, the president granted these individuals clemency because they have demonstrated genuine remorse and a strong commitment to being law-abiding, productive citizens and active members of their communities,” White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said.

Among those pardoned was James A. Bordinaro, a former general manager of Empire Fish, who served 12 months in prison and paid a $55,000 fine for a scheme to illegally launder Canadian fish.

Bordinaro, of Gloucester, Mass., was among a half dozen New England fishing industry executives who pleaded guilty to such scams, according to a 1991 report by the Boston Globe. They were charged with falsifying documents in their contracts with the Department of Defense certifying that Canadian fish were caught by U.S. fishermen in U.S. waters, a requirement of government contracts, according to the Globe.

Last year, members of the Bordinaro family introduced Republican congressional candidate Richard Tisei at a fishing-themed campaign event at the docks in downtown Gloucester.

In Alexandria, meanwhile, Salleh’s federal conviction dates to 1989. Salleh was a career foreign service officer who was caught, and pleaded guilty to, submitting $7,650 in phony lodging vouchers to the State Department. She was given a three-year suspended sentence, placed on four years of probation, fined $5,000 and ordered to pay $5,900 restitution.

The State Department then tried to fire her. Salleh appealed to the Foreign Service Grievance Board, saying that her offense stemmed from her alcoholism, and she was reinstated, court records show. The State Department then turned to the federal courts to reverse the grievance board, but two courts upheld the board and Salleh continued to work for State for many years. Other people granted clemency faced similarly modest sentences. Alfor Sharkey, of Omaha, was sentenced for unauthorized acquisition of food stamps. Sharkey was given three years of probation with 100 hours of community service and $2,570 restitution.

They have two demands. The first is that investment bankers stop profiteering from the sale of public property assigned to the Postal Service. And the second demand is that Congress stop bleeding the Postal Service dry.

Led by Citizens to Save the Berkeley Post Office, community members will assemble at 11:30 a.m. for a rally at 909 Montgomery in front of the offices of Blum Capital Partners. Blum Capital is a private equity firm founded in 1976 by Richard Blum, a current regent of the University of California. Commercial real estate giant Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis (CBRE) is among the many investments of Blum Capital. In fact the Chairman of CBRE is Richard Blum.

""The hand of Richard Blum"" Graphic by Sances & Hazelwood

The Postal Service is eager to sell properties in their control to raise quick cash. CBRE advises the USPS on what properties to sell. The properties are advertised on a joint CBRE/ USPS website and as a general rule CBRE profits again as the listing agent.

After the rally in front of Blum Capital, the marchers intend to proceed down Montgomery Street to One Post Street, the office of California Senator Dianne Feinstein. Senator Feinstein's husband is Richard Blum.

Newspaper headlines read ""The Post Office is Going Broke"". Truth: The Postal Service is being bled dry by a law passed in the 2006 lame duck session of Congress.

Senator Feinstein must take a lead in changing the 2006 law.

The USPS is managed by an independent Board of Governors of 11 members. Nine are appointed by the President, no more than five from one political party. There are three vacancies on the Board. Of the six presidential appointments, only one was appointed by President Barack Obama. The term of office of Dennis Toner, Obama's sole appointee, expires December 8, 2012.

Elections must have consequences. Surely the President should be able to make appointments to the USPS Board of Governors and just as surely Senator Dianne Feinstein must reconsider her qualms on filibuster reform. We are entitled in this democracy to have judges, agency administrators and Postal Service governors appointed by the President that we elected in 2008 and re-elected this November.

CIA whistleblower Kiriakou gets posh send-off to prison

By David Montgomery,

John Kiriakou stood in the ninth-floor banquet hall of the Hay-Adams hotel Thursday night and took in the spectacular view of the White House and the Washington Monument. He recalled briefing two presidents during his career with the CIA. “It’s ironic,” he said, spreading his arms as if to embrace the tableau. “This really is the reason I came to Washington 30 years ago in the first place.”

But next Thursday he will check into the Federal Correctional Institution in Loretto, Pa., to begin a 30-month sentence for divulging information that prosecutors said could harm his country.

Kiriakou, 48, seemed unbowed and almost content at the prospect of prison as he basked in the well wishes of about 100 supporters, who gathered for a posh send-off at the luxury hotel. The guests wore orange jumpsuits and other mock prison garb and serenaded Kiriakou with a reworked version of the protest anthem “Have You Been to Jail for Justice?”

“I’m proud of my career,” said Kiriakou, who lives in Arlington County. “I still love the CIA — crazy as that may sound. . . . I wear my conviction as a badge of honor.”

Kiriakou, who left the CIA in 2004, stepped into the limelight a few years later to confirm and describe in detail the harsh interrogation tactics, including waterboarding, that he said agency operatives employed. He was charged with several counts related to sharing sensitive information with reporters and pleaded guilty to a single count of disclosing a covert operative’s name. He was sentenced last month.

“My case was about torture,” he said. “The CIA never forgave me for exposing the torture program and saying it was U.S. government policy.”

The $20,000 farewell bash — open bar for two hours — was underwritten by Oakland, Calif.-based activist and heiress Naomi Pitcairn and co-hosted by Code Pink, the theatrical peace group.

“I don’t think any of my Republican ancestors would have stood for torture,” said Pitcairn, whose great-grandfather co-founded Pittsburgh Plate Glass in 1883. “Civilized people do not behave that way, and so we are honoring him for his civilized behavior in a very civilized location.”

The guests included left-wing luminaries, whistleblowers and protesters — from Dennis Roberts, one of the attorneys for the Chicago Eight, to retired Air Force Col. Morris “Moe” Davis, the former chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay, who resigned in 2007 because, as he said at the party, “I objected to the use of evidence obtained by torture.”

Kiriakou’s wife, Heather, resigned her own position as a senior CIA analyst last year under pressure from superiors, The Washington Post reported.

The couple have five children, ranging from 16 months to 19 years old. Kiriakou said that his children are worried about his looming absence but that the older ones understand and support him. He said he expects to be released with good behavior to a halfway house in less than 20 months. He said the prison will allow him to stay in regular e-mail and phone contact with his family.

“Even though it’s prison and we’ll be separated, it’s doable,” he said. “After 15 years in the CIA” — including as a case officer in the Middle East and South Asia — “I’ve lived in worse places than Loretto.”

Before the duo Emma’s Revolution took the stage Thursday to sing its danceable political folk music, Kiriakou clapped along to the Code Pink version of “Have You Been to Jail for Justice?”

Do you know John Kiriakou?

Well, he’s a friend of mine.

Blew the whistle on the CIA

And now he’s doin’ time."

Both chambers of Congress are on recess, and many of their members are far from Washington. But the distance did not stop some of them from responding to President Obama’s statement on Saturday afternoon that he would seek Congressional authorization before launching a military strike in response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons. Many representatives and senators took to Twitter with their reactions.

Some lawmakers expressed gratitude for the president’s announcement that he would wait for them to debate and vote on a strike, including Representatives Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, and Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York.

Good decision by the President! He will seek our approval!! Thank you! — Billy Long (@auctnr1) 31 Aug 13

I applaud President Obama’s decision to request authorization from Congress prior to the use of force in Syria. — Yvette D. Clarke (@YvetteClarke) 31 Aug 13

Others offered more measured words for the president, reflecting controversies over the extent of the executive branch’s powers. Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, who has taken a leading role in debates over government surveillance, summed up his gratitude this way:

It’s unfortunate that it’s gotten to the point where I have to thank the President for following the Constitution & the law. — Justin Amash (@repjustinamash) 31 Aug 13

And at least one congressman, Representative Randy Weber, a Republican who filled Ron Paul’s seat in Texas, used Twitter to solicit opinions on the president’s statement:

The President is calling for Congressional action on #Syria. Tell me what you think… — Randy Weber (@TXRandy14) 31 Aug 13

One question that remained unresolved was when Congress would debate and vote. With Congress out of session until Sept. 9, several lawmakers expressed their willingness to return early:

I’ve been urging Speaker to call us back into session — it is essential that we be called back into session immediately. #Syria — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) 31 Aug 13

Stand ready to debate and vote on military action even before sept 9 or 10. Will need more evidence of threat to U.S. Security. — Rep. Lee Terry (@LEETERRYNE) 31 Aug 13

President Obama has responded to congressional critics and is seeking legislative authorization on Syria. Congress must come back — Gerry Connolly (@GerryConnolly) 31 Aug 13

Whether the House and Senate leaders take them up on their offers remains to be seen. Either way, Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, warned, President Obama would face a difficult debate:"

Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, on Monday sent blistering letters to the network bosses, calling their decision to air Clinton projects just as the 2016 White House campaign is heating up “disturbing and disappointing.” And if the shows go forward, the GOP will cut CNN and NBC out of Republican debates during primary season leading up to the election.

NBC last week announced a miniseries called “Hillary” with Diane Lane playing the former first lady and secretary of state. CNN is planning a documentary about Hillary Clinton’s life.

“Out of a sense of fairness and decency and in the interest of the political process and your company’s reputation, I call on you to cancel this political ad masquerading as an unbiased production,” Priebus wrote NBC Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt. (You can read the letters in their entirety here.)

A NBC spokesman said the network had no comment.

But CNN, which plans to run the Clinton documentary in 2014 following a theatrical run, issued a statement bashing the RNC.

“This documentary will be a non-fiction look at the life of a former First Lady and Secretary of State,” the statement said. “Instead of making premature decisions about a project that is in the very early stages of development and months from completion, we would encourage the members of the Republican National Committee to reserve judgment until they know more.

“Should they decide not to participate in debates on CNN,” the statement added, “we would find it curious, as limiting their debate participation seems to be the ultimate disservice to voters.”

Both networks have a long history of run-ins with the GOP. Conservatives frequently derided CNN as the “Clinton News Network” during the 1990s, when it was run by Rick Kaplan, a close friend of President Clinton and his wife, both Democratic leaders. Many Republicans have also felt that NBC News has been tainted by longstanding liberal bias and its association with sister network MSNBC, now a bastion of left-wing opinion during prime time.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)

Republicans, wounded and eager to show they have not been stripped of all power, are far more likely to unify against the Democrats who humiliated them in such dramatic fashion.

take her ball and go home

The channels Senate Republicans to let us know: Thursday's use of the nuclear option ""could usher in an era of rank partisan warfare beyond even what Americans have seen in the past five years."" In translation, now that Republicans can't obstruct quite as much in one of their favored ways, they're going to find new ways to harm the function of the nation's government.These are people who were arguing there should be fewer judges on the nation's second most important court simply to prevent President Barack Obama from filling vacancies. Frankly, there's not that much more they can unify against Democrats. Oh, sure, occasionally a few Republicans helped break the filibuster on legislation and now they might refuse to do the part of their jobs that involves passing laws—Sen. Susan Collins is making noises about how the nasty partisanship involved in preventing Republicans from keeping the judiciary desperately understaffed might cause her tojoin in filibusters of things like the Violence Against Women Act.

That's the story: Republicans are committed to obstruction and to destruction of the government's function. One tool of obstruction has been taken from them, so they're going to wield the others with more fury—possibly even in cases where they think legislation like VAWA is necessary. But that's not about Democrats somehow ushering in a new age of partisanship. It's about Democrats forcing Republicans to shift tactics in the age of Republican extremism we're already living through."

But to turn public opinion in his favor, Obama’s goons trucked in barricades to keep out World War II vets and other visitors. By one estimate, the barricades and workers cost $100,000.

The same punish-the-people attitude led to shutdowns of other parks and historic sites that get no federal funding.

“We’ve been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. It’s disgusting,” a Park Service ranger told The Washington Times.

The ranger cited the order to close the parking lot at George Washington’s home in Mount Vernon so visitors couldn’t use it. The cheap trick captured the contrast between a revered president and the current one.

I’ve been saying for a while that there is no bottom to Obama. He’s not just ruthless. He’s without scruples and honor.

However the shutdown ends, it will bring only a temporary respite from the crisis atmosphere in Washington. When it comes to his countrymen, Obama always chooses conflict over cooperation.

Meanwhile, Jimmy Carter can rest easy. We have a new worst president.

She explained that the mayor was busy campaigning for a third term, making travel to Bermuda next to impossible (and undoubtedly impolitic). “She said he would be back,” said the manager, Antonino Amato.

The mayor’s aides say he can get back quickly if needed — the flight between New York and Bermuda takes about two hours — but there have been some notable absences.

In February, a City Hall aide was struck by a car early one Sunday morning and fell into a coma, ordinarily an emergency that would prompt a mayoral visit. The mayor spoke to the aide’s grieving family by telephone while aides rushed to the hospital. Mr. Bloomberg eventually met with the family late Sunday afternoon, after returning to New York.

Two weekends ago, Mr. Bloomberg skipped the annual Greek Independence Day Parade on Fifth Avenue, leaving some spectators miffed. He has attended the parade for the past two years, and was grand marshal in 2006. During the mayoral campaign last fall, he often boasted of his connections to Greek New Yorkers, even printing up thousands of signs that declared, “Greeks for Mike Bloomberg.”"

They walk into Alice's Tea Cup holding hands before settling in for afternoon libations. Washington is appearing in the Broadway play Race while promoting her drama Mother and Child, in theaters.

Washington's real-life mother, Valerie, a retired education professor and schoolteacher, inspired her performance, but in an unexpected way. ""Their relationship is really different from ours.

USA TODAY

The Duck Dynasty family issued a statement Thursday evening supporting patriarch Phil Robertson and throwing the future of their successful hit reality show into jeopardy.

The A&E cable channel has put patriarch Phil Robertson, 67, on ""indefinite"" hiatus from filming after anti-gay remarks he made in the January issue of GQ erupted into debate about free speech.

Now the clan is thanking fans for their support, but isn't happy about the cable channel's decision.

""The family has spent much time in prayer since learning of A&E's decision. We want you to know that first and foremost we are a family rooted in our faith in God and our belief that the Bible is His word. While some of Phil's unfiltered comments to the reporter were coarse, his beliefs are grounded in the teachings of the Bible,"" the statement says.

""Phil is a Godly man who follows what the Bible says are the greatest commandments: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart' and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' Phil would never incite or encourage hate. We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for expressing his faith, which is his constitutionally protected right.""

And finally, the family says, ""We have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm. We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of Duck Dynasty. Again, thank you for your continued support of our family.""

Season 5 of the series is set to debut Jan. 15. Filming has finished and Robertson is featured in the 10 episodes. The Season 4 debut, which pulled in 11.8 million viewers in August, set a record for the cable channel."

ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) — A federal judge on Friday cleared the way for horse slaughterhouses to resume operating in the U.S. as early as next week.

U.S. District Judge Christina Armijo in Albuquerque threw out a lawsuit by The Humane Society of the United States and other animal protection groups that alleged the Department of Agriculture failed to conduct proper environmental studies when it issued permits to Valley Meat Co. in Roswell, New Mexico, and an Iowa company to slaughter horses for human consumption.

The decision ends, for now, a two-year battle by Valley Meat to open the slaughterhouse.

The issue of horse slaughter has divided horse rescue and animal welfare groups, ranchers, politicians and Indian tribes about what is the most humane way to deal with the country's horse overpopulation and what rescue groups have said are a rising number of neglected and starving horses as the West deals with persistent drought.

The plants would become the first horse slaughterhouse to operate in the U.S. since Congress banned the practice by eliminating funding for inspections at the plants in 2006. It restored that funding in 2011, but the Department of Agriculture did not approve the first permits for horse slaughter plants until this summer.

The companies want to ship horse meat to countries where it is consumed by humans or used as animal feed.

The Iowa company converted to cattle because of the court fight. But attorneys say Valley and Rains Natural Meats of Gallatin, Missouri, are poised to open as early as Monday.

A temporary order blocking a return to domestic equine slaughter had expired Thursday night. Attorneys for the groups that sued the Agriculture Department over its permitting procedures then filed a motion Friday seeking an extension of the restraining order.

Blair Dunn, who represents Valley Meat and Rains Natural Meats, said he would fight any further attempts to keep the plants closed. He said he had calls into the Department of Justice, which represents the Department of Agriculture, to get inspectors dispatched to the plants.

""Rains Natural Meat in Missouri will be ready to go on Monday,"" he said."

The lawmakers are expected to ask former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman why he didn't tell Congress that agents had been singling out conservative political groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status -- even after he was briefed on the matter.

Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, left the IRS in November when his five-year term ended. He is testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, which has launched a bipartisan investigation into the matter.

The hearing comes after White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the president’s counsel was told on April 24 about the preliminary findings of an IRS audit that showed tax officials unfairly targeted Tea Party groups applying for tax-exempt status.

Carney had previously said that White House counsel did not have any details about the IRS probe and was given a generic heads up that one was being conducted.

More On This...

Senior legal counsel Kathryn Ruemmler was told about the audit on April 24, Carney said Monday. She then told Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff and other senior officials about the investigation.

“It was the judgment of counsel this is not a matter she should convey to the president,” Carney said. “Her opinion that this is not the kind of thing that requires notification to the president.”

“No one in this building intervened in an independent investigation or anything that could be seen that way,” he said, adding that the misconduct had stopped in 2012, “almost a year before we knew about it.”

Carney also said while Ruemmler knew the subject of the investigation and potential findings, they were not given a draft of the report and understood details could change.

Ahead of the hearing, the committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican, sent a letter to the IRS Monday, asking for an explanation. The letter included 41 separate requests for information. They gave the IRS until May 31 to respond.

The two senators said the IRS had not been forthcoming about the issue in the past.

""Targeting applicants for tax-exempt status using political labels threatens to undermine the public's trust in the IRS,"" Baucus and Hatch wrote. ""Lack of candor in advising the Senate of this practice is equally troubling.""

For more than a year, from 2011 through the 2012 election, members of Congress repeatedly asked Shulman about complaints from tea party groups that they were being harassed by the IRS.

Shulman's responses, usually relayed by a deputy, did not acknowledge that agents had ever targeted tea party groups for special scrutiny. At a congressional hearing March 22, 2012, Shulman was adamant in his denials.

""There's absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens to people"" who apply for tax-exempt status, Shulman said at the House Ways and Means subcommittee hearing.

The IRS has said Shulman did not know about the targeting at the time of the hearing.

The agency's inspector general says he told Shulman on May 30, 2012, that his office was auditing the way applications for tax-exempt status were being handled, in part because of complaints from conservative groups. However, the inspector general, J. Russell George, said he did not reveal the results of his investigation.

George was also testifying at Tuesday's hearing. So was Steven Miller, who took over as acting commissioner in November, when Shulman's term expired. Last week, Obama forced Miller to resign.

George issued a report last week blaming ineffective management for allowing agents to inappropriately target conservative groups for more than 18 months during the 2010 and 2012 elections.

The agents were trying to determine whether the groups were engaged in political activity. Certain tax-exempt groups are allowed to engage in politics, but politics cannot be their primary mission. It is up to the IRS to make the determination, so agents are supposed to look for clues when reviewing applications for tax-exempt status.

In March 2010, agents starting singling out groups with ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriots"" on their applications. By August 2010, it was part of the written criteria for identifying groups that required more scrutiny, according to George's report.

Agents did not flag similar progressive or liberal labels, though some liberal groups received additional scrutiny because their applications were singled out for other reasons, the report said.

Mike Miles, who the Dallas Independent School District hired from Colorado Springs a year ago to help reform the big-city district, may have ended the teaching career of Cristy Nicole Deweese almost before it began. The 21-year-old beauty was about a month into the school year when word got out that she had been featured as a “Coed of the Month” in the men’s mag three years ago. But just a few weeks ago, Miles barely saved his own skin from the very fate he meted out to Deweese.

[pullquote]

Trustees voted 5-3 against a proposal to fire Miles after a report by a former U.S. Attorney found he violated district policy and his contract by ""contacting witnesses"" in the internal investigation and by ""discussing case facts"" with potential witnesses. The case grew out of allegations Miles interfered with a contract the district sought for parent education services. He was cleared on the initial allegations but accused of violating district policy by talking to witnesses and attempting to publicly disparage board members.

""It may not rise to the level … of a fireable offense, but what it does do is give us very grave concerns about whether we have trust-based leadership, and whether we as a district should place trust in that leader when that leader has violated that trust,"" Trustee Elizabeth Jones told WFAA-TV after the vote.

The board voted 7-0 to give Miles a written reprimand and to amend his contract to bar him from disparaging the school board, bullying, abusive behavior and the release of confidential information.

The teachers union wanted Miles fired, but didn’t take a position on Deweese. That’s because Texas is a right to work state, and Deweese opted not to join up.

“The union was not able to represent her, because she was not a member,” George Rangel, executive vice president of Alliance AFT, told FoxNews.com.

Miles decision to fire Deweese has generated controversy, from both parents who don’t want their young boys’ minds wandering in class at Townview Magnet High School, as well as sympathizers who say a photo shoot that took place when Deweese was just 18 should not haunt her. Deweese plans to put the classroom in her rear-view mirror and pursue a career in modeling."

He has attended the parade for the past two years, and was grand marshal in 2006. During the mayoral campaign last fall, he often boasted of his connections to Greek New Yorkers, even printing up thousands of signs that declared, “Greeks for Mike Bloomberg.”"

They all make me sick. Even the handful of people that I know personally who are a part of it, they make me sick too. I'm talking about all of them: Congressional staff, media people, lawyers, lobbyists, administration officials, campaign consultants, think tank scholars, bureaucrats...all of them. They're all horrible, disgusting people. I actually like Wall Street people, with whom I also familiar, more than I like Beltway people. At least with Wall Streeters the motivations are clear. Spend some time around both groups and you'll agree.

But when I read this piece by quintessential beltway insiders Mike Allen and Jim Vandehei attempt at self-reporting, the level bile building up in my throat couldn't be kept down by my morning coffee. Just listen to them:



Talk about incestuous: A top Obama official cashes in with a top corporation with the help of a top Washington fixer and gets top-shelf treatment from one of Washington’s top journalists (who also happens to be the co-byline on this piece.)

Haddad may regret it, too. Leibovich asked a lot of questions about how the former TV producer courts the powerful. He focused on Haddad’s relentless promotion and fundraising for CURE (Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy), founded by Susan Axelrod, the wife of David Axelrod. Leibovich portrays this as a blatant effort to curry favor – a bald execution of the theory that you build connections to the powerful by finding out what interests the people around them. David Axelrod is distressed by the expected portrayal and told us: “Tammy has been a great friend to Susan and me, and I think very sincere about it. She has never asked me for anything in return.” Haddad did not give Leibovich a formal interview but the two recently had a clear-the-air lunch at The Jefferson hotel. Leibovich seemed suspicious of Haddad’s presence on Air Force One when Jon Meacham of Newsweek, then one of her clients, had an interview with President Obama. But Haddad has told friends it’s perfectly normal to accompany clients to interviews she has helped arrange. She declined to comment. For what it’s worth, Haddad is a friend who has thrown parties for us. Come to think of it, she has thrown parties for virtually every other person and cause we know.

Yes, its so awful you want to throw your tablet at some ""strategist"" right? Well hold on to it because it gets much, much worse:This doesn't deserve analysis. This deserves nothing but the purest forms of hateful insults.

These people are the problem in our nations Capitol. Washington has come to be dominated by an elite class of tightly connected social-climbing nihilists. They promote inertia, because inertia is their gravy train. Their kids go to the right private schools, their salaries paid by an ever growing list of people who move effortlessly between government, the press, and corporate employment justified by their expensive connections made in college, thanks to their parents...who are also people just like them.

If you decide you want to be civic minded and run for office, you too will run into these people. They'll be sent to you by a party campaign committee. Then, if you can get successfully trained by handlers (same people) to say the right things, they'll use their connections to get you interviews with the media, who are also the same people. Then you can spend many hours of your day calling donors, who also have staffs of people who know your people. Then you'll use the money you raise to pay other people, who are also friends of theirs, to run your campaign. And if you win, those people will introduce you to other people who will run your office. And those people will make sure you meet other people so that you get the right assignments, so that those can people can then tell other people that they have influence over you. Because they do. And if you do this for two or three terms in office, you'll cycle through a bunch of people like these whom you will see far more than any of your constituents. Then one day, you'll look up at a committee hearing, reading a statement prepared by your people, telling you what to say and how to vote. And you will have totally forgotten why you decided to come there in the first place, having accomplished little to nothing, while watching all your people get rich in the process. And then you will retire and decide its time to get yours. You will become your people.

This is why all of them make me want to vomit.

Pat Quinn, who mentioned Pendleton during his annual State of the State speech on Wednesday as he called for tougher gun control measures. Quinn said he spoke to the teen's family this week.



""There are no words in the English language, or any language, to relieve the pain of parents who lose a child,"" said Quinn, who has two adult sons.



A White House source said senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Education Secretary Arne Duncan also will attend the funeral. Both are Chicagoans.



Community activists had urged the Obamas to come to Chicago to speak out about recent violence. A petition on the White House website had called on the Obamas to attend Pendleton's funeral.



The president reached out to the family last week to offer his condolences, according to people close to the family. Early on, the family had expressed concern that the president's attendance would overshadow the funeral and make it difficult for Pendleton's many friends to say their goodbyes to her.



After learning today that the first lady planned to attend, Shatira Wilks, a cousin who serves as the family's spokesperson, said they are still committed to making the funeral a celebration of the teen's life.



""It's a nice gesture and we appreciate it,"" Wilks said. ""But that is who we are.""



Those close to the family said the parents are still trying to come to grips with what has happened.



""It's a lot to take in. It's an overwhelming experience,"" said LaKeisha Stewart, Hadiya's godmother. ""We are very thankful the people are coming to support the family. We realize that this young lady has touched a lot of people and this goes beyond us.""



Pendleton was killed at Harsh Park on Jan. 29, near the end of the deadliest January for Chicago homicides in a decade. There is a $40,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest in the teen's death."

Canadian-born U.S. Sen. Ted ""Calgary"" Cruz (R-TX) hasn't served a single day of his life in the United States armed services, but over the weekend that didn't stop him from accusing decorated Vietnam veterans and Obama cabinet nominees John Kerry and Chuck Hagel of being against our nation's military:The fact that a chickenhawk like Calgary Cruz would accuse actual war heroes like Kerry and Hagel of being against America is crazy enough on its own, but the substantive argument he was trying to make was just as absurd. Cruz wasn't merely trying to impugn their patriotism, he was also trying to make the case for more military spending.

According to Cruz, what America needs now is to build up American military power just like we did during the Cold War. In Cruz's view, failing to do so would project weakness to whomever it is that we are fighting. Therefore, the fact that neither Kerry nor Hagel believe it is in America's interests to continue feeding fiscal steroids to our military industry means that they must hate America and want our enemy (or is it enemies?) to win.

Obviously, Cruz's thinking isn't alone in the GOP. It's about as common as a Republican foreign policy adviser slipping up and referring to the Soviet Union or Czechoslovakia, which is to say it's pretty damn common. It might be a theory worth debating if our ""enemy"" were the Soviet Union, but whatever our enemy is, it's not the USSR or anything like it.

Nonetheless, Republicans continue to insist on the sort of outdated thinking that leads their leading politicians to say offensive things like Cruz did over the weekend and stupid things like Paul Ryan did in the vice presidential debate when he claimed the sequester's defense cuts encouraged the attack in Benghazi.

There is one good thing to come out of it, though: It's nice to see that yet another guy elected by the tea party is complaining about the spending cuts that they forced into law.

Sometimes I long for the wit of a Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert. They treat this town as burlesque, and with satire and parody show it the disrespect it deserves. We laugh, and punch each other on the arm, and tweet that the rascals got their just dessert. Still, the last laugh always seems to go to the boldface names that populate this town. To them belong the spoils of a looted city. They get the tax breaks, the loopholes, the contracts, the payoffs.

They fix the system so multimillionaire hedge fund managers and private equity tycoons pay less of a tax rate on their income than school teachers, police and fire fighters, secretaries and janitors. They give subsidies to rich corporate farms and cut food stamps for working people facing hunger. They remove oversight of the wall street casinos, bail out the bankers who torpedo the economy, fight the modest reforms of Dodd-Frank, prolong tax havens for multinationals, and stick it to consumers while rewarding corporations.

We pay. We pay at the grocery store. We pay at the gas pump. We pay the taxes they write off. Our low-wage workers pay with sweat and deprivation because this town – aloof, self-obsessed, bought off and doing very well, thank you – feels no pain.

The journalists who could tell us these things rarely do – and some, never. They aren’t blind, simply bedazzled. Watch the evening news – any evening news – or the Sunday talk shows. Listen to the chit-chat of the early risers on morning TV -- and ask yourself if you are learning anything about how this town actually works.

William Greider, one of our craft’s finest reporters, fierce and unbought, despite a long life in Washington once said that no one can hope to understand what is driving political behavior without asking the kind of gut-level questions politicians ask themselves in private: “Who are the winners in this matter and who are the losers? Who gets the money and who has to pay? Who must be heard on this question and who can be safely ignored?”

Perhaps they don’t ask these questions because they fear banishment from the parties and perks, from the access that passes as seduction in this town.

Or perhaps they do not tell us these things because they fear that if the system were exposed for what it is, outraged citizens would descend on this town, and tear it apart with their bare hands."

Opponents Plan Attack on Immigration Bill,"WASHINGTON — Republican opponents of legislation to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws are readying an offensive intended to hijack the newly released bill as the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday begins a review that will offer the clearest sign yet of how difficult a path the legislation faces.

With the committee expected to spend at least three weeks on the legislation, Republican critics could offer hundreds of amendments to try to reshape the overhaul. They include proposals that could lengthen the timeline for a pathway to citizenship and that could tamper with an already fragile deal negotiated between business and labor groups for a guest worker program. Anticipating an onslaught, Democrats are preparing a robust defense in an effort to keep the legislation largely intact.

For the bipartisan group of eight senators who drafted the legislation and now hope to shepherd it through committee and onto the floor, each amendment is a potential hurdle.

“They’ll be looking to throw obstacles in the way of the process and propose poison pills in order to frame the debate for the far right,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigration group, referring to some of the potential Republican amendments. “What they’re really doing is playing towards conservatives, trying to make Marco Rubio and other Republicans uncomfortable, and mobilizing grass-roots opposition.”"

The Obama administration said Thursday that it would not challenge laws legalizing marijuana in Colorado and Washington state as long as those states maintain strict rules involving the sale and distribution of the drug.

In a memo to U.S. attorneys in all 50 states, Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole said the Justice Department is “committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way.” He stressed that marijuana remains illegal under federal law.

The memo, which was welcomed by proponents of marijuana legalization, directs federal prosecutors to focus on eight areas of enforcement rather than spending time targeting individual users. Those aims include preventing distribution of marijuana to minors, stopping the growing of marijuana on public land, keeping pot from falling into the hands of cartels and gangs, and preventing the diversion of marijuana to states where it remains illegal.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. called the governors of Colorado and Washington about noon Thursday to inform them of the decision. A Justice official said Holder told them that federal prosecutors would be watching closely as the two states finalize a regulatory framework for marijuana and that prosecutors would be taking a “trust but verify” approach.

Last fall, Washington and Colorado approved initiatives to legalize the possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, becoming the first states to approve the drug for recreational use. Twenty states and the District have passed laws legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes.

Until Thursday, the administration had remained silent about the initiatives in Colorado and Washington, despite requests for guidance from state officials.

“We recognize how difficult this issue has been for the Department of Justice and we appreciate the thoughtful approach it has taken,” Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), who opposed efforts to legalize marijuana last year, said in a statement. “Amendment 64 put Colorado in conflict with federal law. Today’s announcement shows the federal government is respecting the will of Colorado voters.”

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), in a statement with state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, said the guidance “reflects a balanced approach by the federal government that respects the states’ interests in implementing these laws and recognizes the federal government’s role in fighting illegal drugs and criminal activity.”

Proponents of marijuana legalization welcomed the new administration guidance.

“This is a very significant step forward,” said Christian Sederberg, a Denver lawyer who helped draft Amendment 64. “The simple truth is that a tightly regulated marijuana market is superior to the criminal market. ­State-regulated business will now be able to continue creating good jobs and generating tax revenue. This is what progress looks like.”

Sederberg said state lawmakers and a government-backed task force in Colorado have tried to deal with the concerns of federal officials — such as keeping pot out of the hands of minors — while setting up the regulatory framework for a marijuana market.

Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor and a member of the governor’s task force that helped devise Colorado’s forthcoming marijuana regulations, said Thursday’s memo represents a “big change of direction for the federal government” but one that was overdue.

“Marijuana exists in this strange place where a number of states permit it but the federal government prohibits it. For a long time, it’s been pretty untenable,” Kamin said. “For the first time . . . they’re saying that if you can do a good job with it, we will not come in with the hammer of federal enforcement.”

But he said questions remain.

The guidance steers clear of whether major banks — which have been wary of giving credit to marijuana-related businesses — can now do so without fear of legal consequences. Because marijuana remains illegal under federal law, it also means individuals still risk losing their jobs, apartments, even custody of children if they are found using a drug that is legal on the state level.

Perhaps most significant, Kamin noted, Thursday’s action represents the views of one administration — and the next one might see things differently. “This could be wiped out with a stroke of a pen,” he said.

Not everyone saw Thursday's action as a positive step.

“We can look forward to more drugged driving accidents, more school drop-outs, and poorer health outcomes as a new Big Marijuana industry targeting kids and minorities emerges to fuel the flames,"" Patrick Kennedy, co-founder of Project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana), said in a statement. The group opposes marijuana legalization.

The Obama administration has long wrestled with how to respond to state laws permitting marijuana use for one reason or another.

In 2009, then-Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden wrote a memo to U.S. attorneys saying that prosecution of significant traffickers of illegal drugs, including marijuana, remained a top priority. But he also said that the prosecution of individuals using the drug for medicinal purposes in compliance with state law “is unlikely to be an efficient use of limited federal resources.” In 2011, Cole reiterated Ogden’s stance on medical marijuana but cited the increase in large-scale commercial marijuana operations “for purported medical purposes.”

In December, Obama told Barbara Walters of ABC News that recreational marijuana use in states that have legalized the drug was not a major concern.

“We’ve got bigger fish to fry,” he said.

Thursday’s memo, while significant, makes clear that the federal government reserves the right to revisit its position in the future.

Ground is %22fertile%22 for immigration revisions when Congress returns in 2014

Republicans have said immigration legislation is a priority in the new year

However%2C some Republicans in the House still opposed to amnesty

WASHINGTON — If the Senate manages to pass a long-term budget deal Tuesday, the next item on the agenda for Congress could be even harder: immigration.

Republican leaders, led by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, have deemed immigration legislation a priority in the new year. The Senate is expected to pass Tuesday a bipartisan budget deal for the next two years that would clear the legislative calendar and eliminate the threat of a government shutdown in January. And even Bob Dane, whose Federation for American Immigration Reform strongly opposes a bill, concedes that at this point, ""the ground is very fertile"" for an immigration bill.

""It's going to happen,"" Vice President Biden said during a webinar last week.

However, whether that momentum leads to a sweeping rewrite of the nation's immigration laws could have more to do with the 2014 elections than current conditions.

The biggest roadblock to legislation has been, and will continue to be, Republicans in the House who oppose a deal similar to that passed by the Senate allowing the nation's 12 million undocumented immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship. Dane says an already-fractured GOP must stand firm in opposition if it wants to have any success come election day.

""Opposing amnesty next year is probably the last hope for the GOP to save itself from losing a core group of its voters,"" Dane said.

Despite their public support of immigration revisions, Republican House leaders accomplished little in 2013.

The Senate passed its comprehensive rewrite of the nation's immigration laws in June, including $46 billion in border security and an overhaul of the legal immigration system to bring in more high-tech and low-skilled workers.

House committees have approved five bills that focus on immigration enforcement and expanding the legal immigration system to bring in more foreign workers. But the last of those bills was approved in June; none of them have been brought to the House floor. No Republicans have introduced a bill that deals with the undocumented population.

Some House Republicans are pushing their colleagues to get those bills moving.

Reps. David Valadao, R-Calif., and Jeff Denham, R-Calif., have been pressing Republicans to sign onto a letter they hope to present to Boehner in January supporting action on immigration legislation.

Denham would not specify how many signatures they've garnered so far, but he said there is a surprising level of interest among his GOP colleagues.

""We've been getting a good percentage of our conference signing on,"" he said.

Denham said they'd have even more signatories, but some supportive Republicans are reluctant out of fear of primary season. Conservative groups have made clear that they will support more conservative GOP candidates against lawmakers who back the Senate bill, so adding their name to the letter could lead to easy attack ads.

""It puts a target on their back,"" Denham said.

Some also see Boehner's repudiation of outside conservative groups as his chamber passed the budget deal last week as evidence that he might be willing to push an immigration bill that isn't supported by the Tea Party wing of his party.

""It shows that Boehner wants to get things done and he's not going to be held hostage by the extreme right,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a group that supports the Senate bill and has spent the past year encouraging rank-and-file Republicans to embrace it. ""You win the conference, you win leadership, and we're getting closer and closer to winning the conference.""

In the meantime, immigration advocates have turned up the pressure on Republicans in the House.

Supporters completed a weeks-long fast for immigration changes on Friday, with several members of Congress joining for 24-hour, water-only fasts. But the tactics of immigration supporters have grown more and more confrontational.

Young undocumented immigrants interrupted Boehner while he was having breakfast several weeks ago, they've staked out the home of Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., and have held nearly constant protests outside Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy's office in California.

Last week, immigration supporters held sit-ins in the congressional offices of two-dozen representatives.

Those moves irked some in Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., has been pushing for new immigration laws for years and said protests aimed at so many members of Congress – including himself and other supporters – are ""not exactly contributing to get this done.""

But others, like Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said he's not surprised by their impatience and expects it to continue when Congress returns to Washington in January.

""They're angry, they're disillusioned, they're hurt, so you shouldn't expect them to come bringing flowers and roses,"" Gutierrez said. ""You should expect them to come here angry."""

Still, others say the Obamas have become more relaxed schmoozers, more at ease with the porous line between the political and social, more willing to reveal themselves. They have recently begun inviting more outsiders into their private living quarters, including Mr. Kushner, Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis at the “Lincoln” dinner. At a dinner in late November to thank top campaign fund-raisers, the first couple was like a bride and groom, bantering and traveling from table to table to accept congratulations and good wishes for the years ahead, making sly jokes that guests would not repeat for publication.

Even Mr. Obama’s speech has changed a bit, close observers say. Though he still disdains Washington, he often sounds less like a disapproving outsider and more like a participant. One former aide was startled to hear Mr. Obama use “impact” as a verb, a particular tendency in the capital. Another longtime adviser said he was struck during the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations when Mr. Obama grew offended that House Speaker John A. Boehner did not return his multiple phone calls. The old Barack Obama would have thought the who-calls-whom protocol was stupid, the adviser said, but “the world that he inhabits now is the world of inside-the-Beltway maneuvering.”

In video footage of Mr. Obama as president, the contrasts can be subtle but amusing. At his first Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony in 2009, the president played along, but then paused to distance himself from what he was doing and hint that he found the tradition ridiculous. “There are certain days that remind me of why I ran for this office,” he said. “And then there are moments like this — where I pardon a turkey and send it to Disneyland.” Cut to the same ceremony, three years later, and cue Mr. Obama promoting a contest over which bird to pardon and giggling just a little. “You can’t maintain your day-to-day cynicism about that stuff,” said Arun Chaudhary, the former White House videographer, because many Americans cherish White House rituals.

What Mr. Obama wants to achieve this term is pretty clear: a fiscal deal and overhauls of gun and immigration laws, steps to address climate change and less restrictive voter identification laws. But what Mrs. Obama wants is more of a mystery. In almost every appearance, she sounds warm, unpretentious notes; on Friday, she continued her Twitter banter with Ellen DeGeneres over who could do more push-ups."
http://news.yahoo.com/state-fire-chief-got-550k-002911659.html,,[],State: Fire chief got $550K in extra pension money,"SEATTLE (AP) -- Auditors are seeking to collect more than $550,000 from DuPont after concluding Friday that improper reporting led to excess pension payments for the city's fire chief.

The Department of Retirement Systems concluded that the city should not have classified Fire Chief Greg Hull as an independent contractor when he was hired after retiring from a position at another fire department. Hull's pension payments would have stopped if he had been labeled as a regular employee, so the state is now seeking to have the city repay the extra $550,000 in retirement money he received over the last few years.

""We feel the city is responsible for that overpayment,"" said Dave Nelsen, the legal and legislative services manager at the Department of Retirement Systems. It's a substantial amount of money for the city, accounting for roughly one-third of DuPont's annual fire department budget.

State officials recently notified Hull that his pension payments would be stopped, and city leaders said this week that Hull is resigning for ""personal reasons."" Hull will be able to apply for pension payments again starting next month, Nelsen said.

The retirement system began examining DuPont's procedures after an Associated Press investigation showed how some firefighter and law enforcement workers got late pay raises that helped increase their pensions. At about $184,000 a year, Hull had one of the largest pensions in the state.

DRS officials were still reviewing details of a raise that Hull received shortly before he retired in 2010 from Lakewood Fire District 2 to determine whether that pay bump was improperly included in his pension calculations. Nelsen said Hull's pension will also be influenced because he will have more service credits for his years working in DuPont, but he will lose cost-of-living adjustments he had received over the same period.

Auditors also dinged DuPont for improperly classifying two other workers as contractors, and they are seeking to have the city pay $45,000 to the pension system for those workers.

DuPont has the option of appealing. The city wrote in a brief response to the final audit that it believed all three people were properly labeled as contractors.

Mayor Michael Grayum did not return a call seeking comment."

USA TODAY

Republicans say an upscale vacation is extravagant when people are struggling to make ends meet.

Democrats criticized George W. Bush for spending too much time away from Washington%2C too.

Wherever the president is%2C technology and aides make sure he%27s never completely away from work.

President Obama and his family are heading to Martha's Vineyard on Saturday for a week of rest and relaxation, but not before facing the ritual partisan grumblings that presidential vacations are extravagant and waste taxpayer money.

While Congress is in the midst of its own five-week break, Republican officials haven't missed the opportunity to question the president for heading to the upscale Massachusetts community at a time when automatic cuts to the federal budget have left the Defense Department and other agencies furloughing employees.

Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said no one begrudges the president taking some time with his family. But Stewart, who earlier this year introduced a resolution calling on Obama to skip vacations until the White House restored public tours — mothballed as a result of across-the-board federal cuts known as sequestration— suggested the president's trip to the upscale community in Chilmark, Mass., appears ""tone deaf.""

""Most of the people in my district could never afford to visit Martha's Vineyard, and those who could would feel uncomfortable vacationing in a place that has a reputation for being for the elite,"" said Stewart in a telephone interview from his district.

Obama is scheduled to arrive on Saturday after he and first lady Michelle Obama travel to Orlando, where he will address the Disabled American Veterans National Convention. While on the Vineyard this year, the Obamas will be staying at the $7.6 million vacation home of David Schulte, a Democratic campaign donor and corporate finance manager.

Diana Waterman, chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, listed personal trips that the president and his family have taken to Hawaii, New York and Europe since the start of his presidency that were partially paid by taxpayers. With unemployment still at 7.4%, Waterman said going to the Vineyard seems exorbitant and suggested that Obama instead take his time off at the presidential retreat at Camp David.

""When there are so many people out there looking for jobs and Americans are struggling to make ends meet, this sends the wrong message to people who are struggling to survive,"" Waterman said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney on Thursday dismissed the criticism and said that Republicans scoffed at those who pilloried George W. Bush for spending too much time away from Washington during his presidency.

At the same point in Bush's presidency, the 43rd president had spent 367 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and his parent's compound at Kennebunkport, Maine, according to a count by CBS News reporter Mark Knoller. Obama, who doesn't own a vacation home, has spent a total of 92 days of his presidency on vacation, according to Knoller.

""I would just check what they said six years ago,"" Carney said of the Republican criticism.

The tradition of criticizing presidents for the choice of vacation spots and duration of their holiday is as old as the Republic itself.

Republicans jeered at Bill Clinton, who famously decided to vacation at Jackson Hole, Wyo., instead of Martha's Vineyard at the advice of his pollster ahead of the 1996 election.

Even Franklin Roosevelt was criticized for spending time on a yacht, which may have led to him taking a seven-day fishing trip to Canada during World War II without letting the media know. And John Adams spent seven months at his Quincy, Mass., farm in 1798, and was accused of abdicating his office. The criticism didn't help him in his bid for a second term.

But these days, when the president is tethered by technology and a coterie of staff is always nearby, he is never completely away from work.

Obama, like his predecessors, will travel with a large entourage of aides and Secret Service, and he will receive his daily briefing on national security and the economy.

Between golf outings with friends and ice cream runs with his daughters, there will likely be private conversations with aides on a variety of issues, including the looming budget and debt-ceiling deadlines and whom he's going to pick to be the next Federal Reserve chairman.

If he's lucky, no big emergencies will upend his trip. George W. Bush had to deal with Hurricane Katrina during a vacation in the summer. Bill Clinton ordered airstrikes against al-Qaeda terrorists from Martha's Vineyard in response to the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. And George H.W. Bush was at his family's compound in coastal Maine when he planned the U.S. response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

Obama had to break up his annual Christmas vacation to Hawaii last year to return to Washington after he was unable to negotiate a compromise with Congress to avert across-the-board tax increases before the holiday.

It ""remains the case that wherever he is, he's president of the United States and will be dedicating a portion of his day to being briefed and working on all the issues that are on the table in front of him,"" Carney said.

Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, said the more substantive issue is about the cost that taxpayers are footing for the president and his family's personal travel. His group has filed a series of lawsuits that have forced the Secret Service to release detailed cost breakdowns for several of the president's and his family's personal trips.

While the president pays for lodging, food and other incidentals, the government pays for Air Force One — which costs approximately $180,000 per hour to operate — and the expenses of Secret Service that must travel with him for his protection. Hotel receipts obtained by Judicial Watch earlier this summer showed that two days of hotel costs for Secret Service agents in Hawaii came to nearly $83,000.

""It's not a question of whether he's better or worse than his predecessors,"" Fitton said. ""It's a question of: Should our government be spending money on this sort of thing in this day and age?""

After Supreme Court ruling%2C Florida%2C Georgia%2C Mississippi and Texas set their own standards



Most likely%2C the case won%27t result in a dramatic shift in national criminal justice policy

Advocates want Supreme Court to revisit borderline cases

How should states decide if someone convicted of a crime has an intellectual disability, when the answer means life or death? This spring the Supreme Court will wade back into these murky waters, 12 years after it took the death penalty off the table for criminals with mental disabilities but left the details to the states.

In its 6-3 decision in Atkins v. Virginia, authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the court prohibited states from executing anyone with ""mental retardation."" Mental health professionals define it as substantial limitations in intellectual functions such as reasoning or problem-solving, limitations in adaptive behavior or ""street smarts,"" and evidence of the condition before age 18. (Mental retardation is the term used in law, but most clinicians and The Associated Press refer to the condition as intellectual disability.)

After the decision, most states stuck with the three-pronged clinical definition, but Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas set their own standards. Under Florida's law, if you have an IQ over 70, you're eligible for execution regardless of intellectual function or adaptive behavior.

Freddie Lee Hall, who has been on Florida's death row for more than 30 years and scored in the mid-70s on IQ tests, is arguing the state's standard amounts to unconstitutional punishment.

Most likely, the case won't result in a dramatic shift in national criminal justice policy, but will further clarify who should and should not be eligible for execution, said Ronald Tabak, an attorney who has represented multiple clients with intellectual disabilities and chairs the American Bar Association's death penalty committee.

""There is no reason to think that the court is taking this case because the court loves that Florida is going against the norms of the mental health field,"" Tabak said. ""The more likely reason they granted (judicial review) is …to say there are certain basic things about intellectual disability that you can't exclude from consideration.""

That's not the way Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi sees it. The Atkins decision, she wrote in her brief to the Supreme Court, ""expressly left the task of defining retardation to the states,"" and Florida is free to adopt its own standard for determining who is intellectually disabled.

""Freddie Lee Hall faces a death sentence for the 1978 murder of Karol Hurst, and Florida courts have found that he is not intellectually disabled,"" said Bondi. ""We will urge the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold Hall's sentence.""

The court's makeup has shifted since the 2002 Atkins decision. But if the justices split along ideological lines, the vote could favor Hall, assuming that swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy sides with Hall, as he did with Atkins in 2002. Arguments are set for March 3.

Similar cases are percolating beyond Florida. In Georgia, death row inmate Warren Hill is fighting execution based on substantial evidence that he is intellectually disabled. In Texas, where the courts use an anecdotal seven-part test largely based on the characteristics of the fictional character Lennie from John Steinbeck's novel ""Of Mice and Men"" to determine intellectual disability, multiple prisoners have been executed in recent years even when they've scored well below 70 on IQ tests.

Last year, Texas executed Marvin Wilson, who was convicted of murder in 1994, even though he had an IQ of 61. In 2010, Virginia executed Teresa Lewis for her role in a murder-for-hire scheme, even though she had an IQ of 72 and her co-conspirators admitted Lewis did not plan the murder.

These are the types of cases advocates want the Supreme Court to revisit. ""It's our hope that the court will clarify that states must use the clinical definition for intellectual disability…not only for current cases but for future cases, too,"" said Margaret Nygren, executive director and CEO of the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.

BORDERLINE CASES

Freddie Lee Hall was convicted of co-planning and carrying out the murder of 21-year-old Karol Hurst in Leesburg, Fla., in 1978. After spending the day scouting the parking lot of a local grocery store with his partner, Mack Ruffin, Hall forced Hurst, who was seven months pregnant, into her car and drove her into the woods. There, Ruffin sexually assaulted and shot Hurst. A jury convicted Hall of first-degree murder for his role in the murder scheme.

Since Hall was sentenced to death in 1981, he has made multiple appeals based on his low IQ, which varied from 71 to 80 depending on the tests and their margins of error.

""He has been the same ever since I've known him, and he has the mind of a child,"" said his attorney, Eric Pinkard, who has been working with Hall since 1999.

In multiple hearings to prove his intellectual disability, Hall's family and longtime friends testified about Hall's struggles with reading, writing and caring for himself and recounted how Hall experienced abuse, starvation and torture as a child. The Florida courts decided that even though Hall had limits in functioning and adaptive behavior, because his IQ scores were not below 70, Hall was not intellectually disabled and could be executed.

It's these borderline cases where the individual state implementations matter, said Nygren. ""Intellectual disability, like genius, is on a continuum,"" Nygren said. ""It's challenging for states to legislate that this person is 'in' or 'out.'""

Still, the court shouldn't wade too much into the specifics of setting protocols to define intellectual disability, said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which advocates for victims of crime.

""If the Supreme Court gets into issues like these and declares them to be federal constitutional mandates,"" Scheidegger said, ""we will have a long stretch of litigation as the high court resolves one issue after another, never reaching the end.""

Making that determination is generally subject to clinical judgment, said Nygren. ""Clinicians must pick scientifically valid tests that are culturally relevant and standardized, but also individualized,"" Nygren said. ""For instance, if someone's been in jail for last five years, it's hard to evaluate if they're good at managing money since they don't have money to manage. That's where clinical judgment comes in.""

Beyond IQ tests, the disability manifests in limitations in learning and reasoning, and difficulty with social skills, personal care and language. These factors are just as relevant as an IQ test score, which, said Nygren, ""is never going to give you 100 percent (certainty), even though that's the expectation placed on the test.""

Advocates like Nygren want the court to require states to pay more attention to margins of error when determining intellectual disability. Leaving the determination of mental disability to the states, ""has given states a lot of leeway to do mischief with the definition of intellectual disability,"" said Brian Kammer, executive director of the Georgia Resource Center, which provides free legal services for death row inmates.

For instance, Georgia requires defendants to prove their intellectual disability ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" the highest standard of proof in the criminal justice system. Georgia is the only state that requires such a high burden of proof and the legislature is considering lowering the standard in the next legislative session.

DEATH SENTENCES DOWN

Still, the Atkins decision has had an impact on executions. At least 98 people have had their death sentence changed since 2002 by proving that they were intellectually disabled, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center. By their count, in the 18 years before the Atkins decision, at least 44 people who likely suffered from intellectual disabilities were executed.

Nationally, states are carrying out fewer death sentences than they have since the penalty was reinstated in 1976. So far in 2013, 36 people have been executed in nine states. In 2012, 43 people were executed in nine states.

Instead, with the fiscal cliff deal he signed in President Obama raised his income tax rate from 35 to 39.6 percent and his capital gains tax rate to 20 from 15 percent. And not content to rest there, Obama's proposed budget for fiscal year 2014 would reduce or eliminate several tax breaks benefitting the wealthiest Americans—a group which happens to include himself. Joe Scarborough's mythmaking notwithstanding, Obama has in fact called on Congress to pass the so-called ""Buffett Rule"" to ensure that those earning over a million dollars a year, like Obama will and Mitt Romney already does, will pay at least 30 percent of their income to Uncle Sam. Just as important, President Obama has proposed capping charitable deductions at 28 percent, a change that would cost him and would-have-been President Romney some serious coin.

President Romney, in contrast, would have given himself and his family a massive tax cut windfall of staggering proportions. Romney not only wanted to make the Bush tax rates permanent, he wanted a 20 percent across-the-board tax cut on top of that. That would have proven quite helpful to him even in those years when his speaking fees of $374,000 were ""not that much."" At no point did Romney publicly commit to a single tax deduction he'd close, even when he suggested capping their total value. On top of that, Romney called for ending the estate tax, a giveaway to the Romney clan potentially worth at least $80 million.

It's also worth recalling that Mitt Romney's 10 percent church tithe reduces his tax bill every year. (But Romney wants credit for that, too, claiming that once his charitable contributions and so-called double-taxation of corporate profits are taken into account his real tax rate is ""45 or 50 percent."") Last August, Mitt announced that he never paid less than 13 percent in taxes (which ones he didn't say) over each of the last 10 years. Mitt insisted that get credit for the dollars donated to the LDS:



""Every year, I've paid at least 13 percent, and if you add, in addition, the amount that goes to charity, why the number gets well above 20 percent.""

As it turned out, for his 2011 return Romney did not claim the full charitable tax break to which he was entitled (claiming only $2.25 million of the $4 million he donated) in order to keep his word about that 13 percent rate.

In contrast, as President Obama explained during the campaign last year:



""To give me another tax break, or to give Warren Buffett another tax break, or to give Mitt Romney another tax break -- that would cost about a trillion dollars"" in the federal budget, Obama told people in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ""We can't afford it,"" he said. ""Not at a time when we're trying to bring down our deficit.""

Apparently, the likes of Erin Burnett and Joe Scarborough not only want to forget the result of the 2012 election; they are pretending it never happened at all."

Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) staff that they have had no contact.

""We have been in contact with everybody involved in this effort on Capitol Hill,"" Carney told reporters at a briefing.

A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private talks, said later Tuesday that White House staff met with the offices of the ""gang of eight"" -- including a Rubio staffer -- five times in the past few weeks.

Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, said in a statement earlier on Tuesday that the senator's staff hasn't spoken to the White House on immigration, but that they didn't necessarily want to anyway.

""Senator Rubio's office has never discussed immigration policy with anyone in the White House,"" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. ""To be clear: That’s fine with us -- we actually think Congress should write the policy; not the White House. But an honest question: If the Obama Administration is serious about drafting & passing its own immigration reform, why wouldn’t they seek input from any Republicans whose support they’ll need?""

USA Today obtained the White House's draft immigration legislation on Saturday, but the White House has said it was not the source of the leak. Carney repeated that assertion in the press briefing, saying it ""was not an intentional release.""

There's no set timeline for when immigration reform should be completed, Carney said. Obama said in his State of the Union last week that he would like a bill passed within ""the next few months"" -- a tight timeframe when bills have not yet been introduced in the House or Senate. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said Sunday that the administration's legislation was a back-up plan and that the White House would continue to work with Rubio and others on a deal.

Rubio is a member of the Senate immigration ""gang of eight,"" along with Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). The four Democratic members of the group met with Obama last week to update him on the status of the talks.

But Rubio's relationship with the White House, at least publicly, has been more fraught. The senator quickly decried the draft legislation leaked on Saturday, saying in a statement that it could be damaging to the discussions going forward.

“It’s a mistake for the White House to draft immigration legislation without seeking input from Republican members of Congress,"" Rubio said. ""President Obama’s leaked immigration proposal is disappointing to those of us working on a serious solution. ... If actually proposed, the president’s bill would be dead on arrival in Congress, leaving us with unsecured borders and a broken legal immigration system for years to come.""

He also released a statement last week accusing the administration, and in particular Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, of seeming to try to hurt reform efforts. Napolitano testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and said border concerns should not prevent broader immigration reform. The ""gang of eight"" plan would only allow immigrants to earn green cards after certain border metrics were met, a trigger not included in the White House draft legislation, but would allow other reforms to take place immediately, including allowing provisional status for undocumented immigrants.

The White House has come out strongly against a piecemeal approach that requires passing border security enforcement measures first and other immigration provisions later, but has not specifically stated it would oppose a trigger such as the one in the ""gang of eight"" framework.

Rubio, though, said Napolitano should have embraced the plan if the administration was ""serious"" about reform.

""Secretary Napolitano’s refusal to accept this bipartisan principle at today’s Senate hearing is discouraging for those of us who are serious about permanently fixing America’s immigration system,"" Rubio said in a statement after the committee hearing. ""By continuing to oppose a key security principle with bipartisan backing, Secretary Napolitano and this Administration appear to be laying the groundwork to scuttle the bipartisan effort in the Senate.""

UPDATE: 1:55 p.m. -- Rubio spokesman Alex Conant tweeted later that the White House had met with ""gang of eight"" staff, despite his statement that they never discussed immigration policy.

We double checked... WH never asked for our input. They sent agency officials to brief gang of 8, but didn't ask for input or discuss policy — Alex Conant (@AlexConant) February 19, 2013

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant clarified further by email.

""We have never discussed immigration policy with anyone from the White House,"" he said. ""The Administration has sent some agency officials to brief staff at the bipartisan group meetings, but they've never asked for our input. (And, frankly, we've never asked for theirs.) We've never received a call or email from Cecilia Munoz or anyone else at the White House asking for our input as they draft their bill.""

UPDATE: 5:10 p.m. -- President Barack Obama called Graham, McCain and Rubio later on Tuesday to discuss immigration reform, the White House announced. Flake, the fourth Republican member of the ""gang of eight,"" was unable to speak with the president because he was traveling, according to the White House.

During the calls, which build on conversations that have taken place at the staff level, the President reiterated that he remains supportive of the effort underway in Congress, and that he hopes that they can produce a bill as soon as possible that reflects shared core principles on reform. The President has made clear that he believes commonsense reform needs to include strengthening border security, creating an earned path to citizenship, holding employers accountable, and streamlining legal immigration. As the President made clear when he met with Democratic Senators involved in the process last week, that while he is pleased with the progress and supportive of the effort to date, he is prepared to submit his own legislation if Congress fails to act. He thanked the Senators for their leadership, and made clear that he and his staff look forward to continuing to work together with their teams to achieve needed reform.

Conant said Rubio ""appreciated"" Obama's call. ""Rubio said he feels good about ongoing negotiations in Senate,"" Conant tweeted."

What’s the impact?,"Much of the federal government will shut down as of midnight. What will be closing, why and what impact will it have?

Question: Why a shutdown?

Answer: Every year, Congress has to approve laws, known as appropriations, that provide money for federal agencies. The new budget year begins on Oct. 1, and Congress has failed to pass a single one of the appropriations. An effort to pass a stop-gap bill to provide temporary money has stalled in Congress: Republicans have insisted they will not approve the stop-gap measure unless Democrats agree to block money for President Obama’s healthcare law, and Democrats have refused to do that. Under federal law, if an agency does not have an appropriation law in force, it can’t spend money, so it has to close.

Q: Do all government programs stop?

Advertisement

A: No. There are three big categories that don’t. Some programs don’t require annual appropriations. That group, which includes Social Security, Medicare and other so-called entitlements, continue without interruption. The second group entails functions “necessary to protect life or property.” Law enforcement, the military, intelligence agencies and foreign embassies all will stay open. Finally, some programs have other sources of money that will allow them to function for a while. Courts, for example, can spend money they have collected through fines and fees, funds that would allow them to keep functioning for a while.

Q: What are some examples of government offices that will close?

A: The national parks, federally owned museums, such as the Smithsonian, offices overseas that give visas to foreigners hoping to visit the United States, many federal regulatory agencies, IRS call centers that provide assistance to taxpayers and most offices that handle federal grants and contracts will all close.

FULL COVERAGE: First government shutdown in 17 years



Q: What happens to federal workers?

A: At least 800,000 federal civilian workers will be furloughed. They will not be paid during the shutdown.

Q: Will workers get back pay once the shutdown ends?

A: The last time this happened, during the Clinton administration, Congress approved retroactive pay. There’s no guarantee, however.

Q: What impact will all this have on the economy?

A: A lot depends on how long a shutdown lasts. If the duration is only a few days, the economic impact will be small. But the impact builds with time. The tourism industry will be among the first hit because of the closure of parks and the inability of foreign tourists to get visas.

Q: Why hasn’t Congress passed its appropriations bills on time?

A: Passing money bills has been difficult for years because of disputes between the two parties about how much to spend. This year, the problem got a lot worse after House Republicans passed a budget plan that called for deep cuts in spending. When the time came to translate those overall spending numbers into specific appropriations bills, the bills failed because many Republicans decided the spending levels were too low.

What shuts down in a government shutdown

Q: How long will a shutdown last?

A: Both Republicans and Democrats will be watching to see which side gets blamed for the impasse. Whichever side is losing the battle for public opinion will eventually decide the price has gotten too high and will offer concessions. In the Clinton administration, there were two government shutdowns. One lasted five days, the other, which affected only part of the government, went on for three weeks.

March Madness is here, and the competition is getting intense.

And the battle for President Obama's library appears to have boiled down two finalists: Chicago and Hawaii.

Universities and community groups in both places are busy lobbying the president's people for the facility that the contestants see as an economic and cultural boon.

""It is a tough choice, but it's not one that I've made yet,"" Obama told an interviewer last month.

In the meantime, the Associated Press reported:

""In December, top officials from the University of Chicago, where Obama once taught law, traveled to Dallas and met with archivists at The George W. Bush Presidential Library at Southern Methodist University. At the meeting was Susan Sher, first lady Michelle Obama's former chief of staff and longtime friend and now a senior adviser to the University of Chicago's president. ...

""In Honolulu, where the president was born, University of Hawaii officials have visited nearly all the 13 official presidential libraries to talk to officials involved in setting them up. An American studies professor, Robert Perkinson, is leading a statewide effort coordinated by the university, with support from Gov. Neil Abercrombie and other state and federal officials. The state Legislature has passed two resolutions urging Obama to pick Hawaii; one resolution calls it 'a matter of great state pride that President Obama is the first Hawaii-born citizen to hold that high office.' ...

""Advocates for placing the library in Chicago speak of Obama's coming of age as a community organizer there and his service in the Illinois Senate and as the state's U.S. senator. They say a presidential library on the city's South Side could revitalize the community and be a force for economic growth. ...

""The emerging consensus in Honolulu is that the state university is best prepared to house the library. But there's no such sense of agreement in Chicago, where a host of groups are publicly stumping on behalf of other sites on Chicago's South Side, where Michelle Obama grew up, voters first sent Barack Obama to public office and the Obama family has their home."""
