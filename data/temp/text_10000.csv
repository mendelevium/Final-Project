In A bridge falling into the water and a vision for the future gone missing, Laura Clawson points out that the collapse of the Skagit River Bridge on Interstate 5 is symptomatic of a deeper, systematic problem in America today. Public construction spending as a share of GDP is the lowest it's been in decades. And as The Huffington Post reports, more than 700 bridges in Washington State alone are in worse shape than the one that collapsed.

This is a symptom of the slow-motion collapse of American civilization. What is happening to our society is much like watching a rotting log gradually crumbling into dust.

In his epic Middle Eastern history novel The Source, James Michener had a chapter near the end called ""Twilight of an Empire,"" about the decline of the Ottoman Empire because of corrupt and ineffectual government. Political officials had given up hope for positive change, and an elaborate system of bribery prevented most legislation or public works from moving forward. As one government leader said to his protege:



""What we must do is permit no change and hope that things work out for the best."" At that moment his desk was heavy with petitions covering matters of health, schools... and an ingenious plan for clearing the harbor of silt, but during his remaining tenure none would be moved forward.

History moves in cycles, and I think most early 21st century Americans can feel in their gut that this country is on the downslope of its historical trajectory. The question is, can we turn it around, or is it too late? Will American civilization as we know it cease to exist, much like the collapse of the Ottoman Empire a century ago?

One thing is for sure: Our government is fundamentally broken. An honest description of the current normative functioning (or lack thereof) of the U.S. Congress would go something like this:



Every year, one party demands and succeeds in cutting government spending and preventing spending on new projects through two mechanisms: 1. Threats to refuse to raise the ""debt ceiling,"" which would cause America to default on its debt and crash the world economy. 2. The ""silent filibuster"" in the Senate, in which a 60% supermajority is always required to pass any bill or even to debate it. The filibuster also prevents many appointees to courts and government agencies from being confirmed, leading to an ongoing, increasing vacancy rate and inability for executive and judicial institutions to function. Legislation that does pass the Congress is usually drafted by lobbyists for corporations and the wealthy, ensuring that their private interests rather than the public interest is protected. Lobbyists have this power because they provide most of the funds for the reelection campaigns of elected officials. In return for their cooperation in this system, politicians are typically hired by lobbying firms and given generous compensation packages upon leaving elected office.

I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2007

Under this system of government in which we are now living -- a system of institutionalized inaction and bribery in all but name -- spending the necessary funds to repair America's crumbling roads and bridges is considered an extravagant luxury that our country cannot afford.""Too expensive... let it rot."" ""Too difficult to have a functioning government... let it do nothing."" Infrastructure and institutions of a once proud nation, dwindling away into embarrassment and farce. Our leaders no longer care about providing the American people with even basic public goods that can be relied upon. So we -- supposedly the greatest country in the world -- let roads and bridges in major American cities collapse.

Schools, libraries, parks, advanced weather forecasting, and other features of great modern civilizations? Forget about it! All being cut to the bone.

So few jobs being created that labor force participation is the lowest since 1979 and food stamp eligibility is the highest ever? Who cares! It sure isn't the government's responsibility to do anything about unemployment, right? -- the reaction from America's politicians on this score is as deafening as John Cage's infamous symphony of silence.

Even spending money on disaster relief for American cities destroyed by a hurricane or a tornado is no longer an automatic thing, but instead a political football. Our politicians are so tight, the unreformed Ebenezer Scrooge would be proud.

It used to be that America put men on the moon.

We have become a society deeply in decline. And for anyone who is proud to be an American, it is sickening to watch it unfold.

The only question that remains is this: Will the American people rise up, with renewed pride in what their country once was and could be again, and demand better of its leaders?"
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/15/business/living-on-minimum-wage.html,2013-06-15 00:00:00,[],Living on Minimum Wage,"At least one part of the labor force has expanded significantly since the recession hit: the low-wage part, made up of burger flippers, home health aides and the like.

Put simply, the recession took middle-class jobs, and the recovery has replaced them with low-income ones, a trend that has exacerbated income inequality. According to Labor Department data, about 1.7 million workers earned the minimum wage or less in 2007. By 2012, the total had surged to 3.6 million, with millions of others earning just a few cents or dollars more.

In his State of the Union address in February, President Obama made raising the federal minimum wage his banner economic proposal. The White House argued that increasing the wage to $9 an hour from its current $7.25 and indexing it to inflation would lift hundreds of thousands of families above the poverty line.

Combined with tax measures the administration has supported, Alan B. Krueger, the departing chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, said that raising the minimum wage would undo “a lot of the rise in inequality we’ve seen over the last 20 years.”"

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/23/senate-republicans-budget-tea-party_n_3327612.html,2013-05-23 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post', 'Senior Congressional Reporter']",Senate Republicans Oppose Budget Blockade By Tea Party In Growing GOP Feud,"WASHINGTON -- A tea party rebellion by several U.S. senators blocking progress on the federal budget may be working for them, but not for their fellow Republican lawmakers -- even ones who mostly agree with them.

Tension has occasionally been evident in the simmering, behind-the-scenes struggle between the Senate's tea party contingent and old-guard party members. But it erupted in public view on the Senate floor this week as Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) revealed their displeasure with their junior colleagues.

The tea partiers -- primarily Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Rand Paul (Ky.), Mike Lee (Utah) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) -- are blocking the Senate from appointing conferees to a conference committee with the House to work out the radical differences between the two budgets each side has passed.

That is often done in the Senate by unanimous consent. Other times, there are votes instructing conferees on how to try to shape the final bill. But the conservative cohorts want more. They are demanding that the Senate bar the conference members from doing anything that would raise the federal debt limit -- a demand that McCain lambasted for much of the week as unprecedented.

The debate intensified Wednesday, when McCain charged that the tea party members' opposition amounted to distrust of the House GOP leadership. And Cruz admitted it did. ""Let me be clear. I don't trust the Republicans,"" he said, lumping them in with Democrats.

But McCain has held his ground, suggesting on Thursday that senators who object to conference negotiations don't understand ""how business has been done"" in Congress. Moreover, McCain asserted that most GOP senators agree with him that it's time to stop stalling and go to conference.

Most senators asked by The Huffington Post said they do agree with McCain.

""I think it's a good idea to get a commitment not to raise the debt limit, but I trust the normal course of business -- that we're not going to use reconciliation to raise the debt limit,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told HuffPost. ""We can have a motion to instruct our conferees not to raise the debt limit by 51 votes, so I'm fine with going to conference.""

""People have strong feelings, and that's what it's all about,"" Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) explained of the tea party conservatives. ""But myself personally, I would very much like to see this resolved very quickly so that we can go to conference. I would like to see us appoint conferees.""

Even Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), a deficit hawk and the top Republican on the Budget Committee who said he understood the concerns over raising the debt limit, pointed out that the ultimate goal was to iron out differences through regular order.

""I think the right thing to do is get ourselves to conference,"" Sessions told HuffPost. ""Eventually we need to go forward and reach an agreement, the president needs to be engaged, and a conference provides an opportunity to do that.""

""I think there ought to be discussion, but ultimately we have to go to conference,"" said Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.).

Some senators said they found the stall tactics to be political grandstanding.

""It's all a political game,"" Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) told HuffPost, adding that he supported regular order. ""This is a slowdown because the House wants a slowdown. As soon as the House doesn't want the slowdown, it will get released.""

Coburn's comments are oddly in line with recent arguments used by Democrats in the budget fight. House Republicans spent four years calling for regular order while berating the Senate for failing to pass a budget. When the Senate finally passed its budget resolution in March, Republicans were suddenly reluctant to convene a conference committee, even though without one, there can be no formal federal budget for the fifth year in a row.

Indeed, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Thursday he's had ""private conversations this week on how we might move ahead, but we've not made any decisions at this point.""

Even some kindred conservatives in the House, however, said they would like to see the budget finished.

""These guys are blood brothers. I love 'em. In fact I would suggest to you, in all deference to Sen. McCain, they're far more in line with the rank-and-file members of the House than Sen. McCain is,"" Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost. ""That's probably an understatement.""

But Franks suggested that the best way to convince people in the long run was play by the rules, and keep making the argument. House leaders, he said, had to keep their eye on the bigger picture of what is possible, even if Franks disagrees.

""I understand the equation they're dealing with is almost untenable, mathematically,"" Franks said. ""If they do what people like me would like them to do, sometimes we end up, because we're so outnumbered, not being able to sustain that.""

And even though the tea partiers' fears may be realized, Franks said he thinks the process should proceed.

""What we have to do, still in a regular order situation, is to get the strongest thing that we can from the Senate that's the best for the country possible and do the same in the House, and then hope that the respective leaderships appoint the people that can sustain the best outcome possible,"" Franks said. ""If we have the right people on our conference side, I wouldn't be afraid of that at all.""

McCain said he couldn't speak for his colleagues in the House, but pointed out that the same group of senators threatened to filibuster the debate on gun control legislation and were ultimately convinced not to block debate.

""Any small group of senators can object to moving to conference on any piece of legislation because they object to their provision not being included in it?"" McCain said in a brief hallway interview. ""That would be a dreadful precedent to set in the United States Senate.""

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate GOP conference, was confident the matter would be resolved. He told HuffPost his colleagues had a ""legitimate fear"" over the debt limit, but stressed the need to figure out a path forward.

""Obviously we want to see a continued debate about the budget,"" Thune said. ""I think that's good for us, because we've been talking about debt, spending and taxes. I think those are good arguments for Republicans."""

They were joined by Lancaster, Texas, Walmart employee Colby Harris, a fellow activist with the labor group OUR Walmart. After delivering a letter to their store manager, and protesting with supporters outside the Laurel Walmart, the workers filed new charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging illegal intimidation by the retail giant. [...] Workers allege that Walmart exploited that agreement to unleash a new round of intimidation against workers. They say that Walmart managers held mandatory meetings in which managers read from a memo telling workers that the strikes had been illegal, and that OUR Walmart was being dissolved. “They said that anybody who associates themselves with OUR Walmart, and the leaders, and the organization as a whole, could face disciplinary actions,” said Harris. He said he had not been pulled into such a meeting, but had heard about them from co-workers in states including Florida, Illinois, Kentucky and Maryland.

The United Food and Commercial Workers and OUR Walmart may have agreed not to picket Walmart for 60 days, but that doesn't mean workers are going to lie down and take it if Walmart mistreats them. Which, of course, Walmart is doing, both as a matter of routine and especially in the aftermath of the no-picket agreement. Josh Eidelson reports that:As long as the Maryland workers who walked out don't do anything resembling a picket line (no walking in circles in front of the store, for instance) and aren't looking for union recognition, they should be within the framework of the union agreement with the National Labor Relations Board. And they're definitely serving notice to Walmart that it's not open season."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/opinion/keller-obamas-fault.html,2013-03-04 00:00:00,['Bill Keller'],Obama’s Fault - The New York Times,"In the summer of 2011, the president tried to find a grand bargain with House Republicans, and failed. Then, with the Republicans threatening to cut off the government’s borrowing power unless they got budget cuts, the White House and Republicans agreed on a bad bargain: the debt ceiling was raised, and the sequester was launched. There is a strong argument to be made (Noam Scheiber made it well last year in his book “The Escape Artists: How Obama’s Team Fumbled the Recovery”) that the president was unwise to let Republican zealots get away with such blackmail. Authorizing the government to pay the bills Congress has already incurred should be a matter of routine, not ransom. But the sequester was locked and loaded.

Which brings us to missed opportunity No. 2. Remember, the original plan was for the sequester to detonate at the beginning of this year, at the same time as the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. These twin shocks were supposed to work together to drive both parties toward the middle. For Republicans, the horrible prospect of an automatic, across-the-board tax increase (plus sequester’s deep cuts in defense spending) would be reason to come to the negotiating table. For Democrats, the opportunity to extract a little more tax money from the wealthy (plus the threat of cuts to cherished domestic programs) would be incentive to bargain.

But with 2012 winding down, the White House and House Republicans struck another bad deal. They let the Bush tax breaks expire for the top bracket, while making them permanent for everyone else. The sequester spending cuts were postponed until — well, until now.

That year-end tax deal was not a negotiating triumph for the Democrats. Obama wanted $1.2 trillion in new revenues over 10 years. Boehner let it be known he would go as high as $800 billion. By the time the master deal-makers of the White House were done, the “compromise” tax hike was $620 billion. I’d love to be the guy who sells the president his next car.

But the bigger mistake was to do the deal at all. Here we had Washington staring down the double barrels of that fiscal shotgun — automatic spending cuts and automatic tax hikes — and the White House agreed to remove one barrel. Once the tax deal was done, the Republicans, having budged once on taxes, felt no inclination to budge again. As John Boehner would say, over and over, “He’s gotten his tax hikes.” And with Republicans unwilling to revisit the issue of taxes, Democrats had even less enthusiasm for a broader budget bargain that would cut programs they regard as sacred.

If Obama had held firm and let the Bush tax cuts expire for everyone, as some recommended at the time, he would now have at his disposal a powerful inducement for both parties to come together. A bargain could be built around restoring the lower rates for most taxpayers. With an actual, large tax cut at the heart of it, you just might construct the kind of big bipartisan bargain that has been so elusive. But it’s too late for that."

Even before the address, Obama’s plan to call for “investments” was panned by House Speaker John Boehner. ""If government spending were the tonic for all our ills, this would have been solved a long time ago,” Boehner told reporters.

But Obama stressed that his proposals would not add to the deficit.

“Tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago,” Obama said in prepared remarks. “Let me repeat -- nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.”

At the beginning of his second term, Obama is pushing anew to make economic growth a priority. In his remarks, he says it is this generation’s task “to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class.”

Regardless of whether Obama’s proposals add to the deficit, he is sure to face a mixed reception in putting the emphasis on new government programs when many -- particularly House Republicans -- are more interested in paring back the spending out of Washington. Some argue this could even help the economy by sending a signal that the federal government is at last tackling the budget deficit.

The president is expected to speak at 9 p.m. ET.

While Obama's aides say Tuesday night is all about the economy, he is expected to hit several other themes during the hour-long speech. First lady Michelle Obama’s guest list, announced Tuesday afternoon, provided a glimpse into what those agenda items might be -- gun control, immigration, education, science and technology funding, and more.

In each guest's biography is reflected a theme, almost certain to make its way into the president's speech.

Among those in Michelle Obama's guest box are Alan Aleman, a so-called ""DREAM student"" -- someone who arrived in the U.S. as a young illegal immigrant, but has been given a reprieve to pursue an education by the administration. Aleman's presence will be symbolic as the president pushes for immigration reform which, if he gets his way, will include some permanent provision dealing illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

Also in the guest box is Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton, mother of Hadiya Pendleton who was killed in Chicago in late January. The first lady attended Hadiya's memorial service over the weekend. Cowley-Pendleton, together with other victims of gun violence in the crowd Tuesday night, represents the president's push for new gun control measures.

Several other guests speak to Obama's stance on the budget. Highlighting the president's push for science funding, the flight director for the Mars Curiosity Rover will be in the crowd. And highlighting the president's push for tax cuts on the middle class (and hikes on top earners), the guest box will include Lisa Richards, a single mom who voiced concern to the White House about taxes rising on the middle class.

The president will have several other weighty issues to address Tuesday night, not the least of which is North Korea's latest nuclear test. The president also plans to announce 34,000 U.S. troops will be brought home from Afghanistan within a year.

That will bring the force size to roughly half what it is now, in the run-up to the withdrawal deadline of the end of 2014.

The centerpiece of the address, though, is still expected to be the economy. The president is expected to revive his calls Tuesday for government ""investments"" in infrastructure and education -- meaning spending. While the recurring push, for Republicans, brings back bad memories of the stimulus law they opposed, White House economic adviser Gene Sperling told Fox News on Tuesday that closing the deficit ""doesn't mean you pull back on everything.""

""I don't think that laying the foundation for future growth (with research and highway spending) is anything to discount in any way,"" Sperling said. ""What you need to do is be smart.""

Boehner, though, dismissed the push. ""If government spending were the tonic for all our ills, this would have been solved a long time ago,"" he said Tuesday. Boehner said the president added ""$5 trillion in new debt over the last four years. How much further is he going to run us into the sewer?""

Boehner also claimed the president doesn't have the ""guts"" to tackle the budget deficit.

Obama and Congress are scrambling to find a way to avoid automatic spending cuts poised to hit March 1 unless a deal is reached to replace them.

Obama, to the chagrin of Republicans, wants to replace those cuts with a blend of tax hikes and separate cuts. Republicans, citing the tax-hike concessions they gave during the fiscal crisis talks, are averse to more tax increases -- even if this time, those increases do not come in the form of rate hikes."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/05/Obama-Scrambles-To-Blame-Abysmal-Jobs-Numbers-On-Sequester,2013-04-05 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],White House Blames Jobs Numbers on Sequester,"The Obama White House is scrambling to blame Friday’s abysmal March jobs numbers on the sequester’s trimming of the rate of growth in federal budgets that have yet to fully commence.

After the Labor Department announced that a mass exodus of 663,000 workers left the U.S. workforce last month and that job creation fell 112,000 jobs short of projections, Obama’s top economic adviser Alan B. Krueger, took to the White House blog to blame the sequester:

It is important to bear in mind that the March household and payroll surveys are the first monthly surveys to look at employment since the beginning of sequestration. While the recovery was gaining traction before sequestration took effect, these arbitrary and unnecessary cuts to government services will be a headwind in the months to come, and will cut key investments in the Nation’s future competitiveness. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the sequester will reduce employment by 750,000 full-time equivalent jobs by the end of the year. Now is not the time for Washington to impose more self-inflicted wounds on the economy. The administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to put more Americans back to work like rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing.

Krueger did not mention January’s 2% payroll tax increase, which will wipe out an entire year’s worth of wage gains by American workers. Roughly 70% of national expenditures emanate from consumers.

Kathy Bostjancic, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis for The Conference Board business research group, says the major flaw in Obama’s argument is that the sequester has not kicked in yet.

“What is even more troubling about the most recent slowdown is that it takes place even before the sequester cuts materially hit the economy,” Bostjancic stated in a press release. “This reinforces our view that the estimated 3.5 percent real GDP growth in Q1 is not likely to be sustained. Instead, we see the overall economy, led by the consumer, downshifting significantly in the second quarter, struggling to get close to 1 percent real growth.”

The need to curb Washington’s spending will have an effect on jobs, says Bostjancich, but they will likely be centered around “further contraction in government sector jobs.”

Indeed, the unemployment rate for government workers is less than half (3.6%) the national unemployment rate. Since July, the government has added 618,000 government workers to its payrolls, employing 20,633,000 individuals.

While Friday’s reporting shows a 7.6% unemployment rate, the real rate–including the millions who have given up hope and quit looking for work, are in part-time positions and needing full-time work, etc.–is closer to 15%, says billionaire former Obama supporter Mort Zuckerman. Worse, says Zuckerman, “Multiple job-holders are up by 340,000 to 7.26 million. In essence then, all of the ‘new’ positions are going to people who already are working, mostly part-time.”

To be sure, the need to slam the brakes on Washington’s reckless spending will likely shed jobs, and possibly the 100,000 to 300,000 economists project. But the 90,000,000 Americans who no longer work as of last month have myriad other factors to blame than a cut the equivalent of 0.5% of the national debt that has yet to go into effect."

Will I get over the end of Saturday deliveries by the U.S. Postal Service? I’m sure I will. But like countless others in this country, I will miss them.

Living in rural Vermont, in a fairly isolated farmhouse overlooking the Green Mountains, I look forward to the mail, which brings news from relatives and friends, Christmas cards, bills, and – most of all – Saturday visits from Bob, who has been arriving at my house for years now, always with good cheer, local gossip and a sense that God’s in his heaven and all’s well with the world.

I remember as a child looking forward to the arrival of Mr. Mail, as my sister and I called him, on Saturday mornings. He was a dour fellow, but we liked him.

Jay Parini

We had no school on Saturdays, so all the children got to know him on that day. He was missing a front tooth, so it was probably a good thing that he rarely smiled. When he did, it was an occasion. I loved him, mostly because he brought regular letters from my pen pal in Sweden – letters with an array of strange, colorful stamps and peculiar tales from abroad.

It was an adjustment when, years later, we had to get used to Miss Fe-Mail, a young woman with masses of blond hair and red lipstick.

The mail has always kept me in touch with the world. As a young man I lived in Scotland for seven years, and loved getting two postal deliveries a day, bringing letters on blue aerograms from home. I would open those fragile blue letters very carefully, so as not to lose words. They were often scribbled in a tiny hand so the author could get as many words as possible within the aerogram’s limited boundaries.

My Scottish postman’s name was Angus, and he told me about his grandfather, who had brought three or four deliveries to every house each day. The mail was like e-mail in those days. If you lived in a city, such as London, you could really send a letter in the morning and expect it to make it across town by the afternoon. Nowadays it can take several days to get a letter from one side of Vermont to another. Sometimes I wonder if we’re still using the Pony Express.

As a boy, I read a book about the Pony Express, and had fantasies about joining it. The express started up in the mid-19th century, with relays of postal workers on horseback who would carry letters from Missouri over the Great Plains, through the Rocky Mountains, to California – and it only took about 10 days. It was the invention of the telegraph that brought this wondrous service to a halt, not unlike the advent of the Internet, which has made the postal service much less relevant to our lives.

E-mails deliver most of our joys and sorrows today, and we conduct routine business in this ephemeral form. Handwritten letters have become precious artifacts. For future biographers, the loss of real letters presents a dilemma. My bookshelf holds volumes of the collected letters of my favorite writers, and I treasure those by John Keats, Lord Byron, Dickens and others. Will anyone ever publish someone’s collected e-mails?

How Amazon could save the U.S. Postal Service

So much of our thinking is about loss, and this is one of the losses we must bear. I doubt that we’ll ever return to obsessive letter-writing, and don’t expect to get many letters from abroad, with brilliantly colored stamps bearing the visage of unknown kings, queens and other eminent people I’ve never heard of. I wonder if I’ll even know the person who brings letters to my house in the years to come.

At least my part of Vermont has Internet access. In the immediate future, the absence of Saturday postal deliveries for rural areas that lack access might have genuine consequences, hurting business and dampening the spirits for people who already feel a bit out of touch.

Everyone would like, I think, to see a robust postal service – the Post Office represents the nation at home. I still make special trips into town, a drive of several miles, to do “business” at the P.O., where I meet friends to exchange gossip, buy special editions of stamps and, for nostalgic reasons, purchase aerograms to send to friends abroad. The bustling atmosphere is cheery, especially at Christmas, when people wait in line to get their odd-shaped boxes weighed and posted.

Postal Service finances show smaller loss, but still in trouble

The postal service will always be part of our lives, and long may it live. I’m sorry about the loss of Saturdays, which may make me feel a little more isolated on weekends at my hilltop house. But who ever thought the government existed to make us happy?

Sources tell Fox News that House and Senate negotiators are close on a possible agreement, at least on paper. Lawmakers have until Friday to finish off their work for the year.

""'Close' is a staff term,"" one senior lawmaker cautioned, suggesting it's unclear whether those drafting the bill yet have the votes.

But even if the bill comes together by the time the House is set to adjourn for the year on Friday, it represents a far cry from the kind of ""grand bargain"" congressional leaders once talked about.

The Washington Post reported that it would not include any significant tax or entitlement reforms, or seriously deal with the sequester cuts. The national debt would continue its seemingly inexorable climb.

Aides told the Post that the emerging plan would raise agency spending to just over $1 trillion for the next two fiscal years, while aiming to offset some of that spending by cutting federal worker pensions and making other modest changes.

Though lawmakers once considered a pension overhaul that would save $130 billion over a decade, aides reportedly are looking at a plan that will instead save less than $17 billion.

The Post reports that negotiators are hoping to finish off the bill in a matter of days and take it straight to the floors of the House and Senate. Lawmakers have until Jan. 15 to pass a budget bill or else risk a partial shutdown.

The budget, though, just represents one challenge facing Congress in the days ahead. While the current budget bill expires in mid-January, lawmakers have until only the end of the year to deal with several other items, including payments to doctors and long-term jobless benefits.

On top of that, several lawmakers, and President Obama, were rearranging their schedules to attend memorial services this week for the late South African leader Nelson Mandela.

Long-term unemployment aid, a prickly issue on the Hill, is expected to expire on Dec. 28 for 1.3 million workers who've been without a job for longer than six months.

President Obama used his weekly radio address on Saturday to appeal to Congress to extend it. ""Extending unemployment insurance isn't just the right thing to do for our families -- it's the smart thing to do for our economy,"" he said.

But despite threats by some Democrats to hold up the must-pass budget bill over their demand for extending jobless benefits, a top Democrat signaled Sunday that his party might not block the budget bill over the issue.

""I don't think we've reached that point where we've said this is it, take it or leave it,"" Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said on ABC's ""This Week.""

Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said the long-term benefits -- which typically kick in after 26 weeks -- are actually doing a ""disservice to these workers"" by making them less marketable to would-be employers.

Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, speaking on the same program as Durbin, said the issue should be dealt with separately, outside the budget talks.

Both Portman and Durbin, though, voiced optimism that lawmakers might reach some kind of agreement on the budget by the end of the week.

Lawmakers are also at work drafting a three-month measure to prevent a 24 percent drop in Medicare payments to doctors. The cost is estimated at about $8 billion.

And lawmakers are trying to work out at least a short-term deal over the farm bill -- an issue that could end up affecting the price of milk.

The bill itself is meant to set spending levels for farm programs and food stamps. A House measure that passed on a party-line vote calls for food stamp cuts totaling $40 billion over a decade. A Senate version, passed with bipartisan support, envisions reductions of $4 billion.

But failure to resolve the broader issues would also return the nation to a Depression-era dairy law and set in motion a chain of events that would potentially quadruple the price of a gallon of milk.

http://news.yahoo.com/critics-complain-sandy-aid-tied-other-projects-001741367--politics.html,,[],Critics complain Sandy aid tied to other projects,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Conservatives and watchdog groups are mounting a ""not-so-fast"" campaign against a $50.7 billion Superstorm Sandy aid package that Northeastern governors and lawmakers hope to push through the House this coming week.

Their complaint is that lots of the money that lawmakers are considering will actually go toward recovery efforts for past disasters and other projects unrelated to the late-October storm.

A Senate-passed version from the end of the last Congress included $150 million for what the Commerce Department described as fisheries disasters in Alaska, Mississippi and the Northeast, and $50 million in subsidies for replanting trees on private land damaged by wildfires.

The objections have led senior House Republicans to assemble their own $17 billion proposal, that when combined with already approved money for flood insurance claims, is less than half what President Barack Obama sought and the Senate passed in December

That $17 billion package will be brought to the floor by the House Appropriations Committee, and Northeast lawmakers will have a chance to add $33.7 billion more.

House Speaker John Boehner intends to let the House vote on both measures. He's responding both to conservatives who are opposed to more deficit spending, and to Govs. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., and Chris Christie, R-N.J., who are irate that the House hasn't acted sooner.

Critics are taking the sharpest aim at $12.1 billion in the amendment for Department of Housing and Urban Development emergency block grants. Any state struck by a federally declared major disaster in 2011, 2012 or this year would qualify for the grants, and that's just about all the states, said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group. Only South Carolina, Arizona and Michigan would not qualify, he said.

""That's not a bad chunk of change, particularly if you are trying to get other lawmakers to vote for the bill,"" Ellis said.

Story continues

State and local governments like block grants because they provide more flexibility in how the money is spent. The money can go toward a variety of needs, including hospitals, utilities, roads, small businesses and rent subsidies.

The Northeast lawmakers' $33.7 billion amendment also includes more than $135 million to help the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration improve weather forecasting.

""A lot of the money goes to government agencies to rebuild rather than helping people actually afflicted by Sandy,"" Ellis said.

Before getting to the aid measures, the House on Monday planned to consider legislation intended to streamline Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations that critics blame for slowing down recovery efforts. That bill would let FEMA make limited repairs instead of lease payments to provide housing that might be less expensive than traditional agency trailers.

A $60.4 billion storm aid package passed by the Senate in December included $188 million for an Amtrak expansion project with an indirect link to Sandy: Officials say that new, long-planned tunnels from New Jersey to Penn Station in Manhattan would be better protected against future flooding.

The Club for Growth, a conservative group, complained the Senate bill was overpriced, full of pork and would swell the federal deficit because other government programs weren't being cut to cover the costs of the legislation. That bill expired with the old Congress on Jan. 3. So whatever additional aid package the House passes would have to go back to the Senate for its approval.

Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, two frequent critics of government spending, tried unsuccessfully to strip the Senate version of $125 million for an Agriculture Department program to restore watersheds damaged by wildfires and drought, $2 million for roof repairs at Smithsonian Institution museums in the Washington area and the $50 million in tree planting subsidies.

McCain also targeted $15 million to repair storm-damaged NASA facilities, saying the agency had called its Sandy damage ""minimal.""

""An emergency funding bill should focus on the emergency needs of the victims, not the needs of politicians,"" said Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, the senior Republican on Senate Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security. ""Loading up a massive $60.4 billion package with unrelated projects and earmarks for other states is not the way we should use taxpayer dollars.""

Coats' scaled-back $23.8 billion Sandy aid bill was rejected by the Senate.

Republicans also criticized $13 billion in the Senate bill for projects to protect against future storms, including fortification of mass transit systems in the Northeast and building new jetties in vulnerable seaside areas. While maybe worthwhile, those projects don't represent emergencies and shouldn't be exempt from federal spending caps, GOP lawmakers said.

The basic $17 billion before the House on Tuesday is aimed at immediate Sandy recovery needs, including $5.4 billion for New York and New Jersey transit systems and $5.4 billion for FEMA's disaster aid fund. The $33.7 billion amendment would bring the total up to the more than $60 billion sought by Obama and passed by Senate Democrats.

It includes the block grants for previous disasters, weather forecasting improvements and measures to minimize damage from future storms, but not the $188 million for the Amtrak expansion project.

""We know it's going to be a heavy lift for the $33 billion, but we'll find the votes,"" said Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., whose Staten Island district was heavily damaged by Sandy.

But conservatives clearly prefer the smaller, $17 billion version. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., a frequent critic of Boehner after losing his seat on the House Budget Committee, said the Sandy aid legislation should be focused on storm-related recovery.

""Conservatives want to see a real plan that addresses real needs for Sandy,"" he said.

Obama has signed a $9.7 billion replenishment of the national flood insurance fund to help pay claims from 115,000 homeowners, businesses and renters.

FEMA has spent more than $2 billion in disaster relief money for shelter, restoring power and other immediate needs arising from Sandy. The Oct. 29 storm that pounded the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina to Maine with hurricane-force winds and coastal flooding. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were the hardest hit."

The GOP measures had little chance of gaining enough Democratic support to reach the 60-vote supermajority hurdle, but they did serve to release some of the pent-up frustration among Republican senators over the bill that will allow the $16.4-trillion debt limit to be raised to continue paying the nation’s bills through May.

The final bill was approved 64 to 34.

Obama is expected to swiftly sign the legislation as lawmakers gear up for the next budget showdown: deep automatic spending cuts that will begin to hit the economy March 1 if nothing is done to stop them.

QUIZ: Test your knowledge about the debt limit

The $1.2 trillion in cuts had once been considered so severe they would force Congress to the negotiating table to devise an alternative deficit-reduction strategy.

But with a month to go before the cuts begin, Congress appears unable to reach a compromise over tax and spending alternatives.

The debt-ceiling legislation will suspend the borrowing authority limit through May 19, even though the Treasury Department would be expected to continue paying the nation’s bills with so-called extraordinary measures through summer.

Another $450 billion in debt is expected to be amassed in that time as the nation’s already accrued bills are paid, pushing the debt load to nearly $17 trillion.

Republicans have been grumbling since House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) engineered passage of the debt-ceiling bill in that chamber last week, complaining that they gave up an opportunity to extract spending reductions from the White House.

To attract GOP support, Boehner tacked on a provision that would withhold lawmakers’ pay if the House or Senate fails to approve a budget for the coming 2014 fiscal year.

Boehner wanted to avoid the potential of a risky credit default if the debt limit was not raised, while pushing on to the next budget fight.

After all, it was the housing market that triggered the financial crisis, and the vast proliferation of low-quality loans that had fueled the housing bubble. But politics delayed those reforms, and now the president is reopening the issue with a call to wind down the two main federal mortgage agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “For too long, these companies were allowed to make big profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag,” the president said this week. “It was ‘heads we win, tails you lose.’”

Well, not entirely. The U.S. government and taxpayers did rescue these agencies in 2009 (to the tune of nearly $200 billion), and, after injecting them with capital and essentially nationalizing them, these companies started to turn a profit as the housing market slowly recovered. This month, they contributed more than $15 billion to the U.S. Treasury, and have been one factor in sharply reducing government deficits.

Even more, Obama’s targeting of Fannie and Freddie is part of a larger narrative — on both the left and the right — that banks and government colluded to produce the financial crisis and the continuing drag on the United States. To be fair, Obama in the same speech this week acknowledged that much of the housing crisis was the product of “banks and the government…[making] everyone feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren’t ready and didn’t have the payment.” But that chord is a decidedly minor one in a general atmosphere of blame.

Over the past decade, we have collectively spun a story of the financial crisis. It goes something like this: in the 2000s, government regulation of the financial system loosened as large banks, in collusion with free-market ideologues in government, convinced regulators that risk was a thing of the past. They then took advantage of easy money and lax regulation and began to push mortgages to speculators and low-credit individuals, who bought homes they couldn’t afford. Those mortgages were then packaged and used as the fodder for financial derivatives, which turned bad loans into a global crisis. Meanwhile, millions of people lost homes and jobs; the government spent hundreds of billions to bail out the banks, and those millions of citizens were left with shattered credit, no employment, and fractured communities such as Detroit.

There is much that is true in this story. Its basic contours were repeated this week in the Justice Department case against Bank of America over lax lending practices in 2008. And Fannie and Freddie, independent agencies backed by the government, were the linchpins, buying up those mortgages and providing a seemingly endless backstop.

What’s missing from the story is crucial, however. Obama alluded to it in his speech, but he buried the details. Often neglected is the degree to which so many felt that they needed to own a home. That wasn’t created by banks and government, even though it was encouraged. The “ownership society” had been touted not just by President Bush in the 2000s, but by Clinton, Reagan, and by Americans of all parties and ideologies since the founding of the republic. There is nothing more “Jeffersonian” than owning your own land and home (and slaves…but that is another issue). The United States pulled immigrants in part because of the availability of land and the promise of independence that owning land afforded. Freed slaves after the Civil War were promised — though not actually granted — “40 acres and a mule” because having land was seen as a necessary component to liberty and freedom.

After World War II, agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration along with other New Deal creations such as Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) spurred more widespread home ownership, with returning GIs both swarming into colleges and then into vast new housing developments in the suburbs. Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), founded in 1970, was meant to augment that process with even more quasi-government intervention in the mortgage market, with the goal of reducing the risk local banks might incur in making new home loans.

These programs then combined with banks to produce the increase in home ownership, from 62 percent in the 1950s to almost 70 percent in the 2000s. The programs worked not because the docile masses were convinced to own homes but because the drive to have a home is deeply embedded in American culture (and many other cultures as well). Government and banks facilitated the realization of these desires, but it is beyond a stretch to claim that they created those desires. They stoked them, and often took advantage of them, but they did not implant and create them.

That part of the story is sadly, thought understandably, overlooked and underplayed. Targeting government ineptitude and Wall Street greed is a far better sell politically, and a better sell for the media, than speaking of collective responsibility for our dreams trumping our means. Aiming for a home, holding that as a goal, and living in a society that allows for the potential to meet it are powerful and productive fuels. But succumbing to the easy lure of a promise too good to be true, which was what many of those mortgages in the 2000s were, required multiple breakdowns, one of which is individual desire clouding judgment.

The easy story of what happened over the past years is now in danger of becoming a set “truth.” It is so often repeated that it often goes unquestioned. But while that story has much to offer, it entirely elides how our individual desires, combined with a long history driving us toward the supreme value of owning a home, were vital ingredients in our recent fate. That story also infantilizes “the American people” by suggesting that so many of us were dupes and rubes, easily manipulated by government and business into making bad choices.

Blaming venal banks and inept government will not transform our system, however satisfying it may feel. Shuttering Fannie and Freddie will not force a shift in people’s desires, though it will make it harder for banks to prey on those desires. Ending the government guarantee of mortgages via these agencies will lead to tighter credit standards, and hence less access to credit for those less well-off. That may be for the best, but it is hard to see that not generating backlash. Rather than unwinding these agencies, we should focus on those lending standards, and when they should be relaxed and when not.

Overall, we would be better served by understanding that many of the struggles of recent years stem from a mismatch between what we dream of and what this system is currently able to provide. Some of the gap is due to bad regulation, Wall Street greed, and speculation. Much of it, however, is due to a radical change in our economies that has upended 20th century industries and jobs and continues to do so. Responding to that change and recalibrating our expectations without giving up our dreams — that is where our focus should be, and must be."

(CNN) —

For most Americans, the budget debate in Washington is reaching dog-whistle pitch, a tone that only partisans can hear. Which, as far as I am concerned, is a mercy.

Paul Ryan offered his budget on Tuesday. Let’s do give him props for making the effort and all. The vast majority of his colleagues are potted plants on this front, reading talking points, sometimes banging the table and doing precious little else. But what Ryan calls a budget is what any CEO would call a firing offense. It uses some numbers and some words that appear in real budgets. But it neglects some other key elements … like arithmetic or the truth or a greater economic purpose.

The Ryan budget depends entirely on unspecified tax reforms and the replacement of revenues he doesn’t care for (such as those associated with Obamacare) with others he doesn’t care to actually define or describe. The rigorous, widely respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities slammed the exercise, taking Ryan to task for failing to live up to his billing as the guy courageous enough to put his ideas out there.

David Rothkopf

It wrote, “Is it courageous to propose tax cuts but not identify a single tax expenditure to rein in? Is it courageous to target your deepest cuts on the poorest Americans, who vote in lower numbers and provide little in campaign contributions? Is it courageous to camouflage hundreds of billions in cuts for the poor and disadvantaged in broad budget categories without identifying the programmatic cuts, so that analysts, journalists, and other policymakers can’t identify the specific cuts and assess their impacts?”

Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, we have a real sign of the End Times: Senate Democrats have actually come out with a budget for the first time since the iPad was invented. There are children in school, reading, who were born since their last budget.

Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray unveiled it Wednesday. Her budget is as partisan as Ryan’s and offers little common ground with his on controversial issues. It calls for $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction through the end of the decade, almost $1 trillion of it from new revenues.

Ryan calls the divergent plans the beginning of a process. The question is where that process will lead.

Early next month, the president will submit the budget he was supposed to have sent to the Hill in February. There it will sit, because it too is just a negotiating ploy, an opening bid.

These compilations of charts and data are not budgets at all. They are just props in the Budget Follies of 2013. Not one of the long-term visions sketched out in these plans will actually be realized. There will be no serious discussion or honest debate about enacting meaningful tax reform, rethinking defense spending or remaking our entitlement system for a world in which people generally live longer and in which government resources are stretched.

But, frankly, these aren’t even the most critical issues we should be addressing.

The budget is important. Cutting our deficits matters. But in a country in which corporate profits and the stock market are at record highs but in which jobs are being created far too slowly and median incomes are sagging, we have far more basic issues to grapple with.

The United States is like a business whose model for making revenue is failing, trying to save itself by cutting down on travel expenditures and the cost of making photocopies. Sure, we shouldn’t overspend. But if we don’t figure out what business we’re in – what new industries will create tomorrow’s jobs, what kind of new workers we’ll need, what kind of infrastructure we must have to be competitive and attract investment – our deficit problems will seem minor compared with our social and political concerns.

Our most important national discussion should not be about spending but about investment. We need to recognize that some federal programs help grow the economy and weigh the return on investment we will get from these and which are essential to growing the new industries that will be the employers of tomorrow … and will provide the growth that is the only real solution to our debt issues.

The Ryan budget cuts transportation spending in a country that has neglected its highways and bridges for over half a century. It doesn’t plan for the infrastructure spending we will need to respond to the consequences of climate change (like hurricane relief) or anticipate the investment we could make to avoid such problems in the first place. It doesn’t discuss how to expand information technology and next-generation energy infrastructure as we must.

Perhaps the Senate budget or the president’s will be wiser about investing – although neither is likely to think big enough about transport spending or an infrastructure bank or, better, a network of regional infrastructure finance institutions. What seems more likely, sadly, is more hollow gestures, scurrying to avoid artificial deadlines and visionless crisis management. Not one leader has emerged in Washington who is providing anything truly different that cuts to the core questions we face or rises to the true challenge of our times.

Which leaves us but one consolation. Washington has grown so shrill that most of this empty debate will be heard only by our dogs. Pity the dogs.

The federal government is in the third week of a shutdown while Congress worked out a deal to fund its operations and to avoid a possible default because of the debt limit.

Meanwhile, furloughed federal workers express their displeasure as the government shutdown seemed to be headed for a third week.

Meanwhile, furloughed federal workers express their displeasure as the government shutdown seemed to be headed for a third week.

Even for a Congress where griping is endemic and insults routine, spirits were especially dark on Saturday.

For a legislative body that takes six weeks for its August break, the third consecutive working Saturday without any solution to the crises in sight meant short tempers and foul moods.

Most vocal in their bitterness were House Republicans, who voted midday and then left Washington until Monday, sputtering as they went that President Obama had halted talks with their leaders in favor of negotiating with Senate Republicans — and even angrier that their Senate colleagues seemed receptive to the president’s overture.

“They’re trying to cut the House out, and trying to jam us with the Senate. We’re not going to roll over and take that,” said House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).

Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.), not generally considered one of the House’s bomb-throwers, advised Republicans in the Senate to “grow a backbone and stand up with the House Republicans, like they said they were going to.”

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) addressed the shutdown during a press conference on Capitol Hill on Saturday, saying Susan Collins's plan to end the shutdown and extend the debt ceiling is ""not going to go any place."" (AP)

Senate Republicans were likewise fed up with their House colleagues, for refusing to accept that they will not win major changes to the federal health-care law and that their party’s leverage only decreases as the shutdown drags and default approaches.

“Our friends in the House apparently can’t muster the votes to send something over here to open up the government, so it’s dysfunction at every level,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).

Several rounds of past budget fights have ended with Senate Republicans forging agreement with Senate Democrats and then shoving it over to the House to be adopted on a bipartisan vote, over the objections of the GOP’s most conservative members.

Republicans in both chambers appeared to be bracing for a repeat of that outcome, which would solve the current crisis but only deepen mistrust between Republicans in the Senate and in the House.

But the ill will was broadly shared.

In the House, a Republican aide accused a leading Democrat of a physical confrontation with another GOP aide on the floor the House. The congressman acknowledged a heated exchange but denied jabbing the man in the chest.

In the Senate, a bipartisan proposal to end the shutdown and raise the debt ceiling written by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) provided a glimmer of hope Friday. It was declared dead a day later.

Senate Democrats emerged grim-faced from a 90-minute, closed-door meeting where leaders briefed them on nascent talks underway between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in place of the Collins proposal, which ran aground amid Democratic opposition.

“Adults will get in the room sooner or later,” said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), exiting the meeting early.

Manchin had backed Collins’s proposal, which would have funded the government at current levels for six months and raise the debt limit through the end of January. It would have required the House and Senate to enter broader budget negotiations but left in place the deep across-the-board cuts known as the sequester while they talked.

An aide said other Democrats, who had opposed Collins’s proposal because it would have left the sequester untouched, had been growing annoyed with their own leadership late Friday and Saturday morning, as rumors spread that a deal was being forged around its tenets before they had been briefed about it.

“The key to this place is communication, even if there’s nothing to say,” the Democratic aide said. “If members feel like they’re being kept out of the loop, they get upset.”

Likewise, in the House, Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) had a raised-voice hallway confrontation with a member of his leadership in clear view of reporters, demanding to know how House leaders plan to resolve the stalemate.

“If Eric Cantor and John Boehner can’t answer the questions ‘what are we fighting for’ — that’s not good!” Rigell told Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), the House’s fourth-ranking Republican.

Rigell has been one of the leading Republican voices urging the GOP to pass a measure to reopen the government, even without getting significant changes to the Affordable Care Act in return.

“We’re on the same page, but we need to be able to articulate specific objectives,” he continued, jabbing his finger in the air to make the point, before an aide came over to suggest that the two continue the conversation in private.

But the low point of the day came when a spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) accused Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) of having a physical altercation with another Cantor aide on the House floor.

Crowley denied touching the aide during the incident, which came after Republicans shut down an attempt by Democrats to lodge repeated requests for the chamber to consider a bill to reopen the government without any conditions.

“He had come to our side and was yelling across the aisles that they were shutting down the debate and pulling the bill,” Crowley told reporters shortly after the incident.

“I said to him then, the staffer is shutting down democracy! And he said, ‘That’s right,’ ” Crowley said.

Crowley said it was the aide who was out of line and who in fact apologized for his conduct after the encounter. A Cantor spokesman said later that all sides had spoken and resolved the matter.

Talks were expected to continue in the Senate through Sunday, where several members expressed hope that a breakthrough was not far off — always darkest before the dawn, and all that.

“There’s good discussion going,” said Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.), generally one of the chamber’s sunniest members. “I see us getting there, in fits and starts.”

But, he conceded: “I think people are pretty tired and haggard.”

Previously']",Obama budget would cut entitlements in exchange for tax increases,"President Obama will propose a budget next week that embraces a risky strategy of courting Republicans for a grand bargain on the debt while angering Democratic allies with cuts to the nation’s entitlement programs.

White House officials said Friday that Obama’s budget would cut Medicare and Social Security and ask for less tax revenue than he has previously sought. The budget, to be released Wednesday, will fully incorporate the offer Obama made to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) during December’s “fiscal cliff” talks — which included $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction through spending cuts and tax increases.

On Friday, liberals expressed outrage that a freshly reelected president would concede so much. Some of Obama’s allies said they were concerned that he was making a strategic mistake. Yet the president’s aides said he was intent on showing that he was not backing away from the compromise he had offered.

“The budget reflects his priorities within a budget world that is not ideal,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said. “It requires compromise, negotiation and a willingness to accept that you won’t get 100 percent of what you want.”

The budget will break with the president’s tradition of providing a sweeping vision of his ideal spending priorities, untethered from political realities. But the spirit of compromise did not win Obama much immediate support, as Republicans and Democrats questioned whether it would lead to an agreement.

Boehner accused Obama of holding entitlement cuts “hostage” in an effort to win support for more tax increases, despite warnings from congressional Republicans not to do so.

“That’s no way to lead and move the country forward,” Boehner said.

But some of the most heated commentary came from the left, which was furious that the president was enshrining cuts to Social Security as official administration policy. Obama proposed changing the cost-of-living calculation for Social Security in a way that will reduce benefits for most recipients, a key Republican request that he had earlier embraced only as part of a compromise.

“I am terribly disappointed and will do everything in my power to block President Obama’s proposal to cut benefits for Social Security recipients,” said Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with the Democrats. “I remember when Obama said he was concerned about retirees struggling to get by and was unequivocal in his opposition to cutting cost-of-living adjustments.”

Overall, the budget request reflects Obama’s stark shift in strategy over the past month, as he has adopted a far more congenial posture toward the opposition. He has begun a charm offensive, reaching out to rank-and-file House and Senate Republicans, dining and speaking privately with them. Obama is set to have dinner with a group of Republicans on Wednesday night, just hours after his budget is released.

Obama’s aides have not been overly optimistic about the prospects for a deal. But they now argue that a strategy of private outreach, coupled with public events, offers the best path for progress not only on the deficit but also on other issues, including immigration and gun control. The White House says the concessions in Obama’s budget should not be viewed as a list of options but rather as a cohesive package.

Obama decided to incorporate the approach he had offered Boehner after a debate among his advisers and allies on Capitol Hill, according to people familiar with the discussions. Some worried that the White House was giving away concessions before Republicans agreed to make some of their own.

“I have some tactical concerns about the White House approach and some substantive concerns,” said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee and a White House ally in pursuit of a broad budget deal.

“The president has essentially said this is his end point and this is a compromise proposal,” Van Hollen said. “Republicans have rejected this as a compromise. From the Republican perspective, the president’s budget is the starting point for negotiation.”

White House officials say Obama felt that, as president, it was important he stand by his original offer and include it in his budget proposal.

“We want to make clear that it’s something that we’re willing to do. To not put it in [the budget] would be a conversation disconnected with reality,” a senior White House official said. Failing to do so, the official said, would have provoked howls from Republicans that “you moved the goal posts.”

Officials also pointed out that the president’s budget goes beyond the Boehner offer. Obama’s budget would fund several new priorities, including the creation of a program offering preschool to all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income backgrounds.

Officials proposed an increase in tobacco taxes to pay for the early childhood education initiative and would also seek to generate revenue by limiting how much wealthy individuals can accrue in their tax-protected retirement accounts. Such accounts would be capped at $3 million in 2013 dollars — which officials say is enough to finance a $205,000-a-year income. The president would also seek to scrap a loophole in the law that lets people collect both unemployment insurance and disability payments — so called double-dipping.

The budget request comes on top of a deal struck at the start of the year to raise taxes on the wealthy by more than $600 billion over a decade.

Through that pact and earlier agreements, Congress and Obama have agreed to reduce the annual budget deficit — how much more the government spends than it collects — by $2.5 trillion over the next decade. If left in place, the deep spending cuts that took effect March 1, known as sequestration, would reduce the deficit by an additional $1.2 trillion over the same period. That would be just about enough to keep deficits from rising and to stabilize the debt, as measured as a percentage of the overall economy.

But Obama’s budget proposal would eliminate sequestration and replace it with a variety of other deficit-reduction measures, together worth $1.8 trillion, according to White House estimates.

The deficit, which is projected this year to be equal to 5.5 percent of the size of the economy, would shrink to 1.7 percent of the economy by 2023. By comparison, the House Republican budget — which would curtail spending on dozens of programs for the poor, repeal Obama’s health-care law and partially privatize Medicare for people now younger than 55 — aims to eliminate the deficit by 2023. A more liberal plan passed by Senate Democrats would make the deficit 2.2 percent of the size of the economy by that point.

The budget is more conservative than Obama’s earlier proposals, which called for $1.6 trillion in new taxes and fewer cuts to health and domestic spending programs. Obama is seeking to raise $580 billion in tax revenue by limiting deductions for the wealthy and closing loopholes for certain industries such as oil and gas.

The budget proposal slices $200 billion from already- tight defense and domestic budgets. It would cut $400 billion from Medicare and other health programs by negotiating better prescription drug prices and asking wealthy seniors to pay more, among other policies. It would also generate $200 billion in savings by scaling back farm subsidies and federal retiree programs, among other proposals.

The proposal to change the formula to calculate Social Security payments, also originally part of the offer to Boehner, would generate $130 billion in savings and $100 billion in revenue, a result of the impact of the change on other government programs.

Obama is submitting his budget two months late, after aides scrambled to deal with the end-of-year “fiscal cliff” and then the March 1 deadline for sequestration. With the House and the Senate having passed dueling budget proposals, both sides will see whether they can find a compromise.

Two upcoming debates will provide opportunities. This summer, Congress will once again be forced to raise the federal debt ceiling or risk a default on the national debt. Republicans in February decided not to mount a fight over the debt ceiling, as they had in 2011, and it is not yet clear whether they will oppose an increase this time. In addition, Congress and the White House will have to agree to a new budget plan at the end of September.

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: America is not in decline or retreat,"We are about to have a major foreign policy debate in the guise of a confirmation battle over Chuck Hagel’s nomination as secretary of defense and the related argument over how long American troops should stay in Afghanistan. President Obama should use this opportunity to stand up for his broader vision of how American power can be sustained and used, even if that doesn’t come naturally to a pragmatist who likes making decisions one at a time.

Underlying this clash will be another over whether the United States is in long-term decline. We are not, and the decline discussion should not scare us. We seem to have it every few decades.

We had it in 1960 when John F. Kennedy promised to “get the country moving again.” We had it in 1980 after Vietnam, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the taking of American hostages in Iran. Ronald Reagan pledged to “make America great again.”

And in 2008, with China rising, our country bogged down in a dispiriting war in Iraq and an economy in free-fall, Obama came along touting “hope” and “change we can believe in.” The operative verb was “believe,” and in 2012, Mitt Romney paid Obama the compliment of using the very same word in his “Believe in America” slogan. We desperately want to believe in ourselves.

Obama’s harshest critics are essentially charging that he has accepted American decline. They are convinced he wants to pull back from the world and slash the Pentagon budget to make room for more domestic spending. He’s often accused of making the Western European choice: less for the military, more for the welfare state. Hagel, a critic of Pentagon bloat and of America’s engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, is seen as Obama’s nominally Republican agent in achieving this transformation.

Let’s look first at the partial truths embodied in a critique that otherwise misreads Obama’s intentions.

The president always considered our intervention in Iraq a distracting mistake. Most Americans are happy our troops are out. He’s been far more ambivalent about Afghanistan, for political as well as substantive reasons. Like many Democrats, he saw the war in Afghanistan as justified by the events of Sept. 11, 2001, in a way Iraq was not. But time and conditions on the ground have convinced him that there are limits to what the United States can accomplish there. He’s trying to extract our troops in a careful but expeditious way. He has been reluctant to commit to large-scale public action in Syria on the grounds of prudence: The calculus of costs and benefits is not at all clear to him or to his advisers.

In the meantime, he is reorienting our foreign policy toward a surging Asia and concentrating on rebuilding the American economy. (We also should be paying more attention to Latin America, but that’s another story.) The appointments of Hagel and of John Kerry as secretary of state could have the additional benefit of strengthening our ties to Europe. The personal histories of both, as Financial Times columnist Philip Stevens observed last week, show they have “Atlanticism in their blood.”

None of this is about retreat, decline or isolationism. It’s an approach rooted in realism about the true sources of American power and the urgency of getting our domestic and economic act together. It’s the view reflected in the well-chosen title of a forthcoming book by Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a quintessential realist: “Foreign Policy Begins at Home: The Case for Putting America’s House in Order.”

Haass is a Republican and has his differences with Obama, but this only underscores the quiet consensus that’s developing around what our priorities must be now. Preserving America’s influence abroad depends on first restoring economic growth, upward mobility, fiscal stability and enhanced social solidarity at home. This will require a somewhat leaner defense budget for a time, but the idea that Obama will slash it indiscriminately is absurd.

The declinists are wrong because they underestimate the resilience of the American economy, the magnetism of our culture, the continuing appeal of the democratic idea and the difficulties our competitors, particularly China, confront.

Only our rancid domestic politics stands in our way, and getting beyond our divisions requires Obama to build support for the consensus that’s waiting to be born. That’s why he should not shrink from a broad debate about our purposes in the world. He should welcome it, and join it.

By refusing to negotiate with the union regarding pay and working conditions, and hiring replacements (i.e., scabs) to take their jobs, he set the stage for the ongoing eradication of unions and the working middle class. As The New York Times noted in 2011:

More than any other labor dispute of the past three decades, Reagan’s confrontation with the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, or Patco, undermined the bargaining power of American workers and their labor unions. It also polarized our politics in ways that prevent us from addressing the root of our economic troubles: the continuing stagnation of incomes despite rising corporate profits and worker productivity. By firing those who refused to heed his warning, and breaking their union, Reagan took a considerable risk. Even his closest advisers worried that a major air disaster might result from the wholesale replacement of striking controllers. Air travel was significantly curtailed, and it took several years and billions of dollars (much more than Patco had demanded) to return the system to its pre-strike levels. [...] By 2010, the number of workers participating in walkouts was less than 2 percent of what it had been when Reagan led the actors’ strike in 1952. Lacking the leverage that strikes once provided, unions have been unable to pressure employers to increase wages as productivity rises. Inequality has ballooned to a level not seen since Reagan’s boyhood in the 1920s.

This event was and is rightfully considered a watershed moment in the Republican Party's attempts to destroy unions and the union movement. Since Reagan took on PATCO, unions have seen their membership number decline precipitously, and most working class Americans have seen their wages and salaries stagnant, even as the individuals (CEO's, Senior executives, and people like Mitt Romney and his former firm Bain Capital) who control major corporations and industries have seen their pay and income soar to levels once though unimaginable.

What many may not know, however, is that Ronald Reagan in the last days of the 1980 election campaign, sent a letter to the President of PATCO, Robert E. Poli, promising he understood the many numerous concerns air traffic controller had with their pay, outmoded equipment and working conditions. Specifically, he promised to provide them with the most up-to-date equipment and to work with them to provide more staffing and less brutal work schedules in the interest of public safety. Here's a image of Reagan's letter to Pioli, dated October 20, 1980:

For those having difficulty reading the content of that letter from the image, here is a transcription of the text in full:

Dear Mr. Poli: I have been briefed by members of my staff as to the deplorable state of our nation's air traffic control system. They have told me that too few people working unreasonable hours with obsolete equipment has placed the nation's air travelers in unwarranted danger. In an area so clearly related to public policy the Carter administration has failed to act responsibly. You can rest assured that if I am elected president, I will take whatever steps are necessary to provide our air traffic controllers with the most modern equipment available and to adjust staff levels and work days so that they are commensurate with achieving a maximum degree of public safety. As in all other areas of the federal government where the President has the power to appoint, I fully intend to appoint highly qualified individuals who can work harmoniously with Congress and the employees of the governmental agencies they oversee. I pledge to you that my administration will work very closely with you to bring about a spirit of cooperation between the president and the air traffic controllers. Such harmony can and must exist of we are to restore the people's confidence in their government. Sincerely, Ronald Reagan

[N]ewly elected PATCO president Robert Poli—who’d succeeded the more irenic incumbent John Leyden in a surprise insurgent challenge—was keen to demonstrate his clout before the union’s restive rank and file. He presumed to be bargaining from a position of strength because during the run-up to contract negotiations, PATCO had sought to secure firm Washington backing with another surprise move: it endorsed Reagan in the 1980 election, partly as a matter of heeding the shifting national mood, and partly out of sheer exasperation with the Carter administration’s handling of key controller concerns.

Based in part on this this letter Poli and other senior PATCO officials had PATCO endorse Reagan for President. PATCO was one of only four AFL-CIO affiliated unions to endorse Reagan over Carter.

Never has a Union leader made a more serious mistake in judgment. The Reagan appointed head of the FAA failed to negotiate in goof faith, reacting to PATCO's demand for pay raises, improved equipment and less arduous working hours with a counteroffer equal to approximately 1/7 of the cost of the union's offer. Poli accepted the offer, but did so with little enthusiasm. Reagan had doubled crossed him and put his position with PATCO's membership at risk. The administration's hard line only encouraged those at PATCO to strike, which was Reagan's goal all along.

He immediately invoked the Taft-Hartley act and fired all the striking air controllers on August 5, 1981, a total exceeding 11,000. Reagan then hired 5.500 scabs as the FAA head, Drew Lewis claimed that there had been a ""surplus of controllers."" The FAA also reduced flights by 25% and also brought in 370 military controllers. Though the FAA promised to have staffing levels up to pre-1981 levels within two years, in fact it took almost a decade before those levels were again achieved. This was due partly to Reagan's ban on rehiring any of the fired PATCO controllers.

Reagan never had any intention of working with the union. This can be best demonstrated by the fact that in February, the Reagan Department of Justice, aided by the FAA, had complied a list of air traffic controllers to arrested and prosecuted in the event of a strike. One Federal District Judge in Denver threw out all the criminal indictments against local PATCO officials, labeling the Reagan DOJ's actions as creating a ""hit list"" at a time when the government was supposed to be negotiating with the union in ""good faith.""

Today, of course, the Republican candidates feel free to openly demonize unions and seek to destroy the right to collectively bargain. We've seen the actions of Republican governors elected in 2010 as proof of that. The nation's political landscape is vastly changed by what Reagan accomplished in his showdown with PATCO. Reagan gambled that he could get away with his lies back then, and he succeeded. Now Republicans can lie on a daily basis and no one in the media even bothers to check the claims they make, the numerous falsehoods and prevarications they promulgate. Now the unions are shrinking, and they more often than not refuse to strike our of fear. Now Democrats govern as 1990's era Republicans, catering far to often to the wealthy elites and multinational corporations and failing to support unions.

And it all started with Ronnie Reagan's sweet little lie to the air traffic controllers. He wasn't concerned about the safety of air travel. He wasn't willing to work with PATCO to improve working conditions or modernize our air traffic control system. He wanted an easy target to make the case that unions are bad for America, and he hoodwinked PATCO into believing he would act honorably and treat them fairly. He lied, and we have been paying the price for it ever since."

WASHINGTON -- Despite the tough rhetoric from President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) about respective refusals to negotiate, there is talk that a way out of the government shutdown and debt ceiling deadline could include a bargain of sorts -- even if it isn't exactly grand.

One Republican lawmaker walked a group of reporters through how this might happen on Thursday afternoon, and said that he thinks a deal will be reached by the Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling.

""I think we'll avoid default. I think we'll stumble toward a larger deal that will continue to narrow the deficit,"" said the lawmaker. ""I don't think it will be as grand as the grand bargain.""

In short, the GOP member, who spoke on the condition he not be quoted by name in order to speak more frankly, said during an hour talk that members of his party might be willing to vote to end some or all of the sequester, in exchange for changes to Social Security and Medicare.

The sequester was the result of the last budget showdown, and it cut discretionary spending across the board. Because neither party is happy with the sequester cuts, they could become another key bargaining chip in a deal to pass a funding bill and end the government shutdown. Republicans could possibly seek the changes to entitlement spending, and in turn vote to restore funding in other areas -- all within negotiations over a deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.

""Sequester is a very blunt instrument,"" the GOP member said. ""It's a pretty common view among Republicans that we've done way too much. So some of the spending can be restored. ... Then the president's going to get some of what he wants, for domestic initiatives, Head Start and whatever.""

The lawmaker said non-discretionary spending, or mandatory spending that's locked in each year and not appropriated by Congress, could ""hold the savings of the sequester,"" while Republicans could ""let the belt out a couple notches on the discretionary side of the budget.""

The changes the GOP is aiming for, he said, would include ""at least chained CPI and at least means testing."" In other words, a different measure of inflation would be used to calculate Social Security benefits, leading to lower increases over time, and lower-income Americans would receive more generous Social Security and Medicare benefits than those in high-income brackets.

One Democratic congressional source noted that Obama has signaled in the past -- including in his budget this year -- that he is willing to support using chained CPI. And a Republican leadership aide said this week that Republican hopes for a deal are based in part on their understanding that Obama wants very badly to get rid of the sequester cuts.

The Democratic source laid out a way a deal could proceed so that the president could claim to have won a ""clean"" government funding bill and a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase, but changes to the sequester and entitlements would be tied to these actions.

""The political appeal of this kind of approach ... is that it offers each party a way out of the corner it’s in,"" wrote conservative policy expert Yuval Levin, editor of National Affairs and an informal adviser to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), in National Review Online. Levin laid out in detail how a deal such as the one described by the Republican lawmaker to reporters would work.

The Republican member said that if a such a deal is reached, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) can move forward even if his right flank in the House, and tea party lawmakers in the Senate like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), oppose it.

""If it's a real bargain and the president and the speaker come to the deal, that way you make the left wing and the right wing irrelevant, because deals have votes from both sides,"" he said.

""The irony of this is that the guys who got us into this mess won't be there to cut the deal that gets us out. And they will attack the people that actually come to the deal, and profit by it politically,"" he said. ""This is more about political position for a few members. For most of them I don't question their motives.""

As for Cruz, the GOP lawmaker said: ""I tell you one thing: He's never played team sports in his life.""

Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion. He heads the section’s Change the List project, which focuses on human rights and social justice. E-mail him at CTL@CNN.com.

Here’s one from the obvious file: There’s no “magic wand” that – poof! – creates jobs in the United States, or anywhere else.

In response to my column this week on long-term unemployment, some of you commented that the president doesn’t have superpowers to create jobs for the rest of us. Or you pointed out that he should be part in the process – but job-creation is actually something Congress or business leaders should take on instead.

I thought those were great points.

Here’s my favorite comment – mostly because it uses the term “pea brain” (and yes, it’s in reference to me, but you’ve gotta love a nerdy insult, especially when it includes a vegetable):

John D. Sutter

“Are you so stupid that you think the President just waves his magic wand and jobs are created? Let me give you a lesson in government Sutter. Maybe your pathetic conservative pea brain will be able to grasp one fact: The President proposes and Congress legislates. So it is the Republican Congress that is keeping that poor woman unemployed. They have done nothing to aleviate (sic) her plight …”

The “poor woman” the commenter, who used the screen name “tom sellier,” referenced is Kim Peters, an unemployed mom who invited me into her home Tuesday to watch the State of the Union. Overall, Peters, who has been unemployed on and off for five years, didn’t take much comfort from the speech. She’s more worried about keeping a roof over her head.

Some of the most cutting things Peters had to say focused on House Speaker John Boehner, whose apparent indifference toward the State of the Union – scowling, licking his lips, looking very “get me outta here” – made her angry. Her point of view, and I think there is some merit to this, is that President Obama wants to promote infrastructure projects and other “stimulus” efforts that would create jobs, but Republicans are so focused on the deficit they won’t consider spending money on that.

She wasn’t thrilled with everything Obama said either.

Drafting public policy that will create jobs and put people back to work is a tricky thing. That’s part of the reason I argued the first and easiest thing we all can do to help the long-term unemployed is to treat them as equal humans.

Currently, they’re some of the most maligned people in our society.

Companies put out ads saying they only will consider employed candidates. Recruiters toss their resumes before taking a look. Generally, I think the national sentiment is that unemployed people must have done something wrong to end up jobless.

As a person who’s been laid off before, I can tell you that’s not always the case. It’s unfair to give unemployed people less of a chance at getting back on their feet. If anything, I think they deserve more consideration. It’s the fair thing to do.

Other readers said getting a job is an individual’s responsibility.

“I’ve been unemployed and it sucks … BUT you do whatever you have to to get work you dig ditches, you wash dishes, empty trash, you may even have to move your home,” wrote mikemc58. “Point is you have to think outside the box and get out of your comfort zone. Wishes and dreams aren’t going to do it. Get off your butt hit the streets everyday asking, looking, volunteering, for a job. And listening to Obama drone on about how good the economy is useless, because as we all know, ‘we’ who live in the REAL world know it’s NOT. GOV is not the answer, personal responsibility and self motivation is the key to finding new work.”

That’s another fair point, although I think individual effort only goes so far when there are 3.4 unemployed workers for every job opening in the United States in December, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And it’s important to empathize with people who become stuck in a cycle of hopelessness and depression the longer their unemployment continues. That’s not an easy cycle to break.

One more thing to bring up about the comments: While many of you wrote in to ask how you can help long-term unemployed people get back on their feet, several of you attacked Peters – criticizing her ownership of a TV, saying she shouldn’t have cable if she doesn’t have a job (she actually doesn’t have cable, but that’s beside the point) and speculating about what type of cell phone she uses.

What silliness, right? And it speaks to the underlying problem here: We’re inclined to attack unemployed people – to judge their financial situations and to speculate about what might have put them out of work. That’s unhelpful. And discriminatory.

Peters, the woman I featured, told me that ending ignorance will help end unemployment. Government and business leaders must help, too. But I think she’s right: a simple shift in attitude – trading ignorance for empathy – can and will make a huge difference.

And not one — not one — senior executive at any Wall Street bank has seen jail time for his role in the financial crisis, five years later. Less than a month before the White House tried to pretend too big to fail was no longer an issue, Attorney General Eric Holder admitted at a Senate hearing that some banks are too big to prosecute effectively. How can anyone have faith in the American judicial system as long as there is one rule for big banks and another for everyone else?"

D. Palmer, the director of external affairs for the California Department of Finance. “We don’t believe it is prudent to budget on the capital gains. It wasn’t that long ago when we had the same experience during the dot-com boom. We don’t want to see that movie again.”

In one particularly revealing moment, the office of the independent legislative analyst — which has a history of scolding governors for unrealistically optimistic budget projections — dismissed Mr. Brown’s figure as pessimistic, saying extra revenue was closer to $4.4 billion. The report undercut Mr. Brown just as he and lawmakers moved into the final stages of budget negotiations, and it empowered Democrats and social service advocates eager to reverse budget cuts.

“I support the governor’s call to pay down more debt aggressively, I support the notion of a rainy-day fund,” said Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tem of the Senate. “But I also believe that we have an obligation to make some limited but important investments in restoring some of what has been lost over the last four or five years.”

Vanessa Aramayo, the director of California Partnership, a group of organizations pushing for social service spending, said Mr. Brown was deliberately understating the state’s financial health.

“The governor is attempting to leave a legacy of solving our state budget crisis,” she said. “But he’s doing so on the backs of poor people in the state.”

Other Democrats said the Legislature should proceed with caution, given the history of financial gyrations in California and, no less important, concern that any perception that Democrats were on a spending spree could prove politically damaging to the party.

John A. Pérez, the speaker of the Assembly, said that he supported putting revenues into a contingency fund, but that some of the money should go to increase spending on programs like college scholarships for middle-class students."

The failure by Congress on Monday to renew the federal budget into a new fiscal year is expected to be followed in a few weeks — no one knows exactly when — by an even more dangerous stalemate over raising the government's borrowing authority.

""You can only see an endgame that ends with one side or the other blinking, and it's hard to predict who that will be,"" Tony Fratto, a Washington consultant and former Treasury official, told CNBC. ""They may not blink until after government has taken a day or two of not paying some bills — which some would consider a technical default.""

Such a default could wreak much deeper havoc than the ongoing government shutdown.

Though disruptive and costly, the current budget freeze is expected to have limited impact on the economy and financial markets, which so far have largely shrugged off Washington's fiscal follies.

While hundreds of thousands of government workers have been sent home, much of the government is operating under spending rules that allow most agencies to keep functioning. That's why the last 17 such shutdowns have caused little long-term damage.

If the government exhausts its legal authority to borrow, however, the Treasury says it will be forced to shut off all cash payments.

(Read more: Obama: GOP shut down government over 'ideological crusade')

That's why last week's political stalemate over the federal budget — embarrassing, pointless, infuriating, to be sure — is shaping up as a mild annoyance compared to the potential mayhem looming if Congress forces the Treasury to default on its payments.

Until Monday, many observers expected Congress and the White House to reach some sort of compromise before the budget deadline. Now, many are reconsidering the outlook for averting a debt ceiling debacle.

""The shutdown doesn't bode well for the debt ceiling negotiation,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""While the House Republican leadership is sort of willing to go along and have this partial shutdown, a debt ceiling standoff is much more dangerous. ""

The nation's borrowing limit currently stands at about $16.7 trillion. Unlike virtually every other country in the developed world, that cap has to be extended periodically by a special act of Congress. Though often contentious, the once-routine debt ceiling extension has recently become a political weapon of mass destruction.

Congress came close to forcing a Treasury default in July 2011, pulling back from the brink at the last minute and agreeing to a compromise. The spectacle cost the U.S. its Triple-A credit rating, but no payments were missed. Now, with Congress still dug in over a bitter fight to delay the White House's health care reform law, there's little time left to avert a freeze on government borrowing.

Unlike the hard deadline of the new fiscal year that began Tuesday, the debt ceiling deadline is more complex and dangerous because it's not clear just when it will be reached. The Treasury has been deferring some payments and tapping reserves, but last week estimated that it will exhaust those ""extraordinary measures"" in less than three weeks.

The forecast is complicated by the complexities of government spending and receipts, which don't flow in a steady stream week-in, week-out like a household paying regular monthly bills with a fixed weekly paycheck.

(Read more: 800,000 out of work as US government shuts down)

With some 80 million payments moving through the system each month, the government's revenues and expenses ebb and flow with irregular, sometimes unpredictable, peaks and troughs on both the income and payment sides of the ledger. Social Security checks typically go out at the beginning of the month, for example. Quarterly tax receipts, on the other hand, typically cluster around the middle of the month.

Treasury figures it will have just $30 billion left on hand by Oct. 17 — most likely not enough to cover all government spending that day. On a typical day, the government's bills reach $60 billion. The department faces an even bigger wild card every Thursday, when it rolls over about $100 billion in U.S. debt. If bond holders decided they wanted to be repaid rather than rolling over that paper, the Treasury would be on the hook for those redemptions.

No matter when the cash runs out, the effects of freezing payments would be much more dramatic than the government shutdown. Without Social Security checks, retirees would be forced to cut spending; many don't have a deep pool of savings to draw on. Unpaid government contractors would be forced to lay off workers.

Federal spending would fall by roughly 20 percent almost overnight. A protracted borrowing freeze would quickly tip the economy back into recession. It would also force the suspension of interest payments on the national debt for the first time in the country's history.

Such a default would have unpredictable — and potentially dire — consequences. At the very least, interest rates would likely rise to offset the risk of holding Treasuries. The ripple effects — even more difficult to predict — could spark a global credit freeze not unlike the failure of Lehman Brothers in Sept. 2008.

(Read more: Lehman a 'kindergarten show' next to any default)

Some default skeptics have argued that such an outcome is highly unlikely because the Treasury would still have enough cash coming in to pay interest on the national debt.

Even with a borrowing freeze, cash would continue to flow into the Treasury's account from tax receipts and other payments due the government. Moody's points out that interest on the debt makes up just 7 percent of federal spending, leaving plenty of money left over to pay interest to bond investors.

""However, the government would have to make painful choices as to which expenditure to cut, and there is no historic precedent that provides confidence that interest payments would be prioritized over discretionary spending,"" wrote Moody's analysts last week.

The Treasury has said it has no legal authority to decide which bills to pay and which to ignore. It's also not clear whether its payment system could be rejiggered to prioritize some payments over others.

In any case, failing to make any federal obligations would raise lasting questions about the U.S. government's ""full faith and credit.""

""Any plan to prioritize some payments over others is simply default by another name,"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warned in a letter to lawmakers last week.

Some default deniers also argue that President Obama has the power to override Congress and authorize the Treasury to continue borrowing, based on language in the 14th Amendment (""The validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned."")

That's another novel theory Lew sought to slap down in a speech last month

""Raising the debt limit is Congress's responsibility because Congress, and Congress alone, is empowered to set the maximum amount the government can borrow to meet its financial obligations,"" he told the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.

Millions of workers would see their hourly pay jump from $8 to $9 on July 1, 2014 and to $10 on Jan. 1, 2016, under legislation which received strong support this week from the state's Governor Jerry Brown and other legislative leaders.

""The minimum wage has not kept pace with rising costs,"" Brown said in a statement. ""This legislation is overdue and will help families that are struggling in this harsh economy.""

More than 90% of minimum-wage workers in the state are over the age of 20, while nearly 2.4 million of the state's children live in a household with a parent who earns minimum wage, according to the statement.

The proposed bump would boost a full-time worker's income by about $4,000 to around $20,000 a year, still several thousand dollars below the poverty level for a family of four.

California last raised its minimum wage in 2008. If the increase is approved, the state could surpass Washington State, which at $9.19 an hour has the highest minimum wage in the nation -- although Washington's minimum wage is also set to increase at the rate of inflation each year.

States must pay at least the same as the federal minimum wage, which has been set at $7.25 an hour since 2009.

The proposal comes on the heels of a wave of protests across the country by Wal-Mart workers and fast food workers demanding higher wages. President Obama has also pushed for raising the federal minimum wage to $9, with automatic indexing to inflation.

Advocates say increasing wage rates stimulates the economy since low income workers are more likely to spend the extra cash. Meanwhile, business groups argue that wage increases can lead to job losses.

Jack Temple, policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the proposed California law should set a strong precedent for other states. Many of the jobs created during the recent economic recovery have been low-wage positions, he said.

""You're seeing more adults, more families relying on low wage work to make ends meet,"" he said. ""As that trend continues, the minimum wage is only going to become more important."""

That's below the poverty line for a family of two, and it's not changing as long as Republicans control the House. But that doesn't mean that it's something to give up on, or that nothing can change for minimum wage workers. The past year saw a call to raise the minimum wage in the State of the Union address, only to have congressional Democrats push for a bigger raise than the president had proposed. And in November, President Obama got behind Sen. Tom Harkin and Rep. George Miller's bill to raise the wage to $10.10. The real action, though, the action that has already concretely changed people's lives, is at the state or even local level.

New York's minimum wage will rise from the federal level of $7.25 to $8 on December 31, then increase to $8.75 at the end of 2014 and $9 at the end of 2015; the minimum wage for tipped workers will also increase. The state Assembly had passed an increase in 2012, only to have it blocked by Republicans in the state Senate.

Rhode Island raised its minimum wage from $7.75 to $8 starting January 1, 2014, which is more a level it should be raised from , but yet puts the state ahead of the federal minimum wage by 75 cents, so ... better than nothing.

, but yet puts the state ahead of the federal minimum wage by 75 cents, so ... better than nothing. Connecticut's state legislature passed and Gov. Dannel Malloy signed a law increasing the minimum wage from $8.25 an hour to $8.70 on January 1, then to $9 on January 1, 2015.

California's minimum wage, currently at $8 an hour, will go up to $9 in mid-2014 and to $10 by 2016, thanks to a law passed by the state legislature and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown.

New Jersey voters passed a minimum wage increase to $8.25 an hour and then tie it to inflation—the same day they re-elected Gov. Chris Christie, who had previously vetoed a similar bill.

The city of SeaTac, Washington, voted to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour. The particularly charming thing about that is that SeaTac the city includes SeaTac the airport, meaning a concentrated hub of low-wage jobs will be affected. However, the vote was close and a challenge is likely.

Washington, DC, and two adjoining Maryland counties are raising the wage to $11.50 an hour. The combination of DC and the two counties will mean an area with a minimum wage higher than any state for an area with a population larger than that of 15 states (and the District of Columbia, it should go without saying). There's also a prospect for more in Washington—I'm told a drive by DC Working Families and other groups to put an increase to $12.50 and a raise for tipped workers on the 2014 ballot will continue regardless.

Several states have already indexed their minimum wage to inflation, meaning that workers in those states will get a small raise at the beginning of the year. It may not help them get much ahead, but least—unlike workers on the federal minimum wage—they won't be falling further behind.

Those states, counties, and cities represent a big chunk of the American population, and a lot of workers getting a raise. Prospects are good for 2014, too. The Massachusetts state Senate has passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $11 and the tipped worker minimum to $5.50 by 2016, and if the state House and governor don't seal the deal, there's a ballot initiative effort already underway. Delaware appears ready to go up a dollar to $8.25. There's that ballot initiative in Washington, DC, and a push for an increase to $15 in Seattle. There are also plans for ballot initiatives in Idaho, Alaska and South Dakota.

But the best prospect of all would be Democrats getting control of Congress and increasing the minimum wage at the federal level."

And both sides are gearing up for next time.

Now that our recent brush with financial crisis is behind us, it’s time to start planning for the next one.

That’s the problem Congress set up in the stopgap deal that ended the 16-day government shutdown and averted a collision with the debt ceiling. After all the sound and fury, the two parties agreed only on continuing federal spending at its current level until Jan. 15 and raising the debt ceiling until Feb. 7.

This was the epitome of a temporary cease-fire: An arrangement that freezes in place a situation neither side liked to begin with.

The deal didn’t solve any of the long-term fiscal worries that landed us in this mess. It didn’t even fix the sequester, the meat-ax budget cuts that hit good programs and bad ones without distinction.

Whether we can avoid a repeat performance this winter will depend on what lessons the two sides learn from the fiasco.

Let’s take the Democrats first.

“There are no winners here,” President Obama said politely Thursday morning as the government reopened.

But his aides and his allies in Congress don’t really believe that — at least, not in a practical political sense.

They think the lesson of the crisis was straightforward: Toughness works. When Obama negotiated with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in 2011, he lost. The debt ceiling was raised, but Obama lost both on the substance of the issues and in the eyes of many voters. This time, when Obama dug in his heels and refused to negotiate over the debt ceiling, he won.

“Our goal was to prove to them that we were not going to engage with a gun pointed at our head,” a White House aide told me. “That’s accomplished.”

That doesn’t mean Obama won’t negotiate with Republicans in the next round. Saying he wouldn’t negotiate during the shutdown “was only a tactic; it wasn’t a basic principle,” the aide noted.

In the next round, Democrats hope to be negotiating from a better starting position. They believe Obama has shown he won’t be pushed around, and they also are hopeful that Republicans got the message they can’t use the debt ceiling as leverage any more.

“It’s kryptonite; they won’t want to touch it,” the aide predicted.

In addition, next year’s scheduled sequester cuts will slash defense spending more than this year’s, a fact that might spur Republican hawks toward a deal Democrats want to soften both defense and domestic spending cuts.

And what did Republicans learn?

To Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate Republican leader who negotiated the stopgap deal, the lesson was that government shutdowns end badly for Republicans, and he doesn’t want to try another one. “There’s no education in the second kick of a mule,” McConnell told the conservative magazine National Review last week. “The first kick of the mule was in 1995; the second one was the last 16 days. A government shutdown is off the table. We’re not going to do it.”

Does that mean every Republican in Congress has sworn off trying to use the debt ceiling as leverage? Not necessarily.

To some of the tea party members of Congress who spearheaded the doomed strategy to demand an end to Obama’s healthcare law as the price of keeping the government open, the lesson was that their own party wasn’t tough enough.

“It was an incredible victory” at first, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) insisted in a radio interview — until more moderate Senate Republicans turned into an “air force bombing our own troops.”

But the main lesson for many GOP House members, probably a majority, was that Republicans need clearer, more achievable objectives in the next round of negotiations.

“When you have multiple objectives, you can’t have a clear strategy,” a GOP strategist told me. “The Democrats have a clear goal — they want to undo the sequester and increase tax revenues. Republicans still haven’t figured out what their goals are … [beyond] holding firm against tax increases.”

Where does that leave us as the next budget battle approaches in January?

It’s certain there won’t be a “grand bargain” that trades long-term cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security spending (Republican goals) for significant increases in tax revenue (a Democratic goal). That idea is now officially dead, at least in the short run.

Since 2014 is an election year, neither party is likely to make large concessions to the other; Republicans’ ambitions to take control of the Senate and Democrats’ hopes of taking over the House will make both sides cautious.

But it’s possible that both sides might agree to modifying the sequester — a “mini-bargain.” Both Obama and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) have talked about the idea of sequester “buy downs” — agreements to trade some sequester cuts for more careful spending reductions. “There’s an acknowledgment on all sides that we can’t live with the sequester,” the White House aide said.

But the most likely outcome may look more like a “micro-bargain” — another agreement to kick the can down the road, perhaps with some modest new flexibility on spending cuts.

And for a Congress that defines dysfunction, even a stopgap solution that avoids a government shutdown or a financial crisis would look almost like a victory.

http://www.nytimes.com/news/fiscal-crisis/,,[],Fiscal Crisis,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. — Bonnie Clarfield spent Thursday morning carrying out detritus from the government shutdown at the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area: park closure signs, caution tape, and armfuls of trash.

Ms. Clarfield, a supervisory ranger at the park, north of Los Angeles, spent the first three hours of her workday taking down the signs — 16 of them, some torn in shreds — and cleaning up after vandals who had expressed their frustration with the shutdown, in some cases posting their own messages. One read, “Congress Can’t Shut Down the Park.”

Three gates were also broken during the two-week shutdown. And an old redwood sign, a fixture for decades, was stolen.

Yet, Ms. Clarfield was all smiles, happy that she could open the park to the public again. “It’s been a rough two weeks,” said Ms. Clarfield, who was one of the few rangers left on duty to police the area while it was closed.

“We had a lot of vandalism of infrastructure,” she said. “People were frustrated, and they were taking it out on the rangers. We were doing our jobs, and they were taking it out on the messengers.”

“I feel great today,” she added. “No one’s been mad at me. Everyone is happy to be back. There was a flood of people this morning, all coming to their favorite park to walk, and there were just smiles across people’s faces because they were happy to be back.”

Jahna Bochte, 28, was one of them. She lives nearby and says she runs the park’s trails several times a week. “When it was closed, I couldn’t come up here, so I didn’t run at all,” Ms. Bochte said. “I feel like a fatty.”

“I learned this morning at 5 a.m. that an agreement was made, and I knew it would be open,” she said. “The first thing I did today was come here.”

Barbara Stanifer, 46, who said she had been coming here for 20 years, returned for a hike. “This place is busy all the time,” she said. “To have it closed down — there are plenty of other places to hike, but this one is so great, and so many people come here to hike all the time.”

“I was angry about the whole thing, more than just this park,” she added. “I love coming out here where it’s quiet, and you can get inside your head a little bit more. I think it’s such a shame that they couldn’t get things together enough that they’re not shutting down basic things. This is a wonderful place, and we should be able to come utilize it.”

Ms. Stanifer said she was a Republican for a long time, but had switched parties. “I think the politicians in Washington hold some equal responsibility, but I do think the right-wing conservatives are a little out of control, and need to be sort of reined in,” she said.

Rob Lind, 69, biked to the park from his home about a mile away. He said he rides about four times a week.

“Last week I was shocked to see it closed. I rode up to the entrance, and it was barricaded,” said Mr. Lind, who added that he had not known that the park was federal property. “This is one of the more majestic areas anywhere to bike, so it was disappointing to see it.”

“I’m really discouraged with the government on this,” he said. “I think I probably speak for about 99.8 percent of the population when I say it’s disgraceful. I’m delighted it’s back open. I’m glad they got it open so quickly. I think that’s really a tribute to the park rangers.”

Mr. Lind said he had been a registered Republican for most of his life, but is now an independent. “The Republican Party is not what I knew it to be now,” he said. “The shutdown really epitomizes it. As far as a moderate Republican goes, there’s no such thing anymore. That’s what I considered myself, and I think a lot of other people do too.

“The party has really swung to one extreme,” he added. “But I believe in the pendulum swing, and I believe it will swing back to the mean.”"

About an hour later, after talking to President Obama, Biden called back. He heard a familiar drawl: “Does anyone down there know how to make a deal?” Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate’s top Republican, wanted to know.

That phone call — the first of at least 13 between the two longtime statesmen — set in motion what became the ugly, unsatisfying last-minute conclusion of the “fiscal cliff” crisis.

It also ended a self-inflicted, nationally televised psychological experiment on Congress.

Two summers ago, politicians tried to concoct a deadline so terrible that even they — mistrustful, divided, weakly led — would be scared into doing something big to solve the nation’s tax-and-spending problems.

View Graphic The impact of tax increases on taxpayers

They misjudged themselves.

In the months leading up to the cliff, and especially in the grueling final two weeks, their mega-deadline only produced more division, not cooperation. There were the usual feuds between the parties, followed by a round of new and bitter battles within them.

An in-depth look at the final four tense days shows that McConnell and Biden resolved the crisis through old-fashioned backroom bargaining. With each call and each new offer, they pared away a little more of the grand ambitions each side had once held so dear, until all that was left was a modest measure that raised some new tax revenue and left most of the deficit problem intact.

Left largely to the sidelines was almost everyone else in Washington — the president, the speaker of the House, the majority leader of the Senate and hundreds of rank-and-file lawmakers anxiously wondering what they might be asked to vote for and how much each of their leaders was giving away.

Congress’s experiment became a parable about the dangers of the way Washington works now — careering from deadline to deadline, panic to panic, no one really happy in the end.

And it concluded in typical fashion — lawmakers set themselves up for another deadline and another panic, this one just two months away.

On Friday, four days before the year-end deadline, President Obama and the congressional leaders from each party gathered in the Oval Office. It was not a happy group.

The Democrats were wary. Two weeks earlier, Obama stunned them by offering to give ground on long-held Democratic positions. The president offered to apply a less generous measure of inflation to Social Security benefits, which would save money by reducing their rate of growth. Obama also backed off a demand that he had championed for five years that George W. Bush-era tax cuts be allowed to expire for people making more than $250,000 per year.

Instead, Obama gave a higher, more Republican-friendly number: $400,000.

“In the blink of an eye, they crossed the Rubicon,” said a Senate Democratic aide.

But, there in the Oval Office, the top Republican in the room was in an even worse mood.

Before the meeting even began, House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio had offered a vulgar insult to Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.).

Boehner’s anger began with a recent, debilitating defeat in his own chamber, when he asked fellow Republicans to cast a vote supporting one of his bargaining positions. They declined, somewhat spectacularly, leaving Boehner to declare that he had done all he could do. It was up to the Senate to avert the cliff.

Reid decided to pile on, calling Boehner a “dictator” on the Senate floor — a so-wrong-it’s-funny insult that provoked snickers in the Capitol.

So when Boehner saw Reid at the White House, the normally amiable speaker was steaming.

“Go f--- yourself,” he said, pointing a finger at Reid, according to both Democratic and Republican aides who were there.

“Excuse me?” Reid responded.

Boehner repeated himself. Reid just stared.

The meeting went ahead. Democrats talked tax rates and trade-offs with McConnell. But Boehner refused to engage, sitting stone-faced on a deep couch.

Reid pestered him with questions. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tried to play good cop.

“John,” she said, “Are you going to try to be a little bit constructive?”

Boehner would not.

“The House has acted,” he said. “It’s up to the Senate.”

On Saturday, McConnell and his staff hunkered down in the senator’s office. Reid did not come in, but his staff got to work in his office.

Only 60 steps separated them, but they were hundreds of thousands of dollars apart on the threshold for raising income tax rates.

McConnell made an offer: The Bush-era tax hikes could expire for people making more than $500,000, or couples making more than $750,000.

Democrats countered with a lower number. On it went, and the numbers got closer together. Republicans went down as far as $450,000 for individuals, $550,000 for couples.

That’s when the bargaining stopped.

Saturday turned to Sunday, and Republicans had still not heard a response to their last offer. Nothing at 11. Nothing at 12. McConnell decided something was wrong. “We couldn’t get the majority leader to counter,” the GOP leader said later. There were now less than 36 hours until the deadline. “The clock was ticking and we were not moving.”

They weren’t moving because Democrats had decided that they had gone as far as they could. Reid and Obama had disagreed privately about what their next offer should be. At one point, Reid was unhappy with an idea that Senate aides said came from Obama — to put the change in Social Security benefits back on the table in exchange for a delay in spending cuts and a rise in the debt limit.

Aides said Reid actually tore up the proposal and threw it into the blazing fire in his ornate green marble fireplace. The paper burned. Reid said he didn’t want evidence that the idea had ever been considered.

Administration officials, for their part, deny that Obama ever considered including the Social Security change in the deal.

Finally, an aide to Reid called an aide to McConnell to make it explicit. There would be no new offer. Take it or leave it.

“It felt like they had chosen the cliff,” a Republican aide said.

McConnell, frustrated, asked an aide to call Biden. The two of them had brokered the deal that set up this mess, during the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011. Now, they would broker the deal that ended it.

When Biden called back, aides in McConnell’s office listening to his side of the conversation could tell that Biden was interested. In fact, Biden had already walked from his office to Obama’s. He got the go-ahead to negotiate.

“Why don’t you get up to speed on this and call me back,” McConnell said, according to the notes of someone in the room.

Deadline day. Over the course of 13 phone calls between Biden and McConnell, and others between lower-level staffers, the deal was getting done.

As the two men talked, they began to kill off the grandest ambitions that both parties had brought into the fiscal-cliff debate. Obama, for instance, had said since 2007 that taxes should go up on people making more than $250,000.

That was gone, now. Biden and McConnell agreed on $400,000, and $450,000 for couples filing jointly.

The men talked about two other key demands the White House had made. One was that the huge budget cuts called the “sequester” would be delayed to avoid hurting the fledgling economic recovery. Obama had also insisted that any cliff deal raise the national debt ceiling. He did not want a repeat of the crisis that nearly pitched the country into default in the summer of 2011.

Gone, and gone. When Reid got news Monday morning that the terms called for a delay of mere months for the sequester, he called the president. What are you going to do in two months, Reid asked Obama, when the sequester is about kick in along with a new deadline on the federal debt limit?

Reid worried that Republicans would demand trillions of dollars in new spending cuts.

I’m not going to negotiate with them, Obama replied. Reid felt it wouldn’t be so easy.

“Mr. President,” he said, according to aides, “We’re setting ourselves up.”



Republican goals, too, were sacrificed. A party that defined itself by its opposition to taxes would now be asked to raise them. Their ambition to save money by changing Social Security benefits was also cut.

The last piece of the puzzle: How, exactly, should they delay the sequester? The cost of paying for it would be $12 billion a month.

They settled on a two-month delay. “If we can’t find $24 billion here to cut, we ought to find another line of work,” McConnell told Biden in one call.

In the end, they made their small deal and then set out to sell it.

McConnell made his pitch to Senate Republicans about 5 p.m. “You could argue persuasively, that — in a government controlled two-thirds by the Democrats — we got permanency for 99 percent of the Bush tax cuts,” McConnell said.

Most of his colleagues were joyous. “Deal, deal, deal,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) chanted to reporters as he exited the room.

Biden made his pitch around 9 p.m. By then, Reid was on board. As he introduced Biden, he told Democrats that he didn’t want anyone to try to block a vote on procedural grounds.

If you don’t like the package, Reid said, you can vote no.

The scaled-down bill passed in the Senate, with just three Democrats and five Republicans voting no.

After a day of hemming and hawing, the House followed suit Tuesday night. The final count was 257 to 167, with most of the support coming from Democrats.

Boehner voted yes. But two of his top deputies, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), voted no.

In the end, it seemed, the lawmakers who had set up this grand experiment had not lost faith in themselves. Instead, they seemed to believe the answer was to hold another experiment, not three months away. Already, politicians from both sides were promising that the next deadline would produce the victories that this one did not.

Obama promised that he would not negotiate over the debt ceiling: “We can’t go down that path again,” he said in a televised address.

Some Republicans seemed certain that they could make him do just that. “Our opportunity here is on the debt ceiling. The president’s made it very clear – he doesn’t even want to have a discussion about it, because he knows this is where we have leverage,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “We Republicans need to be willing to tolerate a temporary partial government shutdown, which is what that could mean.”

Next up: A grande push to solve the nation's long-term debt problems.

The CEO of Starbucks already mobilized his customer base, gathering signatures to reopen the government and hike the debt ceiling in order to stave off a U.S. default.

The 1.7 million petition signatures that his baristas collected may or may not have had anything to do with the end of the stand off. But Schultz is convinced it helped.

On Friday Starbucks published ads in USA Today and the Washington Post taking a victory lap of sorts for the shutdown petition, saying ""We are all reminded and inspired how a spirit of civility and common purpose can help move America forward.""

Now he plans to call on his customers to push Washington to solve its budget woes. When Congress voted Wednesday night to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling, it set new deadlines that will likely result in another budget showdown.

So in a second letter to the 300 other business leaders, Schultz has vowed to do more.

""I continue to believe we cannot be bystanders about our collective future,"" he wrote. "" We are going to have to become more engaged so that Washington doesn't fall back into this kind of unnecessary crisis every few months.""

Schultz didn't offer any details about his plans for the future. But he did say that the response to the petition drive ""has inspired me to think more about what we can do at Starbucks to continue to use our scale for good.""

In December 2011, as Congress debated the so-called ""fiscal cliff,"" he asked employees at its approximately 120 D.C.-area stores to write ""Come Together"" on coffee cups when serving customers.

Schultz has also taken high-profile positions on several other controversial issues that have little to do with Starbucks' business.

Last month he issued a public plea asking customers not to bring their guns into Starbucks. He has also been an outspoken advocate of same-sex marriage, telling shareholders who don't agree ""you can sell your shares of Starbucks."""

Rep. Steve Stivers, a close Boehner ally, even floated the idea that “revenue”, i.e. higher taxes, could be part of this “bargain.”

There is no clear path to reopening government right now. Obama and Senate Democrats continue to refuse to negotiate or compromise on legislation to provide new government funding. In just two weeks, however, the federal government is set to hit its debt ceiling, exhausting its borrowing authority. After this, the government will have to pay its bills out of continuing tax collections, necessitating dramatic cuts in spending or a default on the nation’s existing debt payments.

As the government shutdown and debt ceiling issues intertwine, many in the GOP believe that only a “grand bargain” on spending and revenue is a big enough vehicle to restore government funding and lift the debt ceiling. During the last debt ceiling negotiations, in 2011, the GOP was close to agreeing to a similar “grand bargain.” The deal fell apart in the 11th hour, however, because President Obama increased his demands for new revenue.

This experience should caution the GOP against unilaterally proposing another “grand bargain” at this time. Obama and the Senate Democrats seem incapable of negotiating in good faith. The rhetoric they currently employ against Republicans does not suggest they are ready to cede ground on fiscal issues in any meaningful way. It is hard to imagine Harry Reid shifting from calling Republicans “anarchists” to treating them as honest brokers in a substantive negotiation over the nation’s fiscal policy.

Theoretically, a “grand bargain” could be a good idea, given the urgent need to reform the nation’s entitlement programs and tax code. In reality, however, with Republicans only controlling the House, any “grand bargain” is likely to be light on spending reform and heavy on tax hikes.

If Republicans take control of the Senate in 2014, which is increasingly likely, conservatives and moderate Republicans would be in a better position to push a “grand bargain” that would contain meaningful reforms that could boost the economy.

Policy considerations, however, may yield to internal GOP politics. Paul Ryan, who was granted a special waiver to continuing chairing the Budget Committee, is eager to strike a significant budget deal while he has the gavel. Rep. David Camp, too, is entering his final term chairing the Ways and Means Committee and is anxious to enact some kind of tax reform while he heads the committee. Their desire for a personal legacy will make them strong advocates for a “grand bargain,” despite the GOP’s relatively weak hand.

The GOP faces a series of tough choices over the next two weeks. So, too, do Obama and the Senate Democrats. Much of the current situation is due to the inability of the Senate to produce a regular budget over the past five years. The failed stimulus program, bailouts, expanded welfare payments and new entitlements like ObamaCare has caused government spending to skyrocket, pushing the national debt to unsustainable levels. Even a mainstream media black-out can’t forever keep those facts from the American public.

The onus isn’t on Republicans to solve the nation’s fiscal crisis. President Obama and Senate Democrats have brought us to this point. It should be up to them to steer us out of it."

Brian Bonlender, Director of the State Department of Commerce said it would be difficult to pinpoint the exact economic impact because it depends on how long the road is out of service, how much traffic was disrupted and delayed by detour routes.

But, based on a flood in 2007 that washed out a section of Interstate 5 in Chehalis and closed Interstate-5 in both directions for four days, he was able to estimate economic losses from Thursday's Skagit River Bridge collapse.

""We’re still calculating, but certainly expect the impact of the Skagit River Bridge disruption to be similar,"" Bonlender said in comments e-mailed to NBC News.

He said total lost economic output from the 2007 floods was $47.07 million, with 290 jobs lost for one year following the closure. The state tax revenue loss was $2.39 million.

Bonlender also noted that Canada is Washington’s No. 2 trading partner ($33.4 billion total imports and exports). It was important to determine how feasible it is to switch some traffic to rail from road, he said.

The bridge collapse will also play havoc with commercial traffic and disrupt the Memorial Day holiday for many Americans who plan to spend the start of the summer season shopping, camping, or taking excursions.

Trucks and traffic from Interstate 5 have been rerouted and Gov. Jay Inslee has urged travelers to avoid the I-5 corridor in the area north of Seattle altogether. That means local businesses will suffer too, as many rely on customers from the main north-south highway.

On the other side of the border, Canadian tourism officials were also concerned that Thursday's bridge collapse would prevent Americans from traveling across the border for a last weekend of skiing, a day's mountain biking or a round of golf.

All this on a holiday, when the AAA motoring organization estimates that nearly 35 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more from their homes by car.

Bob Lama, a board member of the Chamber of Commerce in Mount Vernon, Wash., said the collapse will affect not just local traffic, but Canadians coming south and Americans going north.

""It’s going to impact everybody, business and non-business,” Lama told The Seattle Times. “The Department of Transportation has their work cut out for them to figure out what to do.’’

Washington state officials say sections of the highway will have to rebuilt around the four-lane bridge, which carried an average daily traffic of 70,925 vehicles in 2010, according to the National Bridge Inventory Database.

The Washington State Department of Transportation has suggested alternative routes, but they involve smaller roads and bridges that cannot handle the same volume of traffic as the huge Interstate 5, which travels the length of the west coast from San Diego to Oregon and Washington before reaching the border with Canada.

Just north of the collapsed Skagit River bridge, is the huge Cascade Mall shopping center in Burlington, which attracts customers from a wide radius. Canadians from Vancouver and other parts of British Columbia often make trips to the outlet mall looking for bargains because of the near parity nowadays between the U.S. and Canadian dollars.

“A lot of Canadian shoppers travel that corridor, said Jenny O'Brien, who handles marketing for the Cascade Mall. ""Obviously it will have an impact, when you get cars off the road.""

She said the mall was working with local communities and state transportation officials to see how altered traffic patterns might affect operations at the mall, which includes a Macy's, a Sears and a TJ Maxx, which is actually opening this weekend.

""This is the main thoroughfare for traffic and commerce going from Seattle to Vancouver,” said Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton. “It’s a far-reaching effect.”

“This is going to affect us not only this Memorial Day weekend, but long into the future,’’ Sexton said.

Canadians are worried too. Amber Sessions, a spokeswoman for Tourism Vancouver, said the city that hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics had more than 8 million visitors last year -- 475,000 of them from Washington state.

""The bridge collapse is on the main road from Seattle to Vancouver: it's not great news, for the flow of cross-border traffic. But it's not catastrophic, at least nobody was killed.""

Sessions said the busiest time for American tourists visiting the city, often referred to as Canada's LA because of its art and film-making community, its theaters and restaurants, was any long U. S. holiday weekend like Memorial Day or Martin Luther King Day in January."

The Senate approved a two-year budget deal

The House approved it last week on a bipartisan vote

President Obama said he will sign it before he leaves Friday for Hawaii

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate approved, 64-36, Wednesday a limited, two-year budget framework to diffuse the threat of another government shutdown and alleviate harsh budget cuts.

Nine Republicans sided with all 55 members of the Democratic Conference, which includes two independent senators.

The agreement was overwhelmingly approved by the U.S. House last week, and it now heads to President Obama for his signature.

The framework sets top-line spending levels for the next two fiscal years at $1.012 trillion and $1.014 trillion, respectively. The GOP-led House and Democratic-led Senate had been unable to agree on spending levels, which helped provoke the 16-day government shutdown in October.

Working off the same budget levels will allow the House and Senate Appropriations committees to move forward on the annual 12 spending bills that fund the government's discretionary spending, which does not include spending on mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare.

""We have a heavy lift ahead of us — drafting, negotiating, and passing these bills in just over one month — but I am certain my colleagues on both the Senate and House Appropriations Committees are up to the task,"" House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., said last week. The current stopgap funding bill runs out on Jan. 15.

The budget deal also alleviates $63 billion in across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester by replacing them with other cuts and new government fees on airlines, new pension requirements for future federal employees, and a 1% reduction in cost of living adjustments to working-age military retirees. It also includes an additional $23 billion in modest deficit reduction over the next decade achieved by extending certain health care cuts through 2023.

The budget deal is one of the final legislative acts in what has otherwise been the most unproductive year on record for Congress.

The GOP-led House has already adjourned for the year, while the Democratic-led Senate is also working to wrap up a defense bill and a number of executive branch nominations before they adjourn for the holiday season.

The deal's negotiators, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Budget Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., said they are hopeful this final act of bipartisanship will usher in a new era of cooperation in a divided Washington.

Murray said the deal could help ""heal the wounds"" of what has been a divisive and partisan year that led to the first government shutdown in nearly two decades and included a bitter and ongoing battle over the implementation of the president's health care law.

Congress will reconvene on Jan. 6 for the second session of the 113th Congress. An overhaul of the nation's immigration laws is the dominant piece of domestic legislation facing this Congress, while congressional Republicans are also angling for additional fiscal restraints in exchange for their support to increase the nation's debt limit. A vote is expected in the spring."

After a bruising week in Washington%2C President Obama headed to Baltimore on Friday

Obama delivered a speech on the economy at a dredging manufacturer and visited a school

Obama says he is trying to keep his focus on the middle class

BALTIMORE—After a week of playing defense on a trio of scandals, President Obama escaped Washington on Friday in an attempt to turn attention back to his economic agenda.

While the House Ways and Means Committee spent the morning grilling ousted IRS acting commissioner Steven Miller about the agency's targeting of Tea Party and conservative non-profit groups, Obama spent his day in Charm City.

He started the day in Baltimore with a visit to an early education program to highlight his call for Congress to fund pre-kindergarten for low- and moderate-income families. He then visited a dredging manufacturer on the outskirts of this city to highlight his economic agenda and later planned to visit a local community center.

""I don't want to interrupt the studying,"" Obama said on Monday after walking in on the pre-kindergarten class at Moravia Park Elementary. ""So I'm going to grab this chair right here. Come on. Let's focus.""

He spent his time in classroom quizzing the children on their addition and subtraction skills and drawing pictures of animals with the class.

""I got to say my tiger was not very good,"" Obama said later. ""The kids were unimpressed.""

The light moment for the president comes at the end of a bruising week for him and his administration.

In addition to the IRS controversy, Obama has come under fire from Republicans in recent days after the release of internal e-mails showed that his senior aides and State Department officials edited out references to terrorism in early ""talking points"" put out by the administration following last year's terrorist attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya.

The Obama administration has also been battling with the fallout of the revelation from earlier this week that the Justice Department secretly subpoenaed phone records of Associated Press journalists as part a probe into the leak of classified information.

Despite the wave of bad news for the White House, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who traveled to Baltimore with Obama on Friday, said the president was ""at ease.""

""He's doing exactly the right thing, focusing on the substance,"" Hoyer said.

On Thursday evening, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough met with a dozen Democratic strategists to talk about moving beyond the controversies and get back to pushing the president's economic agenda.

On Friday afternoon, Obama visited Ellicot Dredges, a Baltimore company that manufactures dredges and dredging equipment that are exported around the globe. Obama announced during a speech at the company that he's signed a presidential memorandum that will cut in half the permitting process on federal infrastructure projects.

But the office of House Speaker John Boehner noted the president's visit to the dredging manufacturer highlights another sensitive topic for the Obama administration — the pending decision on permitting the Keystone XL pipeline.

Peter Bowe, the president of Ellicot Dredges, testified before a House subcommittee on Thursday that the proposed pipeline that would bring tar sands oil from northwest Canada to the Gulf of Mexico would be a boon for companies like his.

""For us, it's all about jobs, not construction jobs for the pipeline itself, but ongoing jobs every year for decades to come, all related to the production of oil from the Alberta oil sands deposits,"" Bowe said in his prepared remarks.

Obama rejected rapid approval of the pipeline last year as he faced pressure from environmental groups who say the pipeline and the carbon-heavy oil are risky for the environment. Republican lawmakers have pushed for the administration to approve the pipeline, which they contend will create jobs and help reduce American dependence on Middle East oil.

The State Department — which has approval authority over the project — is to make a decision on a new permit application on Keystone, perhaps as early as later this year.

Obama didn't address Keystone or make any mention of Benghazi or the IRS controversies directly, but he made clear that he's trying to move beyond the scandals.

""Others may get distracted chasing every fleeting issue that passes by, but the middle class will always be my No. 1 focus, period,"" Obama said. ""Your jobs. Your families. Your communities. That's why I ran for president."""

Citizen soldiers lose jobs; U.S. government biggest offender,"The jobs of the nation’s citizen soldiers are supposed to be safe while they are serving their country: Federal law does not allow employers to penalize service members because of their military duties.

Yet every year, thousands of National Guard and Reserve troops coming home from Afghanistan and elsewhere find they have been replaced, demoted, denied benefits or seniority.

Government agencies are among the most frequent offenders, accounting for about a third of the more than 15,000 complaints filed with federal authorities since the end of September 2001, records show. Others named in the cases include some of the biggest names in American business, such as Wal-Mart and United Parcel Service.

With good jobs still scarce in many states, the illegal actions have contributed to historically high joblessness among returning National Guard and Reserve members — as high as 50% in some California units — and created a potential obstacle to serving.

“The whole point of the National Guard and reserves, how they save the country money, is they get paid only when they are serving,” said Sam Wright, director of the Service Members Law Center at the Reserve Officers Assn. “It’s a great deal for the country, but if we don’t protect their civilian jobs … they aren’t going to volunteer and serve.”

Veterans’ advocates say that the heavy use of the nation’s citizen-soldiers to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan placed a burden on employers in a tough economy. Even as 11 years of war wind down, Guard and Reserve members are being called up for peacekeeping and other duties around the world.

The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, a 1994 law that strengthened job protections for returning troops first introduced during World War II, requires that service members are reemployed in the type of position they would have attained if they had not been called to active duty.

Just how many service members are being denied jobs illegally is impossible to know. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office estimated in 2005 that fewer than a third of service members with complaints seek help from the government. Many don’t file lawsuits, either.

Even so, the Labor Department and Office of Special Counsel, which investigate complaints for possible prosecution, have seen cases surge from 848 in fiscal 2001 to 1,577 in the 12 months ending in September 2011. Last year, the agencies handled 1,436 new cases, according to preliminary figures.

A Defense Department program that tries to mediate disputes handled 2,884 cases in fiscal 2011 alone, including 299 that went to the Labor Department when they could not be resolved informally.

Although the law says the federal government should be a “model employer,” federal agencies accounted for nearly 20% of the formal complaints in fiscal 2012, about twice the share recorded in 2007. The departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs lead the way with 105 and 47 complaints respectively.

President Obama instructed federal agencies last July to intensify efforts to ensure compliance. But officials say it has been a challenge to ensure that supervisors working at offices across the country are familiar with the requirements.

Obtaining redress can take months, if not years. For service members, the experience can be a maddening double-blow.

Lt. Col. Pierre Saint-Fleur, a former Fresno County mental health worker who deployed three times to Iraq as a military chaplain, said he was forced into early retirement because of his service in the California National Guard. He protested to the Labor Department’s Veterans’ Employment and Training Service but said he was told the case had no merit.

“I felt betrayed,” Saint-Fleur said. “This same government that called me to go into harm’s way, into a war zone, failed me when I got back and lost my job.”

Saint-Fleur said he had no problem getting rehired after he demobilized in 2008. But he said he quickly saw that he was no longer welcome at the Department of Children and Family Services, where he had worked as a counselor for 18 years.

Instead of getting his old office back, he was given a desk in what he described as a trailer, with no privacy for counseling patients — a situation he feared could cost him his license. He said his work was criticized, his authority was reduced to the level of a student intern and a fraud investigation was opened alleging that he had been overbilling patients — claims he said were baseless.

“I had no choice but to leave,” he said.

Only after hiring a private attorney did he win a $100,000 settlement, court and county records show. The county did not admit fault in the 2010 settlement. Fresno County officials did not return calls seeking comment.

Government agencies and Fortune 500 companies — especially defense contractors — are major employers of people who serve in the armed forces and might be expected to experience the most disputes. State and local governments accounted for more than 20% of the complaints last year and private companies nearly 60%.

Advertisement

Government officials note that many of these cases are the result of misunderstandings that may not amount to breaking the law.

“It’s not an intuitively obvious law,” said Lt. Col. Melissa Phillips, deputy director of the Defense Department’s Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. “We have individual supervisors who are continually changing, and so it’s a continual education process.”

That can also be an issue at large companies.

Home Depot has won awards for its support of current and former military members, who make up about 10% of its workforce. But Brian Bailey, an Iraq veteran and former California National Guard member, said his supervisors at a Home Depot store in Flagstaff, Ariz., complained about having to find a replacement when he was called up for training or to fight a brush fire.

“They think you have a weekend off,” he said.

In 2010, two years after Bailey was promoted to department supervisor, he was fired. At the recommendation of Labor officials, the Justice Department investigated and filed suit. Home Depot did not admit wrongdoing but agreed last year to pay Bailey $45,000 and to update its policies to provide explicit protection for workers needing to take military leave.

“We would never tolerate the termination of any of our employees for illegitimate reasons,” said Stephen Holmes, a company spokesman. At any time, about 1,500 Home Depot employees across the nation are on military leaves of absence, he said.

Bailey’s grievance took two years to resolve. Veterans complain that the process can take too long and that investigators are too inclined to take the word of employers.

A Labor official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said most disputes are resolved without recourse to the courts. He acknowledged past problems, but said the department has revamped its training for investigators. It now takes an average of 60 days to complete an investigation, he said.

But attorneys for aggrieved service members say some employers have grown sophisticated about trying to get around the law. Rather than wait to see if deploying troops will want their old jobs back, some hand out pink slips as soon as they are notified that their employees are expecting orders. Others refuse to hire people who serve in the Guard and Reserve, a form of discrimination that is illegal but difficult to prove.

Enrique Ostojic, an Air Force reservist, said he lost a job offer after he told a prospective employer about his military obligations. Ostojic said a San Diego-based security firm offered him a full-time position but changed the offer to part-time after learning he would need some weekends off for training.

When he complained to the Labor Department, he said he was told insufficient evidence existed to pursue a case against the company, which is now closed. “Apparently my word isn’t good enough,” he said.

Ostojic said he didn’t take the matter further because he couldn’t afford a lawyer on his Reserve pay. Last year, he showed up at a veterans’ job fair, where he collected a stack of brochures from such companies as UPS and Verizon.

“At least I feel confident that if they are here, I am not going to be discriminated against,” Ostojic said. Yet records show that these and other companies at the job fair have been the subject of repeated complaints.

The Labor Department investigated eight new claims against UPS last year and 11 in fiscal 2011. Verizon was the subject of six complaints in the last two years. Officials at the two companies declined to discuss specific cases but said they go out of their way to recruit and retain military members.

Wal-Mart was named in 29 cases, more than any other Fortune 500 company. Officials at the company did not respond to requests for comment. The Labor Department did not identify smaller employers, to protect the privacy of complainants.

Some veterans’ advocates would like to see the law strengthened to include punitive damages and mandatory attorney’s fees. For willful violations, courts can require employers to pay twice the amount of compensation a service member lost, but critics say the awards are often small.

Ramsey Sulayman, a legislative associate for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said he believes employers are “rolling the dice” and getting away with breaking the law.

“It’s a paper tiger,” Sulayman said. “There’s nothing that will prevent an employer from violating over and over and over.”

Sets New Offensive on Obama Goals,"WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans are moving to gut many of President Obama’s top priorities with the sharpest spending cuts in a generation and a new push to hold government financing hostage unless the president’s signature health care law is stripped of money this fall.

As Mr. Obama prepares to deliver a major economic address on Wednesday in Illinois, Republicans in Washington are delivering blow after blow to programs he will promote as vital to a more robust economic recovery and a firmer economic future — from spending on infrastructure and health care to beefing up regulatory agencies. While Mr. Obama would like to keep the economic conversation lofty, his adversaries in Congress are already fighting in the trenches.

On Tuesday, a House Appropriations subcommittee formally drafted legislation that would cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by 34 percent and eliminate his newly announced greenhouse gas regulations. The bill cuts financing for the national endowments for the arts and the humanities in half and the Fish and Wildlife Service by 27 percent.

For the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, Mr. Obama requested nearly $3 billion for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs — a mainstay of his economic agenda since he was first elected. The House approved $826 million. Senate Democrats want to give $380 million to ARPA-E, an advanced research program for energy. The House allocated $70 million."
http://news.yahoo.com/obamas-no-negotiation-stance-setting-tone-072558838--politics.html,,[],Obama's no-negotiation stance setting new tone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — This time, President Barack Obama says, he's not budging. This is the confrontational Obama, the ""Make my day"" president, betting Republicans blink to avoid a government shutdown or a first-ever default of the nation's debts.

It's a proposition not without risk and one with a history of last-minute accommodations on both sides. Brinkmanship between Obama and congressional Republicans has often stopped at the precipice's edge.

In this round, however, the president and his aides maintain that when it comes to raising the government's borrowing authority and meeting its debt obligations, there's no bargaining. To conservatives wishing to undo the 3-year-old health care law in exchange for an increase in the nation's credit, Obama on Friday said bluntly: ""That's not going to happen.""

""I don't know how I can be more clear about this: Nobody gets to threaten the full faith and credit of the United States just to extract political concessions,"" Obama said in a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room.

Still, House Speaker John Boehner says a debt hike must be linked to budget cuts and other programmatic changes.

""The president says, 'I'm not going to negotiate,'"" Boehner said. ""Well, I'm sorry, but it just doesn't work that way.""

Obama's stance is rooted in experience, politics and a desire to protect himself from similar demands in the remaining three years of his presidency.

Obama advisers note that past negotiations have not yielded grand bargains and that the mere threat of default in 2011 rattled the economy, causing a downgrade in U.S. credit. Talks earlier this year to avoid automatic spending cuts known as sequestration also failed.

Obama aides also note that Boehner himself eight months ago declared an end to negotiations with Obama, favoring the regular legislative process instead.

That process has proved messy for the GOP, and senior White House aides insist that in a standoff, Republicans will be perceived as the unreasonable party. And the White House is convinced any concession would place the president in the position of having to bargain again and again when the next debt ceiling looms.

Story continues

""I'm not going to start setting a precedent, not just for me, but for future presidents, where one chamber in Congress can basically say each time there needs to be a vote to make sure Treasury pays its bills, we're not going to sign it unless our particular hobby horse gets advanced,"" Obama said Friday.

His advisers only see a downside if Obama doesn't stand his ground.

""Every poll I've seen suggests that while no one escapes cleanly from a shutdown, the GOP would bear the brunt,"" former senior White House counselor and Obama adviser David Axelrod said. ""The bigger danger for the president is to put himself in a position to be constantly held hostage. First they want an arm. Then they want a leg. It's unsustainable.""

House Republican leaders, meanwhile, want to attach other provisions to the debt ceiling, including approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and provisions blocking pollution regulations.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., on Thursday demanded the GOP-controlled House simply send the Senate unencumbered spending and debt ceiling bills.

""There's no need for conversations,"" Reid said. ""We've spoken loudly and clearly, and we have the support of the president of the United States. And that's pretty good.""

The Pew Research Center, however, found nearly 6 out of 10 Americans want politicians they side with to be more willing to engage in talks. And the public split about evenly in the Pew poll on who would be responsible if the government shut down, with 39 percent blaming Republicans and 36 percent Obama and much of the rest blaming both.

""The president may not be playing this just for this set and this match,"" said Patrick Griffin, the White House legislative director under President Bill Clinton. ""As his tenure goes on and his legacy looms larger, he might not be as poll sensitive as he might be otherwise.""

White House aides say Obama is still willing to negotiate over a long-term spending deal, just not as part of raising the debt ceiling. But the opportunity for that could be short-lived, too. The Senate version of the short-term spending bill would set up another possible government shutdown as soon as Nov. 16.

What's more, lines in the sand have blurred before.

Obama ran for re-election vowing to increase taxes on individuals making more than $200,000. Republicans insisted they would not raise taxes at all. In the end, both settled on a hike on incomes above $400,000. Most recently, Obama altered course on Syria, at first determined to launch missile strikes against its regime, then seeking congressional support before taking a diplomatic path aimed at destroying Syria's chemical stockpile.

The White House also sees the current showdown as an opportunity to cast the Republican Party in the image of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a leader in the effort to kill Obama's health care law.

""They have allowed Ted Cruz to be their face, write their charter and steer their ship,"" said senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer. ""That is a decision that has real consequences for how the American people view the Republican Party as we head into this debate.""

Still, if the White House is eager to stitch Cruz' name to the Republican Party banner, many Senate Republicans were doing their best to distance themselves from the Texan and his aggressive tactics.

Indeed, as much as Republicans dislike the health care law, many Republicans argue that seeking to kill it is fruitless as long as Obama is president and Democrats control the Senate.

Hess', 'Brian Zajac']",Maryland is the richest state; Mississippi is the poorest,"Median household income in the United States declined for the second straight year, according to data released from the U.S. Census Bureau today. Income was $50,502 in 2011, more than 8 percent below the 2007 pre-recession peak.

While the trend is generally down, some states fared far better than others. Median income ranged from $36,919 in Mississippi to $70,004 in Maryland, positions both states have held since before the recession. Based on the 2011 Census Bureau American Community Survey, 24/7 Wall St. identified the states with the highest and lowest median household income.

24/7 Wall St.: The World's Best (And Worst) Economies

Between 2010 and 2011, Vermont was the only state where median income increased. Income fell in 18 states and remained statistically unchanged in 31. In Hawaii, which remained one of the wealthiest states in the country, median income decreased by more than $3,000 between 2010 and 2011 alone.

Not surprisingly, poverty rates continued to be high. The percentage of Americans living below the poverty line increased in 17 states between 2010 and 2011, the third consecutive increase for 10 of these states. Of the states with the lowest income, eight had among the 10-highest poverty rates. Mississippi had the highest poverty rate in the country, at 22.6 percent of residents, compared with the national rate of 15.9 percent.

The poorest states in the country are almost entirely found in the South, with the exception of New Mexico. The wealthiest states can be found all across the country, including three in New England, four in the Mid-Atlantic, and two outside the contiguous 48 states.

Of course, not all residents of the wealthiest states earn as much as the median. According to the Census Bureau’s Gini Coefficient, which measures income inequality, there was a significant increase in the divide between the rich and poor in 20 states. The measure remained unchanged in the rest.

Though income inequality affects rich and poor states alike, the poorest states struggle with it most. Inequality was high in only three rich states: California, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Meanwhile, with the exception of West Virginia, all of the poorest states had among the highest income inequality scores, with six in the top 15.

In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Brookings Institution fellow Elizabeth Kneebone explained that income inequality at a state level is often influenced by differences between the state’s high- and low-income cities and between urban and rural areas. “These are metropolitan economies that drive a lot of these [state] trends.” This was especially the case in California, where the Bay Area’s wealthy suburbs have incomes fueled by the tech industry and the low-income areas in other parts of the states are agricultural-based economies.

At least one positive development involves health insurance coverage, which increased in 37 states. While the poorest states improved, coverage remained relatively low. Three of the poorest states were among the 10 with the lowest coverage. In New Mexico, nearly 20 percent were not insured in 2011, much higher than the 15.1 percent national average. In the wealthiest states, coverage was among the highest, with four states having greater than 90 percent insured.

24/7 Wall St.: Brands That Will Disappear in 2013

While most of the states with the lowest incomes suffer from weak economies, unemployment was not a significant problem. Only two states were among the worst 10 for unemployment in 2011. In fact, five of the worst-off states had unemployment rates lower than the national rate of 8.9 percent last year. In Oklahoma, one of the poorest states, unemployment was 6.2 percent. In the states with the highest median incomes, the results were similarly varied.

According to Kneebone, it is not a surprise that unemployment and income appear unrelated. ""Earnings for middle and lower-wage workers have fallen or stagnated over time,"" Kneebone explained. ""So you can have a situation where jobs are being created ... but the types of jobs matter. If those are jobs that pay low wages, even if you’re working full time, that might not be enough to lift you above the poverty line.”

To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income, poverty, and health insurance from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2011 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and additional 2011 ACS data on individual cities. Because the cost of living has a direct bearing income, 24/7 Wall St. considered cost of living data for Q4 2011 from the Council for Community and Economic Research.

The Richest States

1. Maryland

Median household income: $70,004

$70,004 Population: 5,828,289 (19th highest)

5,828,289 (19th highest) Unemployment rate: 7 percent (15th lowest)

7 percent (15th lowest) Percent below poverty line: 10.1 percent (2nd lowest)

Maryland, which has had the highest median income of all states since 2006, was the only state in the country to have a median income above $70,000 in 2011. The state’s 10.1 percent was well below the national rate of 15.9 percent. Furthermore, a sizable portion of the population is earning well above the median income. Maryland is one of three states, along with New Jersey and Connecticut, where more than 10 percent of families earned more than $200,000 in 2011. Across the U.S., only 5.6 percent of families made more than $200,000 in 2011.

2. Alaska

Median household income: $67,825

$67,825 Population: 722,718 (4th lowest)

722,718 (4th lowest) Unemployment rate: 7.6 percent (22nd lowest)

7.6 percent (22nd lowest) Percent below poverty line: 10.5 percent (4th lowest)

In 2011, Alaska moved ahead of New Jersey to take the spot of the state with the second-highest median household income in the country. The state benefits from its vast natural resources, particularly oil, natural gas, and timber. Since 1957, the state has collected nearly $100 billion in taxes from oil and gas companies, and Alaska oil production has accounted for more than 13 percent of total U.S. production. Most residents reap the benefits from these payments. Income inequality in the state is the second-lowest in the country. Just 3 percent of Alaskan families earned less than $10,000 per year compared to the 5.1 percent nationwide. Meanwhile, despite the state’s high median income, just 5 percent of families earned more than $200,000 per year.

3. New Jersey

Median household income: $ 67,458

67,458 Population: 8,821,155 (11th highest)

8,821,155 (11th highest) Unemployment rate: 9.3 percent (14th highest)

9.3 percent (14th highest) Percent below poverty line: 10.4 percent (3rd lowest)

In New Jersey, 10.9 percent of families earned more than $200,000 last year and just 10.4 percent of residents lived below the poverty line, fewer than all states except for New Hampshire. Still, there were areas in the state where poverty was more widespread. In Newark, 31.6 percent of residents lived below the poverty line, while Paterson’s poverty rate was 28.9 percent. In contrast to the state as a whole, families in Newark were more than 16 times more likely to earn less than $10,000 than over $200,000 a year. Similarly, in Paterson, 16.2 percent of families earned under $10,000 per year, while just 1.4 percent earned more than $200,000 annually.

The Poorest States

1. Mississippi

Median household income: $36,919

$36,919 Population: 2,978,512 (20th lowest)

2,978,512 (20th lowest) Unemployment rate: 10.7 percent (4th highest)

10.7 percent (4th highest) Percent below poverty line: 22.6 percent (the highest)

The median income of the poorest state in the country, Mississippi, was just slightly less than 53 percent of the median income of Maryland, the richest state. Mississippi’s median income--like many states-- fell each year between 2008 and 2011, dropping $2,677 during that time. Not only did Mississippi have the highest poverty rate in the country, but 7.8 percent of Mississippi families made less than $10,000 in 2011, which was also the lowest rate in the country. While unemployment declined in most states between 2010 and 2011, Mississippi’s actually rose 0.2 percentage points, one of only two states to see an increase in unemployment.

2. West Virginia

Median household income: $38,482

$38,482 Population: 1,855,364 (14th lowest)

1,855,364 (14th lowest) Unemployment rate: 8 percent (tied-25th lowest)

8 percent (tied-25th lowest) Percent below poverty line: 18.6 percent (10th highest)

West Virginia’s median income of $38,482 was well off the median income of $40,093 in 2007. The state’s unemployment rate of 8 percent was well below the 8.9 percent nationwide. But, like Kentucky, a softening mining sector in 2012 could weaken West Virginia’s economy. The proportion of West Virginia residents without health insurance grew 4.9 percent, the third-largest increase in the U.S. Fortunately for cash-strapped residents, although the state’s overall cost of living is in the middle of the pack compared to all other states, the cost of groceries is the third lowest in the country.

3. Arkansas

Median household income: $38,758

$38,758 Population: 2,937,979 (19th lowest)

2,937,979 (19th lowest) Unemployment rate: 8 percent (tied-25th lowest)

8 percent (tied-25th lowest) Percent below poverty line: 19.5 percent (4th highest)

While the national median household income fell to $50,502 in 2011, Arkansas was just one of three states where median income remained below $40,000 for the year. Despite an unemployment rate of 8 percent in 2011, nearly one percentage point below the national rate, the 19.5 percent of families lived below the poverty line, one of the nation’s highest rates. Poverty was slightly less of a problem in Little Rock, the state’s largest city, which had a 16.4 percent poverty rate and a median income of $40,976. Despite having the third-lowest cost of health care nationwide at the end of 2011, 17.1 percent of residents lived without health insurance last year--well above the national figure of 15.1 percent.

Washington (CNN) - The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is releasing ""several hundred"" people out of detention facilities to other ""less costly"" forms of supervision because of pending forced budget cuts, the agency said on Tuesday.

Gillian Christensen, a customs enforcement spokeswoman, said the cases were reviewed over the past week as part of agency preparations for $85 billion government-wide cuts due to take effect on Friday absent congressional action to avert them.



""As fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE's current budget,"" she said in a statement.

""ICE has reviewed several hundred cases and placed these individuals on methods of supervision less costly than detention. All of these individuals remain in removal proceedings. Priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety,"" she said.

That move prompted an incredulous reaction from House Speaker John Boehner, who said on CBS the release of detainees was “outrageous.”

""This is very hard for me to believe, that they can't find cuts elsewhere in their agency,” Boehner said, adding: “I'm looking for more facts but I can't believe that they can't find the kind of savings they need out of that department short of letting criminals go free.""

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican and a vocal critic of President Barack Obama, called the move ""pure political posturing and the height of absurdity.""

Republican leaders have criticized Obama administration warnings as scare tactics, but also said the cuts would be bad policy and should be changed. Only rigid fiscal conservatives have backed the concept of mandatory deep spending cuts as a painful first step of deficit reduction.

Obama said on Tuesday in Newport News, Virginia, that the spending cuts are a ""self-inflicted wound"" that do not have to occur. He called on Congress to reach an agreement to avert the harshest impacts.

Separately on Tuesday, Attorney General Eric Holder warned the spending cuts, also called sequestration, would leave Americans ""less safe.""

""We'll do the best that we can to minimize the harm that actually occurs as a result of the sequestration, but the reality is there is going to be harm,"" Holder told the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington.

Holder had barely finished his remarks when the leading Republican on the committee that oversees the Justice Department sent Holder a sharply critical letter about the agency's plans.

Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, cited a recent Holder letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee outlining operational cuts in spending for the FBI and other agencies totaling about $1.6 billion.

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-democrats-back-automatic-debt-limit-hikes-145832075--finance.html,,[],Senate Democrats back automatic debt limit hikes,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted along party lines Tuesday to reject a GOP effort that would have blocked the approved increase in the national debt limit.

The chamber voted 54-45 against the GOP move to try to use a special ""disapproval"" process to block that increase.

The move came as Senate Democrats proposed to avoid future showdowns over the so-called debt ceiling by giving the president authority to authorize additional federal borrowing unless Congress can muster veto-proof margins to block him.

The move by Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, is aimed at heading off future Washington confrontations over increasing the government's borrowing cap. Debt limit battles this fall and in 2011 spooked financial markets and took the government precariously close to a default on its obligations.

""It's time for us to put in place a straightforward process to avoid a catastrophic default on our nation's debt,"" Boxer said, adding that the legislation ""sends a strong message of certainty to the markets, to our families and to the world.""

The Democratic legislation is based on a proposal first unveiled by GOP Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky during the 2011 debt limit battle. But McConnell weighed in against the Democratic plan even before it was unveiled, saying debt increases must be paired with spending cuts or other reforms.

The recently-passed debt limit measure included the mechanism under which the president proposes a debt increase that takes effect automatically unless Congress approves legislation to overturn the move. He could veto that legislation, however.

""Increases in the debt ceiling should be accompanied by reforms,"" McConnell said. ""That's just what we did in 2011, when Congress raised the debt ceiling in return for enacting $2 trillion in bipartisan spending control.""

McConnell is positioned to filibuster the measure if Democrats try to force a vote and the measure is a non-starter with the GOP-controlled House."

House Speaker John A. Boehner bears a great deal of blame for this dismal record, but he can be commended for finally calling out the conservative activist organizations that have been cheering on the congressional drive toward ignominy.

Last week, with Congress on the verge of actually doing something – passing a compromise two-year budget that would avoid another disastrous government shutdown – right-wing groups such as the Club for Growth, Heritage Action and the tea party umbrella organization FreedomWorks demanded that Republicans vote against the spending plan and threatened that a “yes” vote could be used against incumbents in the 2014 GOP primaries.

At long last, Boehner had had enough. In a news conference Wednesday, the speaker hammered the conservative hard-liners, saying: “They’re using our members and they’re using the American people for their own goals. This is ridiculous. If you’re for more deficit reduction, you’re for this agreement.”

In another gathering with reporters Thursday, Boehner took a repeat shot. “I think they’re pushing our members in places where they don’t want to be,” he said. “And frankly, I just think that they’ve lost all credibility.”

Boehner went on to lay blame for October’s government shutdown squarely with the right-wing money groups. Those groups pushed the shutdown as a bold plan, encouraging the tea party faction of the House Republicans to resist more moderate voices in their caucus. “My members know that wasn’t exactly the strategy I had in mind,” the speaker said.

Besides the satisfaction of seeing Boehner smack down the people who have helped turn the Republican Party into a narrow cult of neo-Confederates, it is gratifying to have him lay bare the preposterous lie many of his conservative compatriots tried to foist on the American people at the time of the shutdown. The very right-wingers who engineered the government closure and were eager for a rejection of the debt ceiling raise, including Sen. Ted Cruz, Rep. Michele Bachmann and the whole crew on Fox News, are the ones who tried to pin blame for it all on President Obama. Unsurprisingly, the faction of Americans who live in a paranoid, Obama-fearing bubble eagerly swallowed this canard.

Now, though, the Republican speaker has spoken the truth. One can hope it is the first small step toward the Grand Old Party being restored to sanity and the first sign that Congress is edging toward redemption."

(CNN) —

I blame Kris Kardashian.

Think about it. Doesn’t the most recent episode of “Keeping Up with the Debt Limit” feel more as though it were an E! production than one by C-SPAN? Hasn’t it been as predictable, brief and of itself, as inconsequential as a Kardashian marriage, as odious as Kanye and as certain to lead to unhappiness as Lamar’s reputed drug problem? Doesn’t the pinheaded disconnect from reality seem familiar?

The problem is that it is easier to deal with the Kardashians than their counterparts in the Capitol. We can just change the channel. The reality is, we all depend on the U.S. government in enough ways that letting it turn into a repetitive, meaningless form of basic cable melodrama would be a formula for national catastrophe.

We should therefore try to draw lessons from this round of Beltway follies: what we must fix if our country is not to go the way of Kris and Bruce’s marriage. Here are five critical problems we must address.

1. The political system is broken

Gerrymandering has caused House districts to be essentially “owned” by one party or the other. That makes general elections irrelevant. So it is primary voters who determine who runs, and they tend to be the more energized, activist voters of the left and right wings. The result? Extremes are rewarded and virtually ensured of re-election.

Add to that campaign finance rules that give disproportionate power to big money, and incumbents and Senate rules that give the minority and individual senators too much power, and you have system in which gridlock is virtually institutionalized. We need campaign finance reform, an end to gerrymandering and rules reform in both houses of Congress, and we need to make these initiatives a top political priority of America’s centrist majority.

2. Our national conversation has gotten off-track

Promote extremist politicians and reward them for their extremism, and you get tension, incivility and a reluctance to embrace the compromise that is essential to democracy. Bring in the language of religion and culture wars, and the debate becomes about what divides us rather than what we need to bring us together, about our problems and not about their practical solutions.

Wedge issues then play a greater role in campaigns than new ideas. Opponents become enemies rather than neighbors with alternative views.

We need to defuse the language, edit the loaded terminology, reinvest in the separation of church and state and call out dangerously divisive ideas, racism, sexism and sheer stupidity, like denying science, history or basic arithmetic.

3. Governance has become a lost art

The least-valued skill set in Washington is the ability to actually get things done. We mistakenly believe that articulating a problem is the same thing as solving it. We reward those who give good speeches and not those who have a proven track record of fixing things.

Politicians are too often elected because they advance an ideology, and when they serve, they inevitably focus on what they need to do to be re-elected. But their jobs were created to serve the public, to govern and to lead, even if that means making their positions of power more precarious. We need to start voting for people who have proved their skill at bridging partisan divides and focusing on the needs of the electorate.

4. We are ignoring the really big problems

We are trapped in a cycle of punting problems ahead a few months and chipping away at the margins of issues. When this shutdown/debt-limit crisis is finally resolved, we will have a few months until it recurs. If a deal is struck before another crisis happens, it will be incremental.

Yet America has much bigger issues: a too-slow recovery from a great economic setback, an inability to create good jobs at the rate of past recoveries and, perhaps above all, a failure to address the growing inequality that is dividing our society.

It is not just an economic quirk that 90% of the benefits of the current recovery are accruing to the top 10% of our society; it is a formula for social breakdown and national decline. It is also profoundly unjust. We need to start demanding that leaders address these bigger issues.

5. The American people have failed their government … and each other

You can’t blame the politicians. You elected them. You turned away from the system. You didn’t run for office. You didn’t write your views down and pass them along to people in power. You didn’t fund campaigns that supported people committed to big solutions.

You have become ill-informed, caught up in the name-calling and the partisanship and the climate that created the Washington we have today. You’ve got the government you deserve. Remember, according to the Constitution, the top job in the U.S. government goes to the voter. If these clowns in Washington can’t get it right and you don’t fire them, you deserve what you get.

This is not reality television, even though it feels as pointless. This is just reality. And reality, in this democracy, is what the voters make of it. You can’t blame Obama or Boehner. Scarily enough, the TV screen, whether it shows the Kardashians or C-SPAN or cable news, is just a mirror, a reflection of what America wants and is.

USA TODAY

Rep. Paul Ryan%2C R-Wis.%2C and Sen. Patty Murray%2C D-Wash.%2C led the budget talks

The agreement eliminates the threat of another government shutdown

Conservatives are already lining up in opposition

WASHINGTON — Budget negotiators announced Tuesday a bipartisan deal to set spending levels for the federal government for two years and partially replace unpopular spending cuts with other savings.

House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Budget Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., led the negotiations that had intensified in recent days as a Dec. 13 deadline approaches.

In a joint appearance Tuesday evening in the U.S. Capitol, Ryan and Murray said the agreement would stop the government ""lurching from crisis to crisis"" and eliminate the threat of another government shutdown. The current stopgap funding measure is scheduled to run out again Jan. 15.

President Obama praised the deal as ""a good first step"" and said he would sign it if it reaches his desk.

If approved, the agreement would put the congressional budget process back on track, allowing for passage of the 12 annual bills that cover federal spending other than mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Ryan noted that it is the first bipartisan budget agreement to come out of a divided Congress since 1986. ""This isn't easy,"" he said.

The budget framework sets top-line spending figures for the next two fiscal years and partially replaces for two years the sequester — the across-the-board spending cuts triggered earlier this year following prior failures to reach a budget agreement –– with other cuts and non-tax revenues.

For fiscal year 2014, overall federal spending will be $1.012 trillion and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. The agreement replaces $63 billion in sequester cuts with a combination of other savings, and includes an additional $22.5 billion in deficit reduction.

There is already growing opposition from influential outside conservative groups, and it is unclear how many Republicans would vote for it despite Ryan's endorsement. ""As a conservative, I think this is a step in the right direction,"" Ryan said, ""I think conservatives should vote for it."" Ryan will brief rank-and-file Republicans on Wednesday morning.

Fiscal conservatives have voiced reservations about a spending level higher than $967 billion, which is the level set by the sequester cuts.

""It's disingenuous for Republicans to surrender the only real spending reforms accomplished under the Obama administration, and call that a deal,"" said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks. The group opposes the deal and is urging lawmakers to vote against it.

Senior Republican lawmakers including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, also expressed reservations Tuesday to any deal that increases spending levels. ""My initial reaction is 'no,' "" Hatch said.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., immediately announced his opposition Tuesday evening. ""(The American people) deserve better than this,"" he said in a statement.

House Democrats unsuccessfully sought to use the negotiations as a vehicle to secure an extension of unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of the month. Benefits affecting 1.3 million long-term unemployed workers are set to expire if Congress doesn't act, and the budget deal could be the only vehicle headed to President Obama's desk before the House of Representatives adjourns until the new year on Friday. The Senate is scheduled to be in session next week.

Ryan and Murray said unemployment benefits were not part of their deal, and would need to be settled separately.

Democrats were also likely to lose support within their party because the agreement cuts the federal employee pension system and includes no new tax revenues.

""This plan won't create jobs, get the economy back on track, or meaningfully cut the deficit,"" tweeted Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.

The agreement comes at the end of what has been the most unproductive legislative year in Congress on record, and at a time when congressional approval ratings continue to hover at historic lows.

The agreement is a sign that Congress can still function, negotiators said.

""This bill doesn't solve all of our problems, but I think it's an important step in helping to heal some of the wounds here in Congress, to rebuild some trust, and show that we can do something without a crisis right around the corner and demonstrate the value in making the government work for the people we represent,"" Murray said.

Ford Presidential Foundation']",Drone giant California loses bids for federal testing sites,"WASHINGTON — Although California is home to some of the nation’s biggest drone manufacturers, the state was passed over Monday when the federal government picked six sites across the nation for testing the use of robotic aircraft in U.S. airspace.

The testing is designed to help the Federal Aviation Administration meet a 2012 congressional mandate to open the skies to remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, by 2015.

Disappointed California officials were at a loss to explain their failure to land a test site, though some suggested the state didn’t do enough to win in the fierce nationwide competition. The state lost out to Alaska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Virginia and — adding salt to the wound — longtime rival Texas.

California was the only state with two groups submitting bids — one based in Ventura County and the other in Kern County.

“How California was left off the list, I haven’t got a clue,” said Bill Buratto, who, as president and chief executive of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. helped pitch a bid for a test site in California. “It would seem to me that the FAA would look favorably on California.”

California was thought to be a front-runner, given its rich aerospace history and the presence of major military drone makers, such as AeroVironment Inc. of Monrovia, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. of Poway, and Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp., both of which build drones in Palmdale. Many of the military’s newest drones take to the skies for the first time at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert.

The FAA has estimated that 7,500 small drones could be aloft within five years, with industry officials predicting they could be used for such things as spotting wildfires, scouting film locations and delivering pizza.

In a conference call with reporters, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the agency considered a number of factors such as geographic and climatic diversity, availability of ground infrastructure, the types of proposed research and the volume of air traffic near the test sites.

Asked about the decision to reject the California proposals, he declined to say what was lacking in the losing bids. He said there would be no comment from the government until FAA officials can debrief the unsuccessful bidders.

“What we were really looking for was how do we select six that give us the broadest base of different airspace configurations, different traffic configurations and different climates,” Huerta said.

Although the test site designation offered no federal money, groups in 24 states competed for it. The groups saw it as an opportunity to generate jobs from a burgeoning industry — and a matter of prestige.

Some states allocated money to promote their bids.

Brook Taylor, spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown’s Office of Business and Economic Development, said the governor’s military council offered its strong support and the state worked directly with both applicants to strengthen their bids.

Winners were ecstatic. Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) said the designation would “put our state on the world map when it comes to this exciting emerging technology.’' Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, in a tweet, called the selection a “historic moment” for his state.

The competition was smart on the government’s part, because it raised awareness about the emergence of commercial drones and built coalitions between state and local politicians to push the technology forward, said Peter W. Singer, author of “Wired for War,” a book about robotic warfare.

“It’s a huge step for the advancement of the industry,” Singer said. “It makes the future of the technology and the political, legal and ethical questions all the more real.”

Drones, which have played an increasing role in military combat around the world, have also begun to take on new commercial roles, often going where it’s too dangerous for a pilot in a cockpit.

They have helped measure radiation in the wake of the meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, penetrated the eyes of hurricanes to gather scientific data and helped firefighters see hot spots during wildfires. The FAA has also allowed limited surveillance uses for a few police agencies.

Currently, drones are not allowed to fly in the U.S. except with special permission from the FAA. The agency said there are 545 active certifications for such flights, many involving educational and scientific uses.

As drone technology becomes more advanced, demand has increased from police agencies and others for using drones. Oil and gas companies want to utilize them to keep an eye on their pipelines. Farmers in Japan already use small drones to spray their crops with pesticides. The idea of using drones as transport vehicles has been discussed as a way to deliver tacos and Domino’s pizza.

This month, online retail giant Amazon.com unveiled a plan to use small drones to deliver packages weighing no more than 5 pounds into customers’ hands in half an hour or less. It was the first time that a big-name retailer offered a compelling vision for using the technology.

Although drone technology has evolved, many questions remain, including safety and privacy concerns. The FAA has said that remotely piloted aircraft aren’t allowed in national airspace on a wide scale because they don’t have an adequate “detect, sense and avoid” technology to prevent midair collisions.

The test sites will work toward accomplishing that goal, which had been a concern of the Air Line Pilots Assn., the world’s largest pilot union that represents nearly 50,000 pilots. The group said drones should be integrated into national airspace only after it could be shown that the aircraft, pilots and operators meet the same high standards as other commercial aircraft operations.

The Assn. for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a drone trade group, has long touted the economic benefits of the proliferation of the technology. The association issued a study last year that found, as a result of the existing aerospace infrastructure in the state, California is positioned to create more than 12,000 jobs and realize an economic impact of $2.39 billion in just the first three years after integration.

There are other hurdles as well. The prospect of robotic aircraft flying over communities has generated cries of spies in the skies — and prompted legislation from city halls to Congress to restrict their operations.

The FAA said Monday that test-site operators will be required to obey laws protecting an individual’s right to privacy. But ACLU staff attorney Catherine Crump said that the FAA’s requirement that test sites have privacy policies was not enough.

“Someday drones will be commonplace in U.S. skies and, before that happens, it’s imperative that Congress enact strong, nationwide privacy rules,” she said.

Selected as the test site operators were the University of Alaska, which will work with groups in Hawaii and Oregon to conduct testing in those states too; Griffiss International Airport in upstate New York; North Dakota’s Department of Commerce; Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi; and Virginia Tech, which also will be testing with groups in New Jersey.

The first testing site is expected to be up and operating in 180 days.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes issued a verbal ruling which is expected to be followed by a written opinion later Tuesday.

""The city no longer has the resources to provide its citizens with basic police, fire and emergency services,"" Judge Rhodes said, ruling that Detroit, once the nation's fourth-largest city, ""was and is insolvent.""

The long-awaited decision sets up a bitter battle between the city’s finance officials and its unions, creditors and retirees, who expect deep cuts in pensions and sales of treasured city assets, such as its art collection, as part of the Chapter 9 process.

""It's a sad day for the people of Detroit,"" American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees attorney Sharon Levine told CNBC's Scott Cohn in an interview outside the courthouse. She said the AFSCME filed an immediate appeal.

In the meantime, Detroit’s emergency financial manager, Kevyn Orr, is expected to proceed towards the city’s next major step: submitting a plan to adjust Detroit’s approximately $18 billion in debt. Judge Rhodes said he will not stay the bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of any possible appeals.



Orr, who had testified the city's current conditions are ""unacceptable,"" released a statement praising the judge's ruling and pledging to ""press ahead with the ongoing revitalization of Detroit.""

Judge Rhodes read for 90 minutes from his 140-page ruling before issuing the court's decision.

His ruling listed the city's long litany of financial woes, including the loss of manufacturing jobs and population in recent decades.

""As of April 2013, about 48 percent of the city's street lights were not working,"" he said. ""In 2012 the average police response time was 30 minutes; in 2013, 58 minutes; and the national average is 11 minutes.""

There were a number of wrinkles in the judge's ruling. Among other things, Judge Rhodes said Detroit did not negotiate in ""good faith"" with the unions to whom the city owes money -- normally a prerequisite for allowing bankruptcy.

At the same time, he noted the obstinacy of the unions in the negotiation process saying that the city could not realistically negotiate with a ""stone wall.""

Rhodes' decision is a critical milestone. He said pensions, like any contract, can be cut, adding that a provision in the Michigan Constitution protecting public pensions isn't a bulletproof shield in a bankruptcy.

The city says pension funds are short by $3.5 billion. Anxious retirees drawing less than $20,000 a year have appeared in court and put an anguished face on the case. Despite his finding, Rhodes cautioned everyone that he won't automatically approve pension cuts that could be part of Detroit's eventual plan to get out of bankruptcy.

Orr, a bankruptcy expert, was appointed in March under a Michigan law that allows a governor to send a manager to distressed cities, townships or school districts. A manager has extraordinary powers to reshape local finances without interference from elected officials. But by July, Orr and Gov. Rick Snyder decided bankruptcy was Detroit's best option.



Detroit, a manufacturing hub that offered good-paying, blue-collar jobs, peaked at 1.8 million residents in 1950 but has lost more than a million since then. Tax revenue in a city that is larger in square miles than Manhattan, Boston and San Francisco combined can't reliably cover pensions, retiree health insurance and buckets of debt sold to keep the budget afloat.

Donors have written checks for new police cars and ambulances. A new agency has been created to revive tens of thousands of streetlights that are dim or simply broken after years of vandalism and mismanagement.

While downtown and Midtown are experiencing a rebirth, even apartments with few vacancies, many traditional neighborhoods are scarred with blight and burned-out bungalows.

Besides financial challenges, Detroit has an unflattering reputation as a dangerous place. In early November, five people were killed in two unrelated shootings just a few days apart. Police Chief James Craig, who arrived last summer, said he was almost carjacked in an unmarked car.

CNBC.com and CNBC's Scott Cohn contributed to this report, as did Reuters.

Peters']",Bipartisan Budget Deal Forged in House Faces Opposition in Senate,"But considering the deal has been hailed for days as a critical turning point in Washington’s dysfunctional descent, its difficulties are a surprise. So far, Senator John McCain of Arizona is a declared Republican supporter, with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, a likely yes, at least to end debate and allow a final up-or-down vote.

“I’m not O.K. with it, but I think it’s better than shutting down the government,” Mr. McCain said.

The trouble with the budget deal came as the Senate worked past another political crisis. The partisan tension over a rules change that limited the power of the filibuster and infuriated Republicans eased Friday as both parties said they were calling a weekend cease-fire that will allow them to move on to more pressing issues next week like the unfinished budget and a major Pentagon policy bills.

If the mood for most of the week was sour, on Friday senators seemed more exhausted than anything else, having endured two late-night sessions in a row. Because senators were on the floor at virtually all hours, they worked in shifts. Democrats occupied the presiding officer’s chair while Republicans took turns speaking from the floor to denounce what they said was an effort to stifle debate and dissent.

But the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, announced late Friday morning that he would allow senators to go home for the weekend and return Monday evening to continue voting on a backlog of President Obama’s nominees. By Tuesday they could start debating the budget bill. They also would likely vote on the nomination of Janet L. Yellen to lead the Federal Reserve.

“We’re doing our utmost to finish our business here a week from today so that we can go home for Christmas,” Mr. Reid said. “I personally thank the senators for their cooperation this week.”

Mr. McCain summed up the thaw, saying: “Both sides didn’t want to work over the weekend. Come on! The zeal sometimes dissipates when you get into Thursday. And by Friday, it’s gone.”"

The report from Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee charged that the Treasury Department-administered program has ""failed"" in its goal of putting Americans to work.

""Billions of dollars have filled the coffers of overseas firms while the evidence of the promised permanent jobs and economic growth here in the United States is scarce,"" the report said.

The program is separate from the Energy Department fund that gave nearly $530 million to failed solar panel firm Solyndra.

This one sprung out of the 2009 stimulus package, and offers cash payments to alternative energy companies worth 30 percent of any given project's cost. The money is available for everything from solar to wind to geothermal to fuel cell projects.

According to the report, though, nearly one-quarter of the $16 billion approved to date has been for U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms. The money went to several Spain-based companies, as well as those in Japan, Germany, France and Italy.

Nearly $1.8 billion, for example, went to various wind energy projects across the country under the U.S. division of Spain's Iberdrola Renewables, according to the study.

Republican lawmakers say the program is effectively aiding foreign competitors, with money the U.S. government arguably does not have.

""With $16 trillion in debt, we cannot afford to send one out of every four taxpayer dollars overseas for a program that has failed to create the jobs promised,"" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the committee, said in a statement.

The program, though, nevertheless was funding projects in the United States that largely employed U.S. workers. According to a July 2012 status report, more than 45,000 projects were funded at the time -- presumably more have been funded since. The projects have also helped boost the country's electricity generation from renewable sources.

Nancy McLernon, president of the Organization for International Investment, said the House report mischaracterizes the economic benefit of U.S. subsidiaries.

""U.S. subsidiaries are not rivals of U.S. industry, they're an important part of it,"" she told FoxNews.com. ""This is in-sourcing.""

McLernon said U.S. subsidiaries, across all industries, directly employ 5.3 million people in the U.S., and said the committee report gave a ""terribly wrong impression"" of their integration with the U.S. economy.

She said U.S.-owned companies likewise can take advantage of certain government aid abroad, but said it's ""very hard to put a flag on a company.""

Energy Department spokesman Bill Gibbons also defended the grant money, saying the program has directly benefited the U.S. economy and boosted U.S. wind power.

""All of the recipients of 1603 funds are U.S. taxpayers and all of the projects funded are located in the United States. Therefore, every single project that has received funds to produce clean energy generation here in the United States is directly creating investment in America and domestic jobs,"" he said. ""That's true for every corporate tax credit or deduction -- not just the ones that our critics don't like.""

Previously, renewable energy companies could collect tax credits for their projects -- the provision in the stimulus bill turned that into cash payments. The program was then extended through 2011, but money is still being paid out for projects that began during that period.

The so-called 1603 program has also recently come under scrutiny after it was revealed that several solar panel companies were issued subpoenas as part of a federal probe into whether they overcharged for their work in order to squeeze more stimulus money out of taxpayers.

The investigation was revealed last year by one of the subjects in the probe, California-based SolarCity. The company disclosed in an SEC statement that it and others had received subpoenas from the Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General. The company has claimed it is not aware of ""specific allegations of misconduct"" but acknowledged the investigation."

Frank Lucas, R-Okla., speaks at a news conference in the Capitol where he and others primarily expressed support for victims of the Oklahoma tornado. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

WASHINGTON -- Republicans in the House of Representatives removed food stamps from broader farm legislation in hopes that doing so would make it easier to pass a separate bill cutting nutrition assistance. But now there's a chance the House won't vote on a food stamp bill at all.

House Agriculture Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) told the Oklahoma Farm Report Wednesday that so far, House Republican leaders have been unable to muster the votes they need to pass a bill reforming the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

""Right now that equation is not there, and discussions are still going on,"" Lucas said. ""My friends on the left don’t want to have any reforms and my friends on the right want dramatically more reforms than probably are achievable in this environment.""

For decades, rural and urban lawmakers have joined forces to pass farm bills that include both agribusiness subsidies and nutrition assistance for poor people. That arrangement has broken down with the rise of tea party Republicans who are hostile to the food stamp status quo, as the Great Recession pushed the program's enrollment to 47 million people. Last month, a traditional farm bill collapsed on the House floor largely because Democrats willing to accept modest cuts withdrew their support in the wake of a Republican amendment seeking to make the cuts harsher.

This month, House Republicans passed a ""farm only"" farm bill without any Democratic support. Lucas started preliminary negotiations with Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) about how the fractured House bill might be combined with the traditional farm legislation that passed the Senate earlier this year.

Lucas said he doesn't want to wait for the House to pass SNAP legislation to begin the formal conference committee process with members of the Senate.

""My personal goal is by some point next week, if it’s quite clear that consensus cannot be achieved, if it’s just not achievable, then I think we need to recognize that fact and move on conferencing the bill that the Senate’s passed and the House has passed and see what evolves from that,"" Lucas told the Farm Report. ""But right now [we're] still trying to achieve consensus. That consensus is at the very least elusive. It might even be impossible. But I’m still trying.""

A House Republican leadership aide suggested that House Republicans wouldn't hurry to conference with the Senate.

“We are still moving forward with member discussions to develop SNAP reforms that have consensus and get these programs back on track so they can be there for the most vulnerable,"" the aide told HuffPost. ""Those discussions will likely continue into August and we will readdress it when we return back after recess.""

If House leaders appoint conferees without approving nutrition legislation first, those lawmakers would probably have less leverage to push for food stamp cuts in the conference committee. Both chambers would have to approve the committee's eventual compromise legislation.

The Senate bill cut nutrition assistance by $4 billion, or less than 1 percent of the program's $800 billion cost over 10 years. Before it was amended, the House bill would have cut SNAP by $20 billion. Without new legislation, the food stamp program would likely continue with no cuts at all -- an outcome Lucas has tried to warn his colleagues about."

Jerry Brown’s budget proposal may be too optimistic, but California’s finances still have shown dramatic improvement, the Legislature’s top financial advisor said Monday.

Legislative Analyst Mac Taylor said the state is likely to generate $2.1 billion less in revenue and savings than the governor is counting on. But after years of catastrophic deficits, that’s a relatively small gap in an estimated $97.7-billion proposal, he said.

“That’s not a startling difference,” said Taylor, who called the governor’s plans “reasonable.”

Brown and Taylor both see California’s finances on the upswing, but they’ve differed on how fast the finances are improving. The governor says the state’s deficit already has been wiped out; in November, the analyst projected a $1.9-billion budget gap this year.

Taylor did not back away from that estimate in his Monday report but described it as a “small problem” -- “not big enough at this point to worry too much.”

H.D. Palmer, spokesman for Brown’s Department of Finance, said the analyst’s report is proof the governor is taking the right approach. “Living within our means, paying down debt and strengthening education are the right policy choices for California,” Palmer said in a statement.

Taylor raised some concerns. The end of the federal payroll tax cut could lower economic activity, taking a bite out of tax revenue. A drawn-out fight in Congress over raising the debt ceiling could cause a slump in the stock market.

He also noted that Brown’s proposal “does nothing” to address mounting costs for teacher pensions and retiree healthcare. “There’s no plan as to how we pay those off,” Taylor said.

Unfunded obligations in the teachers’ pension fund were estimated at $64.5 billion over 30 years. For retiree healthcare, the estimate was $62.1 billion.

In addition, Taylor said, Brown’s plan could burn through much of California’s potential surplus, leaving the state without a cushion. Then, “if you get to the point where you have a downturn,” he said, “you’ll need to go back on those spending commitments.”

Assemblyman Jeff Gorrell (R-Camarillo), vice chairman of the Assembly budget committee, said California will need financial breathing room when the temporary taxes that voters passed in November expire in 2019. Otherwise, Gorrell said, the state could face “another massive deficit.”

Palmer said the administration’s own estimates show the state having healthy surpluses through 2017.

Taylor’s most pointed criticism involved Brown’s plan to use new revenue from Proposition 39, which changed how corporate taxes are calculated, to make schools more energy-efficient.

Because the ballot measure said projects would be selected based on energy savings and job creation, devoting the money to schools may not give the state the most bang for its buck, according to the report.

“The governor’s proposal very likely would not maximize state energy and job benefits,” it said.

Taylor did not offer alternatives.

http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-07/news/ct-met-illinois-pension-reform-1108-20131108_1_pension-system-pension-bill-pension-shortfall,2013-11-07 00:00:00,"['Ray Long', 'Hal Dardick', 'Chicago Tribune Reporters']",State pension crisis fix is pushed back again,"— As expected, Illinois lawmakers left the Capitol on Thursday without a resolution to the state's $100 billion public worker pension debt and without a clear time frame for reaching an agreement to rein in the costs of the nation's worst-funded retirement system.

The pressing issue remains on hold as legislative leaders try to negotiate a solution. The message repeated throughout the week is that the next key step is getting answers from number crunchers projecting how many billions of dollars can be saved by each potential tweak to complex pension plans that could affect hundreds of thousands of current and retired government workers.

""We're waiting for the experts,"" House Speaker Michael Madigan said as he walked into his Capitol office.

Before leaving, lawmakers did send Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn a measure to deal with the Chicago Park District's pension shortfall, a win for Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

In Springfield, there are several provisions being discussed. Among them: providing a 401(k)-style option for some current and future workers; phasing in a higher retirement age for many workers; and giving more help to longtime, low-wage workers. The expectation is that the framework of a 401(k)-like option would be roughly cost-neutral, but people familiar with the negotiations say the biggest calculations include the other concepts.

Those ideas come on top of a pension framework put together by a bipartisan, House-Senate panel. The group suggested cost-of-living cuts, a freeze of one-to-five years of those annual pension bumps and limiting how much of a salary could count toward a pension. Also suggested was cutting the amount of money workers would have to kick in toward their retirement in the hopes of passing constitutional muster.

All told, the earlier provisions were estimated as saving as much as $138 billion over 30 years. Now number crunchers are turning their calculators toward the latest ideas under consideration by leaders. Lawmakers also must decide how much of the projected savings could be immediately poured back into the pension system if changes are made.

It was a challenge to get to this point. Madigan had pushed through his chamber a plan worth more than $160 billion that is aimed at bringing the system to full funding in 30 years. Senate President John Cullerton had won passage of his own plan. It came with the endorsement of worker unions but saved the state less: $58 billion over 30 years and funded the system at 90 percent.

Neither plan passed both chambers. Back when Quinn faced a potential primary challenge from Bill Daley, the governor suggested the little-used conference committee approach to the pension problem. The governor continues to want a pension bill, but has toned down his rhetoric with lawmakers since Daley decided not to run.

As with many big issues, any deal requires agreement among the four leaders. Lawmakers are not scheduled to return to the Capitol until January, but a return in a few weeks remains possible. ""Most people feel we should vote on the bill when we have the votes,"" Cullerton said.

But they've learned from experience that they need to get the numbers right.

More than a decade ago, then-Gov. George Ryan and legislative leaders sweetened the pot of benefits to induce workers to retire early. More than 11,000 people took the deal, and the costs went through the roof.

Even after Madigan's latest pension plan passed the House last spring, a mistake in the cost savings estimates was discovered. The savings ended up about $24 billion less than lawmakers believed.

But there's political math involved too. In the Senate, Democrats hold a 40-19 majority, but many Democratic members are reluctant to cut the pension benefits of unionized government workers too deeply.

Cullerton has said he hopes to supply as many as 18 votes and wants Republican leader Christine Radogno to provide 12 to hit the minimum 30 to pass the Senate.

Radogno said it is important to complete a deal soon. ""It will inject some stability into our state economy,"" Radogno said.

Also Thursday, the Senate sent to Quinn a measure to overhaul Chicago Park District pension benefits. The bill, following negotiations between workers and management, would require employees to pay more, the district to put more tax money into the retirement system and raise the retirement age for some workers. The bill also would freeze cost-of-living adjustments every other year for three years beginning in 2015.

Emanuel hopes it's a template for other, larger city pension systems — a view not shared by many unions.

""The cuts in this bill are unfair and unconstitutional,"" said Henry Bayer, the head of the state's powerful American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31.

Mike Shields, president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, and Tom Ryan, president of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union, also dismissed the idea that the Park District pension overhaul could serve as a model to preserve the system.

""Pension legislation is not one size fits all,"" Shields said.

Paul Ryan is emerging as the key congressional Republican in negotiating with Democrats to solve Washington’s two fiscal crises with a plan that only delays efforts to defund ObamaCare, not derail them.

Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is proposing a plan to increase the federal debt that is tied largely to simplifying the tax code, make enough changes to Medicare to offset cuts to domestic spending and defense programs and a solid promise from Senate Democrats and President Obama to continue talks about reopening the federal government.

Failure to increase the debt limit within roughly the next week would result in the country defaulting on its debt for the first time in history. The partial government shutdown started Oct. 1.

“I'm working to get a budget agreement,” Ryan told a group of conservatives meeting this weekend in Washington. “We need to completely rethink government’s role in helping the most vulnerable. … That means we can never give up on repealing and replacing ObamaCare.”

His remarks, in a video message for the Value Voters summit, were reassuring to conservatives concerned that Ryan in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed piece seemed to have abandon the idea of defunding or altogether dismantling ObamaCare as part of fiscal negotiations -- considering how hard they, led by Tea Party favorites Sens. Ted Cruz, Texas, and Mike Lee, Utah, worked to garner support for the effort.

Still, Ryan appears to have support from establishment and conservative Republicans as well as a good relationship with Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, with whom he has yet to meet on the fiscal issues but will likely negotiation with her.

House Republicans pitched a plan to the White House on Thursday night to approve a short-term debt-ceiling increase, but President Obama pushed back because it did not address the partial shutdown.

Senate Republicans are now crafting an alternate proposal that deals with both. It includes a provision dealing with ObamaCare, but is far short of what Cruz campaigned for -- and advocated with a 21-hour address on the Senate floor last month.

The Senate on Saturday planned to take up a one-year extension of the debt limit. Democratic sponsors, though, may have difficulty advancing the measure given the ongoing negotiations.

The emerging proposal comes from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and others. It would propose a six-month extension of government spending, a repeal of the health care law's medical device tax and greater flexibility for agencies to deal with across-the-board spending cuts in effect this year.

Returning from a two-hour meeting at the White House, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Friday that the session with Obama was useful and he hoped that Senate Republicans could find a way out of the impasse.

Where the budget and debt talks go from here is unclear. Obama called House Speaker John Boehner at mid-afternoon Friday, and Michael Steel, a spokesman for the leader of House Republicans, said, ""They agreed that we should all keep talking.""

Jay Carney, the president's press secretary, said Obama ""appreciates the constructive nature of the conversation and the proposal that House Republicans put forward. Yet, the spokesman said, ""He has some concerns with it.""

Statewide, 52% of the respondents said the $68-billion project to link Los Angeles and San Francisco by trains traveling up to 220 mph should be halted. Just 43% said it should go forward.

The poll also shows that cracks in voter support are extending to some traditional allies, such as Los Angeles-area Democrats, who have embraced the concept of high-speed rail as a solution to the state’s transportation problems. The survey results suggest that the current plan and its implementation are of specific concern to those voters, according to officials with the Republican and Democratic firms that jointly conducted the poll.

“I don’t think they are against the concept, but they are against the way it is being executed,” said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a Democratic polling firm in Washington.

The massive project has fallen a year behind schedule and is facing lawsuits that threaten to stall the momentum of the project and a groundbreaking now likely to come early next year.

The new findings mirror a USC Dornsife/L.A. Times poll taken last year, just before the state Legislature approved funding to start construction, under political pressure from the Obama administration and the state’s Congressional leaders. At that time, state rail officials argued that public backing would increase as improvements to the rail plan became clear.

But a wave of new support hasn’t materialized. Instead, signs of buyer’s remorse among voters for approving a 2008 ballot measure to fund the current project have increased. The poll found 70% of respondents want the project to be placed back on the ballot — up from the 55% measured in last year’s USC Dornsife/L.A. Times poll.

As public opposition solidifies and the start of construction nears, the question of whether the state should go forward with one of the biggest and most technically difficult infrastructure projects in California history is taking on greater urgency.

“It should have public support to go forward,” said former state Sen. Quentin Kopp, a former champion of the rail project who has become one of its most influential critics. “The lack of support reflects a general disbelief of the authority leadership, which has become a public relations game.”

Kopp, who served for years on the California High-Speed Rail Authority board, said the agency will almost certainly need another bond measure to complete construction, making public opinion potentially crucial to the project’s survival.

The results include some good news for the project. A 61% majority said the bullet train would help reduce traffic on highways and at airports, and 65% said it would create jobs. And by one measure, public opposition appeared more pointed last year. At that time, 59% of poll respondents said they would vote against high-speed rail if it were on the ballot, though they were not asked whether the project should be stopped.

Rail agency officials declined to be interviewed. Spokeswoman Lisa Marie Alley said in a statement: “We will continue to uphold the will of the voters, Legislature and federal administration to help modernize California’s transportation system and create tens of thousands of new jobs.”

Fifty-one percent of respondents called the project a waste of money, and 63% said they would never or seldom use it. Given the choice, 58% of voters would rather fly or drive from Southern California to the Bay Area, and 39% would take a bullet train.

Voter concerns about the project have been heightened by the tough economic times that continue across the state, the poll shows.

“Over the last five years, voters have had to tighten their belts, and they feel the government should be doing the same thing,” said David Kanevsky of American Viewpoint, the Republican firm that helped conduct the poll for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and The Times.

Poll respondent Lara Erman, a Burbank resident, cited those concerns as the basis of her opposition to the project. “Our state and our country are in a lot of trouble right now with the condition of the economy and the job market,” she said. “It would be better served as a private enterprise project.”

Bryan Koenig, an aircraft mechanic in Ridgecrest, said he objects to the project mainly because he won’t use it and “the cost is exorbitant.”

The bullet train network is supposed to begin carrying passengers between the Bay Area and Los Angeles by 2028. Construction was supposed to have begun late last year, but it now appears it will not begin until 2014, assuming a court ruling does not sidetrack it. A Sacramento County Superior Court judge ruled this summer that the state violated the legal protections imposed by the 2008 voter-approved bond measure that will provide $9 billion in funding. A second ruling, due this fall, would determine how to remedy the violation.

The sampling of 1,500 registered voters conducted in mid-September found significant differences in voter opinion about the project across the state. In Southern California, 56% of respondents said they want the project stopped. Even in the Bay Area, where support has historically been strong with the backing of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, only 51% endorsed the project. The margin of error in the poll was 2.9 percentage points.

Nowhere is the project more controversial than in the Central Valley, where farmers, businessmen and homeowners have formed coalitions to overhaul or derail it. Even though Gov. Jerry Brown touts the benefits to the Central Valley, 59% of voters there want to call it off, according to the poll. Opposition is even stronger in the Northern California counties, where 61% say it should be killed.

“The best thing for Brown is to have one of the lawsuits stop the project until he leaves office,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC.

The poll also asked about a quixotic proposal by high-tech businessman Elon Musk, chief of Space Exploration Technologies and Tesla Motors, for a tube-type transport system, called the Hyperloop, that would move people between L.A. and the Bay Area in 30 minutes at a cost of $20 per trip. Sixty-five percent of the respondents said the proposal was not realistic. Nonetheless, they liked the idea, and 55% said they would take the Hyperloop, compared with only 13% who would opt for the high-speed rail.

The so-called ""Penny Plan"" would, according to its sponsors, balance the federal budget in two years by using just a 1 percent reduction in spending.

The lawmakers are pitching the plan in the simplest terms -- cutting a penny from every dollar the government spends so that spending will soon equal revenue. They cast the plan as a pick-and-choose alternative to the sequester's across-the-board budget cuts.

""Everybody should be able to live with one percent less in order to help bring this country back from the brink of catastrophic failure,"" bill sponsor and Wyoming Republican Sen. Mike Enzi said in submitting the legislation just before August recess.

Enzi is joined by fellow GOP Sens. Rand Paul, of Kentucky; John Barrasso, of Wyoming; Jim Risch, of Idaho; David Vitter, of Louisiana; Johnny Isakson, of Georgia; and Marco Rubio, of Florida. Republican Georgia Rep. Austin Scott introduced similar legislation in the House.

Senate sponsors warn that federal spending over the past 11 years has increased from 18 percent of the country's GDP to nearly 23 percent. And without intervention, they say, the national debt will go from roughly $16 billion to $25 billion by 2023, increasing interest payment so much that balancing the budget will go ""beyond the reach of Congress.""

The 1 percent cut would last two years, followed by a cap on total annual spending -- equal to roughly 19 percent of GDP. Supporters say it also will cut spending over roughly 10 years by about $5.8 trillion, based on currently projected levels.

The senators say only that the plan takes a ""worst first"" approach to the cuts -- in other words, leaving it to lawmakers to cut what they deem the most wasteful items first -- as long as the overall 1 percent cut is achieved.

Enzi has frequently talked about reducing spending by eliminating ineffective, outdated and redundant federal programs.

""You don't need five agencies doing the same thing, especially when their programs could be combined or cut,"" Enzi spokesman Daniel Head told FoxNews.com.

However, the bill singles out only entitlements.

""Absent reform, the growth of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other health-related spending will overwhelm all other federal programs,"" the bill states.

This is not the first time the plan has surfaced on Capitol Hill.

Enzi proposed similar legislation in 2011 with then-Florida Republican Rep. Connie Mack that also got Paul's support.

Paul refreshed the idea in March during his Tea Party response to President Obama's State of the Union address.

The idea is backed largely by conservative groups including FreedomWorks and the Tea Party Patriots. It also garnered support during its Capitol Hill debut from former Clinton administration aide Lanny Davis, who said the plan also needs a revenue-raising component but was ""practical"" and seemed like ""a good place to start.""

Still, the plan does not appear to enjoy widespread support among progressives.

Jim Dean, chairman for Democracy for America, called the plan ""one of the more idiotic pieces of legislation"" put forth by Congress' Tea Party-aligned lawmakers.

""Americans are smart enough to see it for what it really is: a stealth effort to gut our dwindling retirement security by slashing over $1 trillion from Social Security and more than $200 billion from Medicare,"" he told FoxNew.com.

Washington has meanwhile made progress on cutting the federal deficit, largely through recent spending cuts and tax increases, including the hike in January on Americans' highest earners.

After topping $1 trillion for four straight years, the budget is projected to fall to $642 billion in the budget year ending in September and shrink even further in the next several years before starting to grow again at the end of the decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

However, the Republican senators warned that entitlements if left unchecked will ""consume"" the additional tax revenue.

The sequester was supposed to be something new in Washington: a budget cut you couldn’t beat. Once it hit, it hit. The money was gone, and nobody could get it back.

That turned out to be true — for about three weeks. Then somebody beat it.

Last week, President Obama signed a spending bill that gave the Agriculture Department’s food inspectors what everybody else wanted: a get-out-of-the-sequester card. Their program got $55 million in new money, which replaced almost all of what the sequester took.

There’s a story there, about how power and lobbying can still make money appear in Washington, even in this age of austerity. It started with sharp political theater.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack insisted that the sequester would force him to shut down all U.S. meat production on at least 11 days.

View Graphic How sequestration will impact federal departments

The inspectors union didn’t believe that. Neither did many in the powerful meat lobby. But they were too worried not to help Vilsack anyway. After an extensive campaign, the Senate gave Vilsack the money.

So the sequester can be hacked. Now, other interest groups are waiting: police officers, airport executives, Border Patrol agents. The question is: Can it be hacked again?

“It is those who make the most noise that sometimes succeed,” said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who failed in his push to exempt small air traffic control towers from the effects of the sequester. “I thought I’d made a lot of noise,” Moran said. Until he saw he had lost and the meat lobby and Vilsack had won.

This was not, of course, the way sequestration was supposed to turn out. Back in 2011, it was designed to exempt some areas of government: welfare, food stamps, Social Security, veterans programs. But where it cut, it was supposed to cut like a razor, clean and even:

Defense programs lose 7.3 percent across the board. Non-

defense spending programs lose 5.1 percent.

Nobody could get out. Because then, everybody would want out. And the sequester was meant to force a gridlocked Washington to come up with something else.

“We need a big fix. And once you start making everybody happy, you lose the leverage in a negotiation” for a bigger deal, said a Republican aide in the House, speaking anonymously to explain the GOP leadership’s thinking. The even spreading of the pain “was the whole point of sequestration to begin with,” the aide said.

Of course, Washington is not a place where people sit back and accept equal treatment. Since sequestration began taking effect on March 1, some programs have lobbied for little victories, taking a bigger piece of their department’s smaller pie.

Corrections officers persuaded the Justice Department to shift more money their way, eliminating the threat of furloughs. The Pentagon found $10.4 billion, so furloughs for civilian employees were reduced. But none of them got Congress to give them money to replace what the sequester took. That trick was pulled off, somehow, by the workers who inspect animal carcasses.

The campaign to do it began in early February, when the sequester was still weeks away. Earlier than many other Cabinet secretaries, Vilsack began describing in detail how badly his department would be hit.

“In our food safety area . . . we will have to furlough workers for a period of a couple of weeks,” Vilsack said, speaking to an agriculture industry conference in Las Vegas. “The problem is, as soon as you take an inspector off the floor, that plant shuts down.”

He had details: There could be $10 billion in lost production and more than $400 million lost worker wages. Diners would be affected, too; beef and poultry would get scarcer. “Food safety could be compromised,” he said.

In the world of meat, people took notice. But a lot of them thought Vilsack was stretching the truth.

Even the meat inspectors’ union doubted he would make good on the promise of shutting plants down. Federal law requires the Agriculture Department to provide inspectors when a plant is running. A budget cut is not a valid excuse to stop, said Trent Berhow, an official with the inspectors union. “If the federal government truly did put the inspectors out of the plant, the industry would sue the hell out of them,” he said.

But Vilsack kept insisting, although he reduced the number of possible furlough days from 15 to 11. In a House hearing, lawmakers tried to get him to admit there were other, less drastic alternatives. Couldn’t he cut other costs instead? Couldn’t he furlough inspectors one region at a time, instead of nationwide?

No, Vilsack said. The sequester law tied his hands. There was one solution: “Just give us the resources,” he said.

“That’s not the option, Mr. Secretary, as you well know,” said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).

“Well, see, now, that’s a choice you all are making, all right?” Vilsack said.

His strategy worked. The union — although still skeptical — began urging that the furloughs be prevented. The meat industry also began to worry. What if Vilsack really did pull the inspectors and shut the plants?

Living animals would start backing up, unable to be slaughtered on schedule. They would consume extra feed, extra space, extra money.

“We had accused the secretary of using America’s cattlemen and women as pawns in his political wrangling of Congress,” said Chase Adams of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. “We still stand by that.”

But despite that, the cattlemen started to advocate for Vilsack’s cause. So he succeeded?

“There, you got us,” Adams said. “Because that’s it. He got what he wanted.”

The effort was joined by the National Chicken Council, the National Turkey Federation and the American Meat Institute, heavyweights of one of Washington’s powerful agriculture lobbies. In the Senate, their cause was picked up by two influential senators from strongly agricultural states: Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).

Those two found a solution: $55 million in new money that had been meant for other Agriculture Department programs. Blunt and Pryor wrote an amendment that would give it, instead, to the meat inspection program. This was sequester-proofing. After the sequester took its cut, the meat-inspection program would be left with almost as much money as it had before.

They built support in the Senate. They checked with the House to make sure that GOP leaders would go along with the idea there. It all worked. “Fortunately, chickens know no political boundaries,” said one Democratic aide involved in that process.

Finally, the day came. The victory — like most in the backroom-dealing Senate — appeared utterly undramatic when it happened.

“All those in favor say ‘Aye,’ ” said Sen. William “Mo” Cowan (D-Mass.). There was a chorus of ayes. “The amendment is agreed to.” Last week, after Obama signed the bill, the Agriculture Department passed the good news to the inspectors: The furloughs won’t happen. There will be meat.

Now, leaders in both houses of Congress insist that no more exceptions will be made. But a number of other interest groups believe they will be the next. “We’re going to keep fighting with our friends on the Hill to find a solution,” said Spencer Dickerson, executive director of the U.S. Contract Tower Association. “Aviation safety shouldn’t be politicized.”

His cause is the same as Kansas’s Sen. Moran: 149 control towers at small and medium-size airports that the Federal Aviation Administration announced it will shutter. It has lost out, so far — partly because the administration says it wants a long-term solution, not just a short-term stay of execution for these towers.

U.S. Park Police officers, facing 14 days of furloughs, are also hoping to get themselves protected. Their union is seeking $5 million, far less than the meat inspectors.

They don’t have a powerful lobby behind them. But now they know it can be done.

“The only thing we can do is try to get our message out to members of Congress to fund us, like they funded the other agencies that got a break,” said Ian Glick, the union’s chairman.

President Obama criticizes the sequester%2C %2485 billion in automatic budget cuts

Obama blames Republicans for allowing sequester by blocking tax hikes on the wealthy

Republicans say Obama would rather raise taxes than cut spending

President Obama blamed Republicans on Saturday for $85 billion in automatic budget cuts over the next seven months, saying the GOP is unwilling to help reduce the federal debt by raising taxes on the wealthy.

""It's happening because Republicans in Congress chose this outcome over closing a single wasteful tax loophole that helps reduce the deficit,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address.

Republicans returned the favor, saying Obama would rather raise taxes than cut major spending programs.

""The American people know full well that if they give this White House more tax revenue, it will be spent on new stimulus projects and government programs,"" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., in the GOP radio address.



The parties hit the airwaves a day after Obama and congressional leaders met at the White House but did not strike a deal to avert the automatic cuts known as the sequester, $85 billion in both domestic and defense programs.

In his radio address, Obama said the cuts will ""inflict pain on communities across the country,"" costing jobs and slowing growth.

Thousands of federal employees, including Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, and Defense Department employees, face furloughs and lost wages, Obama said. The cuts will hurt programs for education, research, and defense.

The White House, working with its Office of Management and Budget, have notified Congress and others of specific items within the $85 billion to be cut over the next seven months, the remainder of the current fiscal year. Letters are also going to out to governors, grantees and others who receive federal money.

The parties did appear to make progress on avoiding another potential budget standoff down the road -- the March 27 expiration of the continuing resolution that is funding the government; failing to renew it would lead to a budget shutdown.

In statements after Friday's White House meeting, Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, expressed optimism that the spending resolution would be extended and a shutdown avoided.

On Saturday, Obama echoed his call for a ""balanced"" budget plan to reduce the federal debt that now exceeds $16.5 trillion. His plan includes both spending cuts -- including reforms to Medicare and other entitlement programs -- as well as eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy.

""That's how we can reduce our deficit without laying off workers, or forcing parents and students to pay the price,"" Obama said.

Republicans said Obama got higher income tax rates as part of the January agreement to end the last budget impasse, the so-called fiscal cliff.

""Instead of campaigning for higher taxes, the president should lead an effort to begin addressing our nation's spending problem,"" said Rodgers, who chairs the House Republican Conference.

The sequester originated as part of a 2011 agreement to break yet another Obama-Republican budget impasse, raising the debt ceiling.

The idea: Require a series of automatic cuts, split between defense and domestic programs, so onerous that the parties would be forced to come up with a plan to cut more than $1 trillion off the debt in 10 years. They have failed to do that."

The news of the “tapering” of Fed bond purchases sent stock prices soaring, this on the notion that the US economy is improving. Would that it were so.

Cardiff Garcia of FTAlphaville reports that the FOMC reduced slightly the rate of bond purchases:

Beginning in January, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than $45 billion per month.

The trouble is that Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen, and the rest of the FOMC remain in fantasy land when it comes to the causes of our shared economic malaise. While parts of the US economy are doing pretty well, the housing and financial sectors are in a terrible funk. Read the last installment of Washington & Wall Street, “Regulation Likely to Slow the Housing Recovery in 2013,” if you want the gnarly details.

There are a couple of basic problems with how American economists and investors look at the economy and issues such as consumer demand. For example, consider this statement by the FOMC last week:

Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint may be diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Really? The liberal/socialist view of demand-side economists championed by the likes of Paul Krugman holds that a failure by government to spend (and borrow) more is somehow restraining the US economy. In reality, however, we are in a period of extended economic hangover following from the housing boom of the 2000s, when many jobs were supported by speculative credit creation and equally dicey housing activity, both in the US and internationally. Just read the frightening article from The New York Times, “Irish Try to Eradicate Ghosts of a Housing Crash,” and the idea is clear. All of the bad debt behind the housing boom ultimately came about due to the irresponsible Fed money expansion policies under Alan Greenspan.

Decelerating consumer spending (and higher saving) in the private sector and shrinkage of credit private are causing poor job creation, but the good news is that real production and real job creation are slowly coming back. Yet the neo-Keynesian socialists led by Krugman et al. want to put the US economy back on a heroin drip of public spending and higher deficits to immediately stimulate consumption.

Truth be told, the only way to really fix the US economy in a stable, long-term fashion is to focus on fiscal reform and deficit reduction. When they consider the statement above that inflation is running below the Fed’s targets, all economists should be given pause.

Even though the US central bank has grown its balance sheet 300% since 2008, the pace of economic activity continues to fall even as financial bubbles proliferate around the world. Even with interest rates near zero and the Fed monetizing most of the Treasury’s debt issuance, the only accomplishment of the FOMC has been to create financial bubbles in everything from single-family homes to the ersatz currency known as Bitcoin. In a very real sense, the soaring value of Bitcoin vs. the dollar tells you that financial inflation is brisk even as deflation haunts the real economy.

The cost of living for all Americans continues to rise, but the volume of spending and all transactions generally is still anemic, even falling. Consider this chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showing the velocity of money, which has been falling rapidly since 2007 and is now at the lowest level since the Great Depression.

“The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period,” notes the St. Louis Fed. “In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy. The frequency of currency exchange can be used to determine the velocity of a given component of the money supply, providing some insight into whether consumers and businesses are saving or spending their money.”

While the majority of the FOMC thinks or at least says they believe that the reduction in government spending is responsible for the lax economic environment, in fact it is a function of the end of 20 years of credit-fueled boom facilitated by the Fed. The speculative “Bitcoin Economy” is surging – at least for now – but the real economy continues to deflate. Americans are shunning the consumer economy, paying down debt, and pulling back on spending more than they earn. The members of the FOMC think this is bad for some reason. Only when the Fed and Congress focus on spurring real growth via tax and spending cuts will we see growth in real jobs and spending that is sustainable."

The idea is a new approach, one that shifts away from the Republican-held position that cuts alone can be used to solve the nation’s deficit problems. It is a long-shot.

“Republicans would be open to a plethora of alternatives,” said Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.), among those conservative lawmakers who voted against the original sequester deal. “I would prefer to have this magnitude of cuts, just not in this manner.”

Republicans have repeatedly sought to stop new regulations coming from the Obama administration, particularly those governing clean air and water at the Environmental Protection Agency, which lawmakers argue are bad for business.

QUIZ: How much do you know about sequestration?

The Republican majority in the House approved dozens of bills last session to prevent tougher emission requirements on industrial boilers, cement manufacturers and other industries, only to see the legislative efforts largely stall in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Aides say there remains a big appetite among Republicans to ensure businesses are not faced with new requirements. Going after regulations could find favor among some Democrats who might join Republicans in hoping to protect home-state industries.

Such an approach remains unlikely to prevent Friday’s scheduled cuts, as virtually no negotiations are underway on the “balanced” approach of new tax revenue and spending cuts Obama insists on to rein in deficits.

The White House is not convinced House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) could rally his severely divided Republican majority to pass an alternative to the “sequester” cuts, which are scheduled to begin slicing 13% off defense accounts and 9% from other domestic spending. Nonpartisan economists project the ripple effect would cost 750,000 jobs this year.

While Democrats have divisions within their ranks over Obama’s tax proposals, Republicans are split between the defense hawks, who want to spare the Pentagon from cuts, and the deficit hawks who see the sequester as their best chance to achieve spending cuts that have eluded them in the past showdowns with the administration.

Any money saved by rolling back regulations would be difficult to quantify. Experts have said loosening regulations could provide long-term savings to industry, but could also be a mixed bag if those are offset by costs to public health.

One thing Republicans do agree on is that Obama’s team came up with the sequester in 2011, when the president and Boehner were negotiating an earlier budget deal.

The sequester was seen as a last-ditch option – cuts so painful to both sides that they would be forced back to the negotiating table to devise an alternative. That never happened as Obama insisted on asking wealthier Americans and corporations to pay more taxes, and Republicans held firm for a cuts-only approach.

Both parties voted that summer to approve the sequester, expecting the other would yield to an agreement. Neither did.

Stevenson'],Republican Governors Open New Front in Tax Debate,"Overhauling the tax system is the subject of endless talk and little action in Washington. But as Republican governors in a range of states start to act aggressively on the issue, they are setting up limited but politically ambitious and potentially telling experiments in what might be possible nationwide.

On Washington National politics and policy.

It is not just that they are cutting taxes. It is how they are taking tentative steps toward rebalancing what kinds of taxes their states rely on.

In Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal is pushing to repeal the state’s personal and corporate income taxes and make up the lost revenue through higher sales taxes. Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska is calling for much the same thing in his state. Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas wants to keep in place what was supposed to be a temporary increase in the state sales tax to help pay for his plan to lower and eventually end his state’s income tax.

Those governors and others going down the same general path are justifying their proposals on many grounds. These include making their states more competitive in attracting employers and high-skilled workers, simplifying their tax systems and resisting pressure for more government spending as their economies and tax revenues recover gradually from the recession.

For Mr. Jindal and other Republican governors who have an eye on a presidential run in 2016, there are obvious political benefits to having a robust tax-cutting record to present to conservative primary voters.

But they are also taking small first steps into a fundamental debate over what kind of tax system most encourages – or least discourages – growth in a 21st-century economy.

In particular, they are focusing more attention on the idea, long championed mostly by conservatives but accepted up to a point by economists of all stripes, that the economy would be better served by focusing taxation on consumption rather than on income. And as they do so they are reigniting an ideological conflict about whether it is possible to move away from a system built around progressive taxation of income without benefiting the wealthy at the expense of middle- and lower-income people.

“The question of whether we should tax income or whether we should tax spending is really a proxy for a different debate,” said Joseph Henchman, vice president for state projects at the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning research organization. “Everyone agrees we’ll get more growth with consumption taxes. It’s just that some people prioritize fairness.”

Democrats are criticizing the approach taken by Mr. Jindal, Mr. Heineman, Mr. Brownback and other Republican governors on exactly those lines. Since lower-income families spend a much greater proportion of their income than wealthier people, any shift in taxation toward sales or consumption taxes hits people on lower economic rungs relatively more heavily than upper-income households.

“These aren’t pro-growth policies — they’re shell games that reward the wealthiest Americans at the expense of everyone else,” said Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors’ Association. “They slash critical investments in education and public safety, cost us jobs, and crush opportunity for middle-class families.”

It is not clear whether any of the Republican proposals will make it into law; even in states with Republican-dominated legislatures, governors face difficulty as they pursue their proposals because changing the tax code almost invariably creates losers as well as winners.

In addition to keeping a higher sales tax, Mr. Brownback has proposed that Kansas help pay for income tax cuts by rescinding deductions for mortgage interest and property tax payments, drawing opposition even from members of his own party. Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia is battling to save his plan, announced this month, to end the state’s gasoline tax and make up the revenues by increasing the sales tax.

And just as President Obama has raised income tax rates on upper-income families, Democratic governors including Martin O’Malley of Maryland, Jerry Brown of California and Deval Patrick of Massachusetts have supported or implemented income tax increases on the wealthy.

The shift toward greater reliance on sales taxes is not universal among Republican governors. Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma would rely largely on projections of economic growth to help offset her plan for lower rates and an eventual end to her state’s income tax.

“I don’t believe greater reliance on the sales tax is likely to be a broad trend in the country, although we may see it in some places,” said Don Boyd, a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government who tracks state fiscal policies. “In recent years voters and politicians have generally shown in a variety of ways that they have been more willing to support tax increases on higher-income taxpayers than on the broad populace.”

The shift toward sales taxes in some states is incremental, and nowhere near the scale or complexity that would characterize adoption of a federal consumption tax, whether a value-added tax, a national sales tax or any of the other variations that have been proposed and debated over the years.

But where it is happening, the results could resonate in other states and in Washington.

“First, a broad-based consumption tax distorts economic activity less than an income tax (particularly than income taxes on business income),” R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the business school at Columbia University and a former top adviser to President George W. Bush, said in an e-mail. “Second, income taxes at the state level (particularly highly progressive ones) lead to boom and bust revenue cycles that are difficult for states to manage.”

The debates going on in the states, he said, “offer suggestions for federal tax reform, too.” He specifically cited proposals for marrying a broad-based national consumption tax with a wage tax on high earners to address concerns about fairness.

Mr. Jindal, whose status as a likely candidate for the White House in 2016 has drawn particular attention to his proposal, has signaled that he wants his plan to be revenue neutral, meaning that every dollar of revenue lost from eliminating the personal and corporate income tax would have to be made up elsewhere. The only viable source for making up most of the money is raising the state’s sales tax.

“We want to keep the sales tax as low and flat as possible,” Mr. Jindal said in a statement this month outlining his approach.

He has not yet settled on any specifics for changing the sales tax, and his aides say he would include safeguards to assure that lower-income people are not made worse off. “With consumption taxes, it’s all in the details,” said Tracy Gordon, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who follows state tax and spending policies.

By focusing on sales tax revenue, Mr. Jindal has also opened up what many economists see as a fundamental issue for states. Sales taxes were developed in an era when sales of physical goods dominated the economy.

These days, the economy is built far more around services than goods. Hair spray is taxed, but not haircuts. So if states – or one day the federal government – want to shift toward a truly broad-based consumption tax, they would have to expand the definition of what people consume.

Officials in Louisiana have indicated that Mr. Jindal is at least open to looking at broadening the scope of the sales tax to include some services, potentially creating a new avenue for rethinking the tax system on both the state and national levels.

“If the sales tax is going to stay a viable source of revenues for state governments, you have to bring in services,” Mr. Henchman said. “It’s not just haircuts and tattoo parlors. It’s lawyers and accountants and real estate agents.”"

Neither side is right.

Most of the pension funds in extreme crisis (including those in Illinois, Kansas, Detroit and Chicago) got that way not because of the pension system itself but rather because elected officials failed to make the annual required contributions needed to keep funds solvent. Skipping these payments was politically expedient during the Great Recession, but the unpaid bills compounded quickly.

The amounts now owed to some of the worst-funded plans, like Detroit’s, are beyond the realistic ability of their sponsoring governments to pay. This, of course, infuriates union members who note, accurately, that if the bills had been paid on time, the crisis wouldn’t exist, at least in its present proportions.

California has a different problem. Here, it is not possible for local agencies to defer or reduce their required contributions to the California Public Employees Retirement System, or CalPERS. California’s pension problems have much more to do with pension enhancements. This was a major factor, but far from the sole cause, of bankruptcies in Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino.

Before pension formulas were increased in 1999, the typical police and fire employee accrued 2% for each year of service as long as the employee retired at 50 or later. A person who started as a firefighter or police officer at 20, say, could retire at 50 with 60% of his or her pay. The post-1999 enhanced formula adopted by most jurisdictions statewide was 3% for each year worked if they retired at 50 or later. This meant that those same 30 years were now worth 90% of salary, a 50% jump.

2013 ENDINGS: Columnist Patt Morrison on what she won’t miss

On average, cities and counties in California pay about 35% of every police and fire salary dollar as the employer contribution to CalPERS. Employees themselves contribute an additional 8% to 12%. This is why California’s pension system is not in a crisis, despite what the anti-union critics say. Our local governments and their employees are making contributions totaling 40% to 50% of salary to keep the state’s pension system solvent.

But it’s easy to see why governments are having a hard time shouldering the financial burden. That burden has been made harder by CalPERS’ decision to slowly ratchet back its investment return and other assumptions to more conservative positions. This will further improve CalPERS’ financial situation (which is already pretty good), but employer rates will also rise. The total contributions of employer and employee may one day hit nearly 60% of a salary.

This is the part of the problem that unions have been loath to recognize.

More than 40% of the pension contribution made by cities and counties for police and fire employees is attributable to the increase from pension enhancements, which raised the payout after 30 years of employment from 60% to 90%. For a medium-sized suburb with 100 sworn police officers and 50 sworn firefighters earning an average base pay of $80,000 annually, the difference between the old pension formula and the new amounts to $1.8 million a year.

Reforms enacted last year in California trimmed back pensions for new hires to a level roughly similar to the pre-1999 levels. But the rub for employers is that because these new formulas apply only to new employees, it will take at least 10 years to realize significant savings. In the meantime, governments will be funding the higher-formula employees throughout their working life and retirement.

Still, the new pension formulas will eventually bend the cost curve downward. What they won’t do, but should, is require an increase in the percentage that employees have to pay.

It would not be unreasonable to ask the grandfathered employees to increase their contribution to, say, one-third of the employer-employee total. This might mean a very high employee contribution of 20%, but it would still be a bargain considering it buys a lifetime pension of 90% of very generous pay.

In the end, neither side’s extreme rhetoric comes close to accurately describing the situation. Conservatives who lay the blame for the bankruptcies of Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino solely at the feet of employee pensions must understand that many factors led to these cities’ insolvency, including huge losses of tax revenue, population flight and inflexible salary increase requirements embedded in their charters. The vast majority of cities and counties in California are not on the same path as Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino.

By the same token, employee unions have to accept that the enhanced benefit formulas for public safety employees are not sustainable without increased employee cost-sharing. It is true that none of these benefit enhancements was a secret deal; they were publicly adopted contracts considered in the full sunshine by elected officials only too willing to curry favor with employee unions at the time, especially police and fire unions. But there is a point at which such generosity is unsustainable when coupled with other major cost generators and tax losses, as we saw in varying degrees in San Bernardino, Stockton and Vallejo.

There is a realistic and moderate solution, however.

Conservatives need to dial down the rhetoric and stop trying to use pensions as a Trojan horse to abolish public employee unions. They also need to accept that defined-benefit pension plans with firm guarantees for the future are good public policy if managed prudently. Union members need to acknowledge that, in order to keep some very favorable benefits, they will have to contribute more of their own pay. They also need to accept that state and local governments have limits: salary, benefits and job security have to remain in line with a city’s actual resources.

That’s all it would take. If only it weren’t politically unacceptable to both sides.

The meeting of the minds took place a little more than a week before lawmakers will return to Springfield for a special session on the issue, though just what their return will accomplish is unclear if there's no plan to vote on.



To that end, Senate President John Cullerton said Quinn has asked him to re-introduce legislation that would combine two differing approaches, the idea being if one portion of the legislation is thrown out by the court the rest of the measure would stand.



One portion of the proposal would push back retirement dates, ask employees to pay more for benefits and scale back annual cost of living increases. The other portion would allow workers and retirees to keep their health care and receive reduced benfits, or keep their current pension plan but give up health care. The measure would not go into effect for another year, meaning it would only need a simple majority to pass instead of three-fifths support.



Cullerton said it was unclear if his new proposal would have the votes needed to pass the Senate. Even if it did, Madigan made no promise to call the measure before the House.



Cullerton acknowledged there was not an agreed way forward, but said ""we're going to proceed anyway.""



Quinn, meanwhile appealed for Madigan and Cullerton to work together to send him a bill, saying they have historically had no problem pushing through legislation addressing their priorities.



""They know how to work together when they want to, so now it's time for them to apply that same approach, that same attitude to comprehensive pension reform,"" Quinn said.

Standoff is costing taxpayers millions of dollars per day

Surprise%3A D.C. is not most affected by the impasse

But the state in the top spot is nearby

With America two weeks into the government shutdown temper tantrum, politicians have mostly acted like spoiled children — retreating to their rooms of incompetence and only coming out to collect their allowances. The standoff is costing taxpayers millions of dollars per day, with some states feeling the effects more than others.

In order to gauge which parts of the nation are taking the biggest financial hits from the shutdown, WalletHub conducted a study by using several key data sources, including federal workers and contract dollars per capita, small business lending per capita, social security payments per capita, and number of veterans per capita. Interestingly, the report finds that states won by the Republican Party in the 2012 presidential election could feel the most pain with a prolonged government shutdown, as 15 Red States ranked in the top 25.

""There will be plenty of angry constituents for politicians to answer to,"" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub and CardHub CEO. ""Let's just hope they get the message before we set the economic recovery back too far or allow partisan politics to ruin America's good name with investors worldwide."" Here's a look at the top 10 states or regions affected by the government shutdown, or areas that will be affected in the case of a prolonged shutdown, according to WalletHub.

10. Hawaii

Hawaii is the tenth most affected state. It ranks number one in the real estate category due to the large role housing plays in the local economy. Staffing shortages at the Federal Housing Administration and the inability of lenders to verify income via tax returns could deliver a blow to loan closings during the government shutdown period.

9. Idaho

Idaho is the ninth most affected state. It also ranks ninth for the state with the most federal contracting dollars per capita, and eighth for Small Business Administration loans. During the furlough period, non-excepted employees at the SBA will no longer be permitted to utilize SBA email or other federal resources — delaying the loan process.

8. Colorado

Colorado is the eighth most affected state. It has heavy exposure to federal contracting dollars and Small Business Administration loans.

7. New Mexico

New Mexico is the seventh most affected state. It ranks sixth in states with the most federal employees per capita, and fourth in states with the most federal contractors.

6. Maryland

Maryland is the sixth most affected state. It has the second highest amount of federal employees per capita, and the fourth most federal contract dollars per capita. Furthermore, Maryland is the third state most heavily exposed to the real estate market.

5. Maine

Maine is the fifth most affected state. It has heavy exposure to SBA loans, social security funding, and real estate. Maine is also the fifth state with the most veterans per capita.

4. District of Columbia

The capital of the United States is not a state, but still worth mentioning since it's at the epicenter of the political temper tantrum. It ranks fourth overall, and is the most affected area of the nation when it comes to federal employees per capita.

3. Alabama

Alabama is the third most affected state. It ranks fourth in states with the most Social Security funding, and eight for the most FAFSA applications per capita. While the shutdown hasn't affected social security payments, benefits could be interrupted if the shutdown drama bleeds into the debt ceiling debacle and Congress fails to raise the debt limit.

2. Alaska

Alaska is the second most affected state. It ranks third in states with the most federal employees per capita and federal contracting dollars per capita. It's also the fourth most affected state by disruption of SBA loans, and contains the most veterans per capita of any state. Veteran Affairs estimates that 3.8 million veterans will not receive their disability payments next month if the government shutdown extends into late October.

1. Virginia

Virginia is considered to be the state most affected by the government shutdown. It has heavy exposure to federal employees and federal contracting dollars. Virginia also has the second most veterans per capita."

And, as a result, not too exciting. This is especially apparent when, as at a forum I attended last week, he is seated next to Anthony Weiner, who plays the hyperbolic huckster with such enthusiasm that he seems to be auditioning for a summer-stock production of “Elmer Gantry.” Thompson is, in his demeanor and his approach to public service, the anti-Weiner — even-keeled, not self-aggrandizing, careful, decent. His favorite adjective seems to be “balanced.” His oratory rarely rises above a simmer. (“No one will ever accuse him of being inflammatory,” Chris Smith dryly observed in New York magazine.) It is easy to forget that in 2009 he ran a close challenge to the seemingly invincible Michael Bloomberg despite being outspent 14 to 1.

His positions generally fall in the middle of a decidedly liberal Democratic pack. Christine Quinn promises to build 40,000 units of affordable housing; Bill de Blasio promises to “build or preserve” 200,000; Thompson, wouldn’t you know, comes in at 120,000. On education, where he speaks with some authority as a former president of the Board of Education, he is a moderate reformer: for charter schools, the Common Core and testing accountability, but for attempting to save failing schools before closing them, and for treating teachers as partners in reform rather than intransigent slackers. (His mother was a public-school teacher, and he has an endorsement from the teachers’ union.)

For a revealing demonstration of the Thompson way — his manner of taking the heat out of a hot-button issue — consider his handling of the police tactic called stop-and-frisk.

Stop-and-frisk, or, as its advocates prefer, stop-question-and-frisk, is as old as policing. Bill Bratton, the former New York police commissioner, former Los Angeles chief of police and the go-to policing guru for mayoral candidates of both parties this year, says the practice is indispensable and uncontroversial when done right: it should be based on a reasonable suspicion, it should be done with respect, and it should be employed consistently. In Los Angeles, which has a famously assertive police force and a population at least as diverse as New York’s, Bratton says stop-and-frisk is routinely employed with little protest."

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-rta-united-american-airlines-lawsuit,0,2644876.story",,"['Kathy Bergen', 'Richard Wronski']","RTA accuses United, American of running 'sham' to avoid taxes","The Regional Transportation Authority on Monday accused United Airlines and American Airlines of running ""sham business operations"" that have deprived Chicago and Cook County taxpayers and public transportation agencies of nearly $300 million during the past seven years.



The allegations reignite the RTA's long-running battle to stop what it sees as tax-dodging in Illinois -- a campaign that has experienced some setbacks. Efforts to get the tax code changed by the Legislature have stalled. And a legal challenge by the state's Department of Revenue and the RTA to a similar tax arrangement in Putnam County have been rejected in circuit and appellate courts. The state and the RTA are asking the Illinois Supreme Court to hear an appeal.



In its most recent move, the RTA alleges that United and American operate offices in the DeKalb County city of Sycamore to avoid paying higher tax rates that would be applied from their offices in Chicago. These small, part-time offices are rarely occupied and, in at least one case, don't appear to even have a computer, the RTA said.



Both airlines claim they purchase their jet fuel, one of their largest expenses, from those offices, the RTA stated.



The RTA filed suit in Cook County Circuit Court against Chicago-based United, while deferring formal action against American, noting that the airline, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is in bankruptcy proceedings.



Both airlines and the city of Sycamore said their tax arrangements are legal under Illinois law.



""The operation of our fuel subsidiary in Sycamore has been examined by tax authorities in the past and has been determined to comply with all applicable laws,"" United said in a statement. ""We will vigorously defend ourselves against any such claims.""



Sycamore said it also intends to defend its position. American declined to comment on pending litigation.



Joe Costello, RTA executive director, said: ""We are looking to have United Airlines pay the sales tax that they legally owe. That sales tax supports public transportation and services for the city of Chicago and Cook County. It supports services that firms like United use themselves.""



The RTA estimates the tax agreements have cost it $96 million since 2005 while they deprived the city of Chicago $133 million and Cook County $60 million. The agencies overseen by the RTA -- the CTA, Metra and Pace -- rely on sales tax revenue to operate mass transit in the six-county region.



Cook County and the city of Chicago are studying the case, officials said Monday.



The tax practice by the two biggest airlines at O'Hare International Airport was first reported by the Tribune in August 2011.



Illinois is among a handful of states where sales tax is applied where a purchase offer is accepted rather than where a product is delivered to the customer. That quirk in the law creates an opportunity for companies to relocate the site of sales transactions to a lower-tax venue, some of which also offer rebates.



Sycamore has a total sales tax rate of 8 percent, of which 2.75 percent goes back to the municipality, while the rate in Chicago is 9.5 percent. Under their agreements with Sycamore, United and American jet fuel companies also recoup the lion's share of the Sycamore's portion.



United received a $17.9 million reimbursement in Sycamore's 2012 fiscal year, while American received $14.1 million, according to city budget documents. Sycamore retained $837,000.



The RTA 18 months ago filed similar lawsuits against Kankakee and Channahon, which have similar tax rebate agreements with retailers and other airlines. Those lawsuits are pending.



But allegations of tax-dodging by local companies date at least to 2008, when the Illinois Department of Revenue challenged the Hartney Fuel Oil Co.'s claim that its sales office was in the tiny village of Mark, in Putnam County, where there was no local sales tax.



The state's revenue department contended that Hartney's business took place at its longtime office in west suburban Forest View, where sales orders of about $200 million a year were processed and fuel shipped by a related company.



The issue was first reported by the Tribune.



A Putnam County judge ruled in favor of Hartney, and the ruling was upheld on appeal. Now the state, the RTA and the village of Forest View are asking the Illinois Supreme Court to take it up.



Meanwhile, the RTA will continue talking with legislators about potential changes to the tax code, said Jordan Matyas, the agency's chief of staff.



The issue is a divisive one, pitting some Downstate and suburban legislators against those from Chicago.



Previous efforts at compromise have stalled.



But the RTA won approval last summer for legislation that requires local governments to inform the public about its sales tax rebate agreements.



""That was a first step,"" Matyas said, ""to show the Legislature how widespread the practice is.""

For Representative Austin Scott, an ardent conservative Republican from Georgia, it’s Ken’s Trading Company, where the profit margin on a Leupold rifle scope is lower than the sales tax too many Georgians are avoiding by shopping for the same scope on their computers.

“We respect their opinion. I’m glad they’re there as conservatives,” Mr. Scott said of the antitax groups. “But the fact of matter is, in the end we have a job to do.”

For opponents of the bill, the impotence of the antitax arguments has been a revelation.

“I don’t think any one group drives an issue. It’s the issue itself,” said Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, whose state is one of five with no sales taxes. “What does surprise me, put aside the groups for a minute, is that there are people who describe themselves as conservatives who are going to support this act, when regardless of how you look at it, whether your state has a sales tax or not, it’s going to put some fairly rigorous and onerous requirements on online businesses to collect taxes for other states. That’s counter to conservative principles.”

The Internet sales tax is not the first battle such groups have lost, but it might be one of the clearest. In 2010, just before all of the Bush-era tax cuts were first set to expire, President Obama and Senate Republican negotiators reached agreement to extend all of the tax cuts for two years, except one.

The estate tax had actually expired. Rather than have it reborn at the relatively high top rate of Bill Clinton’s era, negotiators allowed it to come back at a considerably lower rate. It was still a tax increase from zero, but not as big as it could have been. Mr. Norquist blessed it.

He took his argument even further this year when all those tax cuts expired again. This time, Mr. Obama insisted that tax rates rise considerably on upper-income families’ wages, estates, capital gains and dividends. Almost all Republicans saw that as a tax increase, and a big one, but Mr. Norquist — seeing that passage was inevitable — again declared that the deal did not violate his group’s no-new-taxes pledge since letting all the tax cuts expire would be worse."

The Federal Reserve will begin circulating a redesigned %24100 bill this fall

It will have several new security features

The %24100 is the most-counterfeited bill

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it will begin circulating a redesigned $100 bill this fall, more than two years after its initial target.

The Fed has set a target date of Oct. 8. The redesigned note incorporates added security features, such as a blue, 3-D security ribbon and a disappearing Liberty Bell in an inkwell. The features are designed to thwart counterfeiters.

The revamped bill had been expected to go into circulation in February 2011. But in December 2010, officials announced an indefinite delay. They said they needed more time to fix production issues that left unwanted creases in many of the notes.

""We made numerous process changes to address the creasing issue and we are back in full production,"" said Dawn Haley, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

Haley said those changes include modifying the paper feeder on printing presses to accommodate variations in the paper associated with the 3-D security ribbon. The blue security ribbon is composed of thousands of tiny lenses. Those lenses magnify the objects underneath them to make them appear to be moving in the opposite direction from the way the bill is being moved.

Benjamin Franklin's portrait will remain on the $100 bill, the highest value denomination in general circulation and the most frequent target of counterfeiters.

The $100 bill is the last note to undergo an extensive redesign aimed at thwarting counterfeiters who have access to ever-more sophisticated copying machines.

The redesigns began in 2003 when the government added splashes of color to the $20 bill. That makeover was followed by redesigns for the $50, $10 and $5 bills. The $1 bill isn't getting a makeover.

An extensive public education effort is planned for businesses and consumers around the world to raise awareness of the new design and provide information on how to use the new security features.More information about the redesigned $100 bill can be found at newmoney.gov."

She Has Written Two Books', 'Demon Fish', 'Travels Through The Hidden World Of Sharks', 'Fight Club Politics']","IRS targeted groups critical of government, documents from agency probe show","At various points over the past two years, Internal Revenue Service officials singled out for scrutiny not only groups with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names but also nonprofit groups that criticized the government and sought to educate Americans about the U.S. Constitution, according to documents in an audit conducted by the agency’s inspector general.

The documents, obtained by The Washington Post from a congressional aide with knowledge of the findings, show that the IRS field office in charge of evaluating applications for tax-exempt status decided to focus on groups making statements that “criticize how the country is being run” and those that were involved in educating Americans “on the Constitution and Bill of Rights.”

The staffers in the Cincinnati field office were making high-level decisions on how to evaluate the groups because a decade ago the IRS assigned all applications to that unit. The IRS also eliminated an automatic after-the-fact review process Washington used to conduct such determinations.

Marcus Owens, who oversaw tax-exempt groups at the IRS between 1990 and 1999, said that delegation “carries with it a risk” because the Cincinnati office “isn’t as plugged into what’s [politically] sensitive as Washington.”

Owens, now with the firm Caplin & Drysdale, said that before the agency’s most recent reorganization, it had a series of “tripwires in place” that could catch unfair targeting, including the fact that the IRS identified its criteria for special scrutiny in a public manual.

View Graphic A report due this week says the IRS targeted groups with names containing “tea party” and “patriot.”

“There’s no longer that safety valve, and as a result, the IRS has been rolling the dice ever since,” said Owens, who worked at the agency for nearly a quarter-century and now represents some organizations seeking tax-exempt status.

The IRS came under withering attack from GOP lawmakers Sunday. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican, described the practice as “absolutely chilling” and called on President Obama to condemn the effort.

“This is truly outrageous,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” adding that even though White House spokesman Jay Carney has said the matter deserves an investigation, “the president needs to make crystal clear that this is totally unacceptable in America.”

In March 2012, then-IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, told Congress that the agency was not targeting conservative groups. On Sunday, the agency declined to answer questions about whether senior officials asked IRS exempt organizations division chief Lois G. Lerner and her staff in Cincinnati about this heightened scrutiny before testifying it did not take place.

“There has to be accountability for the people who did it,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” adding: “And, quite frankly, up until a few days ago, there’s got to be accountability for people who were telling lies about it being done.”

The appendix of the inspector general’s report — which was requested by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and has yet to be publicly released — chronicles the extent to which the IRS’s exempt organizations division kept redefining what sort of “social welfare” groups it should single out for extra attention since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. That decision allowed corporations and labor unions to raise and spend unlimited sums on elections as well as register for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, as long as their “primary purpose” was not targeting electoral candidates.

The number of political groups applying for tax-exempt status more than doubled in the wake of the Citizens United ruling, forcing agency officials to make a slew of determinations despite uncertainty about the category’s ambiguous definition.

Of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny, according to the congressional aide, 72 had “tea party” in their title, 13 had “patriot” and 11 had “9/12.” Lerner, who apologized Friday for the targeting of such groups, described it as a misguided effort to deal with a flood of applications for tax-exempt status. She did not release the names of the groups.

On June 29, 2011, according to the documents, IRS staffers held a briefing with Lerner in which they described giving special attention to instances where “statements in the case file criticize how the country is being run.” She raised an objection, and the agency adopted a more general set of standards. Lerner, who is a Democrat, is not a political appointee.

But six months later, the IRS applied a new political test to social welfare groups, the document says. On Jan. 15, 2012, the agency decided to look at “political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding Government, educating on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, social economic reform movement,” according to the appendix in the IG’s report.

The agency did not appear to adopt a more neutral test for 501(c)(4) groups until May 17, 2012, according to the timeline in the report. At that point, the IRS again updated its criteria to focus on “organizations with indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention (raising questions as to exempt purpose and/or excess private benefit.)”

Campaign reform groups have been pressing the IRS for several years to conduct greater oversight of nonprofits formed in the wake of the Citizens United case, given that many have become heavily involved in elections. “But this isn’t the type of enforcement we want,” said Paul Ryan, a senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center. “We want nonpartisan, non-biased enforcement.”

Loyola Law School professor Ellen Aprill, who specializes in tax law, said any groups that have applied for tax-exempt status has “opened themselves up to scrutiny” by the IRS. “It’s part of their job to look for organizations that may be more likely to have too much campaign intervention,” she said. “But it is important to try to make these criteria as politically neutral as possible.”

Aprill said one of the problems is the agency’s top officials have not provided clear enough guidelines on what constitutes too much political activity for a social welfare group because it’s been “a hot potato,” and that now with this new controversy, “it’s going to make it even more difficult to do so.”

Toby Marie Walker, president of the Waco Tea Party, said the IRS subjected her group to a series of unreasonable requests after it applied for tax-exempt status in June 2010. The requests came in early 2012, Walker said, after being initially informed by an official in the Cincinnati field office that he was “sitting on a stack of tea party applications and they were awaiting word from higher-ups as to how to process them.”

The agency asked the group’s treasurer to supply information on its “close relationship” with current candidates and elected officials as well as future candidates, along with detailed information about its contributors and members. It also asked for transcripts of any radio interviews its officials had done and hard copies of any news articles mentioning them.

“That would take me years to do,” Walker said, noting that in some cases, Chinese media outlets referred to her organization. “Am I responsible for every news article across the globe?”

The group had even more difficulty providing transcripts and details of speakers at its events, since they hosted informal gatherings such as “rant contests” where anyone could come and express their views.

While the IRS awarded the Waco Tea Party tax-exempt status about six weeks ago, Walker said the group was now considering suing the agency since the process not only consumed time and effort but prompted the group to scale back its 2012 get-out-the-vote operation. “We were afraid to do it and get in trouble,” she said.

Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Tea Party Express, said that even though the agency’s actions intimidated tea party adherents, he gives the IRS “credit for standing up and admitting” it targeted them. And while only two of the agency’s officials — the commissioner and the chief counsel — are political appointees, Russo said the administration needs to conduct better oversight.

“The culture is set at the top,” Russo said. “Obviously you can’t control what every employee does. But you have to set a standard, particularly with the IRS, to be squeaky clean.”

The proposal has little chance of Republican support, even though neither party wants the automatic cuts. But Republicans are increasingly willing to stomach the reductions in defense and domestic spending rather than accept President Obama’s call for a “balanced” approach that matches cuts with new revenue.

The Democratic alternative would replace half of the scheduled cuts with the so-called Buffett Rule, a requirement that those who have adjusted gross incomes above $1 million pay a minimum 30% tax rate.

The rule, a favorite of the president, is named for billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has complained that tax loopholes and deductions allow him to pay a lower effective tax rate than his secretary.

“Now, Republicans in Congress face a simple choice,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. “Do they protect investments in education, healthcare and national defense, or do they continue to prioritize and protect tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans?”

The White House and its Democratic allies in the Senate are returning to a strategy that has shown some success — portraying Republicans as protecting tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of deep reductions in popular domestic programs.

Polls show that, although Americans agree with Republicans that deficits are worrisome and that spending should be reduced, enthusiasm wanes when the cuts slice into mainstay programs in transportation, education or other government services.

At the same time, majorities of Americans have shown a willingness to ask the wealthiest to pay more, as happened when Obama secured a tax increase on households earning more than $450,000 in the New Year’s deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.

Republicans are gambling that by resisting the president’s call for new taxes they will win the budget reductions that they were unable to achieve in the deal.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) asserted that the cuts, called sequestration, will begin March 1 unless serious changes are made in federal spending to achieve the Republican goal of bringing the budget into balance within 10 years. Nonpartisan analysts, noting that would extract federal money from the still-struggling economy, say that could damage the recovery.

“The sequester will be in effect until there are cuts and reforms that put us on the path to balance the budget over the next 10 years,” Boehner said Thursday.

The $120-billion proposal from Democrats would postpone the across-the-board cuts for 10 months to make time to craft a broader solution. The Democratic package includes $55 billion in new revenue, primarily from the tax on the wealthy, along with cuts to farm subsidies and a smaller hit to defense than the automatic cuts coming next month.

Democrats dropped a proposal to close tax breaks on oil companies after protests from four oil-state Democratic senators.

The across-the-board cuts would eliminate as many as 750,000 jobs and reduce the growth of the nation’s gross domestic product, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Boehner met privately Thursday with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), but the speaker has resisted the closed-door negotiations that characterized past fiscal battles because they drew protests from lawmakers in his Republican majority.

Instead, Boehner has shifted the burden of devising legislation to replace sequestration onto the Senate, as he has struggled to rally support for proposals from his divided GOP majority in the House.

Senate Republicans plan to present their own alternative. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) would replace the across-the-board cuts with a plan to reduce the federal workforce by hiring only one new employee for every three vacancies.

The Democratic and Republican alternatives probably will come to a vote when Congress returns from its weeklong Presidents Day recess.

Both parties’ proposals are likely to fail, leaving Congress without a clear alternative days before the cuts begin.

The proposal, which hasn't been made public yet, would give trustees of multiemployer pension plans the discretion to cut guaranteed benefits, so long as those cuts were done as ""early corrective actions"" to financially troubled plans. While corporations in the past have been able to wiggle out of guarantees for future retirees, the promises to current retirees have generally been untouchable.

Several structural factors are driving that deficit upwards. The national trend of de-unionization coupled with job losses from the recession have meant that fewer and fewer workers are paying into funds as more and more retirees are starting to receive benefits. Employers also have an incentive to drop out of these pools when they can afford to do so—paying an exit fee has often proven more enticing than staying on the hook for owed benefits. Furthermore, like other pensions across the country, multi-employer plans were ravaged by the Wall Street-driven economic meltdown of 2008. While about 75 percent of multi-employer plans were considered financially healthy at the beginning of 2008, according to government criteria, only 30 percent were considered to be so by the start of 2009. But many plans have since improved—60 percent are once again stable, and only about 25 percent, many of them relatively small funds, are in critical status. In fact, it’s two large pension funds in particular—the 410,000-participant Central States Fund and an 118,000-member United Mine Workers of America fund—that are responsible for much of the funding crisis. Together, they make up about 5 percent of all workers covered by multi-employer plans and about $26 billion of the $27 billion in liabilities of plans projected to go insolvent, according to the PBGC.

For decades, the corporate answer to retirement security has been to cut pensions wherever possible. In recent years, states have gotten into the game, with Republican governors and legislators—and more than a few Democrats—attacking public worker pensions. Because after all, the private sector has already kicked as many people as possible out of pension plans, so wouldn't it be greedy of public workers not to follow private sector workers into retirement poverty? Now, Congress may be getting into the act , expanding the already vast range of ways existing pensions can come under attack:Multiemployer pension plans do face a deficit, but One thing that often drops out of the hype on troubled pensions is that personal retirement accounts like 401(k) plans are in as much trouble or more. According to economist Teresa Ghilarducci, ""Seventy-five percent of Americans nearing retirement age in 2010 had less than $30,000 in their retirement accounts,"" but ""To maintain living standards into old age we need roughly 20 times our annual income in financial wealth."" Suffice it to say, $30,000 is not 20 times most people's annual income. Continuing to attack pensions and thereby promoting these vastly inadequate personal accounts that are speeding the U.S. toward a generation of elders living in dire poverty, is a disaster waiting to happen. Unfortunately, if Congress weakens pensions, the disaster may not have to wait that long."

Can we have 50 more like her, please?","Elizabeth Warren, who by Senate tradition ought to be a meek, eyes-down freshman, turned in another stellar performance Wednesday at a Banking Committee hearing with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in the hot seat.

Warren began by asking whether Treasury had changed its views on banks that were judged ""too big to fail"" back in 2008 since four of these institutions have grown 30 percent since then. “When we see the largest financial institutions getting bigger and bigger… it tells us that we are clearly not on the path to resolving too big to fail,” she said. She asked Lew:



“How big do the biggest banks have to get before we consider breaking them up? Do they have to double in size? Triple in size? Quadruple in size?”

Lew said it would not be a good idea to enact any new measures until Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, is fully implemented. That law will have its third birthday in July. You can see the exchange below and a somewhat longer version here

The four banks Warren was speaking of are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. They're nearly $2 trillion larger now than they were when the financial crisis struck. With assets of $7.8 trillion, their combined assets are half the size of the entire U.S. economy and the banks hold more than half of America's $7 trillion in deposits.

In April, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican Sen. David Vitter introduced a too-big-to-fail bill that would impose capital restrictions on banks as a proportion of the assets. For community and mid-sized banks, that would be eight percent. For the giants of $500 billion or more in assets, 15 percent. Subsidiaries and affiliates of banks would have to be separately capitalized.

In addition, the bill would limit the government's safety net to traditional banking operations not the risky investment practices that led to federal bailouts. At the same time, the bill would reduce regulations on community banks.

The Independent Community Bankers of America support the Brown-Vitter bill as do some current U.S. regulators. Not surprisingly, the bill is under attack by the usual suspects."

House GOP leaders, after a closed door session, announced there would be no votes Tuesday night. With that decision, focus shifted back to the Senate and talks between Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart, Sen. Mitch McConnell.

A spokesman for Reid issued a statement late Tuesday saying, ""Senator Reid and Senator McConnell have re-engaged in negotiations and are optimistic that an agreement is within reach.""

The emerging framework on the Senate side would raise the debt ceiling through February, and include a spending bill meant to last through Jan. 15. That version would not include any provision relating to the ObamaCare medical device tax.

Amid discontent on the House side, conservatives were also unhappy with the Senate version and raised concerns that Senate Republicans would go along with it.

Some were still holding out hope that Republicans could score a bigger victory against ObamaCare, and singled out GOP senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, John McCain of Arizona, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who have all suggested the initial push to try and defund ObamaCare as part of the fiscal deal was a bad strategy.

Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp panned them as part of the ""Senate Surrender Caucus."" ""And they wonder why conservatives don't trust them,"" he told FoxNews.com.

Heritage Action for America -- the political advocacy arm of the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, which has led efforts to defund the health care law -- also remained critical of the Senate side.

""To their credit, House Republicans responded to their constituents by pushing to defund this unworkable, un-affordable and unfair law,"" said Mike Needham, chief executive for Heritage Action. ""Unfortunately, their leverage is being severely undermined by many of their Senate colleagues who do not share their determination.""

While the Senate had originally been crafting a bipartisan bill to address the budget impasse, House Republicans surprised Senate negotiators earlier Tuesday when they announced they were pursuing their own framework. Moving quickly, House Speaker John Boehner's office announced late Tuesday afternoon that the chamber would vote by the end of the night.

But a vital meeting of the House Rules Committee, which prepares bills for the floor, was then postponed -- a signal that House leaders were lacking the necessary votes.

Fox News is told that a decision by the Heritage Action to come out against the emerging bill drove some Republicans to oppose the plan -- and helped sideline the proposal.

The group complained that the House plan would ""do nothing"" to stall ""massive new entitlements"" in ObamaCare.

The revised House plan was aimed at both ending the partial government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling, but also imposing one ObamaCare-related provision.

Though Republicans have considered over the last several weeks a range of provisions relating to ObamaCare, the one they settled on in this package would force Congress, the president, and many other administration officials and staff onto ObamaCare without additional subsidies. GOP lawmakers described the proposed mandate as a matter of ""fairness.""

""If the president and Senate Democrats are going to force the American people to live under ObamaCare, then they and all Washington leaders should not be shielded from the law,"" one GOP aide said.

The idea was to pass the bill in the House, and effectively dare the Senate to hold up the bill -- and risk missing the debt-ceiling deadline -- because senators don't want to submit to ObamaCare.

But with some conservatives no longer on board, it was unclear whether Boehner would try to tweak and salvage the package -- or kick the debate back over the Senate.

Amid the confusion, some Democrats urged the Republicans to throw in the towel. ""You have two options -- you can get bowled over by the Senate or you can get bowled over by the Senate,"" said one House Democratic aide.

Senate leaders had effectively hit pause on their own negotiations while talks play out on the House side. While Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democrats blasted Boehner for pursuing a House plan, sources indicated the Senate was willing to wait on the House -- if for no other reason than, procedurally, it would save a lot of time. That's because a measure coming from the House could not be filibustered.

Fox News is told the latest plan to emerge in the House would end the partial government shutdown by funding the government through Dec. 15. It would also raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7 -- in turn averting the looming Thursday deadline to raise the debt cap.

Unlike a prior proposal, it would not include a provision delaying the medical device tax in ObamaCare. It would include a provision limiting the Treasury Department's ability to buy more time when faced with future debt-ceiling deadlines.

Importantly, the plan would kick other budget decisions, including the debate on the medical device tax, to a conference committee.

Republicans earlier claimed the details of their plan were not so far off from a bipartisan approach being crafted in the Senate. Republicans urged Democrats to give it a chance, and questioned why they would preemptively reject it.

""To say, 'absolutely categorically not, we will not consider what the Republicans in the House of Representatives are doing,' in my view, is piling on,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on the Senate floor, as Democrats lined up against the House plan. ""Let's sit down and work this out.""

The mood in Washington has shifted drastically in the last day, with both sides of the aisle hurling accusations at one another when, the night before, bipartisan leaders in the Senate were claiming on the floor to have made significant progress.

White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage called the House approach a ""partisan attempt to appease a small group of Tea Party Republicans who forced the government shutdown in the first place.""

In the most visceral remarks, Reid alleged Boehner is trying to ""preserve his role at the expense of the country"" -- and said his plan will not pass the Senate.

""Extremist Republicans in the House of Representatives are attempting to torpedo the Senate's bipartisan progress with a bill that can't pass the Senate ... and won't pass the Senate,"" he said.

Amid the partisan crossfire, President Obama met with House Democratic leadership Tuesday afternoon.

Some 30% of the federal workforce will be eligible to retire in the next three years, according to a Government Accountability Office report. That means the government could be hit by a wave of retirements at a time when it is already dealing with inadequate staffing, because large numbers of employees are on furlough and hiring freezes are in place to save money and dramatically shrink the federal budget deficit.

It could lead to disruptions in some key areas. Some 46% of air traffic controllers can retire in the next three years, creating a challenge for the government to replace them with similarly experienced workers. It's a worry, especially at a time when the public has fresh memories of long delays at the nation's airports when the sequester kept controllers at home on furlough.

Also, more than a third of all federal veterinarians are eligible to retire. An impending national veterinarian shortage is already fueling fears that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will not be able to easily tamp the spread of a severe disease outbreak in animals, according to several federal reports.

Congressional watchdogs have been warning for years about this ""tsunami"" of baby boomers hitting retirement age at federal agencies. So far, it hasn't happened because more workers hung on to their jobs far longer than expected, in part due to the recession.

That may be changing this year. In the first four months of 2013, some 60,000 employees filed for federal retirement benefits, a 43% increase from last year, according to the Office of Personnel Management. A major part of the spike comes from postal workers taking early retirement buyouts, OPM says.

But union groups and employee advocates say the uptick in retirements is being fueled by the $85 billion in spending cuts, along with its furloughs, pay freezes, slashed overtime and increased work load from the lack of new hires.

""We're seeing this massive brain drain as thousands of workers leave the federal workforce, and it's leading to a huge loss of knowledge and expertise,"" said William Dougan, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees. ""A lot of these jobs are not being filled once they're vacated.""

It's already leading to questionable outcomes. In the past two years, the beleaguered Internal Revenue Service has lost 10,000 employees to retirement and attrition. Some have suggested that the lack of senior level employees may have played a role in the current scandal plaguing that agency.

More than a third of IRS employees will soon be eligible to retire, which could also lead to longer waits for things like taxpayer refunds and audits.

Federal employees can retire at the age of 62 if they have worked five years, or even younger with 20 years of service. The average federal worker is 47 years old with about 14 years on the job, compared to the median age of 42 for all American workers, according to federal data.

Over at the USDA, the labor crunch poses a risk to the nation's food supply as early as this year, according to Michael Gilsdorf, executive vice president for the National Association of Federal Veterinarians.

At least three USDA agencies are struggling to fill positions left by outgoing vets since federal budget cuts took hold, Gilsdorf said. That has shrunk the number of ""deployable"" veterinarians, who can respond to an animal disease outbreak from 1,000 vets last year, to about 250 now.

A federal advisory panel has warned there aren't enough federal veterinarians to contain a massive multi-state outbreak of foot and mouth disease, a highly contagious animal disease which strikes cows, goats and pigs.

""Our capacity to respond to a disease outbreak has hit a critical stage,"" said Gilsdorf, who runs the panel tasked with helping craft the plan to recruit thousands of private and public sector veterinarians to fill in gaps if disease hits the nation's food supply.

The USDA responded by saying it has recruited 955 veterinarians and 3,100 animal health technicians to join a volunteer group of emergency responders called the ""National Animal Health Emergency Response Corps."" The agency's has a special program that trains vets, including those at nonprofits and in private practice on how to respond to a national emergency.

A USDA spokesperson said the agency prioritizes ""working with staff and accredited veterinarians to ensure that we can respond quickly and in a manner that is highly protective of our animal agriculture resources.""

For some, however, a shrinking federal workforce is not something to worry about. In fact, it is a good thing -- it's a key part of Republican budget chief Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to shrink deficits. This year, Ryan proposed cutting the 2.1 million workforce by 10% through a two-year hiring freeze.

An OPM official said it's prepared for the wave of retirements by ""constantly evaluating workforce preparedness programs.""

While sequester has been an ""added challenge,"" the official stressed ""the decision to retire is a very personal one, as each person looks at their individual situation and decides what is best for them."""

“There’s no winning,” Obama told reporters before ordering lunch at a favorite haunt near the White House. “No one is winning.”

The president’s rare midday stroll outside the White House came as he tried to contain the fallout from a senior administration official’s comment that the White House was “winning” in the budget fight that has frozen parts of the government. ”It doesn’t really matter to us” how long the shutdown lasts, the official told The Wall Street Journal. “Because what matters is the end result.”

Aides disavowed the comment Friday morning, Day Four of the shutdown, before Obama and Biden took to the streets for the impromptu hoagie run. Jacketless and shirt-sleeves rolled up, the men were cheered on by pedestrians as they walked. “Hang tough, Mr. President” one person yelled. “You’re doing the right thing.”

LIVE UPDATES: Day four of the shutdown

At Taylor Gourmet, standing between a sign saying “Order Here” and a poster that read “Love,” Obama praised the restaurant for offering furloughed employees a 10% discount, but said the shutdown “could be over today.” “I’m happy to have negotiations, but we can’t do it with a gun held to the head of the American people,” he said.

The president has turned to Taylor’s Philadelphia-style hoagies during tough times with Congress before. In May 2012, as he tried to win support for his economic proposals, the president fetched takeout from Taylor for a meeting of the top four congressional leaders.

The meeting and the sandwiches did little to move his proposals along.

Special for USA TODAY

Tech lobbyists want to nearly double annual visas for skilled foreign workers to 110%2C000

Yet CEOs of some start-ups are going overseas to find workers with the technical skills

Microsoft%2C IBM%2C Cisco Systems have hired thousands of Indian engineers%2C consultants over past decade

SAN FRANCISCO — While the path to U.S. citizenship sketched out in an immigration-reform bill passed by the Senate is a long one, a key part of one industry isn't waiting to see whether Congress delivers what it wants.

Even while technology-industry lobbyists fight hard in Washington to nearly double the number of annual visas for skilled foreign workers — to 110,000, as the Senate bill calls for — the CEOs of some fast-growing start-ups are already going overseas to find workers with the technical skills they need.

That includes Lew Cirne, CEO of New Relic, a San Francisco-based maker of software that boosts the efficiency of applications that run on corporate computer networks.

Of the 225 engineers working at its headquarters and Portland, Ore., office, just eight are foreign nationals in the U.S. on H-1B visas, Cirne says.

Yet two years ago, when he began to plan another product line — ""one that can help take us from a $100 million company (in annual revenue) to a billion-dollar-company in a few years,"" he says — he turned to a programmer who lives and works in Brisbane, Australia, to help develop New Relic's next-generation software code.

""We have a bias to hiring here. We're not looking to reduce costs by moving jobs overseas,"" says Cirne, whose previous start-up, Wily Technology, had more than 400 employees when it was acquired by CA Technologies, a larger rival, for $375 million in 2006.

""We're competing for the top talent, no matter where it is,"" says Cirne, a native of Canada and naturalized U.S. citizen.

He is far from alone.

A growing number of small, private U.S. technology companies — who, like, New Relic are late-stage start-ups with more than $100 million in annual sales — now have engineering offices overseas.

A decade ago, such offices were de rigueur for start-ups backed by marquee venture-capital firms, who pushed their portfolio companies to move some engineering work overseas — mostly to India — to cut costs.

But that labor arbitrage never provided all the savings that companies had hoped for, once the rupee had risen to where the cost of office space in Mumbai equaled or even exceeded that of similar space in Silicon Valley, as it does today.

And the logistical headaches caused by trying to manage workers located many time zones away caused even some large companies to question the value of offshoring engineering work.

While the motivation for large U.S. technology companies to hire foreign workers back then was based primarily on a desire for cost savings — and Microsoft, IBM, Cisco Systems and others all hired thousands of Indian engineers and consultants over the past decade for that reason — the start-ups of today are hiring foreign workers in different places, and for different reasons.

Perhaps the most important reason — along with trying to hire the very best engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists — is that doing so is so much easier than it used to be.

When San Francisco-based Zendesk was looking to open a development office in Europe in 2011, CEO Mikkel Svane and his two co-founders were able to begin their search using contacts they'd made in the software developer community of their hometown of Copenhagen.

The three Danes all moved to San Francisco in 2009, when the help-desk software start-up they'd founded two years earlier outgrew the apartment in which they'd launched it. Yet they'd been able to follow online the work of others who — like them — wrote code in a new programming language called Ruby on Rails.

While two-thirds of its 120 engineers and technical workers are located in San Francisco or Madison, Wis. — home to the Badger State's largest university — three dozen or so work either in London, Dublin, Tokyo, Berlin, Copenhagen or Melbourne, Svane says.

The company now employs almost 400 workers — up from 90 just 24 months ago — and has tripled its number of customers to 30,000 during that time, according to Svane.

TECH'S ANSWER TO 'MONEYBALL'

A start-up's need to produce innovation on a tight budget against entrenched, better-funded rivals forces them to search high and low for workers who can deliver great new products — and who will accept a lower wage than they'd get at a large company.

In exchange, those employees get the chance to work 70- to 80-hour weeks in hopes of building something that could be big.

People willing to take those kinds of risks are similar to the immigrants who — like Cirne and Svane — have come to this country for more than 200 years to pursue their own version of the American dream. About 40% of the current Fortune 500 companies are founded by immigrants or their children.

Other research has shown that, on average, every 100 foreign students who remain in this country after receiving an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering or math (a so-called STEM degree) create 262 additional jobs.

Before the days of online forums for computer-programming languages, small U.S. companies that wanted to compete for the best technical talent had to rely either on their own personal networks — as Cirne did — or try to compete with larger rivals for the graduates of advanced-degree programs at U.S. universities.

The percentage of foreign nationals enrolled in advanced STEM degree programs has remained fairly constant over the last two decades, 33% in 2009 from 31% in 1990, according to a report compiled for Congress in May 2012 by the Congressional Research Service.

During that same time, however, the total number of such students surged 64% to 149,000 from 91,000, as university programs sought to keep pace with a fast-growing industry.

The problem for U.S. tech companies is that, as the need to hire more skilled workers has increased, the number of visas for skilled workers hasn't.

Although Congress temporarily raised the number of annual H-1B visas to 115,000 in 1998, the limit reverted to 65,000 in 2004.

That means a growing number of workers with advanced STEM degrees from U.S. universities have been forced to go back to their home countries to look for work — even while U.S. companies want to hire them.

""I get calls every day from hiring managers and (human resource) execs looking to bring in foreign STEM workers into the U.S. to help them grow their businesses here,"" says Charles Small, an immigration attorney in San Francisco for more than a decade.

But given a six-month minimum wait time, and the fact that the 65,000 cap on H-1Bs for this year was reached on the very first day that the government began accepting visa applications, any skilled foreign worker that a company found today couldn't start work until Oct. 1, 2014, at the earliest, Small says.

With the Senate moving on a tech-friendly bill, those working on raising the number of H-1B visas now turn their attention to the House, which in past years has voted out of committee several bills that would establish a new type of visa for workers in STEM fields.

There is a new sense of urgency after several other countries — including Canada, Australia and Chile — have loosened their own immigration laws to make it easier for their own companies to hire skilled foreign workers.

""The tech industry will do everything it can to get a bill passed … that makes sure the U.S. remains the center of innovation,"" says Dean Garfield, CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, an industry trade group.

As things slowly move forward in Washington, start-ups are going wherever they can to find more skilled workers.

King.com, a maker of some of the most popular social games on Facebook, has 100 engineers in Stockholm.

Its website lists dozens of open tech jobs in London, Hamburg, Barcelona, Bucharest and several other overseas offices.

Optimizely, a start-up here, hired its first H-1B worker this year, says CEO Dan Siroker, a former Google product manager. Under current visa rules, the employee can't start until Oct. 1.

Zendesk now lists all new engineering positions in each of its multiple locations around the globe. That approach has helped the company overcome ""the huge challenge of trying to hire technical talent in San Francisco, where the competition is so fierce,"" says CEO Svane.

So rather than debate whether more skilled foreign workers will take jobs away from Americans, perhaps Congress should pass a bill that prevents more high-skilled jobs from heading overseas.

(CNN) - The Treasury Department does not plan to mint a $1 trillion platinum coin to avert federal government default, a spokesman said Saturday.

The statement from Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Anthony Coley effectively puts to bed speculation that the administration would act unilaterally to avert default. It also puts the onus on Congress – specifically Republicans in the House - to act.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""Neither the Treasury Department nor the Federal Reserve believes that the law can or should be used to facilitate the production of platinum coins for the purpose of avoiding an increase in the debt limit,"" Coley said in a statement.

With the Saturday statement, the Obama administration has shut down two potential legal loopholes by which the executive branch could avoid the Treasury from being unable to pay the nation’s bills.

Defaulting on the nation’s debts would be catastrophic to the economy. Hesitation over the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011 caused the stock market to tumble and led to the downgrade of the nation’s credit rating by Standard & Poor’s.

As that debt deadline loomed, Obama was asked about one potential loophole: reading the 14th Amendment’s requirement that the “validity of the public debt of the United States … shall not be questioned.” If Congress were not to act, some have suggested, the president could act unilaterally, viewing the debt limit as unconstitutional and – in the words of former President Bill Clinton – “force the courts to stop me.""

“I have talked to my lawyers,” Obama said that summer. “They are not persuaded that that is a winning argument. So the challenge for me is to make sure that we do not default.”

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney ruled out that constitutional route on Friday.

“There is no Plan B. There is no backup plan,” he told reporters. “There is Congress’ responsibility to pay the bills of the United States.”

On Saturday, he added, “Congress can pay its bills or they can fail to act and put the nation into default.”

""The president and the American people won't tolerate congressional Republicans holding the American economy hostage again simply so they can force disastrous cuts to Medicare and other programs the middle class depend on while protecting the wealthy,” Carney said. “Congress needs to do its job.""

The second loophole would be to mint a platinum coin of a large denomination, which the Treasury is authorized to do and is not subject to the restrictions placed on coins made of other metals.

Stamped with a denomination such as $1 trillion, that platinum coin would be deposited into the Federal Reserve. Some experts say it would not inflate U.S. currency overall because the coin would be a technical device and not enter into circulation.

The laws which leave this loophole, however, were not designed for this purpose. The authorization to mint platinum coins, for example, was intended to allow production of collectors’ items.

The federal government has already reached the debt ceiling of nearly $16.4 trillion, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said last month.

Right now, his department is staving off default through “extraordinary measures,” which are expected to cover the balance for a few more weeks.

Political analysts are looking ahead to what could be a showdown which rivals the fireworks of the fiscal cliff negotiations of just a few weeks ago.

Obama has called on Congress to raise the debt ceiling without the haggling.

""While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed,"" he said after the fiscal cliff deal passed the House. ""If Congress refuses to give the United States government the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy would be catastrophic - far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff.""

But some Republicans want to see spending cuts balance an increase in the government’s borrowing ability. Among them is Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, who delivered her party’s weekly address on Saturday.

""I believe we cannot agree to increase the borrowing limit without addressing our out-of-control spending,” she said. “That's why Nebraskans sent me here. That's what the American people demand. And that's what our children and our grandchildren deserve.""

Congress is also faced with the March expiration of the resolution funding the government and the sequester, those across-the-board spending cuts created by Congress as an incentive to avoid a future showdown similar to the 2011 debt ceiling fight. But that attempt failed, and Congress avoided the fiscal cliff by, in part, pushing those cuts back to this spring.

The Treasury Department judgment was first reported by The Washington Post.

This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me: ‘You need to fund our Defense Department at such-and-such a level. You need to send Social Security checks. You need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans.’ They lay all this out for me, and–because they have the spending power–and so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills. Separately, they also have to authorize a raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can’t do is tell me to spend X and then say, but we’re not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.

Of course, Obama isn’t mentioning that it is largely his side that wants to spend, while the GOP wants to cut spending.

The issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation and so there’s a very simple solution to this. Congress authorizes us to pay our bills. Now if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don’t have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I’m happy to take it. If they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done and you know, there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no, you know, easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending.

The president’s entire defense is predicated on the premise that spending absolutely must stay at its current levels, an issue he has been entirely unwilling to discuss with Republicans in Congress.

Notice that for the past two years, the House, run by the GOP, has passed budgets while the Democratic Senate hasn’t. Who’s the fiscally irresponsible party here?"

Steven Miller, appearing on the Hill for a second hearing in two weeks on the scandal, acknowledged that the agency was trying to get ahead of a damning investigative report at the time. As was confirmed over the weekend, he admitted the agency had a question planted at a conference two Fridays ago -- a senior IRS official, in response to the question, then confessed to a long-running program that singled out conservative groups for additional scrutiny.

""Obviously the entire thing was an incredibly bad idea,"" Miller said.

Miller explained that the agency had been trying to brief lawmakers on the Hill, in advance of the release of the inspector general report. But that ""did not work out,"" he said, so they used the planted question.

""The report was coming, we knew that,"" he told the Senate Finance Committee.

The issue raised more questions for lawmakers about the way in which the agency addressed public concerns about the screening program. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, criticized the IRS for using the planted question to come forward, suggesting it compounded the problems with the agency's response.

In a tense round of questioning, Hatch also asked why neither Miller nor former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman acknowledged the program before -- Congress had been asking about the allegations since 2012.

Shulman claimed he did not have a ""full set of facts,"" but said he was aware in the spring of 2012 there was an internal list that included the term ""Tea Party."" That list was used as the basis for singling out some groups applying for tax-exempt status. Shulman also said he did not know how the controversial program started, adding that lower-level officials ""should have run up the chain"" their knowledge about the program earlier.

""You should have corrected the record, and you should have done it long before today,"" Hatch said.

He also accused Miller of lying when he didn't acknowledge the program in letters to Congress last year, despite being aware of it.

""That's a lie by omission, there's no question about that in my mind,"" Hatch said.

Miller, as he claimed last week, said he ""did not lie.""

Shulman got into another tense exchange with Republican Sen. John Cornyn, when the former commissioner refused to apologize for the practice which started under his leadership.

Shulman said he was ""deeply, deeply saddened"" by what happened and acknowledged it started ""on my watch."" But he said he's not ""personally responsible"" for creating the screening list.

Cornyn later said that the response was ""an insult.""

The hearing followed one by the House oversight committee last week; they are likely just the first of several as committees begin to investigate the IRS program.

""The IRS abandoned good judgment and lost the public's trust,"" said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, at the start of Tuesday's hearing.

Hatch, the top Republican on the panel, alleged that officials didn't decide to come clean until the investigative report was imminent and ""their hand was forced.""

""Were they simply holding out until after the election?"" Hatch asked.

It was the first time lawmakers were able to question Shulman, the man who ran the IRS when agents were improperly targeting Tea Party groups.

The Senate Finance Committee, which has launched a bipartisan probe, was also hearing from Inspector General J. Russell George.

Shulman faced scrutiny, after having told a House committee in March 2012 there was ""absolutely no targeting"" by the IRS of conservative organizations. Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, left the IRS in November when his five-year term ended.

The hearing comes after White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the president's counsel was told on April 24 about the preliminary findings of an IRS audit that showed tax officials unfairly targeted Tea Party groups. Senior legal counsel Kathryn Ruemmler was told about the audit on April 24, Carney said Monday. She then told Denis McDonough, Obama's chief of staff and other senior officials about the investigation.

""It was the judgment of counsel this is not a matter she should convey to the president,"" Carney said.

Carney also said while Ruemmler knew the subject of the investigation and potential findings, they were not given a draft of the report and understood details could change.

Ahead of the hearing, Baucus and Hatch sent a letter to the IRS Monday, asking for an explanation. The letter included 41 separate requests for information. They gave the IRS until May 31 to respond.

The two senators said the IRS had not been forthcoming about the issue in the past.

""Targeting applicants for tax-exempt status using political labels threatens to undermine the public's trust in the IRS,"" Baucus and Hatch wrote. ""Lack of candor in advising the Senate of this practice is equally troubling.""

For more than a year, from 2011 through the 2012 election, members of Congress repeatedly asked Shulman about complaints from Tea Party groups that they were being harassed by the IRS.

Shulman's responses, usually relayed by a deputy, did not acknowledge that agents had ever targeted Tea Party groups for special scrutiny. At a congressional hearing March 22, 2012, Shulman was adamant in his denials.

""There's absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens to people"" who apply for tax-exempt status, Shulman said at the House Ways and Means subcommittee hearing.

The IRS has said Shulman did not know about the targeting at the time of the hearing.

The agency's inspector general says he told Shulman on May 30, 2012, that his office was auditing the way applications for tax-exempt status were being handled, in part because of complaints from conservative groups. However, the inspector general said he did not reveal the results of his investigation.

To get ready, agencies have been identifying services, programs and workers deemed essential, or ""excepted"" in official speak. Translation: Workers in the business of protecting life and property. They will continue working, though they won't be paid until after the shutdown.

Employees whose jobs are funded by money other than the annual appropriations that Congress is fighting over will keep working as well. So too will presidential appointees.

But all other programs deemed to be non-essential, or ""non-excepted,"" will be shuttered. And workers at those programs will be furloughed without pay.

Here are a few of the plans for next week in the event of a shutdown.

Defense: All active-duty military personnel, as well as active-duty reserve personnel, will stay on the job, the Pentagon said. But their Oct. 15 paycheck could be delayed if the shutdown goes past Oct. 7.

Civilian personnel engaged in essential activities will also continue working through the shutdown.

Civilian personnel involved in non-essential work will be furloughed without pay -- unless money to pay their salaries is drawn from a source other than fiscal year 2014 appropriations.

Those who work during the shutdown will be paid, but not until Congress appropriates funds to do so.

Temporary duty travel will be canceled, unless it's in direct support of the war in Afghanistan or related to safety of life and protection of property or foreign relations. In such cases, written approval is required.

For any service member killed during a shutdown, families will not get death benefits until the shutdown ended.

Federal courts and justice: Justice will continue to be served.

The court system said it will remain open for business for approximately 10 business days in the event of a shutdown.

It's able to do so on the basis of fees and funds from prior appropriations, according to an earlier report from the Congressional Research Service.

All court proceedings and deadlines will remain in effect unless otherwise advised. The judiciary said it will reassess its funding capacity on or around Oct. 15.

The Department of Justice, meanwhile, said it only plans to furlough about 15% of its 114,486-person workforce.

Health and Human Services: The Department of Health and Human Services has said it will furlough 52% its employees if there's a shutdown.

Offices to be hit hardest include the Administration for Children and Families, the Administration for Community Living and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be affected too. But they would keep on minimal support for their outbreak investigations, processing of laboratory samples and the 24/7 emergency operations center.

The Food and Drug Administration will also continue limited activities related to high-risk recalls and other vital efforts.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue large portions of Obamacare. And the Medicare program will continue ""largely without disruption"" during the shutdown.

Housing loans: The Department of Housing and Urban Development, of which the Federal Housing Administration is a part, said it will be furloughing 96% of its workforce.

Nevertheless, on Monday it said it would continue to process FHA loans during the shutdown. But given the greatly reduced staffing levels, the underwriting and loan approval process will be slower than usual, an FHA spokesman said.

National museums: The Smithsonian Institution said its 18 museums and the National Zoo will be closed to the public in a shutdown.

It will furlough 84% of its workforce. The other 16% who will be asked to work include employees responsible for the care and protections of the facilities and collections as well as the care and feeding of the animals at the zoo.

Passports: During the last shutdown in the mid-1990s, passport offices closed. But according to the State Department's current shutdown plan, offices will remain open because they generate enough in fees to support their operation.

Any offices located in a federal building affected by the shutdown, however, may not be able to open.

Chemical spill investigations: They'll be halted.

The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board said it will furlough 37 of its 40 staff members in a shutdown.

""There would be no ability to respond to a major incident,"" managing director Daniel Horowitz told CNN.

The board sees its mission as investigative rather than immediately life-saving, which is why it essentially will shut down until Congress appropriates funding.

NASA: Good news for crews docking at the International Space Station. NASA said it will keep on some employees during a shutdown to make sure the crews are safe. Existing satellite missions will also continue.

But any NASA activity not tied to the protection of life and property will cease during the shutdown.

That's true even if it would cost more to shut a program down than to keep it running, according to NASA guidance.

For the first time since 2008, Congress failed to extend the benefits went it passed a budget just before Christmas. The Obama Administration has warned that more than 4 million unemployed could lose benefits next year unless Congress passes another extension.

In the past, states provided unemployed workers with up to 26 weeks of benefits. At the start of the recession, the federal government provided extra weeks of assistance. During the depths of the recession, federal and state governments provided 99 weeks of cash payments. For those keeping score at home, that is almost 2 years of financial assistance. The average benefit is around $1,100 a month.

The expiration of benefits for the long-term unemployed has already sparked a round of finger-pointing in Washington. On Friday, the left-wing Huffington Post put much of the blame on Democrats. “The record indicates that Democrats were late to show up, distracted in part by other concerns,” HuffPo reported. “A month and a half before the deadline, few members of Congress or administration officials were even talking about unemployment insurance.”

Extending the benefits for another year would cost the government $25 billion. The left argues that this assistance helps the economy, by giving the unemployed cash to purchase consumer goods. The Congressional Budget Office has even estimated that extending benefits for the unemployed creates around 200,000 jobs.

This argument is absurd. It is the fiscal policy version of the “broken windows” economic fallacy. If all my windows were broken, I would have to spend a lot of money replacing them. This would theoretically boost the economy by providing work for glaziers and other workers. This does not factor, however, what else I could have done with my money. It is likely that it could have been spent or invested far more productively than simply replacing what I already had.

If the government wants to extend unemployment benefits for another year, it will have to borrow $25 billion. The cost of this will actually increase over time, as the government pays interest on this debt. These are resources that can’t be used for anything else, whether its infrastructure improvements or tax reform.

A bigger problem than the duration of unemployment benefits, is the number of the long-term unemployed. More than 4 million Americans looking for work have been unemployed for more than 27 weeks, beyond the time-frame of traditional unemployment insurance. The recession officially ended more than 4 years ago. Such a large number of long-term unemployed suggests deeper problems with the economy than can be fixed by simply adding additional benefits.

Absurdly, at the same time the left is pushing for an extension of unemployment benefits, it is also pushing to hike the minimum wage. If someone has been unemployed for 99 weeks, mandating higher wages is unlikely to be of much help. Minimum wage hikes, at least at the margin, have a negative impact on job creation.

Extending unemployment benefits may itself be counter-productive for job creation. A landmark study from Sweden found that more generous unemployment benefits increased the rates of unemployment. The relationship was very robust. Every 1% point increase in benefits increased unemployment by 5%.

In 2007, Sweden reformed its unemployment insurance system. The government provides 60 weeks of benefits, but on a sliding scale. The longer someone is unemployed, the less they receive in assistance. This system provides a powerful incentive to find work.

It is perhaps telling that, in 2013, we are in such a state that American lawmakers should look to Sweden for economic reforms."

Leaders who want their achievements to endure know that their task includes changing the terms of the national debate and leaving behind an intellectual legacy that shapes how future generations see the country and its possibilities.

Franklin D. Roosevelt accomplished this. So did Ronald Reagan. President Obama traveled Wednesday to Knox College in Illinois to give the speech that launched his effort to join them. It was where, in 2005, he originally laid out his philosophy of government.

Obama is making this bid in the face of a political culture that is far more cynical than it was in the days of FDR or the Gipper. He confronts adversaries determined to move the country in exactly the opposite direction from the one he would have it choose. And up to now, the president has been foiled or distracted whenever he has tried to focus the public conversation on reversing rising inequality and restoring social mobility.

So why should his latest effort be any different? Here are three reasons.

1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.

First, Obama and his advisers have learned from past failures. Earlier speeches along these lines came and went, barely causing a ripple in the public’s consciousness. This time, the president is embarking on an eight-week campaign to keep his themes at the center of the debate. He wants to bend the news cycle, rather than bow to it.

By giving a series of addresses that include specific proposals — some old, some new — he hopes to grab the public’s attention, and the media’s. His grass-roots operation will mobilize supporters to talk up these themes with their neighbors. Whatever else it is, this campaign is not a one-off.

Second, he will be speaking to a country that’s fed up with the mean, narrow and pessimistic tone emanating from a capital locked in what Obama called “short-term thinking and stale debates.” The president’s critics have said over and over that he needs to “go big” and push the system beyond itself. Even his friends have been frustrated at his difficulty in seizing the initiative and confronting obstructionist opponents. He appears to have listened.

But the most important reason this offensive has a chance is that it goes to the heart of why Obama got elected in the first place and won reelection. A substantial American majority just doesn’t buy the ideas that Obama forcefully rejected: that “inequality is both inevitable and just” and that “an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families.”

In describing his priorities, Obama’s language was plain but direct: “Good jobs. A better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class. An economy that grows from the middle out. . . . That’s where I ’ll focus my energies — not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.”

“Middle out” is the key concept. Since the Reagan era, conservatives have enjoyed enormous success in making supply-side economics — the belief that wealth flows to everyone else from the economy’s commanding heights — a powerful, underground default position. A corollary: Government can do little to make the nation richer other than cut taxes and reduce its own reach.

The alternative view is, as Obama put it, that “growing inequality” is “not just morally wrong; it’s bad economics.”

President Obama says political distractions are keeping the U.S. economy from fully recovering from the recession. (Nicki Demarco/The Washington Post)

“When middle-class families have less to spend,” Obama insisted, “businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy.”

In the long history of the country, concentrations of wealth and income always have created perverse effects. Broadening our nation’s winners’ circle, on the other hand, has always been the best strategy for sustainable growth. We need to acknowledge this once again.

There is more Obama needs to do to make his case for the specific steps Washington can take to restore shared, robust prosperity. He will have to beat back the forces that would continue to shrink government through a sequester that is making the recovery slower than it should be.

But this time, he cannot let himself be sidetracked. With 1,276 days left in his presidency, he chose to draw a clear line and start a big argument. His place in history will hang in large part on whether he can win it.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/business/economy/feds-plan-to-taper-stimulus-effort-not-expected-until-next-year.html,2013-12-09 00:00:00,['Binyamin Appelbaum'],Fed’s Plan to Taper Stimulus Effort Is Not Expected Until Next Year,"When Mr. Bernanke first described the Fed’s tapering plans in June, investors ignored this distinction, driving up rates across the board. But the message has gradually taken hold. The movement of asset prices after recent good news, including the November jobs data, has reflected an expectation that the Fed is closer to tapering, but not to raising interest rates. “Markets are beginning to appreciate that they are separate tools,” Mr. Bernanke said last month.

Some officials think the Fed still needs to underscore this distinction when it begins to taper its bond purchases. Others now regard such an effort as unnecessary, or contend that the Fed could act after it begins to taper if investors seem to be confused.

Proponents of underscoring the Fed’s commitment to low interest rates are further fragmented about the best technique. Some, including Mr. Evans, would like to lower the threshold unemployment rate. Some would like to create a similar threshold for inflation. Some would like to make a symbolic cut in an obscure interest rate the Fed pays on bank reserves.

Instead of such concrete steps, the Fed also could seek to explain in greater detail how it will decide the timetable for increasing interest rates. This option commanded the broadest support at the Fed’s meeting in October.

A shift among officials who pushed for tapering earlier in the year has made it easier for the Fed to postpone decisions. Some of those officials now say the Fed should commit to a date to end the program rather than beginning to taper as soon as possible, because they see this as the best way to reduce confusion among investors.

“The sooner we say we’re going to end this program once we’ve purchased X, the sooner we say that, the better,” Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said on Friday. “It’s that constant uncertainty about what we’ll do at each and every meeting that I think we can eliminate this way, and we’ll be better off for it, and we’ll not sacrifice much of the benefits of the program.”

The sluggish pace of inflation also has made it easier to wait. Prices rose just 0.7 percent during the 12 months that ended in October, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. Excluding the volatile movements of food and energy prices, inflation was still just 1.1 percent over that period. That is significantly below the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as best for the economy."

In a stunning admission, Obama reportedly told Boehner, “We don’t have a spending problem.”

Boehner added that President Obama continues to maintain that America’s federal deficit is caused not by governmental overspending but by “a health-care problem.” Said Boehner, “They blame all of the fiscal woes on our health-care system.” Boehner told Obama, “Clearly we have a health-care problem, which is about to get worse with Obamacare. But, Mr. President, we have a very serious spending problem.” Obama eventually replied, “I’m getting tired of hearing you say that.”

Obama may be tired of hearing Boehner talk about a spending problem, particularly when Obama has been re-elected on the basis of ignoring government spending. Nonetheless, America does have a spending problem, which Obama is steadfastly ignoring. “He’s so ideological himself,” Boehner explained, “and he’s unwilling to take on the left of his own party.” That’s why Obama refused to raise the retirement age for Medicare after agreeing to it. “He admitted in meetings that he couldn’t sell things to his own members,” said Boehner. “But he didn’t even want to try … We could never get him to step up.”

Boehner says that there will be no new tax increases over the debt ceiling. “The tax issue is resolved,” he said. And he said that more closed-door negotiations with Obama would be “futile.” It’s a bit too late to recognize that, but better late than never.

Obama need not negotiate on spending. He can just continue to bully Republicans by suggesting that they are the party of the rich – and his media lackeys can pretend that it’s fiscally irresponsible to ask the government to live within its means.

We have two alternatives, two paths to take here. Either fix the financial problems in a longer-term, bigger fix or do something with sequestering that we've punished ourselves basically because we have been unable, as a body, to come together.

So I think that was also said, if we're going to do a sequestering, shouldn't it also be done in a more or a smarter way to where there's more flexibility?

Bernanke: Well, as you point out, it was done to be sort of like, in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" the bomb that goes off.

So if — obviously if you can find a way to, you know, a bipartisan way to make it more effective and —and — and better prioritize, that would be a good thing.

And people disagree on the second point but, again, what I suggested today is try to make some trade-off on the effects of the near-term recovery and, you know, aligning the policy with the timing. The timing says that you've made progress on the very near-term as far as the budget is concerned.

Where — where the problem still remains unaddressed is — is in the longer term. And so it doesn't quite match to be doing tough policies today when the real problem is a somewhat longer-term problem."

It was the first time economic growth contracted since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 and showed how much the concerns about large tax hikes and federal spending cuts weighed on businesses as last year drew to a close.

A last-minute deal in Washington averted most of the tax increases and delayed the automatic spending cuts. Economists say they believe that will lead to economic growth in the first three months of 2013.

But Thursday’s report -- the government’s first estimate of fourth-quarter economic activity -- was a surprise.

QUIZ: Test your knowledge about the debt limit

Economists has projected that the gross domestic product -- the nation’s total economic output -- would expand about 1% in the fourth quarter, a slowdown from the 3.1% growth in the July-through-September period.

But a drop in inventory investment by businesses, federal government spending and U.S. exports led to the first contraction since the economy shrank 0.3% in the second quarter of 2009.

Leading the drop in government outlays was a 22.2% drop in defense spending.

“The economy ended 2012 on a very sluggish pace, even though one-time factors put the number below the trend,” said Kathy Bostjancic, director for macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board.

“While the inventory runoff and the steep decline in defense spending in the fourth quarter made economic activity look weaker than it really was, the underlying demand from consumers and businesses kept moving forward at a moderate pace,” she said.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/31/survey-new-york-california-last-in-personal-freedoms/,2013-03-31 00:00:00,[],"Survey: New York, California last in personal freedoms","New York and California have for generations of Americans been considered destination spots to express personal freedoms -- one with a city big enough for anybody with a dream to perhaps become a star and the other a state synonymous with the so-called laid-back lifestyle.

But such attitudes have drastically changed, according to a new study that finds the two states last in individual freedom.

The “Freedom in the 50 States” study published last week by the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center ranks New York last and California second to last.

The survey is based on fiscal issues such as job prospects and tax rates, regulatory policies that include property rights and personal freedoms such as gun laws.

“When it comes to overall freedom, New York ranks dead last,” the study’s authors said.

They point out that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken away – or at least tried to take away – several personal freedoms, including his failed effort to outlaw the sale of sodas 16 ounces and larger.

“Though the law ran into a judicial buzz saw on the eve of its enactment earlier this month, it demonstrates the attitude city and state legislators have toward their constituents,” the authors noted.

Bloomberg has already imposed a stiff tax on cigarette sales and is a leading advocate for tougher gun laws.

In addition, New Yorkers pay a state income tax of 14 percent.

“Even New Yorkers who don't care about sweet drinks have to deal with the highest state and local tax burden in the country,” the authors wrote.

The result is New Yorkers are voting with their feet, with roughly 1.7 million leaving between 2000 and 2010, though newborns and new immigrants are keeping the state's population steady, according to the study.

“We’re not living in a police state,” White Plains attorney John Murtagh told CBS New York. “But the economics of New York clearly don’t work. And then you see things like Mike Bloomberg and his Big Gulp sodas.”

The top five states with the most freedom are North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, New Hampshire and Oklahoma, according to the study from the center, at George Mason University in Virginia.

North Dakota came in first in large part based of its “very low taxes” and government debt, the authors said. “However, its spending is uncharacteristically high.”

The three other lowest ranking states are Rhode Island, Hawaii and New Jersey, in descending order.

The study authors said California's biggest problem is business regulation, though a recent attempt to impose a higher tax rate on the state’s highest earners has become a major complaint among residents.

“The Golden State, with hundreds of miles of picturesque Pacific coastline, nonetheless managed to drive off a net of 1.5 million residents between 2000 and 2010 -- over 4 percent of its 2000 population,” the authors wrote.

They also pointed out Californians' personal income contracted by 0.4 percent a year in the seven years before the Great Recession struck, a record worse than any other state besides Michigan."

Claims that spending cuts would actually boost employment by promoting confidence have fallen apart. Claims that there is some kind of red line of debt that countries dare not cross have turned out to rest on fuzzy and to some extent just plain erroneous math. Predictions of fiscal crisis keep not coming true; predictions of disaster from harsh austerity policies have proved all too accurate.

Yet calls for a reversal of the destructive turn toward austerity are still having a hard time getting through. Partly that reflects vested interests, for austerity policies serve the interests of wealthy creditors; partly it reflects the unwillingness of influential people to admit being wrong. But there is, I believe, a further obstacle to change: widespread, deep-seated cynicism about the ability of democratic governments, once engaged in stimulus, to change course in the future.

So now seems like a good time to point out that this cynicism, which sounds realistic and worldly-wise, is actually sheer fantasy. Ending stimulus has never been a problem — in fact, the historical record shows that it almost always ends too soon. And in America, at least, we have a pretty good record for behaving in a fiscally responsible fashion, with one exception — namely, the fiscal irresponsibility that prevails when, and only when, hard-line conservatives are in power.

Let’s start with the common claim that stimulus programs never go away.

In the United States, government spending programs designed to boost the economy are in fact rare — F.D.R.’s New Deal and President Obama’s much smaller Recovery Act are the only big examples. And neither program became permanent — in fact, both were scaled back much too soon. F.D.R. cut back sharply in 1937, plunging America back into recession; the Recovery Act had its peak effect in 2010, and has since faded away, a fade that has been a major reason for our slow recovery."

Suicide rates rose 40% in the first six months of 2011 alone.

Murder has doubled.

9,100 doctors in Greece, roughly one out of every seven, have been laid off.

Joining those doctors in joblessness are 27.6% of the entire Greek labor force. By comparison, in the depths of the Great Depression, unemployment in the United States peaked at a lower percentage than that. Among Greek young adults under 25 years old, unemployment reached an abominable 64.9% in May. (Yet the unemployment rate in Greece was as low as 7% as recently as 2008.)

I'm sure that my Tea Party friends will blame universal healthcare, paid sick leave and ""generous"" unemployment benefits for this catastrophe. ""If we simply stopped helping people, then they wouldn't need our help,"" they would say. You can see where that ""logic"" leads. The dead need no help whatsoever, except possibly burial. Sort of like this: ""The Republican healthcare plan: Don't Get Sick. And if you do get sick, Die Quickly.""]

Maybe you think that I'm kidding about what my Tea Party friends would do. I'm not. A few years ago here in Florida, we had a children's health insurance program called KidCare, with a waiting list of over 100,000. The Tea Party Republicans didn't like that. So they eliminated the waiting list.

But back to Greece. A lot of people blame Greek government debt for the current suffering. According to the Central Intelligence Agency, that most authoritative of all conceivable sources, Greek government debt stands at 160% of GDP, which seems like a lot. But Japanese government debt stands at 215% of GDP, and the unemployment rate in Japan is only 4%.

Moreover, Spain's unemployment rate is virtually as high as Greece's, but Spain's government debt stands at only 85% of GDP. That's less debt than Singapore's, and Singapore's unemployment rate is 1.8%.

So we cannot properly attribute the catastrophe in Greece to labor protection, nor can we attribute it to government borrowing. What is the cause, then? The World Health Organization has the answer: austerity. ""Austerity"" is a bloodless term for gross economic mismanagement, animated by heartlessness. That robotic cut-cut-cut mentality that deprives us of jobs, of public services, of safety, of health, of infrastructure, of help for the needy, and – ultimately -- of our economic equilibrium and the ability to survive. The mentality that ushers in, and welcomes, a vicious war of all against all. Austerity is destroying an entire country, right before our eyes.

Or, as the World Health Organization put it: ""These adverse trends in Greece pose a warning to other countries undergoing significant fiscal austerity, including Spain, Ireland and Italy. It also suggests that ways need to be found for cash-strapped governments to consolidate finances without undermining much-needed investments in health.""

In America, we have a rich and powerful lobby that has the same prescription for every economic malady: austerity. Cut-cut-cut. Cut Social Security and Medicare. Cut teacher and police and firefighter jobs. Cut health care. Cut pay and cut pensions. It all boils down to that one ugly word: austerity. And austerity always brings disarray, disaster, decay and death.

People often ask me my position on various issues. Well, I'm for certain things, and I'm against others. But on one issue, I'm very consistent. I'm against pain and suffering. Especially avoidable pain and suffering. And therefore, I'm against austerity. It begins with seemingly innocuous budget cuts. It then leads inexorably to the destruction of countless lives.

Why am I telling you about Greece? In 1935, Sinclair Lewis wrote a book called ""It Can't Happen Here."" But it can. And it's up to us to prevent it.

Story highlights House GOP pushes bill tying government funding to end of Obamacare funding GOP plan locks in current spending levels and prioritizes spending if debt ceiling isn't raised Democrats have said they will not negotiate over Obamacare or the debt ceiling Negotiating over the debt ceiling ""can't be a recipe for government,"" Obama warns

(CNN) —

House GOP leaders announced their intention Wednesday to pass a bill this week that would only keep the government running after September 30 if President Barack Obama’s health care reform law is fully defunded.

The decision sets up a high stakes game of political chicken over the next 12 days, as Democrats have repeatedly rejected any attempt to undo the president’s signature legislative achievement.

“We’re going to continue to do everything we can to repeal the president’s failed health care law,” said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. “The law is a train wreck.”

“We aim to put a stop to Obamacare before it costs one more job or raises a family’s out-of-pocket expenses one more dollar,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia.

The House bill, which would keep the government running through mid-December, also locks in overall funding levels at $986 billion, preserving Washington’s so-called “sequester” – forced across-the-board spending cuts that have been criticized by leaders on both sides of the aisle.

Obamacare, spending showdown heats up in House

Most congressional Democrats, opposed to further cuts in non-defense spending, have expressed their strong opposition to such a move.

In addition, the GOP bill states that Social Security and disability payments need to receive top priority if Congress and the president are unable to raise the federal debt ceiling by mid-October.

A failure to extend the nation’s borrowing limit and pay bills already incurred risks an unprecedented national default.

Obama and other Democratic leaders have warned they will not cave to GOP demands for new spending cuts in exchange for a hike in the debt limit.

“I’m happy to negotiate with (congressional Republicans) around the budget, just as I’ve done in the past,” Obama told business leaders on Wednesday.

“What I will not do is create a habit, a pattern, whereby the full faith and credit of the United States ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy. It’s irresponsible.”

The president told his audience to “flip the script for a second and imagine a situation in which a Democratic speaker said to a Republican president, ‘I’m not going to increase the debt ceiling unless you increase corporate taxes by 20 percent. And if you don’t do it, we’ll default on the debt and cause a worldwide financial crisis.’”

“That can’t be a recipe for government,” he said.

A less confrontational strategy initially backed by GOP leaders unraveled last week.

Government shutdown: Again? Seriously?

Numerous House Republicans threatened to defeat a temporary spending measure proposed by their leadership because it did not directly link continued government funding with a ban on money for the new health care law.

Conservative groups such as Tea Party Patriots and Heritage Action for America praised the harder line now adopted by Boehner and other GOP leaders.

“Senate Democrats and President Obama must make a decision: shut down the government to protect a destructive, unpopular law or acknowledge Obamacare has failed and cannot be salvaged,” said Michael Needham, communications director for Heritage Action.

One Republican, Nebraska Rep. Lee Terry, told CNN that conservative activists had been strongly engaged with House members on the issue in recent weeks.

I “absolutely heard from a lot of our conservative groups over the (summer) break about defunding Obamacare,” Terry said. “The pressure was absolutely there … (though) I didn’t feel like it was pressure per se because I agreed we need to do away with Obamacare.”

Opinion: Worried about Obamacare? Fear not

Another Republican, freshman Rep. Trey Radel of Florida, predicted the White House will eventually give in to at least some GOP demands.

“I think the president will negotiate with us,” he said.

Other Republicans seemed less sure.

“We can’t let the government shut down,” said Rep. Peter King, R-New York. “We can’t be kamikazes and we can’t be General Custer.”

A top Senate Democrat warned House Republicans they were playing a losing hand.

“Republican leaders in the House have decided to give the hard right their day in the sun, and decided to pursue an agenda that they know will never, ever be signed into law,” New York’s Chuck Schumer said.

“Reasonable Republicans, stop these zealots in your party from driving our economy off a cliff.”

Meanwhile, with a potential government shutdown less than two weeks away, the White House budget office directed federal agencies on Wednesday to prepare for a potential shutdown.

Sylvia Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told federal agencies to update their plans in the event no agreement is reached before September 30, the end of the fiscal year.

“Prudent management requires that agencies be prepared for the possibility of a lapse,” Burwell wrote.

It will cost an estimated $241,080 for a middle-income couple to raise a child born last year for 18 years, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released Wednesday. That's up almost 3% from 2011 and doesn't even include the cost of college.

At the same time, wages aren't keeping up. The country's median annual household income has fallen by more than $4,000 since 2000, after adjusting for inflation, and many of the jobs lost during the recent recession have been replaced with lower-wage positions.

The USDA's latest estimates include expenses for housing, food, transportation, clothing, health care, education and child care, as well as miscellaneous expenses, such as toys and computers.

The biggest price tag is for families in the urban Northeast earning $105,360 or more. They will spend $446,100, much more than the national average, according to the report. Meanwhile, families earning less than $61,590 a year in rural areas will spend the least, at $143,160.

While expenses in all categories rose in 2012, health care, education and child care spending increased the most.

Health care spending made up around $20,000, or around 8%, of the USDA's estimated child-rearing expenses for a child born in 2012. Meanwhile, child care and education expenses represented nearly 18% of the total costs for middle-income parents.

Since 2000, the cost of child care has increased twice as fast as the median income of families with children, according to the most recent report from Child Care Aware of America. In 2011, the average cost of full-time center-based care for an infant ranged from about $4,600 a year in Mississippi to more than $15,000 in Massachusetts.

""Many families are priced out of licensed child care services,"" said Lynette Fraga, executive director of the nonprofit group. ""If they are priced out, then the health and safety of those children are at risk.""

Amanda Holdsworth, who lives outside of Detroit with her husband and 22-month-old daughter, pay more than $1,000 a month for their daughter's day care center -- or nearly 15% of their monthly income. The costs are so high that they think twice about having a second child.

""To think about paying two day care rates, it's shocking,"" she said.

Another factor hurting families: rising transportation and food costs. Gas prices almost doubled between 2000 and 2012, even after adjusting for inflation, according to AAA. Meanwhile, food costs have spiked.

Turlock, Calif., resident Jason Hicks, a father of 10- and 13-year old sons, said his family has seen their monthly grocery bill grow from $500 to $800 in the past few years.

""As prices are going up and our kids are reaching teenage years, it's compounded quite quickly,"" he said.

There are ways to ease the cost burdens, said Stuart Ritter, a T. Rowe Price financial planner who teaches a money management class for new parents. Many employers, for example, offer tax-advantaged accounts that let parents pay for health and child care expenses with before-tax dollars.

""I have to reassure everybody there are other people who successfully have children,"" he said. ""I personally have three. People figure out ways to make this work."""

But the last half-decade has proved far worse for black and Hispanic families than for white families, starkly widening the already large gulf in wealth between non-Hispanic white Americans and most minority groups, according to a new study from the Urban Institute.

“It was already dismal,” Darrick Hamilton, a professor at the New School in New York, said of the wealth gap between black and white households. “It got even worse.”

Given the dynamics of the housing recovery and the rebound in the stock market, the wealth gap might still be growing, experts said, further dimming the prospects for economic advancement for current and future generations of Americans from minority groups.

The Urban Institute study found that the racial wealth gap yawned during the recession, even as the income gap between white Americans and nonwhite Americans remained stable. As of 2010, white families, on average, earned about $2 for every $1 that black and Hispanic families earned, a ratio that has remained roughly constant for the last 30 years. But when it comes to wealth — as measured by assets, like cash savings, homes and retirement accounts, minus debts, like mortgages and credit card balances — white families have far outpaced black and Hispanic ones. Before the recession, non-Hispanic white families, on average, were about four times as wealthy as nonwhite families, according to the Urban Institute’s analysis of Federal Reserve data. By 2010, whites were about six times as wealthy."

While a growing chorus in Washington, including President Barack Obama, House Speaker John Boehner, multiple Cabinet secretaries, and some political pundits, criticize deep, automatic spending cuts set to take effect on March 1, the White House and Congress have yet to come up with an alternative to avoid them.

With the imposition of at least some of them appearing more and more likely, here’s a look, by the numbers, at Washington’s self-imposed budget austerity (aka “sequestration” or the “sequester”):

The real impact of automatic cuts and why they may happen after all

2 - Provisions in the Budget Act of 2011 that can result in automatic spending cuts: Appropriating funds over newly established spending caps for years 2012-2021, where the extra amount is automatically cut, and failure of Congress to enact specific deficit-reduction legislation, which has happened.

$1.2 trillion - Total amount of the potential sequestration cuts, over 10 years. This is based on the amount not cut from the deficit by the congressional “super committee” created by the Budget Control Act of 2011.

$85 billion - Amount of deficit reduction necessary for fiscal year 2013 in order to postpone the automatic spending cuts from taking effect March 1.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/04/Post-Cliff-a-Leaderless-Washington,2013-01-04 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Post-'Cliff': A Celebrity President, a Leaderless Washington","President Barack Obama is supposed to lead the country, but barely participated in the “fiscal cliff” negotiations except to berate Republicans in the media. As Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid is meant to move legislation through the upper chamber, but gave up and was sidelined by the Vice President. House Speaker John Boehner is meant to lead his caucus, but they rejected his proposals, and he barely held onto his job.

Welcome to post-“fiscal cliff” Washington, a leaderless chasm in which no one is bold enough to offer an agenda, nor confident enough to compromise. Even the Tea Party refuses to step up: it was ironic that Michele Bachmann cast the 218th vote that gave Boehner the bare majority he needed to retain the Speaker’s gavel. This is an age without a Reagan, without a Thatcher–without even a Ted Kennedy, on the other side.

President Obama marked the conclusion of the “fiscal cliff” deal by promising he would not negotiate with Congress on the debt ceiling. Likewise, Speaker Boehner promised he would no longer negotiate directly with the President. These are absurd promises that mock the spirit of the Constitution’s separation of powers, bold statements that are meant to convey strength but in reality betray the weaknesses of both party’s leaders.

The branches must co-govern, even as they check each other’s power. Yet the separation of powers is something President Obama has never accepted, as he ignores Congress and writes regulations or makes appointments as he pleases. He resents the fact that Congress controls the debt ceiling, and there is now serious talk that he might simply ignore Congress by minting a $1 trillion coin and depositing it in the Treasury.

Meanwhile, in Congress, the Senate has treated the Republican-controlled House as if it were an illegitimate body, ignoring dozens of economic bills passed through the lower chamber even as it refuses to pass a budget. The “extremist” House compromised on the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff, much to the annoyance of the GOP base, because Republicans accepted the reality of divided government. Not so the Democrats.

The new Republican temptation, as expressed by Boehner’s promise not to deal one-on-one with the President, is to withdraw from a political process in which good faith is punished by mockery and demands for more concessions. That is understandable, but mistaken. President Obama is actually weaker than ever, because there is no political will to enact further tax hikes, and because fiscal circumstances demand spending cuts.

These are precisely the conditions under which Republican leaders should want to engage President Obama directly. The President does not want to negotiate because he knows he will have to make concessions–just as, during the campaign, he took little interest in debating Gov. Mitt Romney because he did not want to have to defend his record. The House has the opportunity, finally, to hold the President accountable for his debts.

But instead of inviting direct talks, Speaker Boehner had to reject them to retain his position. And so Republicans have re-elected a leader on a promise not to lead. It is almost as bad as watching Democrats re-elect Nancy Pelosi as Minority Leader after guiding her party to two successive defeats.

Because there are few consequences for bad leadership, there is little good leadership. And so we stagger into the next crisis."

Thank you all so much! Keep spreading the word about Senator Begich's plan. He has the right idea about what to do to strengthen Social Security and we need to get Democrats to make this the party's official plan. Expect more diaries about Begich from me.

Ok, so far Laurence Lewis' front page post is about Chuck Hagel and John Brennan, which yes highlights some valid points and the rec list has diaries about Obama wanting to cut Social Security. Great way to start Sunday Morning off with the first big Obama Rocks/Obama Sucks Pie Fight. Well since the rec list gets filled with both ""Obama Will Betray Us"" and ""11th Dimensional Chess"" themed diaries, I for one am going to repeat a call for action that I have made several times but only made the rec list once. And that is to get everyone to get their Senator and Congressman to back Senator Mark Begich's (D. AK) plan to strengthen Social Security. I've already written about it quite a few times but if Sunday is going to turn out to be a big pie fight, I will take the role of the diarist actually proposing solutions.

Ok, so here's the very first diary I wrote about Begich's plan to strengthen Social Security:

http://www.dailykos.com/...

Begich's plan is known as the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act and here's what the plan calls for:



Lifts the Cap on High-Income Contributions. Current law sets a cap based on income at $113,700 for paying into Social Security. If an individual’s wages hit that total for the year, they no longer pay into the program. Sen. Begich’s bill lifts the cap and asks higher income earners to pay Social Security on all their earnings in order to increase the program’s revenue stream and extend the overall solvency of the program. Extends Social Security for approximately 75 years through modest revenue increases gradually implemented over the course of seven years. - Alaska Native News, 11/14/12

“Sen. Begich’s bill serves the American people well in very important ways,” said Eric Kingson, co-chair of the Strengthen Social Security Coalition. “By asking high-income people to pay the same payroll tax contribution as everyone else, he dramatically improves the financing of Social Security. By improving the accuracy of the cost of living adjustment, he assures that seniors and people with disabilities will be able to maintain their standard of living as time goes on.” - Alaska Native News, 11/14/12

""Mr. President, a few weeks ago back home in Anchorage, I joined a group of seniors I presented this piece of legislation to them at the Anchorage Senior Center and she says she loves to describe herself as a ""young woman from Alaska"" stood up. Beverly Moore, an 81-year old Korean War Navy veteran. Beverly was there because the majority of her modest income comes from Social Security. And she wanted to know how this proposal will strengthen that lifeline for her and thousands of Alaskans. In fact, one in nine Alaskans receive Social Security. With my states population of those 65 and older expanding rapidly, Social Security will continue to play a key role in supplementing a decent living. If Social Security was not there for the elderly Alaskans, a fifth of them would live below poverty. It's vital for our state, it's vital for all our states and for this whole country. Mr. President I have no illusions that this bill is going to pass in the final weeks of this 112th congress but I wanted to get it into the mix. I wanted to make sure people got the bigger point and again I would say to my residing officer and says this well and I know my friend here from Oregon who is on the floor also as we talk about the deficit that has taken center stage right now, we want to highlight one very clear thing: Social Security has not contributed, is not part of and never will contribute to the deficit. So those who like to meddle in it and try to combine it into this deficit talk are just playing games with our seniors and disabled in this country."" - U.S. Senator Mark Begich (D. AK), 12/7/12

You can help in three ways. (1) Call Senator Begich’s office and thank him. It’s seriously important to let him know that real progressives are behind a real progressive proposal. His DC office number is: Senator Mark Begich

(202) 224 – 3004

(877) 501 – 6275 (toll-free) (2) Get behind this bill. If you can publicize it, do. If you can write about it, do. If you can talk about it, do. We need to do our part as well to promote real progressive legislation. The next four years should not be a spectator sport. (3) Call your senators — both of them — and ask them to co-sign this bill. This needs momentum, and co-signers provide that. The list of Senate phone numbers is here.: http://www.senate.gov/... - America Blog, 11/19/12

Now here's the actual plan:The Alaskan AARP and the coalition to strengthen Social Security have endorsed Begich's plan:Now here's Begich making the case for the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act on the Senate floor and explaining how Social Security doesn't contribute to the defict:Sounds like a great plan, right? Wouldn't it be nice if every Democratic Senator backed this plan? Well instead of spending the day fighting each other in the comments section of people's diaries, how about we focus on putting the pressure on the Senate to make it a reality. Here's how you can do so:I'll leave you with this diary. Every time I sense an Obama pie fight regarding Social Security a brewing, I'm just going to post another diary about Begich's plan. Personally, I like inspiring you guys to take action with actual solutions rather than argue with you. Happy Sunday!"
http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/11/pf/taxes/beer-taxes/index.html,2013-06-11 00:00:00,['Melanie Hicken'],Beer taxes: Why six-packs are pricier in some states,"Every state imposes a tax on beer, but the amount each state charges varies widely.

Buy a six-pack of beer in Tennessee and you'll pay 66 cents towards state beer taxes. Yet, right across the border in Missouri, the tax drops to mere pennies.

With a state excise tax of 6 cents per gallon of beer, or three cents per six pack, Missouri -- home to Anheuser-Busch (BUD) -- has one of the lowest beer taxes in the nation.

Tennessee, which happens to be the heart of whiskey country, claims the top spot, due to combined excise and wholesale taxes that push the tax burden for consumers to $1.17 per gallon, or 66 cents per six pack, according to the Tax Foundation's analysis of beer-specific statewide taxes. In contrast, the state's taxes on spirits -- including whiskey -- rank 30th in the nation.

Other states with the highest beer taxes include Alaska ($1.07 per gallon), Alabama ($1.05) and Georgia ($1.01), which charge more than 50 cents in taxes on a six-pack.

Meanwhile, the lowest taxes are in Wyoming, a generally tax-friendly state which levies only two cents in taxes on a gallon of beer or one cent per six pack. Other low beer-tax states include Wisconsin and Colorado, the respective birthplaces of Miller and Coors brews.

Sometimes dubbed ""sin taxes,"" excise taxes are selective taxes on specific goods and activities, such as cigarettes, gasoline and indoor tanning services. Beyond raising revenue, excise taxes are often aimed at decreasing consumption and paying for government services related to the product. For example, gasoline taxes help fund road and highway repairs.

Beer lovers not only indirectly pay a state beer tax, but they may also face a local excise tax as well as a federal excise tax of about 58 cents per gallon (for large brewers), or about 33 cents per six-pack. All of this is in addition to any state and local sales tax that is charged whether the beer is bought at a grocery store or a favorite pub. And some states tack on case or bottle fees and other special sales taxes specifically targeting alcoholic beverages.

Excise taxes are typically paid by brewers and distributors before the beer reaches store shelves so they won't show up on a receipt like a sales tax, but consumers still feel their effects.

""A higher tax on beer is going to make for a higher price on beer,"" said Scott Drenkard, an economist at the Tax Foundation.

The difference adds up. Buy a six-pack once a week for a year in Tennessee and your purchases will have included around $34 for state taxes. In Missouri, less than $2 in state beer taxes would be included in the same purchases.

While the way Tennessee's wholesale beer tax is charged is slated to change in July, the tax rate will remain among the country's highest.

Related: Are you paying the iTunes tax?

Anti-drunk driving groups and other advocacy groups argue that other states should raise outdated beer tax rates to help reduce consumption and pay for prevention and healthcare programs.

Wyoming, for instance, hasn't raised its beer excise tax since 1935, two years after the end of Prohibition, while Pennsylvania's dates back to 1947, according to Alcohol Justice, a self-proclaimed industry watchdog that argues that all state beer taxes are too low.

The brewing industry counters that beer is already one of the country's most heavily-taxed goods. Including federal and state business taxes, taxes make up 40% of beer's retail price tag, according to The Beer Institute, an industry trade group. Similar to sales taxes, beer taxes are regressive, meaning that they hit lower and middle-class consumers the hardest, the institute argues.

""This is an invisible tax that consumers don't know they're paying,"" Beer Institute President Joe McClain said in a March 2013 audio interview posted on the group's website. ""The people who enjoy beer the most, those middle-class Americans, are feeling the bite of that tax more."""

Already, some Senate conservatives are moving against the proposal, which Murray and Ryan say would provide sequester relief by increasing spending by $63 billion over the next two years, but offsetting that increase with $86 billion in new spending cuts and revenues over the next decade. For example, Rand Paul:



“Senator Paul will oppose the reported cap busting deal,” Doug Stafford, Paul’s senior adviser, told POLITICO on Wednesday. “He opposes increasing spending and undoing the minimal sequester cuts in current law, which weren’t even close to enough to begin with.”

“It doesn’t appear to be something I will likely support,” Crapo said. “It’s pretty light on entitlement reform and the entitlement reform that’s done is not structural. It doesn’t do anything to actually change or fix that. We’re looking now to see if it can pass the Congress.”

And Sen. Mike Crapo, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said:But even if Senate Republicans don't provide much support for the deal, history suggests it can still pass the Senate because it has the support of Senate leadership and President Obama. The real question is whether Republicans will be able to get it through the House without Democratic help, and whether House Democrats will provide that help if Republicans ask for it.

Yesterday, Ryan said he expected conservatives would support the deal, pointing out that its spending levels are lower than the ones contained in the budget that House Republicans passed last year. And this morning, House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor appeared at a press conference with Ryan to demonstrate their support for the deal—and to try suggest that if Republicans pass it, it will allow them to pivot their focus back to Obamacare instead of dealing with another fiscal crisis.

Nonetheless, conservative groups were already railing against the deal even before it was announced, putting pressure on House Republicans to oppose it—and their efforts may be having an impact:





@jamiedupree Many House GOP lawmakers leaving meeting on budget deal obviously not thrilled with Ryan-Murray budget deal



@edatpost ""Stay tuned"" @Nancypelosi says in regards to whether Democrats will support #budget agreememt.

Obviously, ""not thrilled"" doesn't mean they'll vote against it, but given the history of House Republicans, it would be foolish to discount the possibility. So, if enough Republicans bolt to tank the deal, will House Democrats provide John Boehner cover?The one thing we do know is that whether or not this deal passes, a huge economic issue remains unresolved: Extending emergency unemployment benefits for out-of-work Americans. Whatever Congress does with the budget, there's no excuse for cutting unemployment insurance now, especially in the middle of the holiday season.

::

Tell your member of Congress: Don't cut emergency unemployment benefits

Here's more on how Boehner is pushing back against right-wing criticism of the budget deal. Also, other GOP senators opposing the deal include John Barrasso of Wyoming, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Jeff Sessions of Alabama."
http://news.yahoo.com/us-economy-shrinks-0-1-pct-1st-time-142114641--finance.html,,[],"US economy shrinks 0.1 pct., 1st time in 3½ years","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy unexpectedly shrank from October through December, the first quarterly drop since 2009 and a reminder of the economy's vulnerability as automatic cuts in government spending loom.

The Commerce Department said the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent mainly because companies restocked at a slower rate and the government slashed defense spending. Those trends partly reflected uncertainty late last year about the fiscal cliff, which Congress averted in a deal reached Jan. 1.

Economists say those factors could prove temporary, and the likelihood of another recession appears remote. Still, the sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent annual growth rate in the July-September quarter, also driven by a drop in U.S. exports, raised concerns about 2013.

Congressional Republicans seem determined to permit deep cuts to defense and domestic programs to kick in as scheduled March 1. And Americans are coming to grips with an increase in Social Security taxes that has begun to leave them with less take-home pay.

Government spending cuts and slower company restocking, which can fluctuate sharply, subtracted a combined 2.6 percentage points from GDP. Those two factors offset a 2.2 percent increase in consumer spending. And business spending on equipment and software rose after shrinking over the summer.

The Federal Reserve referred to the fourth-quarter slowdown in a statement after it ended a policy meeting Wednesday. The U.S. economy appears to have ""paused in recent months,"" the Fed said, mainly because of temporary factors. The Fed reaffirmed its commitment to stimulating the economy by keeping borrowing costs low for the foreseeable future.

For all of 2012, the economy expanded 2.2 percent, better than 2011's growth of 1.8 percent. For 2013, analysts generally think the economy will grow at a steady if modest pace of roughly 2 percent as the housing and auto sectors continue to recover along with bank lending and consumer spending.

Story continues

""Frankly, this is the best-looking contraction in U.S. GDP you'll ever see,"" Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. ""The drag from defense spending and inventories is a one-off. The rest of the report is all encouraging.""

The plunge in defense spending in the October-December quarter followed a jump in the third quarter. The fluctuation might have reflected higher-than-usual spending that occurred in the July-September period in anticipation of government spending cuts later in the year. Some defense contractors reported lower government spending at the end of the year.

Last week, General Dynamics blamed a $2 billion loss in the fourth quarter on ""slowed defense spending.""

Exports fell by the most in nearly four years, a result of Europe's recession and slower growth in China and some other large developing countries.

Incomes, though, jumped last quarter as companies paid out special dividends and bonuses ahead of expected tax increases in 2013. Commerce estimated that businesses paid nearly $40 billion in early dividends. After-tax income, adjusted for inflation, rose 6.8 percent, the most in nearly four years.

Superstorm Sandy likely also dragged on growth by closing factories, disrupting shipping and shutting down retail stores. While the department did not specify Sandy's effect on GDP, it estimated that Sandy destroyed about $36 billion in private property and $8.6 billion in government property.

Subpar economic growth has held back hiring. The economy has added about 150,000 jobs a month, on average, for the past two years. That's barely enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which has been a still-high 7.8 percent for two months.

Economists forecast that unemployment stayed at that rate in January. The government will release the January jobs report Friday.

The slower growth in stockpiles followed a jump in the third quarter. Slower inventory growth means factories likely produced less. Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. said this week, for example, that it reduced its inventories in the fourth quarter as global sales declined from a year earlier.

Still, with consumer spending rising, companies might have to rebuild inventories in the current January-March quarter, economists say. That could boost growth.

Wednesday's report is the first of three estimates of GDP the government issues each quarter. GDP measures the nation's total output of goods and services — from restaurant meals and haircuts to airplanes and appliances. The estimates of GDP are revised by an average of 1.3 percentage points between the first and third estimate. That means the final figure for the fourth quarter might end up showing either growth or a steeper contraction.

A big question for 2013 is how consumers will react to the expiration of the Social Security tax cut. Congress and the White House allowed the temporary tax cut to expire in January but prevented income taxes from rising for most Americans.

The Social Security tax increase will reduce take-home pay this year by about 2 percent. A household earning $50,000 a year will have about $1,000 less to spend. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.

A key measure of consumer confidence plummeted this month after Americans noticed the reduction in their paychecks, the Conference Board reported Tuesday.

Several trends, though, are expected to boost growth later this year.

Home builders are stepping up construction to meet rising demand. That should create more construction jobs.

And home prices are rising steadily. That tends to make Americans feel wealthier and more likely to spend. Housing could add as much as 1 percentage point to economic growth this year.

In addition, auto sales reached their highest level in five years in 2012. That's boosting production and hiring at U.S. automakers and their suppliers."

Aides say Obama is showing solidarity with federal employees facing furloughs

The move%2C which adds up to a %2420%2C000 cut in pay%2C is retroactive to March 1

A few members of Congress have announced similar sacrifices

President Obama plans to take a 5% salary cut in support of federal workers who are going to be furloughed, officials said Wednesday.

The decision comes a day after a similar move by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Obama's move is retroactive to March 1, the first day the ongoing $85 billion in budget cuts known as the sequester began to take effect.

The president's base salary is $400,000 a year; 5% adds up to $20,000.

Because Congress sets the president's salary by law, his actual paycheck cannot be reduced; Obama will have to honor the voluntary pay cut by returning money to the Treasury.

Hagel and Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter have announced plans to give up part of their pay because about 700,000 civilian workers face mandatory furloughs this summer.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Deputy Secretary Maurice Jones will also forgo some of his salary, their office said.

Two administration officials discussed Obama's plans on the condition they not be named while discussing the president's personal finances.

Said one official: ""The salary for the president, as with members of Congress, is set by law and cannot be changed. However, the president has decided that to share in the sacrifice being made by public servants across the federal government that are affected by the sequester, he will contribute a portion of his salary back to the Treasury.""

A few members of Congress also have announced self-imposed pay cuts. Lawmakers' salaries are exempted from the sequester, so any reductions in pay are voluntary.

Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, who is up for re-election in 2014, said Wednesday that he will return a portion of his $174,000 salary to the Treasury. ""We need to be making responsible cuts wherever we can, and there is no reason that members of Congress shouldn't feel the pinch like everyone else,"" he said in a statement.

More than half of the senator's staff will take a pay cut this year, he said, and his office began furloughs in March.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., also said she will give up a portion of her salary.

The Senate approved an amendment last month authored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to establish a reserve fund to lessen the sequester's impact by allowing members of Congress to donate 20% of their salaries to it. However, it was a non-binding vote to the budget resolution and does not have the force of law.

Congress returns next week from the two-week spring recess. Begich said he intends to work with Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., to cut ""billions"" more in federal spending, and ""I hope my colleagues come back from the holidays ready to get to work.""



Prior to adjourning for the spring recess, the GOP-controlled House approved reduced funding levels for the chamber's 21 committees, but not for lawmakers. The approximate 11% reduction in spending from 2012 is mandated under the sequester.

House Administration Committee Chairman Candice Miller, R-Mich., said the cuts were necessary and ""will undoubtedly challenge each committee to do more with less."""

In the United States, half of the 7.5 million jobs lost during the Great Recession were paid middle-class wages, ranging from $37,000 to $68,000. But only 2 percent of the 3.4 million jobs gained since the recession are mid-pay. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)

The January jobs numbers released earlier on Friday show that while the private sector added 166,000 jobs, the government shed 9,000 positions in January.

Those job losses have ripple effects throughout the economy, economist Dean Baker explained. ""If these people were still getting paychecks, they would have spent them, and that would have employed people elsewhere in the economy,"" the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research told The Huffington Post. He estimated that government job cuts have cost the economy more than 1 million jobs total.

The unemployment rate rose to 7.9 percent in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, not much lower than a year ago. In contrast, the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent just before the recession, according to BLS.

""The stimulus was helpful, but it wasn't nearly enough,"" said Baker, who also blogs for The Huffington Post.

The government now is focused on deficit reduction instead of helping put people back to work, he said. ""No one is talking about how we shouldn't be cutting the deficit; we really need more jobs and that means larger deficits. No one prominent in the debate is saying that.""

The government reduced the maximum duration of unemployment benefits last year. But instead of boosting hiring, this only led some jobless workers to give up looking for work, according to a statement from Baker. (Receiving unemployment benefits is contingent on searching for a job.) The average duration of unemployment has declined over the past year from 40 weeks to 35 weeks, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The government is scheduled to soon slash spending even more. The government recently postponed but did not eliminate the sequestration, across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to kick in starting on March 1 after a congressional committee formed in response to the debt ceiling crisis failed in 2011 to agree on a deficit reduction plan.

The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that sequestration would eliminate 689,000 jobs in 2013 and cut GDP growth by 0.6 percentage points.

Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former Obama administration economic adviser, who also blogs for HuffPost, said that letting the sequestration go into effect probably would send the unemployment rate up to 8.2 percent.

""While the government's fiscal policy was adding to growth back in 2009 and 2010, at this point it's subtracting from growth,"" Bernstein said, pointing to the end of the stimulus and payroll tax cut. ""If state and local employment had held up instead of falling so quickly, the unemployment rate would easily be a point lower than it is today [6.9 percent]."""

Sometimes I long for the wit of a Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert. They treat this town as burlesque, and with satire and parody show it the disrespect it deserves. We laugh, and punch each other on the arm, and tweet that the rascals got their just dessert. Still, the last laugh always seems to go to the boldface names that populate this town. To them belong the spoils of a looted city. They get the tax breaks, the loopholes, the contracts, the payoffs.

They fix the system so multimillionaire hedge fund managers and private equity tycoons pay less of a tax rate on their income than school teachers, police and fire fighters, secretaries and janitors. They give subsidies to rich corporate farms and cut food stamps for working people facing hunger. They remove oversight of the wall street casinos, bail out the bankers who torpedo the economy, fight the modest reforms of Dodd-Frank, prolong tax havens for multinationals, and stick it to consumers while rewarding corporations.

We pay. We pay at the grocery store. We pay at the gas pump. We pay the taxes they write off. Our low-wage workers pay with sweat and deprivation because this town – aloof, self-obsessed, bought off and doing very well, thank you – feels no pain.

The journalists who could tell us these things rarely do – and some, never. They aren’t blind, simply bedazzled. Watch the evening news – any evening news – or the Sunday talk shows. Listen to the chit-chat of the early risers on morning TV -- and ask yourself if you are learning anything about how this town actually works.

William Greider, one of our craft’s finest reporters, fierce and unbought, despite a long life in Washington once said that no one can hope to understand what is driving political behavior without asking the kind of gut-level questions politicians ask themselves in private: “Who are the winners in this matter and who are the losers? Who gets the money and who has to pay? Who must be heard on this question and who can be safely ignored?”

Perhaps they don’t ask these questions because they fear banishment from the parties and perks, from the access that passes as seduction in this town.

Or perhaps they do not tell us these things because they fear that if the system were exposed for what it is, outraged citizens would descend on this town, and tear it apart with their bare hands."

""If the Congress does not fulfill its responsibility to pass a budget today, most of the government will shut down tomorrow,"" Obama said.

Obama gave a rundown of how a government shutdown would affect Americans. He noted that ""NASA will shut down almost entirely"" though Mission Control will remain active; national parks and monuments will close; and veterans will find support centers unstaffed.

""A shutdown will have a very real economic impact on a lot of people right away,"" Obama said.

""The idea of putting people's hard-earned progress at risk is the height of irresponsibility, and it does not have to happen,"" Obama said.

Obama said a shutdown ""is entirely preventable"" if the House acts as the Senate already has. Obama also directly addressed those who think using Obamacare as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations will keep the health care law from being implemented.

""You can't shut it down,"" Obama said of the health care law.

""Does anybody truly believe that we won't have this fight again in a couple more months?"" Obama asked.

Obama called keeping the government open a ""basic responsibility"" and said preventing a shutdown wouldn't be seen as a point of weakness.

The president placed blame squarely on Republican lawmakers at a Friday press conference for failing to stop automatic spending cuts that were to begin kicking in later in the day, calling the cuts ""dumb, arbitrary.""

Republicans, for their part, said the fault was his, for insisting that increased taxes be part of the resolution

The president said the impact of the cuts won't immediately be felt, but middle class families will begin to ""have their lives disrupted in significant ways."" He said that as long as the cuts stay in effect, Americans will know that the economy could have been better had they been averted.

""The pain, though, will be real,"" Obama said.

He said he still believed the cuts could be replaced but he wanted a deal that includes more tax revenue.

""Let's be clear: None of this is necessary,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. ""It's happening because of a choice that Republicans in Congress have made. We shouldn't be making a series of dumb, arbitrary cuts to things.""

Obama met for less than an hour Friday morning with House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

Boehner's office said he and McConnell told Obama they're willing to close tax loopholes but only to lower taxes overall, not to replace spending cuts. Obama and congressional leaders have agreed that Congress should pass a bill funding the government beyond the end of March while they keep working on a way to replace the spending cuts, Boehner's office said.

""The president got his tax hikes on January 1st,"" Boehner said bluntly after the meeting with Obama. ""The discussion about revenue in my view is over. It's about taking on the spending problem here in Washington.""

On Thursday, two proposals aimed at blunting the blame over the cuts -- one Democratic and the other Republican -- were rejected in the Senate.

McConnell has already drawn a line in the stand and said in a statement released before Friday's meeting that Republicans will not support any last-minute deals and they will not raise taxes.

""Republicans have offered the President numerous solutions, including the flexibility he needs to secure those reductions more intelligently,"" McConnell said in the statement. ""I am happy to discuss other ideas to keep our commitment to reducing Washington spending at today's meeting. But there will be no last-minute, back-room deal and absolutely no agreement to increase taxes.""

In addition to McConnell, the President meet with House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Vice President Biden will also be at the meeting.

In the days leading up to the deadline, there were few signs that either party had much progress on how to cut the federal debt that now tops $16.5 trillion.

As the White House has come to acknowledge, the impact of the cuts will – for the most part -- not be felt immediately.

The billions of dollars in budget cuts are most likely going to phase in over the next few months. Furloughs of government workers will begin several weeks from now. Administration officials say the impact of this and other cuts will build up over time; Obama describes the effect on the economy as a “tumble downward.”

But some fiscal hawks see a silver lining, in that the sequester will force the government to trim the waste in order to shield higher-priority items. Already, the White House budget office is recommending agencies take a skeptical eye toward costly conferences and training programs.

The two sides remain deadlocked over the issue of raising taxes. Republicans want to replace the current regime of cuts with different, more sensible, cuts. Democrats want to blend in a set of tax increases, closing loopholes for top earners and some corporations.

The effects of the 2013 sequestration will be rolled out over the next several months. It won’t be a government shutdown but it will be a government slowdown.

“The impact of this policy won’t be felt overnight but it will be real,” Obama said. “The longer these cuts are in place, the greater the damage.”

The predicted impact of the spending cuts could come in flight delays, limited hours at national parks, longer wait times at border crossings and furloughs of civilian Pentagon employees – and workers at several other agencies.

Some officials say the administration has the leeway, or should be given the leeway, to spread around the budget pain.

“There is so much hype on this, it’s ridiculous,” David Walker, former U.S. comptroller general, told Fox News. “We spend as much money as the next 15 countries put together and some of the people who are hyping this big time are going to be really embarrassed.”

How the public reacts to the cuts will have an effect on how Congress addresses the issue. If voters react with a shrug, the GOP may be less compelled to agree to the kinds of tax increases Obama wants. If there’s a big backlash, the Obama administration may take it as vindication that the public won’t stand for big cuts to federally funded programs. Still, Republicans point out that the sequester idea originated at the White House.

“The sky is not going to fall but things will get progressively worse,” Maryland Democrat Rep. Chris Van Hollen said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday’s talks are designed to be a “constructive discussion” about how to keep the deep spending cuts from having harmful consequences.

The meeting, the first face-to-face since Obama was sworn in for his second term in January, will essentially look past the current $85 billion in cuts to the next looming fiscal crisis – a possible government shutdown.

On March 27, the fiscal 2013 continuing appropriations resolution expires, cutting off the ability of most agencies and programs to operate. A new spending bill will be needed to keep the government from shutting down.

Following March Madness – budget style – Congress will have two months to decide on the debt limit. Congress has suspended enforcement of the $16.4 trillion limit on federal borrowing until May 18. The short-term debt limit deal will then raise the borrowing limit the following day, on May 19, to the debt accumulated up through May 18. The short-term extension, approved in January, will allow what budget experts project will be $450 billion in additional borrowing before the debt limit is raised to a new, higher level.

And then, even if no increase in granted by May 19, the Treasury Department will be able to stave off a final day of reckoning until late July or early August by redeploying cash management measures which would allow it to claw back about $220 billion worth of borrowing capacity.

That money, the officials said, could be used to finance the investment in jobs.

The revenue would result from the transition to a revised code — for example, as companies paid a one-time fee on profits they earned overseas but did not bring home because they did not make them subject to American tax rates.

For two years, Republicans have rejected most of Mr. Obama’s initiatives to create jobs, in part because, to avoid increasing the budget deficit, he has paired those ideas with proposals to repeal or reduce tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations, especially oil companies.

By presenting the tax-rate cut as a stand-alone proposal, the White House hoped to make it more appealing to Republicans — or, failing that, to depict them as obstructionists. Both Republicans and the administration have said that an overhaul of the corporate code should be “revenue neutral,” meaning it does not add to or subtract from the annual budget deficit.

The White House and Republicans also clashed over Mr. Obama’s contention that he was making a concession by calling for an overhaul of the corporate tax code separate from one for individual taxes. In truth, analysts said, both the White House and Republicans have been increasingly open to separating the two, although neither likes to advertise it.

In February 2012, Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, said the administration’s plan was devised so that the corporate tax code could be overhauled separately."
http://news.yahoo.com/spin-meter-dubious-list-budget-horribles-184834571--finance.html,,[],SPIN METER: A dubious list of budget 'horribles',"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama and his officials are doing their best to drum up public concern over the shock wave of spending cuts that could strike the government in just days. So it's a good time to be alert for sky-is-falling hype.

Administration officials are coming forward with a grim compendium of jobs to be lost, services to be denied or delayed, military defenses to be let down and important operations to be disrupted. Obama's new chief of staff, Denis McDonough, spoke of a ""devastating list of horribles.""

For most Americans, though, it's far from certain they will have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day if the budget-shredder known as the sequester comes to pass. Maybe they will, if the impasse drags on for months.

For now, there's a whiff of the familiar in all the foreboding, harking back to the mid-1990s partial government shutdown, when officials said old people would go hungry, illegal immigrants would have the run of the of the land and veterans would go without meds. It didn't happen.

For this episode, provisions are in place to preserve the most crucial services — and benefit checks. Furloughs of federal workers are at least a month away, breathing room for a political settlement if the will to achieve one is found. Many government contractors would continue to be paid with money previously approved.

But while the government prepares to make the best of a tough situation, it's putting the worst possible face on it all.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan says teacher layoffs have already begun, but he has not backed up that claim and school administrators say no pink slips are expected before May, for the next school year, if the budget crisis persists.

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the money crunch means the national parks system will be hit with a ""perfect storm.""

But perish the thought of yellow police tape around Yellowstone. It's far from settled that parks would close. Officials said to expect reduced operating hours, fewer rangers, bathrooms that might be locked and trash that might not be collected as often.

Story continues

To be sure, the cuts are big and will have consequences. Knowing what they will be, though, is far from a precise exercise.

And there is a lot of improbable precision in administration statements about what could happen: more than 373,000 seriously ill people losing mental health services, 600,000 low-income pregnant women and new mothers losing food aid and nutrition education, 1,200 fewer inspections of dangerous work sites, 125,000 poor households going without vouchers, and much more.

""These numbers are just numbers thrown out into the thin air with no anchor, and I think they don't provoke the outrage or concern that the Obama administration seeks,"" said Paul Light, a New York University professor who specializes in the federal bureaucracy and budget. For all the dire warnings, he said, ""It's not clear who gets hurt by this.""

The estimates in many cases come from a simple calculation: Divide the proscribed spending cut by a program's per-person spending to see how many beneficiaries may lose services or benefits under the sequester.

But in practice, through all the layers of bureaucracy and the everyday smoke and mirrors of the federal budget, there is rarely a direct and measurable correlation between a federal dollar and its effect on the ground.

That has meant a lot of tenuous ""could happen"" warnings by the administration, not so much ""will happen"" evidence.

So it was in Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' letter to Congress laying out likely consequences of the spending cuts for her agency's operations. She said the sequester ""could"" compromise the well-being of more than 373,000 people who ""potentially"" would not get needed mental health services, which in turn ""could result"" in more hospitalizations and homelessness.

Duncan left himself less wiggle room. ""This stuff is real,"" he said last week. ""Schools are already starting to give teachers notices.""

Asked to provide backup for Duncan's assertion, spokesman Daren Briscoe said it was based on ""an unspecified call he was on with unnamed persons,"" and the secretary might not be comfortable sharing details.

Briscoe referred queries about layoffs to the American Association of School Administrators. Noelle M. Ellerson, an assistant director of the organization, said Monday that in her many discussions with superintendents at the group's just-completed annual meeting, she heard of no layoffs of teachers. While everyone is bracing for that possibility down the road, she said, ""not a single one I spoke with had already issued pink slips.""

Most school district budgets for the next school year won't be completed for two months, she said, meaning any layoff notices would come in early to mid-May. ""No one had yet acted.""

As for the assertion that 600,000 women could be dropped from the Women, Infants and Children Program, that's not to say the rolls would be cut by that number. The actual number is likely to include women who are not enrolled in the program now and could be denied when seeking to join it. Federal officials say the true number will depend on how states can manage their caseloads.

Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has warned of impending furloughs of air traffic controllers, who may need to take one day off every two weeks, and said air-travel delays are likely across the country. Asked Friday why the airline lobby predicted no major impact on air travel from the sequester, he said, ""I don't think they have the information we're presenting to them today.""

""The idea that we're just doing this to create some kind of a horrific scare tactic is nonsense,"" LaHood said. But it's a pressure tactic nonetheless: ""What I'm trying to do is to wake up members of the Congress on the Republican side to the idea that they need to come to the table.""

However the cuts fall, Light at NYU says the Washington Monument ploy, also known as the Firemen First principle, is at work.

It goes like this: Put someone's budget at risk and the first thing you'll hear is a threat to close a cherished national symbol or lay off firefighters and police, when in fact there are other ways to cut spending.

It so happens the Washington Monument is already closed, for earthquake repair. But Obama indulged in the Firemen First principle quite literally.

He appeared at the White House in front of officers in blue uniforms to warn of the consequences of the sequester. ""Emergency responders like the ones who are here today — their ability to help communities respond to and recover from disasters will be degraded.""

FBI and Border Patrol furloughs are expected. Still, the White House has directed agencies to avoid cuts presenting ""risks to life, safety or health"" and to minimize harm to crucial services.

The law gives little flexibility to agencies to protect favored programs, except for big ones specifically exempted from the automatic cuts, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans benefits. There's only so much latitude to move money among accounts.

But not everything is cast in stone. The Small Business Administration, for example, should be able to avoid furloughs because of early retirements already achieved, said Karen Mills, the administrator. And she said declining demand for one type of loan should free up money for other lending, so ""we are not slowing down giving loans to anyone.""

In the partial government shutdown during his presidency, Bill Clinton and his officials told some tall tales and sketched dark scenarios that didn't come to pass, though some might have if the crisis had lasted weeks or months longer. The shutdown played out over two installments totaling 26 days from mid-November 1995 to early January 1996.

National park properties closed (yes, even the Washington Monument), passport and federal mortgage insurance processing were disrupted and toxic waste cleanup stalled as hundreds of thousands of federal workers went idle, paid retroactively later. But states, communities and private groups stepped up to tide over the neediest, keeping Meals on Wheels rolling with their own resources, for example, until Clinton found emergency money to cover the costs. Warnings that Medicare treatment would be withheld proved unfounded, and veterans got their care.

Contractors, who perform many key services for government, kept working for IOUs. A claim by the government that deportations ""have virtually ended"" was not so.

The Justice Department told the story of a Florida gas station rejecting the government-issued credit card of a drug-enforcement agent to illustrate the indignity of it all.

But the reality was humdrum: The card had merely expired.

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",McConnell delivers; Boehner can’t,"God bless Mitch McConnell.

The Senate Republican leader isn’t an especially lovable figure. Even many of his fellow conservatives are lukewarm about him.

He’s colorless and charisma-free. He’s a thoroughgoing partisan who has launched more filibusters than any Senate leader in history. He’s a relentless fan of unlimited campaign spending and a bitter opponent not just of Obamacare but of all things Obama. Asked in 2010 to describe his highest legislative goal, he said it was to make sure Barack Obama was a one-term president.

PHOTOS: Tea party backlash: Protest signs to cheer you up

But the wily Kentuckian is also an old-fashioned legislative strategist who can count votes, discern when his party is holding a losing hand and make the decision to cut a deal.

That’s what McConnell did this week when he sat down with his Democratic counterpart, the equally unlovable Harry Reid of Nevada, and struck a bargain to reopen the federal government and avert the danger of a default on the national debt.

“No one wants a default,” McConnell said. “So let’s put this hysterical talk of default behind us and instead start talking about finding solutions.”

McConnell took a distinct political risk in agreeing to extend the federal debt ceiling until February with almost no strings attached. The Senate Conservatives Fund, a fundraising group that backs primary challenges to Republicans it deems insufficiently hard-line, denounced him for “negotiating surrender.” (This column won’t do him much good either.)

But McConnell could read the polls. The longer the government shutdown continued and the closer the nation came to a politically induced financial crisis, the more the GOP was losing.

And McConnell, a ferocious enforcer of discipline, knew he could deliver most of his party’s votes. “There are few things more daunting in politics,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) once said, “than the determined opposition of Sen. McConnell.”

But whether a deal is on track by the time you read this column — something in no way certain as I write these words — doesn’t depend on McConnell alone. His counterpart on the other side of Capitol Hill has a tougher job.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who holds a safe seat and commands a 32-seat majority, can’t manage to work his will among the 232 Republicans who chose him as their leader.

On Tuesday, Boehner and his lieutenants tried to unveil a proposal of their own to end the budget standoff, one with tougher conditions than the bargain McConnell struck with Reid. The idea was to give the House a coherent position from which to negotiate with the Senate and to avoid being “jammed” to accept the McConnell-Reid deal as the Oct. 17 deadline for lifting the debt ceiling bore down.

In a basement conference room in the Capitol on Tuesday morning, House Republicans gathered, bowed their heads, and — in lieu of an opening prayer — sang three a cappella verses of “Amazing Grace.”

It went downhill from there. Tea party conservatives, who had caucused the night before at a Mexican restaurant called Tortilla Coast, complained that Boehner’s draft didn’t do enough to block Obama’s healthcare law. Fiscal conservatives balked at lifting the debt ceiling for as long as the four months proposed by the Senate.

Boehner warned his colleagues — as he has many times — that flirting with the debt ceiling was a bad idea. “The idea of default is wrong, and we shouldn’t get anywhere close to it,” he said. But after a day of backroom negotiations, the speaker withdrew his own draft proposal, leaving the House without any plan at all.

The difference between the two leaders isn’t merely a matter of talent or style. Because House members represent much smaller, often more homogenous constituencies, many of them see no reason to compromise. This week, for example, as polls showed the Republican Party plummeting in the eyes of voters, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) dismissed the numbers, saying it was more important for conservatives to stick to their principles.

McConnell’s challenge is different: His mission is to make it possible for Republicans to win the six more seats they need to secure a majority in the Senate. That means fighting for conservative principles when he can, but not at the cost of diminishing the GOP’s appeal to centrist voters.

In the House, the roughly 35 Republicans who ally with the tea party make the difference between a majority and a minority for the GOP. In the Senate, McConnell has to contend with only three tea party renegades in his caucus of 48: Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky.

The difference mirrors the larger dilemma faced by the Republican Party nationwide: Should it focus on building a grass-roots movement of committed tea party conservatives, or seek to enlarge its coalition by welcoming more moderates and pragmatists?

The answer matters to McConnell in more ways than one. He faces a well-funded Tea Party opponent in Kentucky’s GOP primary next year. If he can survive that challenge and help six more Republicans win Senate seats, he might yet achieve his ambition of being sworn in as majority leader in 2015.

Robert G. Marshall, doomsday might be just around the corner.

That's why the Prince William County Republican wants to prepare Virginia for the impact of a major financial meltdown, caused by hyperinflation, cyberattacks on banks and the Federal Reserve's increasing control over the nation's money supply.

What if your credit or debit cards won't work tomorrow and you have no access to your money? How do you continue to conduct commerce in these emergency situations?

To protect Virginians and their assets, Marshall has drafted legislation with the goal to give Virginia its own currency.

House Joint Resolution 590, which passed by a two-thirds vote in the House of Delegates last week, would establish a 10-member joint subcommittee consisting of eight legislators and two non-legislative Virginia residents who would study the feasibility ""of a metallic-based monetary unit.""

Marshall said the new currency would not replace but compete with the U.S. dollar.

""It would be an additional vehicle of trade and commerce,"" he said.

The study's projected $17,440 cost would justify the means, he added.

""That's very cheap, just about what one delegate makes a year,"" he said.

His concern that the dollar might not always be available prompted him to introduce this measure, Marshall said.

""There are sniper attacks going on right now from foreign powers on our financial institutions,"" he said. ""If they succeed, you're not going to be able to buy gas with a credit card. If you are on Medicaid, you won't get a debit card to buy food at the grocery store. A whole bunch of transactions are going to cease.""

A simple way around this, Marshall said, would be to require at least the 81 state-chartered banks to issue checks to all account holders ""so they can carry on commerce, so they can buy food, gasoline, pay their rent and electricity.""

Marshall's idea isn't new. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, a passionate advocate for the abolishment of the Federal Reserve -- who has run for president as a Libertarian and as a Republican -- previously introduced his ""Free Competition in Currency Act"" in Congress.

The measure, which would have allowed states to introduce their own currencies, was never signed into law but was reintroduced last month by Georgia Rep. Paul C. Broun, a Republican.

The proposals have gained support, especially among some Republicans and tea party groups nationwide, who worry about the Fed's continuing infusions of cash into the economy and who are pushing for a return to the ""gold standard"" that would require the U.S. dollar to be backed by gold reserves.

The guarantee of the convertibility of dollars into gold on demand was first established in 1944 at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce under the Bretton Woods Agreement. But in 1971, the measure was abandoned under Republican President Richard Nixon.

Since President Barack Obama's first election in 2008, several states have pursued legislative efforts for currency creation. These efforts face legal challenges, because while individual localities are permitted to issue their own currency -- as long as it is distinguishable from U.S. dollars -- the Constitution bans states from printing their own paper money or issuing their own paper currency.

But Article 1, Section 10 also leaves states the option to mint coins to be used for debt service -- a loophole that some use as a step toward currency creation.

At least 13 other states -- Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Washington -- have explored the option of issuing their own currency.

To date, only Utah has passed such legislation, recognizing gold and silver coins issued by the U.S. Mint, like Silver Eagles and American Gold, as a legal form of payment.

Marshall introduced legislation in 2011 that authorized the governor to direct the state treasurer to mint ""gold, platinum and silver coins for commemorative use that bear the seals of the commonwealth."" The bill passed in both houses and was signed into law.

Two years ago, Marshall complained that his bill had been mischaracterized as an attempt to mint a separate currency for Virginia -- bringing criticism that he offered an alternative to the Federal Reserve. ""Some hysterical comments,"" he said.

That was then. But now, Marshall is serious about taking that next step.

""Virginia has to do this, we need to be prepared,"" he said. ""We have to anticipate this so we don't descend into social chaos. When you got massive inflation, you are setting up the stage for dictatorships. We don't need that in this country.""

But experts say Marshall's fears are not grounded in reality.

""There is no chance whatsoever that hyperinflation will happen in the United States,"" said Michael Smitka, professor of economics at Washington and Lee University. ""Only countries that are on the brink of a complete political breakdown ever face this.""

Smitka said Japan, a country with an economic system most similar to that of the U.S., has never experienced hyperinflation after its 1991 economic meltdown.

""After all this time, what they have is outright deflation, not inflation, much less hyperinflation,"" he said. But slight, one-digit inflation, as the U.S. experiences, is manageable, he said.

Cyberattacks are even less likely to cause serious damage, Smitka said.

""Banks are very careful with their Internet systems. Anyone suggesting that a cyberattack can bring down an entire centralized system has no understanding of how it works,"" he said.

A system that can be trusted is already in place, Smitka said.

""Who are they going to put in to run the Virginia monetary system? I'd fear the competence of a state-level monetary board and state-level financial regulation more than the federal level,"" he said.

The Fed is prepared for national emergencies, Smitka said.

""The Federal Reserve in Richmond has multiple billions in cash reserves that can be infused into the Virginia economy if needed,"" he said.

Democrats also slammed Marshall's proposal.

""House GOP put on tin foil hats in late-night session,"" was the headline of a statement released by the Virginia House Democratic Caucus last week. Caucus chairman Mark D. Sickles, D-Fairfax, called the debate over this legislation ""political theatrics.""

Marshall stands by his measure, which the state Senate has referred to the Rules Committee.

""It's a serious effort dealing with a serious problem,"" he said.

But Marshall -- who suggested in 2011 to name a Virginia currency ""Ginny"" -- said he has not given any thought to whose head he would want to grace the commonwealth's coin.

""We are not at that point yet,"" he said. ""But it won't be mine.""

So far, at least 29 Republicans have said they're on board -- exceeding the 217 votes needed to pass a ""clean"" funding bill if all 200 House Democrats joined them and voted in favor. Of course, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put such a bill on the floor in the first place. But if he did, the votes appear to be there for passage, at which point the bill would sail through the Senate and be signed by President Barack Obama, ending the shutdown.

HuffPost has been keeping a running tally of which Republicans have said they're done trying to force through provisions to delay or defund Obamacare in order to keep the government running. That list is below.

But as of Tuesday, Oct. 8, we're adding another category: Republicans in that group who have since changed their minds and say they will no longer support a bill that simply reopens the government without extra provisions. Four Republicans have flip-flopped as of Oct. 8, which means the total number of GOP members who publicly support a clean continuing resolution is back down to 25.

Senior White House officials are discussing a budget strategy that could lead to a government shutdown if Republicans continue to demand deeper spending cuts, lawmakers and Democrats familiar with the administration’s thinking said Thursday.

The posture represents a more confrontational approach than that of this spring, when President Obama decided not to escalate a fight over across-the-board reductions known as sequestration in an earlier budget battle with Republicans.

The change in tone has been evident in repeated and little-noticed veto threats over the past few weeks by Obama, who has rarely issued the warnings with such frequency. He has made it clear that he will not sign into law Republican spending bills that slash domestic programs even more deeply than sequestration.

If Republicans do not relent and the White House sticks to its position, a shutdown would be likely at the end of September, when Congress must authorize a new measure to fund the government.

The discussions at the White House illustrate the extent to which the looming budget battle is worrying the administration, which is seeking to advance Obama’s second-term agenda in the face of GOP opposition.

White House officials also are discussing a potential strategy to try to stop the sequestration cuts from continuing, the lawmakers and Democrats said. Under this scenario, the president might refuse to sign a new funding measure that did not roll back the sequester. No decision has been made.

But some of Obama’s top economic advisers fear that they may not be able to stop what they consider damaging cuts without a sharper confrontation, the sources said. Other advisers are urging a more cautious course, saying it would be better for Obama to seek a more targeted agreement that would increase funding for a smaller set of priorities.

Obama would still prefer to replace all the domestic and defense cuts with a long-term budget deal and avoid talk of a shutdown, according to the people familiar with the discussions. But some White House officials consider the Sept. 30 date the last chance to cancel a portion of the sequestration cuts before the 2014 midterm elections.

White House officials are all but resigned to any potential budget agreement lasting just a year or two — not the long-term fiscal pact they have sought.

Negotiations have not started on Capitol Hill, where the two parties are far apart, and many officials on both sides are skeptical that any agreement will be found before the September deadline. Senate Democrats are advancing spending bills worth $1.058 trillion, while Republicans are assuming a total spending level of $967 billion.

The White House is likely to frame any government shutdown as a consequence of Republicans protecting the wealthy at the expense of the nation’s economy and poor.

But Republicans are portraying Obama’s increasingly confrontational tone — which has been on display this week as he began a series of economic speeches — as a way to pull more taxes from the rich to fuel additional government spending.

Republicans have seized on Obama’s veto threats and speeches as a setup for a shutdown. “The president wants to raise taxes so he can do more stimulus spending,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) said this week. “And the fact is, it’s his sequester, and if we’re going to get rid of his sequester, we’re going to have to look for smarter spending cuts in order to do that.”

Congressional Democrats say they and the White House are preparing for a bigger clash in September.

“I think they’re in a position, and I’m urging my House members to be in a position, of a much stronger, less flexible agreement with policies that we believe undermine the operations of our government, our national security and our creditworthiness,” said House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (Md.).

Several Democrats suggested that they might accept an interim spending measure to keep the government open into November, delaying the fight until just around the time of another looming deadline: raising the statutory limit on federal borrowing. The exact deadline has not been determined by the Treasury Department, but the Congressional Budget Office recently estimated it would come in October or November.

Republicans are insisting they will demand additional spending cuts in exchange for agreeing to raise the debt limit, while Obama and Democrats say the nation’s creditworthiness cannot be subject to negotiation.

The president maintained the same position on that issue at the beginning of the year, and Republicans ultimately folded by agreeing to suspend the debt limit for several months. It is not clear whether they will acquiesce again.

The choice about how hard to fight Republicans over sequestration in September tugs at two competing impulses for the president. One is to avoid brinkmanship that could endanger the economy or unravel government operations. The other is to try to force an end to spending cuts that represent the opposite of his core second-term vision.

Deciding to escalate the confrontation with Congress over the budget would be a break from the president’s approach earlier this year. In March, he signed a budget resolution that continued to fund the government through Sept. 30 without forcing a fight over the sequestration cuts. Several weeks later, he agreed to move around money to cancel furloughs at the Federal Aviation Administration to eliminate flight delays, angering congressional Democrats who wanted broader negotiations.

Administration officials said that they had no choice because Senate leaders said that Congress probably would override any veto.

Congressional Democrats, led by Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough after the FAA episode that the administration had to send a much clearer signal about its intentions.

In recent weeks, Obama has been issuing a fusillade of veto threats and signaling that he will not sign bills that do not support his priorities.

In a Thursday letter to Van Hollen, ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, the Congressional Budget Office said canceling sequestration cuts in 2014 would create 900,000 jobs.

“There’s a real cost to keeping the sequester in place,” Van Hollen said in an interview, but he added that the options Democrats will consider in September will depend on public response.

“There is evidence that the pressure from the sequester is continuing to build,” he said. “I think the viable options will depend in part on what the public mood is at the time.”

There is little time for Congress to work out its differences. Lawmakers will leave for August recess next week and will not return until Sept. 9. Obama will spend a week in August on Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., and will be at a summit in Russia in early September.

That leaves only two weeks for both sides to reach a budget agreement upon their return. Some lawmakers are considering a short-term extension of budget funding to gain additional flexibility."

USA TODAY

The partial government shutdown enters Day 10 frozen in the same place. All eyes will be on Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on the consequences if the debt ceiling is not raised by Oct. 17. What you need to know about the shutdown on Thursday, Oct. 10:

Obama convenes talks with Congress

President Obama is reaching out to lawmakers in a bid to move forward on ending the government shutdown. He'll sit down Thursday for separate talks with House Republicans and Senate Democrats, after meeting with House Democrats on Wednesday. Both chambers are in session Saturday, a sign that the deadlock is expected to continue. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has scheduled a key procedural vote Saturday on legislation to suspend the debt ceiling through 2014. But he'll need the votes of six Republicans to cross that hurdle, assuming all 52 Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them stick together.

Military death benefits restored after widespread outrage

The Pentagon reached an agreement with the non-profit Fisher House Foundation to restore $100,000 death benefits to military families that are stalled in the shutdown. The outcry was loud and fierce when news broke that payments to the families of fallen servicemembers were on hold. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to meet with families as the remains of their loved ones, killed Sunday in a roadside blast in Afghanistan, returned to the United States. Hagel said the foundation will be reimbursed when the shutdown ends.

Number of furloughed workers shrinks as shutdown drags on

The government shutdown is shrinking, even if the political divide is growing. When the shutdown began Oct. 1, an estimated 800,000 federal workers were deemed ""non-essential"" and furloughed. The Pentagon earlier this week recalled almost all of its 350,000 civilian workers. Thousands of other workers in the Social Security Administration are also back at work, and other federal agencies have temporarily recalled employees. There is still no guarantee that federal workers will receive back pay because a bill to do that has so far only passed the House.

One man steps in to clean up at memorials

Chris Cox is a cut above the bickering in Washington. Fed up with the government shutdown, Cox took a lawnmower to the National Mall this week and began cutting grass in areas between the Lincoln and World War II memorials. The South Carolina native, who now lives in the Virginia suburbs of the nation's capital, calls his one-citizen effort the Memorial Militia. ""These are our memorials. Do they think that we're just going to let them go to hell?"" Cox said in an interview with WNEW, an all-news radio station.

Shutdown closes tap on new beers

The prolonged closure of federal offices has given some people a reason to cry in the beer. An obscure arm of the Treasury Department has stopped approving new brews. All beers that get bottled or canned that are sold across state lines must get approval by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, better known as the TTB. The agency signs off on the label, as well as the recipe if it uses non-traditional ingredients. Brewery taxes, however, are being collected during the shutdown.

Soneji']",Social Security: It’s Worse Than You Think - The New York Times,"We have made our methods, calculations and software available online at j.mp/SSecurity so that others can replicate or improve our forecasts. The implications of our findings go beyond social science. As the wave of retirement by the baby boomers continues, doing nothing to shore up Social Security’s solvency is irresponsible. If the amount of money coming in through payroll taxes does not increase and if the amount of money going out as benefits remains the same, the trust funds will become insolvent less than 20 years from now.

To save Social Security, which has lifted generations of elderly people out of poverty, tough choices have to be made. One option is to continue raising the retirement age, perhaps to as high as 69 or 70. While the full retirement age is gradually increasing to 67 (for people born in 1960 or later) from 65, this increase is not enough to counterbalance the gains in longevity.

A second option is to increase payroll taxes, for example by taxing wages over $113,700, the current earnings limit. A third is to limit the annual cost-of-living adjustments, possibly by changing how those adjustments are calculated. A fourth is to reduce benefits — for example, by lowering the initial benefits for workers whose lifetime wages are above the national average (currently $43,000 a year). Other choices, in numerous combinations, are possible, too.

One factor that might be considered is new research suggesting that retirement itself, although popular, may reduce life expectancy by breaking lifelong routines and disrupting deep social connections. One might question how much government policy should actively encourage retirement, as opposed to merely making it an option.

Americans need to discuss these difficult choices — and the Social Security Administration needs the ability to improve its forecasting technology by adding statisticians and social science methodologists to help its actuaries institute more formalized quantitative and statistical procedures.

In 1983, after the last time the trust funds ran a deficit, the National Commission on Social Security Reform, led by Alan Greenspan and with members appointed by President Ronald Reagan and Congressional leaders, produced a report that led to changes in payroll taxes. But in the quarter-century since, there have been only modest changes in the program.

We know much more now about mortality and demography, and so an open debate today about Social Security’s future could be even more productive than it was then. The high levels of partisan strife may not make the present seem like the best time to reach a bipartisan agreement. But few issues are more important to more Americans, of both parties, and the longer we ignore the problem, the more disruptive any change will need to be to keep Social Security alive."

A group of unions and anti-poverty organizations accuses real estate giant Brookfield Office Properties Inc. of trying to skate on potentially millions of dollars in new property taxes on downtown Los Angeles skyscrapers the company is buying by taking less than a 50% stake in a new entity that will take title to the properties and others now held by Brookfield.

Brookfield agreed in April to pay about $430 million for four prominent buildings, including Gas Co. Tower and Wells Fargo Tower on Bunker Hill. Selling the towers is Los Angeles landlord MPG Office Trust Inc., which is winding down its business after taking steep losses during the economic downturn.

The transaction, which is expected to close in the next few weeks, would make Brookfield the dominant operator of prime space in the city’s financial district and give it a major role in setting office rents downtown.

A group called ReFund LA Coalition says Brookfield has structured the deal in a way that will enable the company to avoid having the properties reassessed at fair market value as required by Proposition 13 when a change of ownership occurs.

If the properties are not reassessed, they will be taxed according to their older — and presumably lower — assessed value.

“We believe that wealthy corporations shouldn’t be allowed to engage in schemes that result in less funding for vital public services,” said group spokesman Ian Thompson of the Service Employees International Union. “If Brookfield makes this deal, it will literally be stealing services away from the most vulnerable people our members serve.”

The union is one of several members of the ReFund LA Coalition. Other members include the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, the California Federation of Teachers and People Organized for Westside Renewal.

A representative of Brookfield declined to comment, saying the company does not publicly discuss pending transactions.

ReFund LA’s objections to the Brookfield office purchase are intended to prompt changes in California tax laws, said Keenan Sheedy, who works at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center and is a member of SEIU.

“We want the county supervisors to support legislation in Sacramento,” Sheedy said. “We want them to go on record supporting a change in state law that would close the loophole.”

Funding shortages at the tax-supported hospital are hurting patients, he said.

“I see every day the impact,” he said. “Long waits in emergency room, long waits to get appointments.”

The structure of Brookfield’s deal did not come as a surprise to real estate financial analysts.

“Brookfield’s duty is to its shareholders, including people with mutual funds in the stock market,” said analyst Craig Silvers, president of Bricks & Mortar Capital. “Their shareholders could be SEIU members.”

The Proposition 13 law allows businesses to avoid reassessment if no one acquires a majority stake in a firm that owns the property.

Under terms of the Brookfield deal, the buyer of record will be a new fund called DTLA Holdings. Brookfield will own about 47% of DTLA Holdings, with institutional financial partners holding the rest.

DTLA Holdings will own the former MPG properties and Brookfield’s current assets downtown that include other office buildings and a shopping mall in the financial district. The activist group says Brookfield would underpay taxes by about $10 million a year based on the total value of the transaction, which the group estimated at $2.1 billion.

“Brookfield is a savvy real estate player. Do they know the ins and outs of Proposition 13, including the 50% threshold? Assuredly,” said analyst Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.

“However, raising and deploying other investors’ capital into real estate investments is a prominent part of their business model,” Knott said. “So the way they structured the MPG deal is consistent with that, including places outside California where there isn’t this thing called Proposition 13.”

Proposition 13’s arcane rules on reassessment have stoked other controversies. In 2006, computer magnate Michael Dell agreed to pay $200 million for the Fairmont Hotel in Santa Monica and then tore up the contract a few month later.

He brought in his wife and two of his investment advisors as partners — with no one taking more than 49% control of the hotel company. By restructuring the deal to avoid taking full ownership he escaped paying more than $1 million in taxes.

Los Angeles County assessors called Dell’s move a tax dodge, but a Superior Court judge disagreed, finding in December that the deal met the letter of the law.

Last month, Refund LA accused mall giant Westfield Group of underpaying taxes by taking advantage of Proposition 13 provisions. Westfield said it pays its taxes in accordance with the law.

Good morning!” black conservative activist and media personality Wayne Dupree, known online as “News Ninja 2012,” said as he fired up the crowd at Freedom Plaza in downtown Washington, D.C. “I still can’t hear you! Good morning, America!”

Dupree walked through how he served in the U.S. military and how he “can say, proudly say, that I have great personal interest in what goes on in my country.”

“We fight for this country because we believe in its greatness,” Dupree said. “We believe in this Democracy. And we believe in freedom for all citizens. And we will continue to fight and defend and preserve those freedoms for our citizens.”

Dupree went on to argue that “the real reason why we’re here today, July 15, here on Freedom Plaza, is because we hear the battle cries, and Washington calling for us Americans to stand up and fight.”

Dupree then railed on the “Gang of Eight” Senate immigration bill. “This legislation is nothing but a wish list written by corporate lobbyists and checked off by career politicians in order to exploit cheap labor and fill campaign coffers for the next election,” he said. “This legislation robs us of the American dream and it undermines our Democratic process. We the People have been called upon to protect our freedom, and we do this with a smile on our faces and patriotism in our hearts.”

“This is not racist,” Dupree added later in the speech. “Let me say that again: This is not racist! This is an American thing. It’s not because we’re ‘hate-mongers who discriminate against those that want a better life.’ We cannot allow people who defy our laws, threaten our national security, and threaten our economy to redefine what America stands for. No way. Not without a fight.”

Here’s video of Dupree’s whole speech.

President Obama wants the debt limit raised without conditions

The government will reach its borrowing authority between mid-February and early March

House Speaker John Boehner and the GOP are insisting on spending cuts in a budget plan

House Republicans said Friday they intend to extend the nation's borrowing authority for three months, but will not agree to a long-term increase on the debt limit until both chambers of Congress approve a budget.

President Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, said the White House is ""encouraged"" and repeated a call for an increase in the nation's borrowing authority without any restrictions.

A three-month extension would ensure the federal government does not default on its obligations. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congress the nation will reach its debt limit sometime between mid-February and early March.

A vote on the temporary debt limit extension will take place next week, the Associated Press reports.

At a House GOP closed-door retreat in Williamsburg, Va., Speaker John Boehner told lawmakers that they will insist members of Congress don't get paid until a budget is passed. Republicans are angry that the Democratic-controlled Senate has not passed a budget plan in four years.

""Before there is any long-term debt limit increase, a budget should be passed that cuts spending,"" Boehner said, according to excerpts of his remarks released by his office. ""We are going to pursue strategies that will obligate the Senate to finally join the House in confronting the government's spending problem. The principle is simple: no budget, no pay.""

House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California, the GOP's No. 3 leader, said the three-month extension will ""meet our immediate obligations and ensure a responsible budget passes both chambers of Congress.""

Obama has asked Congress to increase the debt limit without any conditions, as a way to calm financial markets. The fights over raising the debt limit and automatic spending cuts that take effect March 1 will be among the toughest facing Obama as he begins a second term.

""The president has made clear that Congress has only two options: pay the bills they have racked up, or fail to do so and put our nation into default,"" Carney said in a statement. ""We are encouraged that there are signs that congressional Republicans may back off their insistence on holding our economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare, education and programs middle-class families depend on.

""Congress must pay its bills and pass a clean debt limit increase without further delay,"" Carney said.

A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., also welcomed the overture on the debt limit.

""It is reassuring to see Republicans beginning to back off their threat to hold our economy hostage,"" said Adam Jentleson, Reid's spokesman. ""If the House can pass a clean debt ceiling increase to avoid default and allow the United States to meet its existing obligations, we will be happy to consider it.""

The House GOP retreat in Williamsburg concluded Friday."

Collectively, the 13 plants employ about 2,000 people and contribute more than a billion dollars to the Illinois economy in the form of their payrolls as well as the taxes they pay and the purchases they make from suppliers. The impact on local economies where the plants are located could be significant because they often are major employers.

Billy McDaniel, mayor of the city of Metropolis — which facetiously bills itself as the home of Superman — said closing the nearby Joppa plant would be devastating for the southern Illinois city of 6,500. The plant employs 125 people, according to a company filing.

It's much the same story over in Peoria County, where workers are waiting to learn the fate of the Edwards coal plant.

""Virtually every coal plant in Illinois right now is owned by companies that are either in bankruptcy, have recently emerged from bankruptcy or whose bond ratings are approaching junk,"" said Howard Learner, executive director of the Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center.

Owners of the plants have been squeezed by regulations forcing expensive pollution control upgrades at the same time cheaper sources of fuel have rendered the plants unprofitable. In the next two years, legal decisions affecting roughly two-thirds of the state's coal-fired power plants are expected to determine whether those plants have any future.

Ameren Corp. has already determined it no longer wants its five operating coal plants in the state, and it is attempting to hand them over at no cost to Houston-based Dynegy Inc. But there's a catch: The deal hinges on regulators' extending a deadline for cleaning up the plants' air pollution, and the total cost is estimated at about $1.25 billion. Missouri-based Ameren says that if regulators can't guarantee Dynegy the extension, the deal could unravel, which would mean shutting down plants.

Meanwhile, Edison Mission Energy, the parent company of Midwest Generation, the owner of four Illinois coal plants, has been floundering in bankruptcy court, and some analysts expect its unprofitable plants to be shuttered.

Midwest Generation's plants face significant obstacles to complying with heightening environmental regulations, said Julien Dumoulin-Smith, director of equity research for electric utilities at UBS Securities. ""These coal plants are very likely retirement candidates,"" he said.

Dumoulin-Smith also said he doubts that Midwest Generation could sell them. ""I don't see any real appetite for an acquisition. If there was not cash paid for the Ameren assets and the Ameren assets were materially better than the (Midwest Generation) assets, what are the (Midwest Generation) assets worth?""

Doug McFarlan, a spokesman for Midwest Generation, said employees at the company's four remaining plants have shown tremendous fortitude in light of the uncertainty that hangs over their future, setting records for safety and performance in the first half of the year.

The company filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in December 2012 and has ""no firm timetable"" to emerge or any idea what the company will look like or who might own it. Edison International used to be its parent company but severed ties as well as financial support.

""No decisions have been made about retiring additional plants because we're focused on operating them,"" McFarlan said.

On a recent investor call, Robert Flexon, Dynegy president and chief executive, was coy about whether his company would be interested in snatching up the Midwest Generation plants, saying, ""We have our hands full"" with the Ameren transaction.

Dynegy's strategy is to expand its coal-fired generating base to take advantage of economies of scale, said Flexon, and he confirmed his company wants the Ameren plants as badly as Ameren wants to get rid of them.

""It's time to get big or get out,"" said Dumoulin-Smith. ""That is really what's going on here.''

Dynegy is expecting to save $75 million annually by scaling up, savings the company says it desperately needs to stay afloat for the next couple of years. Much of the savings would come from increased purchasing clout.

""In the coal generation business, short term, it's a matter of survival,"" Flexon said in an interview Thursday. ""The market now is as tough as any market has ever been.""

For now, the company is making money from its small cadre of natural gas-fired plants while trying to stem losses from its coal plants for the next three years. If it can make it through until 2016, Dynegy is betting it will be one of the few big coal operators left as tightened federal laws governing mercury and air toxics take effect and coal plant operators shut down rather than invest in pricey pollution controls.

In December, Dynegy completed $1 billion in environmental upgrades at its Baldwin plant and three sister plants in Wood River, Havana and Hennepin.

The company is also betting that the U.S. will begin exporting significant amounts of natural gas, tightening domestic supply and increasing pricing. For Dynegy, a dollar increase in natural gas prices would double its earnings, said Flexon.

In March, Dynegy announced it would become Illinois' largest owner of coal-fired power plants when it said it would acquire Ameren's five Illinois coal plants.

With the Ameren transaction, Dynegy would be the third-largest independent power producer in the U.S., according to Dynegy. It would also give the company a route to sell a portion of its power into a more lucrative power market than it operates in today.

Ameren's plan was to hand over the plants to Dynegy by the end of the year, along with a newly minted five-year extension granted to Ameren to complete those upgrades.

In earning the waiver from the Illinois Pollution Control Board late last year, Ameren argued that it couldn't complete the upgrades because of financial hardship.

Three months after being granted the extension, Ameren announced it would walk away from the plants altogether; shortly thereafter it announced the deal with Dynegy.

Dynegy had been a vocal opponent of such extensions.

Last year it objected to Midwest Generation's request for more time to install pollution controls at its four coal plants, saying such extensions create ""an unlevel playing field between power generators in Illinois, such as Dynegy, that committed to and made the significant financial investment on or ahead of schedule needed to comply with Illinois environmental regulations."""

Editor’s Note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of “Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pot in America.” She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000.

(CNN) —

After the vote in the House of Representatives to slash the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, I wrote a column against cutting food stamps. This column generated more than 5,200 online comments and hundreds of e-mails.

Comments reflected, not surprisingly, the tone and tenor of the political debate: a lot of partisan passion, some mutual understanding, animosity based on stereotypes and a lot of misinformation.

I would like to address some of the typical concerns that were expressed.

For example, “Willis CurryFans” wrote, “These wealthy Republicans spend a lot of time RUNNING from the typical black person this affects. If they came and visited some of these neighborhoods, they would see folks that they KNOW they won’t give a job to.”

JUSTIN LAROSE/cnn Donna Brazile

But who are the people using food stamps? They’re us.

The Census Bureau, which gathers statistics house by house, reports that Americans on food stamps are 49% white, 26% African-American and 20% Hispanic. The Pew Research Center, a nonprofit polling firm, found in a July survey that self-identified liberals, moderates and conservatives who receive food stamps are in a statistical tie.

A lot of people who commented on the column wanted to regulate what foodstuffs program participants can buy – often not realizing that alcohol and prepared foods are banned. And many respondents bashed food stamp recipients, declaring they should “get a job,” “stop having kids on my dime” or giving a variation on such cliches.

“Chiefpr” writes to one reader who’s been out of work: “Get training to better yourself and DO NOT have kids until you can feed them. But do not demand I do all that and support you …”

But the truth refutes the cliches: Feeding America says participation in SNAP, or the food stamp program, “historically follows unemployment with a slight lag.”

Unemployment increases food stamp rolls, not people with children who go looking for aid.

And unemployment has been abnormally high because of the recession that began under the previous president. In fact, USA Today found that “under President George W. Bush, the number of recipients rose by nearly 14.7 million. Nothing before comes close to that.”

With employment increasing, “the Congressional Budget Offices projects SNAP participation to begin declining in 2015.”

Shaun Kirkpatrick commented: “There was a work requirement for welfare. Bill Clinton did that during his welfare reform that most working people applauded. To make sure he got the votes and make Republicans look greedy and evil, Obama removed the work requirement …” Kirkpatrick’s perception is prevalent on the Web.

But that information comes from a 2012 Mitt Romney political ad that got it dead wrong. Obama actually encouraged the states to strengthen their work requirements. Also, of course, welfare is not the same as food stamps.

As for food stamps, more than 72% of all SNAP beneficiaries are families with children. Most of the recipients are children (48%), the elderly (8%) and the disabled. Less than 10% of food stamp recipients receive welfare payments.

“John in WNY” wrote, “Yes, many do work, but many of them make sure they never make enough to lose their benefits …”

Again, the facts refute the assumption.

SNAP has strict time limits for unemployed workers: Able-bodied adults without children can only get three months worth of food stamps in a three-year period, unless working in a qualifying job training program.

And how much are the benefits, anyway?

The average monthly SNAP benefit per person is $133.85, or less than $1.50 per person per meal. Those benefits are low, and for many families, SNAP benefits don’t last the whole month.

Why do we need to support the food stamp program?

Because low-income families experience unemployment at a far higher rate than other income groups. Because cutting nutritional assistance programs is immoral and shortsighted and protecting families from hunger improves their health and educational outcomes. Food stamps are an investment in our future.

Being on food stamps can be demeaning.

Cashiers know the difference between the new plastic SNAP cards and a credit card. Some food stamp recipients say some cashiers have made them feel uncomfortable and embarrassed.

Maybe we should focus on rewards rather than punishments. Behavioral psychologists say that’s more effective.

Why not add benefits for making healthy food choices, provide a transition bonus for getting off food stamps or increase job training opportunities and income – raising minimum wage?

Doing so takes courage, compassion and believing in “We, the people.”

The failed measures leave lawmakers snarled in a familiar debate that has divided the parties but has not attracted the attention it did a year ago when it became part of the presidential campaign.

The House voted last month on a proposal that would tie interest rates for Stafford loans to the Treasury’s 10-year borrowing rates, which Republican sponsors said was in line with principles outlined by the Obama administration. Based on current forecasts, the interest rate for subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans would be 5% next year. The proposal would cap such loans at 8.5%.

The White House, however, offered a plan that differs slightly by locking in that variable rate for the duration of the loan rather than allowing it to reset each year. The plan would not place a ceiling on rates but would continue to allow college graduates to repay loans as a percentage of their overall incomes. For a subsidized Stafford loan, the rate in 2014 would be 3.4%.

President Obama, in a Rose Garden event last week, said the plan passed by House Republicans would also eliminate safeguards for low-income families.

The two Senate proposals took different approaches. The Democratic version would have extended the current rates for two years.

The Republican one would have tied the interest rates of all newly issued federal student loans, not simply Stafford loans, to Treasury rates. It would also, like the president’s plan, lock in that interest rate for the life of the loan. Under that plan, interest rates for all loans would be 5.5% next year.

The Democratic plan received 51 votes, nine short of the threshold needed; the Republican plan received 40 votes.

In 2012, as student borrowers faced the same increase in rates, Obama campaigned on the issue, urging Congress to extend lower rates as he appeared in college towns in key states. Congress ultimately voted to pass the one-year extension. Now, without new action by July 1, interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans will double from 3.4% to 6.8%.

Thursday’s votes were seen as political moves, with neither expected to pass.

“This is like the opening act at the circus,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a co-sponsor of the GOP bill. “Hopefully, the main event will attract some senators who are willing to conduct this in a grown-up way.”

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called the result “another example of how out of step Republicans in Congress are with the struggles of all of our American families today.”

The House and Senate have three weeks to agree on a compromise before they adjourn for recess.

The White House, which supported the Senate Democratic plan, said in a statement that it was willing to work with lawmakers on a long-term solution.

USA TODAY

Nation will hit debt limit in October%2C Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew says

Letter is first time a specific date has been given

Congress would need to authorize higher limit

WASHINGTON — The United States will run out of borrowed money ""no later than Oct. 17"" unless Congress raises the $16.7 trillion debt limit, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a letter to Congress Wednesday.

Lew's letter marks the first time he has given a date certain for when the government would hit the debt ceiling and comes as Congress is at another impasse on how to keep the government running and pay its past bills.

It's not a coincidence that Oct. 17 is a Thursday, said Steve Bell, economic policy director for the Bipartisan Policy Center.

That's because the Treasury typically rolls over $100 billion in debt every Thursday, as old bonds mature and most investors simply use the proceeds to buy new bonds. Some bond holders may park their money elsewhere. Others may demand higher yields. ""But at what price? That;s the big imponderable,"" Bell said.

""I think people don't understand what this does to the market psychology. It's not within Congress's full control,"" said Bell, a former managing director of Salomon Brothers. He said bond rates are creeping up on the uncertainty.

Lew expressed the same worry in a speech to the Economic Club of Washington last week, saying a massive sell-off of bonds could create an immediate crisis. ""The point is, trying to time a debt limit increase to the last minute could be very dangerous,"" he said.

The nation has been at the debt limit since May 17. Since then, the Treasury Department has undertaken what it calls ""extraordinary measures,"" which include delaying pension fund payments and drawing down an emergency fund.

Once those measures are exhausted, the government would have only enough money to pay its bills as it has revenue on any given day. As of Oct. 17, the Treasury expects its cash-on-hand will be reduced to $30 billion. The government typically spends $60 billion every day.

It's unclear exactly how Treasury would juggle those payments. During the last debt-limit crisis in 2011, the Treasury Department ruled out many stopgap measures to maintain spending and pay its debts, such as selling off assets. The United States has more than $350 billion in gold reserves on its balance sheet, for example, but Treasury officials said a ""fire sale"" on gold would hurt the dollar and the economy, according to a 2012 report from the Treasury Office of the Inspector General. The Treasury has no practical way of reducing payments by an across-the-board percentage to stay under the debt limit.

""If we have insufficient cash on hand, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations for the first time in our history,"" Lew said.

Even dancing so close to a debt-limit deadline can be costly. In 2011, the debt-limit showdown cost the government $1.3 billion in increased borrowing costs, according to a review last year by the Government Accountability Office. That study looked at the yield spread between government and corporate bonds to determine how the markets were reacting to the uncertainty caused by the debt-limit debate.

Lew's warning comes as Congress debates another measure that would authorize spending for the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. A resolution passed by the Republican House would keep government spending roughly at current levels and extend the debt ceiling — but only for paying the principal and interest on the debt.

The Obama administration opposes the pay-the-debt-first plan, which Lew called ""default by another name.""

""The debt ceiling must be raised,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. ""This cannot and should not be a matter of negotiation.""

(CNN) —

The Detroit bankruptcy case is acting as a Rorschach test for so many challenges that bedevil older industrial cities in the United States and beyond. A common one: How do older cities rocked by deindustrialization and the loss of population and jobs redefine their economic function and find a new reason to live in a shifting global economy?

The experiences of Pittsburgh and Northeast Ohio offer cause for hope and a roadmap for reinvention and renewal.

With the collapse of the steel industry in the early 1980s, the Pittsburgh metro area endured the loss of nearly 100,000 jobs in just three years; the city’s population declined by almost 12.7% during the full decade. Fast forward 30 years, and it is clear that the city and broader metropolis have regained their footing through a series of strategic and sustained interventions.

Smart public, private and civic leadership has helped diversify the economy toward health care and technology, building off a solid base of advanced research institutions and medical campuses (“eds and meds”), such as Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Smart urban regeneration tactics have successfully repurposed waterfront locations, historic buildings and even brown-field sites into new walkable places valued by innovative firms and talented workers.

An impressive 25% of the jobs in the Pittsburgh metro area are within three miles of the central business district, compared with just 7% in Detroit. With such employment density, reasonable housing costs and ample cultural amenities, the city now routinely places at or near the top of worldwide livability rankings.

Northeast Ohio – which spans the four metropolitan areas of Cleveland, Akron, Canton and Youngstown – provides a more recent example of renewal. In the early 2000s, the Cleveland Plain Dealer chronicled the “quiet crisis” that was gradually bleeding the region of people, jobs and vitality.

In response, philanthropic institutions pooled their resources and supported a series of institutions and intermediaries, including the Fund for Our Economic Future, BioEnterprise and Nortech, to identify precisely the region’s untapped potential in emerging technology, health care, energy and manufacturing clusters and then help small- and medium-sized firms meet the demand for new products and services.

As in Pittsburgh, these efforts leveraged Northeast Ohio’s stellar network of advanced research institutions and medical campuses, many of which (e.g., the Cleveland Clinic) sit at the cores of the region’s central cities.

The result in less than a decade has been impressive: an additional 10,500 jobs, $333 million in payroll, $1.9 billion in investments, including the first nationally designated additive manufacturing institute in Youngstown.

The examples of Pittsburgh and Northeast Ohio provide a road map for the renewal not only of Detroit but of older industrial cities more generally.

RoboCop creator: Detroit shows the film’s fictional future is upon us

First, form and sustain a network.

Cities and metropolitan areas are powerful because they are networks – of corporate, philanthropic, university, community and government institutions and leaders. Each element of the network is not big enough or rich enough to power economic restructuring. But, taken together, they have the potential to design and deliver transformative initiatives and interventions.

Second, set a distinctive vision for economic growth grounded in your region’s special assets and advantages.

Shakespeare was right; what’s past is prologue. Northeast Ohio, for example, shows how specialties designed for car manufacturing can be repurposed. As Akron’s tire making industry declined, companies working with local universities shifted their focus and research efforts into the related business of polymers. The former Rubber Capital of the World now makes polymers and plastics that can be used in clean energy and biotech.

Third, find the series of game changers that have the potential to create jobs in the near term and alter the trajectory of your economy over the long haul.

In Pittsburgh and Northeast Ohio, the signature game changer has been collaboration–among companies, universities, entrepreneurs and supportive institutions – to help reshape the economy and create a sense of place and to grow quality jobs in quality places.

The revival of Detroit is not a fanciful dream; in fact it has already begun. According to research in progress by the Brookings Institution and The Reinvestment Fund, Detroit’s historic downtown and midtown core is 3 percent of the city’s land mass but home to 37 percent of its jobs, and residential and business growth is underway.

This growth includes new corporate residents like Quicken Loans bringing over 7,000 new jobs downtown since 2007, and older anchor institutions like Wayne State University, Henry Ford Health System and the College for Creative Studies driving over $1.8 billion in investments to midtown over the past decade.

This resurgence of Detroit’s core builds off the physical “bones” (such as historic buildings, revised riverfront) of the city and the enviable assets in the broader metropolis, including a relatively high concentration of workers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, given the region’s concentration in advanced manufacturing.

And the resurgence is stewarded by the leadership of re-energized networks of philanthropies like the New Economy Initiative, as well as the work of capable institutions like the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, Midtown Detroit and Invest Detroit. With such advantages, now is the time to revive the city from the core and set ambitious goals for housing, job and fiscal growth that benefits all residents.

Detroit’s future, in short, is still to be written.

Private, civic, and, yes, public investors like the federal government must double down on this momentum, and invest in that future to make it a bright one.

ABC News White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl questioned Press Secretary Jay Carney on Obama’s sequester predictions:

KARL: Jay, even before we heard from Secretary LaHood, we’ve heard some dire warnings coming from the administration. Just to tick through a few, we’ve heard about more wildfires, more workplace deaths, higher risk of terrorism, criminals set free. Is there any exaggeration going on here?



MR. CARNEY: I think all of those things come from reduced numbers of people fighting fires, reduced numbers of people doing inspections of our food, reduced numbers of people engaging in air traffic control. I mean, those are just the facts, Jon.



KARL: No other way to squeeze 3 percent out of the federal budget?



MR. CARNEY: I think we had this colloquy yesterday. The fact of the matter is that you are talking about a 13 percent cut in our defense budget and 9 percent cut in our nondefense discretionary budget this year. And there is no way to do that, based on the way the law is written, without having hugely negative impacts on individuals and families. Furloughs would have to happen. Layoffs would have to happen. That is a fact. And it’s not just us saying this. You don’t believe us, maybe you believe the CBO. Maybe you believe Macroeconomics Advisers or Moody’s. They have projected fully a half a percentage point reduction in GDP growth. And you know, because you cover this stuff, what that means economically. They have projected three-quarters of a million people will lose their jobs if the sequester takes effect and stays in effect.



Those are real-world consequences. These are real people. It’s not political leverage. It’s a fact. And we’re out there making clear that this is an important issue to deal with because of the real-world implications. The reason why the President continues to put forward and we made clear again on paper what we have been making clear all along, the President’s very reasonable offer remains on the table because he wants to avoid this.



Let’s just, again, go back to my basic point. It is not an easy sell to Democrats to go along as part of a big deal with superlative CPI. It is not an easy argument necessarily to get Democrats to go along with the reforms that the President has put in place in his proposal on entitlement reforms or with the spending cuts. It was not easy to sign into law $1.1 trillion in spending cuts. But he has done it, and Democrats have done it. And what we haven’t seen from Republicans is anything equivalent. And we’re just looking for a negotiating partner here. We’re just looking for somebody to meet us halfway."

At The Washington Post']",House approves resolution to keep government running; bill heads to Obama,"Congress approved a short-term funding bill Thursday that ends the possibility of a federal government shutdown next week. But a broader budget battle about taxes and spending for the year is just beginning.

The stop-gap spending resolution, approved on a broad bipartisan vote in the House, locks in the $85 billion across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year.

But the legislation includes provisions that will blunt the impact of the sequester. Within hours of the bill’s passage, the Defense Department announced that furlough notices scheduled to go out Friday to 800,000 civilian workers will be delayed until April 5.

That will give officials time to see whether the new budget will still require 22 unpaid days or could result in fewer lost days for workers.

Congress’s action also halted furloughs for thousands of meat inspectors by transferring $55 million from other agriculture programs to ensure meat and poultry plants stay open, agriculture officials said.

The meat lobby, as well as Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, pressed the issue with Congress and the Obama administration, saying the furloughs threatened a multibillion-dollar industry and would have forced an increase in retail meat prices.

The House vote, which provides funding for the government for the six months starting March 28, came a day after the Senate approved the bill. It now goes to President Obama for his signature, ending a relatively smooth and drama-free process for a Congress that has repeatedly found itself deadlocked on spending issues.

Still, the measure covers only the next six months.

Lawmakers are debating how much to tax and spend for the years to come. On Thursday, the House also approved a budget blueprint by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in a mostly partisan 221 to 207 vote. Ten Republicans joined House Democrats in opposing the Ryan budget measure.

Ryan’s plan calls for balancing the budget over the decade by slicing $5 trillion from future spending, including by block-granting programs for the poor and overhauling Medicare for people 54 and younger.

Conservatives had insisted that the Ryan plan lock in a balanced budget within the next 10 years. His spending proposals of the past two years took at least 30 years to bring spending into line with government revenue.

Democrats slammed Ryan’s plan as too austere — particularly its proposal to end Medicare as a guaranteed benefit for seniors. They said voters defeated that idea in the presidential election in November.

The Ryan proposal clashes dramatically with a budget proposal offered by Senate Democrats that will face a vote as soon Friday.

The first budget put forward by Senate Democrats in three years, the proposal by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) would raise taxes by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade in an effort to stabilize deficits but would not balance the budget in that time.

Trying to reconcile those two visions will consume Washington in the coming months, as leaders warily look to the next fiscal showdown: the yet-to-be-determined deadline, somewhere in late summer, when the Treasury will be out of options to manage the federal debt and need congressional approval to increase its borrowing authority.

In blunt terms, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) acknowledged Thursday that the path ahead is murky: Republicans are demanding reforms to reduce entitlement spending in exchange for increasing the debt ceiling — a position Democrats object to unless large tax revenue is included beyond the more than $600 billion in tax hikes approved New Year’s Day.

“At this point in time, I don’t know how we go forward,” Boehner told reporters.

As Congress prepared to leave for a two-week holiday recess, the attention was fixed on Congress’s success in solving an immediate problem: ensuring the government remains funded.

“This is a good bill. I’m proud of it. I’m proud of the fact that we’ve been able to do all this frankly as smoothly as it’s gone,” Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) told colleagues on the House floor, noting the continuing resolution would be passed more than a week before required.

The resolution will block the impact of the sequester by adding money to certain programs just before the across-the-board reduction hits.

But all additional money was offset with reductions elsewhere, reflecting the sequester’s cut. The government will be able spend $982 billion for the year.

Defense officials have been saying for weeks that the across-the-board spending cuts would force them to furlough civilian employees for up to 22 days between April and the end of the fiscal year. Unions representing federal defense employees have been negotiating with management over conditions of the furloughs, which would have begun one day a week in late April.

The overall size of the cuts will remain the same, but the Pentagon will add $10.4 billion to its operations and maintenance budget, where shortfalls have led to plans to curtail training, suspend some maintenance work and other steps that commanders feared would take a toll on force readiness. Also, the agency will be able to move forward with new investments and contracts that had been held up.

Defense spokesman George Little called the delay a “responsible step to take in order to assure our civilian employees that we do not take lightly the prospect of furloughs and the resulting decrease in employee pay.”

It was unclear Thursday whether a handful of other agencies that the bill gave some flexibility and that had also said their employees faced furloughs would be able to pare back unpaid days.

But a lobbyist for the meat industry praised the action to spare food inspectors.

“We became one of the big examples that was cited of a major impact of sequestration,” said Janet Riley of the American Meat Institute. “If you’re going to put all of our inspectors out, we won’t operate.”

The measure also eliminated the chance of a pay raise for federal workers this year, denying a 0.5 percent increase that Obama proposed and that otherwise would have taken effect in April. The extension of the pay freeze also applies to members of Congress and high-level political appointees. Federal salary rates have been stagnant since January 2010.

In a fundraising email to supporters, Tea Party Patriots referred to the Ohio Republican as a ""ruling class politician"" who only pretends to be a conservative while remaining a ""tax-and-spend liberal,"" The Hill reported Friday.

The group, which supported efforts to defund the Affordable Care Act, accused Boehner of passing a ""back-room budget deal which increases discretionary spending, does nothing to reform entitlements, and fully funds ObamaCare.""

The organization called the deal ""an out and out betrayal of the American people.""

All three top Republican leaders were among 169 members of the rank and file in voting for the measure, which cleared the House on Tuesday on an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 332-94.

In advance of the vote, Boehner unleashed a stinging attack on conservative groups campaigning for the bill's demise, saying they lacked credibility. He also blamed them for leading the party into the partial government shutdown this fall.

Boehner's remarks appeared aimed more broadly at Tea Partyers who say true conservatives never compromise, and at groups that try to oust established Republicans seeking re-election.

House actions under his speakership, Boehner said, ""have not violated any conservative principle, not once."" He then dismissed the activist groups, saying, ""I don't care what they do.""

Overall, the bipartisan budget plan erases a total of $63 billion in across-the-board cuts in the next two budget years, and specifies $85 billion in savings over a decade, including the one relating to military retirement. The result is a net $23 billion cut in deficits through 2023, although critics argue the spending increases will happen first, and many of the savings years later, if at all.

By raising spending levels, the bill is also designed to eliminate the threat of another budget shutdown like the one this fall.

Groups such as Heritage Action, the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity oppose the deal. The Washington, D.C.-based organizations have also aided insurgent Republican challengers who vow never to compromise with Democrats, even if it means shutting down the government or defaulting on the federal debt.

Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler said his group won't back down. When Boehner writes off the dozens of House members who won't compromise on tax and spending issues, it means ""he's going to rely heavily on Democrats"" to pass legislation, Holler said. That's bad for conservative principles, he said, and bad for GOP cohesion in elections.

Boehner's allies say the alternative is worse. When Boehner tries to placate the staunchest conservatives in his caucus, they say, the results are a government shutdown, a major loss on the ""fiscal cliff"" deal a year ago and other Republican embarrassments.

Steve LaTourette, a Boehner friend and former GOP House member from Ohio, said he is heartened by the stepped-up actions by Boehner, the Chamber and others frustrated by tea party tactics. He warned, however, that mainstream Republicans won't tame the tea party faction without huge amounts of effort and money.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., announced a test vote for Tuesday on the measure, which appears likely to command the 60 votes necessary to clear the Senate, officials in both parties told the Associated Press on Friday.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars joined the ranks of the bill's opponents during the day, citing a provision to reduce cost of living increases for military retirees until they reach age 62. The result could mean ""a cumulative loss in retirement income of $80,000"" for a sergeant first class who retires at age 40, the group said.

""Although Iraq is over and the war in Afghanistan is winding down, we can't allow Congress to dismantle the programs they created over the past 12 years,"" said William A. Thien, the VFW's national commander.

A short while later, Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said they would oppose the measure unless the provision were changed. They said a 42-year-old sergeant first class retiring after 20 years would lose about $72,000 in income.

Fitch Ratings has the U.S. on credit watch

The firm may downgrade the U.S. credit rating from AAA

S%26P downgraded its rating from AAA during the 2011 debt ceiling debate

LONDON (AP) — The United States could lose its top credit rating for the second time from a leading credit agency if there's a delay in raising the country's debt ceiling, Fitch Ratings warned Tuesday.

Congress has to increase the country's debt limit, which effectively rules how much debt the U.S. can have, by March 1 or face a potential default. There are fears that the debate will deteriorate into the squabbling and political brinkmanship that marked the last effort to raise the ceiling in the summer of 2011. The U.S. Treasury Department warned then that it had nearly reached a point where it would be unable ""to meet our commitments securely.""

If Fitch does move to downgrade the US, it will join Standard & Poor's, which was so concerned by the dysfunctional 2011 debate that it stripped the U.S. of its triple A rating for the first time in the country's history. Another major ratings agency, Moody's, also has a negative view on the U.S. outlook.

""The pressure on the U.S. rating, if anything, is increasing,"" David Riley, managing director of Fitch Ratings' global sovereigns division said at a London conference. ""We thought the 2011 crisis was a one-off event …. if we have a repeat we will place the U.S. rating under review.""

If that happens, Riley said there was ""a material risk"" of the rating coming down.

Fitch already has a negative outlook on the U.S. as the country's debt burden has risen to around 100% of its gross domestic product and has said it will make a decision on the rating this year, regardless of how the debt ceiling discussions pan out.

The U.S. government reached its statutory debt limit of nearly $16.4 trillion at the end of 2012 but has engineered extraordinary measures that should see it through February.

Riley's comments come just two weeks after U.S. lawmakers agreed a budget deal with the White House that avoided the so-called ""fiscal cliff"" of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that many economists thought could plunge the U.S. economy, the world's largest, back into recession.

Relief that a deal was cobbled together, albeit at the final hour, is one of the reasons why sentiment in the financial markets has been buoyant in the first trading days of the new year. Many stock indexes around the world are trading at multi-year highs.

""The 'fiscal cliff' bullet was dodged …. (but it's) a short-term patch,"" said Riley.

Riley warned that the different arms of the U.S. government still have a number of issues to address. As well as increasing the debt ceiling, they have to agree to spending cuts that were delayed as part of the 'fiscal cliff' agreement and back measures to avoid a government shutdown, potentially in March.

Though short-term fixes are more likely than not, Riley said the U.S. political environment is not as good as it should be for a country holding the gold-chip AAA rating. The past few years, Riley said, have been marked by ""self-inflicted crises"" between deadlines.

The major reason behind the lack of swift action in the U.S. is that the Democrats control the White House and the Senate, while the Republicans have a solid majority in the House of Representatives. Both sides have differing visions of the role of the state in society and often varying political objectives.

Despite his cautious tone on the rating, Riley said the U.S. has a number of huge advantages and that getting the country's public finances into shape will not require the same level of austerity that many countries in Europe have had to enact over the past few years, partly because the U.S. economy is growing at a steady rate.

Other factors Fitch says support the U.S.'s AAA rating are the country's economic dynamism, lower financial sector risks, the rule of law as well as the global benchmark status of the country's bonds and the dollar.

However it says these ""fundamental credit strengths are being eroded by the large, albeit steadily declining, structural budget deficit and high and rising public debt."""
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/10/the-budget-deal-in-plain-english/,2013-12-10 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",The budget deal in plain English,"7 years ago

Washington (CNN) – Hey! Republicans and Democrats agreed on something! Woo hoo… er, whoa. What is this deal, exactly? The summary is written in Washington-speak. To make it easier, here’s our user-friendly version of highlights and what they mean.

The money: The deal sets the government’s spending level at $1.012 trillion for the current fiscal year and $1.014 trillion for next year. So what? Keep reading.



Budget cuts: Here’s the first reason the deal matters. Those spending levels would eliminate $45 billion in forced budget cuts (yes, “sequester”) set to hit in January and another $18 billion set to hit in 2015. It would not eliminate all of the cuts, but would erase a large chunk of them.

Wait, so does it raise spending?: Hang with us here. Simple question, not-so-simple answer. The deal would raise one kind of spending – discretionary spending – for the next two years. That’s the type of spending Congress votes on each year. It funds many government agencies. But the deal more than offsets that two-year spending increase with long-term cuts to a different type of spending – mandatory spending, or spending that happens automatically under the law. So over 10 years, the deal saves money, its writers say.

Airline fees: If you plan to take a trip , buy your tickets now and save a few bucks. The Ryan-Murray agreement would raise the TSA security charge to $5.60 for any one-way trip. So $11.20 round trip. Currently, the so-called ""9-11 fee"" is $2.50 for a nonstop flight and $5 for travel that involves connecting flights. The deal would charge the same $5.60 regardless of whether the flight plan was nonstop or not.

Federal workers: This was one of the most difficult pieces of the deal to work out. In the end, the deal requires that newly hired federal workers pay more into their pension fund. The change means that new federal workers would see a 1.3% pay cut.

The troops: Military retirees under the age of 62 will face slimmer cost-of-living increases in their retirement pay. This is phased in over three years, but ultimately cost-of-living adjustments, or COLA, will be cut by 1%.

Contractor pay: Bad news for contractors who charge the government $488,000 or more for their salaries. The deal caps what the government will pay for a contractor’s salary at $487,000.

More budget cuts, later: The deal may roll back much of the sequester during the next two years, but it extends forced budget cuts for two new years on the back end, into 2023 and 2024.

Oddball proposals: The deal contains more than a dozen other assorted provisions, a kind of nickle-by-nickle, rag-tag collection. Here are some that especially stand out.

The Death Master File: Cue the Star Wars’ Imperial March music here. Turns out the Department of Commerce keeps something called the “Death Master File,” which lists people who have died and their Social Security numbers. The budget deal would block fraud (checks going to dead people, essentially) by limiting access to the death list and raising penalties for misuse.

Prisoners shouldn’t get unemployment checks: The deal aims to block prisoners from getting government checks the law bans, like unemployment benefits, by increasing the coordination of prisoner lists.

Student loan companies: This isn’t sexy, but it is worth $3 billion, according to House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan’s office. The deal would take away automatic payment for non-profit student loan servicers, replacing it with payment that Congress determines yearly. Told you it wasn’t sexy.

Pension guarantees: And, it gets even more wonky - but also more lucrative. The federal government runs a program that guarantees the pensions for companies that participate, sensibly called the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The deal saves an estimated $7.9 billion by asking the companies to pay more money for that guarantee.

Gas and oil: The deal would make two changes that energy companies won’t like. It ends a government research program that Ryan’s office says was for private energy companies. It also ends a provision that allowed energy companies to stash funds in government accounts and earn interest above market rates."

They are tired of brinkmanship.

Republicans have taken a HUGE hit:



Participants in the poll gave the Republican Party overall its lowest marks in the history of Journal polling, which goes back to 1989: More than twice as many hold a negative view of the GOP as a positive one. By contrast, the number of Americans viewing the Democratic Party positively or negatively was nearly equal, at about 40%.

n all, 53% of those polled blamed Republicans for the shutdown, compared with 31% who blamed Mr. Obama—numbers that showed the GOP taking a worse beating than the party did 17 years ago during the last extended shutdown, under President Bill Clinton.

Asked about the current budget battle, 70% of participants faulted Republicans in Congress for putting their political agenda ahead of what's good for the country. In a separate question, 51% said Mr. Obama was more concerned about his agenda than the good of the country. The public was divided over the president's refusal to negotiate with Republicans unless they reopen the government and raise the federal debt ceiling, with 40% agreeing with his stand and 43% disagreeing.

Bill McInturff , a Republican pollster who conducted the poll along with Democratic pollsters Fred Yang and Peter Hart , called the data ""toxic"" and noted key areas in which the GOP had suffered from what he called ""an ideological boomerang"" contrary to the outcome sought when members of the party launched the budget fight last month.

The poll also showed a slight uptick in support overall for the health law and a larger jump, to 52%, in support of the government doing more to solve people's problems.

Far more blame Republicans than Obama for the shutdown.Although Obama has taken a hit, it is not nearly as bad as the Republicans.In all this poll is TOXIC for the GOP:And Obamacare got an uptick!Please proceed GOP!"

They are among $25 billion of wasteful and duplicate spending targeted by the president's budget that will be released Wednesday, according to an administration official.

By cutting one of two catfish inspection programs at different federal agencies, for instance, the government could save some $14 million.

It's part of 215 proposals from Obama to save money by streamlining various federal programs. They include eliminating a redundant Air Force satellite system and also consolidating 220 science, technology, engineering and math programs across 13 agencies.

Separately, a report by the non-partisan Congressional watchdog, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, released Tuesday also identified 31 new areas of waste and duplication. The GAO said the government can save $82 million just by getting the different military departments to agree on one or two types of camouflage for their uniforms, instead of the current seven ""varying patterns and colors.""

Related: Obama's deficit reduction scorecard

Republicans, in particular, are interested in cutting waste, because they say it's key to buffering the $85 billion automatic, across-the-board budget cuts that kicked in on March 1.

The House Oversight Committee is holding a hearing Tuesday on the new GAO report. In recent years, the House has passed several bills that drastically slashes all kinds of spending. However, those bills have gone nowhere, because the Senate hasn't taken them up.

It's hard for Washington to cut waste, because every program has its own fan club.

In 2011, for instance, Obama suggested scrapping Voice of America's radio broadcast in China, because studies showed few people were listening. But House Republicans wanted to send the program an additional $14 million to keep it on air.

In 2012, GAO suggested $1.2 billion in savings by getting rid of federal crop insurance subsidies for rich farmers to reduce subsidies.

Rural lawmakers from both political parties said they were hesitant to limit such insurance, especially after a drought that ruined many crops in 2012. Last summer, the Senate took a symbolic step by passing a scaled back measure that trimmed crop insurance subsidies by 15% for farmers with $750,000 in total sales. But that too went nowhere,

The key reason why Washington has failed to slash spending for so long is the lack of an official budget. Congress hasn't worked together to pass an official budget in the past four years. Instead, Congress has resorted to passing short-term funding measures, often waiting until the very last minute. The government is currently operating on a budget measure that runs out on Sept. 30.

""Right now, we have budget-making by crisis, and it has to be a major crisis, like a debt ceiling or a government shutdown,"" said Patrick Lester, fiscal policy director for the Center for Effective Government, a watchdog group.

Traditionally that process starts in February, when the president proposes his budget to start Oct. 1. President Obama is nearly two months late in offering his budget, which doesn't give Congress a lot of time.

Despite the lack of an official budgetary process, some progress has been made to root out waste, GAO noted. The White House, executive agencies and Congress have adopted 21% of the 300 suggestions GAO has made in the past three years and ""made progress"" on about 51% of its recommendations."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/16/10-Questions-Obama-Must-Answer-On-IRS-Scandal,2013-05-16 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],10 Questions Obama Must Answer on IRS Scandal,"On Wednesday, President Barack Obama said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asked for and accepted the resignation of the acting Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Steven T. Miller. However, Miller’s term as acting IRS Commissioner was up in a couple of weeks, and it is presently unclear whether he was forced to resign or was simply granting notice that his term was up.

Obama will face reporters on Thursday to answer questions about the IRS scandal that placed nearly 500 conservative organizations in the IRS’s crosshairs during the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Beyond the classic question, “What did the Administration know and when did it know it?”, a myriad of questions remain unanswered. Here are just a few:

Who inside the IRS hatched the plan to target conservatives and what, if any, connections do they, their associates, or superiors have to the Obama White House, campaign team, or other political organizations? Who at the IRS leaked confidential tax documents to the progressive-leaning journalism group ProPublica, an action which the IRS official manual says can result in up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000? Who are the two “rogue” individuals disgraced former IRS Commissioner Stevens said went “off the reservation” and acted “overly aggressive” and what, if any, connections do they have politically? If, as the Inspector General report alleges, political motivations were not driving the targeting of conservatives, then what was? Also, what “discipline” did the two rogue agents receive? Did IRS agents coordinate with Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) or his staff to “go after them [conservative groups],” as he told the New York Times, following Levin’s letters to then-IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman and Director Lois Lerner? Did Sen. Max Baucus (D-MO) or his staff communicate or coordinate with IRS agents after Baucus wrote this September 28, 2010 letter instructing then-Commissioner Douglas Shulman to have his “agency survey major 401(c)(4), (c)(5) and (c)(6) organizations to determine whether they are acting as conduits for major donors advancing their own private interests”? What communications took place between IRS agents and the following senators and their staffs following the delivery of this jointly written letter demanding the IRS crack down on “abuse of the tax code by political groups focused on federal election activities”: Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO ), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Sen. Al Franken (D-MN)? What communications existed between Obama reelection campaign co-chair Joe Solomonese, whom the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) alleges received its confidential tax returns, and IRS agents? What portion of Obama’s 79% increase in audits of charities were of conservative groups? If political motivations were not driving the selective targeting of 500 conservative organizations, then why were a similar number of liberal groups not harassed? What role did IRS Rulings and Agreements Division Director Holly Paz, who in 2008 donated $2,000 to Obama, play in ratcheting up IRS investigations, as she promised she would in June 2012?

Whether reporters will ask and Obama will answer the critical questions that must be resolved remains to be seen."

He says perhaps conservatives saw the light; if so, let's see them walk the walk Begala: Liberals extoll hard work; conservatives honor wealth, punish work

Editor’s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House.

(CNN) —

It’s not often that I agree with Sarah Palin. But when she comes around to a liberal point of view on an issue, that is to be noted with praise. So, good for you, Sarah, for flip-flopping on the issue of hard work.

Palin took to Facebook recently to praise the remarks of liberal actor Ashton Kutcher, who has in the past donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and participated in a star-studded video pledging, “to serve our President (Obama) and all mankind.”

So how did this Hollywood liberal become the darling of Sarah Palin? By speaking out on behalf of a truly liberal value: hard work.

CNN Paul Begala

“I believe that opportunity looks a lot like hard work,” Kutcher said in a speech he gave at the Teen Choice Awards. “I’ve never had a job in my life that I was better than. I was always just lucky to have a job. And every job I had was a steppingstone to my next job, and I never quit my job until I had my next job.”

Palin and other conservatives lept to embrace Kutcher’s comments, as though they were conservative. They are, of course, profoundly liberal.

It is liberals who honor, extoll and reward hard work. That’s why President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and virtually all Democrats support raising the minimum wage – to honor and reward those who choose work over welfare, and ensure an honest day’s work pays enough to feed a family. That’s why President Obama and the Democrats cut taxes on working people by $3,600 over four years. And that’s why President Obama won the votes of working-class Americans (those making less than $100,000 a year) by a full 10 points.

But perhaps Palin and others on the right have seen the light. Perhaps Kutcher’s bracing and bold statement of liberalism has moved them. If so, let’s see them walk the walk. Because at the present moment Republicans seem to honor wealth and punish work.

How else can you explain that they want a tax code in which a billionaire heiress pays nothing on her inheritance, while the hard-working maid who makes the heiress’ bed pays taxes on every nickel she earns?

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney pocketed $42 million during 2011 and 2012. He did not earn that money from work – he accrued it through wealth. His investments garnered him tens of millions while he ran around the country campaigning. And yet Romney paid merely 12% in taxes. By contrast, a cop married to a teacher, each making the median income of around $50,000 a year, pays a marginal tax rate of 25%. Even with deductions they are almost certainly paying a greater percentage of their income in taxes than mega-millionaire Romney.

Palin, who famously quit on the people of Alaska when she got too big for the gig of governing her beautiful state, is an especially unfortunate spokesperson for the value of hard work. One hopes she takes Kutcher’s liberal advice to heart, and supports working people in word and deed.

And if Palin liked Kutcher’s Teen Choice remarks, she’ll love this statement: “Success may not come quickly or easily. But if you strive to do what’s right, if you work harder and dream bigger, if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our time, then I’m confident that, together, we will continue the never-ending task of perfecting our union.”

Those are not the words of Ashton Kutcher. No, the liberal extolling hard work and patriotism in those comments was Palin’s president – and mine and Ashton Kutcher’s and every American’s president: Barack Obama.

Nearly half of the recipients who get federal science funding say they've recently laid off or will lay off scientists and researchers, because federal grants are tougher to win, according to a survey by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and 15 other scientific societies.

At Arkansas State University, 30 scientists and researchers have lost or will lose jobs by October from federal budget cuts at the defense and education departments that funded research detecting bombs and nerve agents.

At the University of Chicago, 3 laboratories have closed, costing six medical researchers jobs treating cancer, healing wounds and gastro-intestinal problems, due to funding cuts at the National Institutes of Health.

These are just some of the cuts underway thanks to $85 billion in forced spending cuts, called sequester, that kicked in March 1. And as more research grants don't get renewed, the layoffs will get worse, experts say.

""My post-doctoral student is facing losing a job in coming months if no new NIH funding comes in,"" said Professor Yuntao Wu at George Mason University's National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases and the Department of Molecular and Microbiology.

Wu has already laid off one technician at his lab, which works with a compound derived from soybeans to treat HIV. ""We are facing closing the whole lab. That takes many years to build,"" he added.

Some 1,444 of 3,165 scientists reported layoffs are imminent or have taken place at their laboratories, because they couldn't renew federal grants.

About 54% of scientists reported that they know a colleague who has lost a job, according to the survey. The questionnaires went out in June and July.

The layoffs were first signaled months ago by Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. He warned earlier this year that the sequester would eventually cost 20,000 research and technician jobs.

The NIH has lost $1.6 billion from its $31 billion budget in its fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, on top of tighter budgets in 2012 and 2011. The NIH is the largest supporter of biomedical research in the United States, and cuts have led to hundreds of research projects not getting funding.

The National Science Foundation also has said 1,000 fewer grants would be awarded this year, compared to last year. NSF funds research and education in non-medical science and engineering.

The Department of Defense has also cut research funding in its quest to trim $40 billion from its budget by Sept. 30.

Scientists and lobbying groups say the funding climate endangers a generation of future scientists and breakthroughs.

""The data shows that deep cuts to federal investments in research are tearing at the fabric of the nation's scientific enterprise and have a minimal impact on overcoming our national debt and deficit problems,"" said Benjamin Corb, spokesman for the biochemistry group."

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) seems determined to chop discretionary budgets by more than $100 billion this year, regardless of what economists (and the unemployment rate) may suggest about the fragility of the recovery.

Granted, it’s not that Reid is calling for the cuts to go into effect on March 1, as currently scheduled. In fact, he says the opposite. But the alternatives that Reid and House Democrats are floating are such political nonstarters, it’s hard to imagine anything else happening.

As part of the 2011 debt-ceiling deal, Congress agreed to reduce projected deficits by more than $2 trillion over the subsequent 10 years. About half of that was implemented right away through lower spending caps; a special committee was created to come up with a plan for saving an additional $1.2 trillion. If the committee failed -- which it did, predictably -- the savings were to be achieved through annual across-the-board spending cuts, starting Jan. 1, 2013.

Congress agreed in early January to postpone the cuts until March, and few people on Capitol Hill like the idea of an across-the-board haircut in defense and discretionary programs. Nevertheless, there’s a gulf between the GOP’s proposed changes and the Democrats’ desires. The former want to spare the Defense Department but keep the total amount of cuts and the timetable for making them the same. The latter don’t seem to mind the idea of a smaller Defense Department, but they don’t think now’s the right time to be pulling federal dollars out of the economy.

On ABC’s “This Week” broadcast Sunday, Reid said: “We need to keep our eye on the prize and continue doing something about spending, but I think that what we need to do is do some of the things that Mitt Romney talked about. He said there’s some low-hanging fruit; there are a lot of tax loopholes that should be closed. I agree with him. We haven’t done that.”

That may be the nicest thing Reid has ever said publicly about Romney. He went on to point to the usual Democratic litany of loopholes that need closing: subsidies for the oil and gas industries, tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas, deductions for corporate jets. That’s all small beer, and as host George Stephanopoulos pointed out, Republicans just agreed to let almost $700 billion worth of tax cuts expire. They’re not willing to go back to the revenue well.

To which Reid replied: “George, the American people are on our side. The American people don’t believe in these austere things. We believe that the rich should contribute. We believe we should fill those tax loopholes, get rid of them, I should say. And that’s where we need to go.” He added that defense cuts have to be included in any deal regarding the March 1 “sequester” because the Pentagon has largely been spared in prior reductions.

Just to be clear, Stephanopoulos asked, was Reid saying that higher taxes would have to be included in a deal to settle “any one” of the three big fiscal battles to come (the sequester, funding the government for the second half of the fiscal year and raising the debt limit again)? “Yes, the answer is definitely yes,” Reid said, adding, “And I’ve got a pretty good fan base for that: the American people, Republicans, Democrats and independents.”

Advertisement

That just settles it, huh? It’s a negotiating tactic, to be sure, but Reid’s stance suggests the talks with Republicans will go nowhere.

Then, on Monday, House Democrats put forward an actual legislative proposal to replace the March 1 spending cuts with ... higher taxes on oil and gas companies, a minimum tax on millionaires and billionaires, and lower farm subsidies.

Democrats sound like the party of One Note Johnny, whose solution to every fiscal problem is higher taxes on big corporations, agribusinesses and wealthy Americans. To maintain a shred of credibility, the party needs to take a cue from the Senate’s “Gang of Six” or the Democrats who supported the deficit-reduction plan laid out by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson. As much as they talk about a balanced approach to shoring up Washington’s finances, they never seem to offer anything that meets the description.

This is not to say they’re wrong about the timing of the cuts to come. But it’s long past time for lawmakers to agree to a plan to bring the deficit under control.

Advertisement

And House Republicans deserve no plaudits either. They’re pushing a bill called the Require a PLAN Act -- PLAN standing for the Require Presidential Leadership and No Deficit Act. Yes, that spells PLAND, not PLAN, and the proposal is every bit as brain dead as whoever botched the acronym.

The measure would require President Obama to do something House Republicans have never done themselves, which is to propose a budget that would eliminate the deficit within 10 years. If Obama’s first submission didn’t do it, he’d have until April 1 to submit a revised one that did, including an explanation of the policy changes that would lead to balance.

Of course, Congress routinely disregards the policy proposals in presidential budgets. More important, Congress, not the White House, controls the government’s purse strings. Congress approves the spending bills, tax laws and benefit programs that determine how big a deficit Washington will have each year, if any. The president can veto any of these measures, which gives him a lot of influence. But Congress’ control over the annual appropriations needed to run the government gives it enormous leverage in any negotiations. Obama can’t spend a dime that Congress doesn’t give him.

What Republicans really seem to want here is for Obama to give them some political cover for when they start carving into entitlements. That’s a pipe dream, however. Obama may not have done much to improve the federal government’s finances, but with one exception, he’s expertly avoided getting out in front of the GOP when it comes to entitlement savings.

The exception is the $700 billion-plus that the 2010 healthcare reform law shaved from projected Medicare spending. Republicans have blasted Obama repeatedly for that -- which the public should keep in mind this week when the GOP complains that the president hasn’t done anything to rein in out-of-control entitlements.

http://news.yahoo.com/washington-dc-city-council-raises-minimum-wage-11-181750866--finance.html,,[],Washington city council ups minimum wage to $11.50 per hour in 2016,"By Ian Simpson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington's city council on Tuesday approved raising the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour, one of the highest rates among U.S. cities and part of the wealthy region's push to hike base pay. The minimum wage in the U.S. capital would rise in 2016 from the current $8.25, and then be indexed for inflation. The council gave unanimous final approval to the measure, which it first passed two weeks ago. Democratic Mayor Vincent Gray has opposed the measure, saying it is unclear how it would affect the labor market, and urged an increase to $10 an hour instead. The unanimous vote means the council could pass it over Gray's veto. The council coordinated raising the base wage with lawmakers in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, in Washington's Maryland suburbs. They approved similar measures last month. Once the higher pay takes effect, the three jurisdictions would form a region with 2.5 million residents and a minimum wage higher than any of the 50 states. Virginia, which borders Washington, requires employers to pay the federal rate of $7.25 an hour. Some business groups said the measure was ill-advised. Jim Dinegar, the president and chief executive of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, told Reuters the higher wages would make the capital and the region less attractive to business, especially since Virginia's rate remained unchanged. ""They think they're doing this in a vacuum. They're not,"" he said of the council's vote. Another business group, the District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce, has called for raising the minimum wage to $10 over three years and then indexing it to inflation. Washington state has the highest hourly minimum wage among U.S. states at $9.19 an hour. Among city workers, those in Sonoma, California, enjoy the highest rate, at $15.38 an hour. Gray had vetoed a bill this fall that would have required Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other big retailers to pay a 50 percent premium over the city's current minimum wage. The pay hike comes after fast-food workers went on strike this month across the United States as part of a campaign to raise pay to $15 an hour. The city council voted as the region emerges relatively unscathed from the recession and with the capital's economy and population growing. The Census Bureau reported last week that eight of the 13 U.S. counties with the highest median income last year were in the Washington area. (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

Washington (CNN) - In case you missed it, Barack Obama–the man who once seemed perfectly content to live under the political equivalent of house arrest–has suddenly decided to become a party animal. He's having phone chats with Republicans, taking them out to dinner at a swanky Washington hotel and has plans to rush up to Capitol Hill next week for four meetings -with the Democrats, and his new acquaintances, the Republicans.

Since we know this is not about empty nest syndrome (he still likes to have dinner with his daughters at home), there must be something else up.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Truth is, as one person who has spoken with the president says, ""he doesn't have a lot of options left."" He managed to cut a deal on the fiscal cliff, but his strategy on the forced budget cuts-asking the GOP to accept new revenue-did not work. And no one thinks it's Armageddon, no matter how much the White House tried to make the case. The alternative to doing nothing, this source says ""is total polarization."" And since the president has a big agenda he would like to get to beyond the fiscal problems, he needs to deal with budget issues in a way that does not poison the well.

So, his Democratic allies have advised him, how about trying to engage the other side? ""The more you do it, the more you will like it,"" one ally said he told the president.

The list of luminaries in favor of glasnost is a well-known contingent: former White House chiefs of staff Rahm Emanuel, John Podesta and Bill Daley and former Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle, according to one source. He's been advised to do this before, a former White official says, only this time he's doing it. And that may have something to do with the fact that he's got a new White House team that is more oriented towards the Congress – Denis McDonough as Chief of Staff and Rob Nabors as his deputy (both are former Capitol Hill staffers).

And the pain apparently isn't as bad as he thought. ""He told his staff that he enjoyed the other night [dinner with the Republicans] very much,"" says one knowledgeable source. ""He's been told that if you try it, you might like it more than you think you will."" Kind of like dreading a party, and then enjoying it once you get there.

Given the fact that the Obamas dined with the Clintons last week, one source who knows Bill Clinton's feelings on outreach says ""It's not a bad assumption"" that the president heard similar talking points at dinner. Clinton, of course, was the king of congressional schmooze.

There is, of course, a crucial backdrop to all of this: one source says the president believes that if he doesn't get a big deficit reduction deal by the end of the summer, the moment will have passed. He's trying to build some momentum for that, another source adds. ""He's saying 'I will talk to everybody and anybody.'"" What that also means is that if this charm offensive fails, he can't be blamed. In other words, he has nothing to lose."

USA TODAY

Almost one in four Texans are uninsured%2C the highest rate in the nation

President Obama%27s health care law has been attacked by Texas%27 Republican leaders

Federal government will run health care exchange

This story was originally published Aug. 14, 2013.

Most Americans know the Affordable Care Act — aka ""Obamacare"" — as the legislation birthed from one of the most acrimonious political debates in years. In 139 days, the law will shift from talking points to the kitchen table, from an eventuality to reality. This sweeping government experiment, after all, stands to affect tens of millions of people.

Jan. 1, 2014, will be the official launch date for a federal endeavor that will reshape the U.S. health insurance market coast to coast. People without insurance can start signing up Oct. 1. Depending on where you live, your experiences with the new law — and your costs — could differ dramatically.

USA TODAY's Julie Schmit, Rick Jervis and Greg Toppo reported from California, Texas and West Virginia to see what people are seeing, and thinking, as the law is being rolled out in three very different ways in these three states.

• • •

AUSTIN — Sometimes Darrell Tatum's car gets only a quarter-tank of gas. Other months, the grocery list gets whittled down. Or the purchase of notebooks, pens and other school supplies for five children is postponed.

The budgetary gymnastics Tatum and his wife, Quintina, perform each month are necessary to meet the $500-to-$600 monthly health care premiums they pay — an amount that has risen steadily over the years and that he says is slowly drowning the Dallas couple in debt.

Tatum, 41, says he's stuck in financial limbo: He makes too much money as a municipal worker to qualify for benefit programs for the poor but not enough to cover the rising cost of health care.

""We're trying to do the best we can with what we have, but it's rough,"" he says. ""It's almost like you're penalized for working.""

HOPE OR HEADACHE?

For Tatum and thousands like him, the Affordable Care Act and the health insurance exchanges offer hope. Almost one in four Texans — more than 6 million residents — are uninsured, the highest rate in the nation, according to the Census Bureau. The Affordable Care Act could halve the Texas number by next year, according to a recent study by the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University.

Welcomed by many residents and scorned by others, the law has been vilified by Texas' Republican leaders. Gov. Rick Perry has led the charge, criticizing the legislation as bad policy and the health insurance exchanges it creates as lacking appropriate funding. Texas, along with 26 other states, has opted not to set up a state-run exchange to market health coverage to the uninsured. For states with leaders who disagree with the initiative, it's the best way to protest the Washington directive. In these cases, the federal government will run the exchanges.

Texas would be better off receiving block grants from Washington to help the uninsured rather than being forced to participate in a federal system, says state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, an outspoken critic of Obamacare who has been a state senator since 2007.

""We're smarter about Texas than Washington is,"" he says. ""This is the worst legislation I've ever seen from the federal government.""

Despite the resistance from state leaders, grass-roots groups across the state are scrambling to inform Texans about the exchanges. Foundation Communities, an Austin-based group that helps low-income residents with their taxes, has set up two enrollment centers to help residents sift through the benefits of the law, says Elizabeth Colvin,a director of the group.

The key struggle is persuading residents that the exchanges will be available, despite highly publicized attacks from leaders in Austin, she says. ""It's a challenge for Texans because there's no state leadership on this issue,"" Colvin said. ""It's all coming from the local level.""

'HIGH-RISK POOL'

Cost predictions have been elusive because the federal government has yet to release the health care rates that will be available through the exchanges, says David Warner, health and social policy professor at the University of Texas.

One group of Texans stands to instantly benefit: the ""high-risk pool,"" those previously uninsurable because of pre-existing conditions or other factors. The new law will cut their premiums in half, Warner says.

Also set to benefit are individuals not part of a large employer insurance group. ""They'll be able to get coverage, and it won't be totally unaffordable,"" Warner says.

That's welcome news for Will Love, 27, co-owner of an Austin video production company who has been uninsured for two years. After the Houston firm he worked for closed, Love paid for his own insurance from Humana. The rates steadily began to climb, from $125 a month to $150 a month, even though he remained healthy and incident-free. So he dropped coverage.

He says he's counting on a stable, affordable alternative with the exchanges. ""I hope to find a reasonable price with a reasonable company that's not going to jack up the prices once you sign up,"" Love says.

Though Tatum first heard about the exchanges via a friend's Facebook post, he plans to attend seminars to learn more about the program he says could better his life.

""It'll give me a better feel for where my dollars are going and what I think is best for my family,"" Tatum says. ""I'd just like to have that option."""

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republican Party leaders have staked their party's future on a false premise. They say the wealthy are already providing for everyone else, and middle class families need to sacrifice for a change while millionaires reap the benefits.

This year's Ryan budget is a product of this assumption. It treats the government to which Rep. Ryan has been elected as something between a nuisance and a menace, with no role in helping the economy except to transfer more wealth upward.

Plenty of people have pointed out that these ideas lost in November. What they often forget is that a more positive vision also won that election: a vision of an America that helps us all achieve more than we could individually, a government that acts when the moment calls for it.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus, which we're proud to co-chair, introduced its Back to Work Budget on March 13 because we know that putting Americans back to work, not cutting investments, is the answer to our nation's problems. We put 7 million people back to work in the first year and reduce the deficit $4.4 trillion over the next decade.

Good jobs and fair pay, not favors for a lucky few, are what make this country run. The magic elixir Rep. Ryan and his colleagues are selling - blank checks to the Pentagon, tax cuts for the wealthy, subsidies for fossil fuels, less opportunity for the rest of us - has simply failed to help our economy. We need to rebuild this country by cutting tax loopholes we don't need and investing in the things we do: roads, bridges, schools, health care, infrastructure, and other basics of a prosperous nation. That's what our budget does.

There is no question which approach the American people support. A Gallup poll released this week found that 72 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, support putting people back to work repairing our infrastructure. The same percentage supports investment to create jobs.

We're not afraid of the contrasts our budget suggests with conservative ideology. Instead of closing the Department of Education, as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called for at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, we believe in building schools and putting more teachers on the job. Instead of continued tax breaks for large corporations, such as the $112 billion we will give away to wealthy fossil fuel companies in the next decade, we end preferential treatment for perks like corporate jets and put the money back into job creation for the American people.

Two years ago, Rep. Ryan's blueprint was greeted with cheers by conservative activists and considerable deference by the pundits. This year, his plan is being treated as what it is: a radical transformation of the American experience. If he got his way, Medicaid would wither, Medicare as we know it would cease to exist, and the decades of progress we've made in fighting hunger and poverty would be wiped out.

We agree with the American people who made their preference known in November: we can do better. The right-wing myth of makers and takers has had a pernicious effect on our politics and will take some time to fade away. In the meantime, we need to get our national conversation back on track. It's time for a serious effort to get America working again.

The House Republican majority didn't pass our budget in last Wednesday's vote, but after two years of ignoring the jobs crisis, we hope our plan starts a new conversation that can continue past budget season. All we've heard from Republicans is the same exhausted line about cutting everything in sight, retrenching, reining in the American dream, and foreclosing on any positive government role in our nation's future. It's time for jobs to be the priority for Washington that it already is for the American people.

Grijalva and Ellison are co-chairmen of the Congressional Progressive Caucus."

In phone calls and a White House session, President Obama and Republican lawmakers worked to hash out a plan to restore government funding and lift the debt ceiling, and also initiate a new round of budget and deficit-reduction talks.

But the task of sealing a deal was complicated by division between Senate and House Republicans, who were conducting separate negotiations. The White House also said it had concerns over the outline of the House GOP proposal. That plan for a short-term suspension of the debt limit, officials warned, seemed guaranteed to set up a renewed confrontation next month.

Still, for the first time in the 11-day shutdown, lawmakers expressed optimism that a deal could be reached in the next several days. Meanwhile, the calendar crept closer to Oct. 17, when the Treasury Department has said the government will no longer be able to borrow money to cover expenses and could risk a default.

“I just have a sense over the weekend some significant jelling is going to take place,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said, speculating that a plan could be in place “potentially as early as midweek.”

The qualified hopefulness was a striking shift after days of deadlock in Washington. The two parties have traded barbs and charges of extortion, while many government services remained closed. Federal workers in some agencies received partial paychecks Friday, reflecting the first week of furloughs.

Under pressure to avoid a default and watching the standoff take a toll on their public approval numbers, Republicans on Thursday offered to extend the debt limit for six weeks, dropping their refusal to lift it before the president committed to negotiations over the budget. Late Thursday, after more discussions with the White House, Republicans added a proposal to reopen the government — at least temporarily.

The House GOP proposal would launch a two-track negotiation over at least the next six weeks, officials said.

On one track, in return for temporarily lifting the debt ceiling, Republicans want a series of talks focused on tax reform, as well as cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs.

On the second track, House Republicans would reopen the government if the White House agreed to talks on spending levels for the current fiscal year, which started Oct. 1.

Both parties would like to make changes to the next round of across-the-board cuts, the so-called sequester, that are scheduled to kick in Jan. 1.

But House Republicans were still insisting on an upfront concession from the president before they moved to reopen the government. Late Friday, House Republicans were still debating what that might be, but it could include slight changes to the healthcare law. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, proposed their own endgame.

Congressional Democrats seemed content to sit back and allow Republicans to argue among themselves, betting that, with the GOP increasingly anxious to end the standoff, Democrats’ leverage will only increase as the debt-limit deadline draws closer.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was expected to move forward with a proposal for a one-year extension of the debt limit with no strings attached. A key test vote in the Senate was set for Saturday.

Friday, however, saw no legislative progress, only deliberations behind closed doors.

Senate Republicans boarded buses for a midday meeting at the White House. During the 100-minute session, Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, outlined a proposal to fund the government for six months and raise the debt limit for a short term, repeal the tax on medical-device makers, and give

federal agencies the flexibility to manage the sequester budget cuts imposed by Congress early this year.

Collins said Obama liked some of her proposal but was noncommittal. “He described it as constructive and having elements of it that could be worked on, but I don’t want to give the impression that he endorsed it and said, ‘What a great plan,’” she said.

House Republicans opposed Collins’ plan, arguing that it cedes too much control over the budget to the president. That split has left Obama in a negotiation triangle with Republicans in the two chambers. It was not immediately clear whether the White House would embrace either Republican proposal.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Friday did not shoot down the possibility of delaying the medical-device tax, a change to the healthcare law that could draw bipartisan support. He would not commit to other elements of the proposal.

Obama has said he would sign a short-term debt ceiling extension, but Carney stressed that such a deal would keep the president from achieving his key objective: ending the cycle of repeated budget crises.

“We cannot have a situation where the debt ceiling is extended as part of a budget negotiation process for only six weeks, which would put us right back in the same position that we’re in now,” Carney said.

On that front, there was some bipartisan agreement.

A six-week debt limit extension “doesn’t make a lot of sense,” said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). “Because all we would be doing is putting the same problem off for six weeks, and then you have the Thanksgiving cliff. This is the Halloween cliff. So we might as well stop having so many cliffs — which is why everybody started talking.

“I think there is a majority of the House and Senate that realizes it is time to get the government back open,” he said.

Isakson, who helped organize dinners at the White House to discuss the country’s debt burden, said Friday’s meeting was a “good exchange of ideas.” Obama was “very engaged” and “candid,” he said.

After weeks of trading tortured metaphors and allegations of hostage-taking, the rhetoric on both sides softened. That was perhaps the clearest sign of progress.

“It was the kind of meeting you’d expect when you are starting to get down to business,” Isakson said, adding that there was “no showboating.”

At the White House, Carney called the talks constructive. “There needs to be continuing discussions,” he said, “and we’ll see where we get.”

The Democrats’ strategy offers Republicans an opportunity. Since the Democrats insist that the prospect of default is the reason they will not negotiate about spending restraint, Republicans should begin the debt-ceiling fight by permanently eliminating that prospect, turning the debt-ceiling debate into an argument about future spending rather than past borrowing.

The House should pass a bill to redefine the debt limit so that it constrains primary spending but not debt service. Under this reform, a Treasury that had hit the statutory borrowing limit could continue to borrow what it needed exclusively for paying interest on the national debt and to roll over existing debt obligations, but it could not borrow for any other government spending until the limit had been increased.

By Doug Palmer

WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - The Senate on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to approve White House international economic affairs adviser Michael Froman to be the next U.S. trade representative, sending him into the fray of huge trade negotiations in Asia and Europe.

Froman, a longtime friend of President Barack Obama, already has played a major role in shaping U.S. trade policy in the past four years from his post in the White House.

Now he is moving from that behind-the-scenes work to a prominent role in Obama's Cabinet, where other big jobs will include managing difficult trade relationships with China and India and breathing life into moribund world trade talks.

""Mike is smart. He knows the issues. Very importantly, he has the trust of the president,"" former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, a Republican, said on Wednesday in a speech at the Wilson Center, a foreign policy think tank.

Froman was approved in a 93-4 vote. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, was among the few senators to vote against him, citing what she called a lack of transparency in U.S. trade negotiations, a complaint many civil society groups have made in the past.

""Many people are deeply interested in tracking the trajectory of trade negotiations, but if they do not have reasonable access to see the terms of the agreements under negotiation, then they can't have real input,"" Warren said.

Froman got strong words of support from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, and Senator Orrin Hatch, the panel's top Republican.

""I have every confidence this man is going to be an excellent leader ... He is highly qualified,"" Hatch said.

The Senate action came just days after Obama and leaders of the European Union opened talks on what would be the world's biggest free-trade agreement, the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership pact.

Froman now will be able to preside over the first round of those negotiations, set for the week of July 8 in Washington.

The United States also is negotiating a free-trade agreement with Japan and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact that it hopes to finish by the end of this year.

Froman's legacy will rest on whether he can bring those two big negotiations to agreements and win their approval in Congress.

To secure the Asia-Pacific pact and win new export opportunities for U.S. business and farmers, Froman may have to make politically difficult decisions that would open the U.S. market to more auto, dairy, sugar and textile imports.

The United States and the EU want to finish their trade talks by the end of 2014, requiring compromise on tough issues like Europe's restrictions on imports of genetically modified crops and other food safety barriers that Washington says are not based on scientific evidence.

Froman also faces an early test in Congress to win approval of trade promotion authority, a piece of legislation that many of Obama's fellow Democrats have opposed in the past.

That legislation, which expired in 2007, allows the White House to submit trade deals to Congress for straight up-or-down votes without any amendments.

Approval of the bill would signal strong congressional backing for the Asia-Pacific and the EU agreements, helping to bring them to a close.

Concern in Congress about the massive U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a record $315 billion in 2012, also puts pressure on Froman to make progress on that front.

In addition, many lawmakers are increasingly frustrated with Indian policies that block U.S. imports and invalidate patent protections for valuable U.S. pharmaceuticals.

In December, Froman will head to Bali for the ninth ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization amid gloom over that body's continuing viability as a negotiating forum.

(CNN) —

Two steps forward, one step back.

A surge of optimism on Monday for a possible compromise to end the partial government shutdown and avoid a U.S. default as soon as this week got jolted by the sudden postponement of a White House meeting between President Barack Obama and congressional leaders.

In a brief statement, the White House said the meeting announced earlier in the day was put on hold “to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress” toward a solution.

It was unclear if the development signaled a problem or was needed to give more time for talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, to finish an agreement that could win approval in the Senate and the House.

7 crazy side effects from the shutdown

Negotiations heated up with the Democratic and Republican leaders signaling progress. Both Reid and McConnell took to the Senate floor to express optimism for a compromise on the twin priorities that they expected to be reasonable and acceptable to both sides.

Reid’s tone remained positive as night fell over the Capitol.

“We’ve made tremendous progress,” he said, saying that “everyone just needs to be patient” and that “perhaps tomorrow will be a bright day.”

Key negotiators also maintained an upbeat posture and financial markets, which Washington is watching very closely considering their volatility over the political impasse, also ended the day higher with Wall Street heartened by news of a possible deal, especially on the debt limit.

At the same time, both sides noted that nothing had been finalized and the postponement of the meeting between congressional leaders and Obama and Vice President Joe Biden raised a new question mark in the process.

Supporters stand by representatives and government shutdown

During a visit Monday to a local food pantry, Obama cited progress in the Senate negotiations but also warned of what he called continued partisan brinkmanship by House Republicans who “continue to think that somehow they can extract concessions by keeping the government shut down or by threatening default.”

“My hope is a spirit of cooperation will move us forward over the next few hours,” Obama said.

Shutdown drags on

The failure of Congress to authorize spending for the new fiscal year triggered the shutdown on October 1.

Another deadline looms on Thursday, when the Treasury says it will need Congress to raise the debt ceiling so it can borrow more money to pay all the government’s bills.

During his visit to Martha’s Table in Washington, Obama said the congressional leaders could “solve this problem today.”

The crisis with an on/off switch

He warned that a default, in which the government would lack enough cash on hand to pay down its debt obligations as well as other daily bills such as Social Security checks, “could have a potentially devastating effect on our economy.”

“We’ve already had a damaging effect on our economy because of the shutdown,” he said. “That damage would be greatly magnified if we don’t make sure that government’s paying its bills, and that has to be decided this week.”

The Treasury Department said it will be unable to pay the government’s bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday.

As reported by CNN’s Dana Bash and CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta, the main sticking point involves how long an agreement would fund the government to end the shutdown and increase the debt limit.

Democrats want the debt ceiling increase to extend as long as possible to avoid similar showdowns in coming months.

Conservatives defiant in the face of GOP troubles

At the same time, they seek a temporary spending plan to reopen the government while formal budget negotiations work out a longer-term agreement that can negate the impacts of the forced sequestration cuts.

Republicans, however, want a longer spending proposal that would lock in the planned sequestration cuts in coming months, with a shorter debt ceiling extension in order to negotiate further deficit-reduction measures.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine have spearheaded the bipartisan talks. Separately, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee also cited progress.

“We’ll get this done. We’re gonna get this done. I feel real confident,” Manchin said.

Manchin said the goal was to get at least 65 Senate votes – which would mean 10 or more from Republicans – to help Speaker John Boehner generate GOP backing in the House despite certain opposition from the tea party conservative wing.

Manchin said Reid and McConnell must work out specifics.

The two party leaders met twice in the morning and early afternoon, and they offered their optimistic assessments after their second face-to-face discussion. Boehner also dropped by McConnell’s office to get an update on the talks, his aide confirmed.

Details of proposal fluid

Democratic sources told Bash and CNN’s Deirdre Walsh that the proposal under consideration by Reid and McConnell would fund the government through January 15, allowing it to reopen for at least three months or so.

At the same time, negotiations on a budget for the full fiscal year would have a deadline of some time in December, the sources said.

Meanwhile, the debt ceiling would be increased through February 7 to put off the threat of default for almost four months, according to sources in both parties.

The budget negotiations were expected to address deficit reduction measures and therefore could impact when the debt limit would need to be increased again.

Paul Ryan steps into budget fight

In addition, provisions involving Obama’s signature health care reforms could be included, such as strengthening verification measures for people seeking federal subsidies to help them purchase health insurance required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the sources said.

Another possible change to the health care reforms would delay a fee on employers, unions and other plan sponsors that raise money to compensate insurance companies for taking on high-risk customers in the early years of Obamacare.

CNN political analyst John Avlon said Monday that Democrats wanted to press what they perceive as an advantage over Republicans on how the public is perceiving the latest round of Washington budget and deficit brinkmanship.

“What’s behind it (are) poll numbers that saw Republicans getting their butt kicked because of this whole gamesmanship,” Avlon said.

Mindful that the Thursday debt deadline is days away, House Republican leaders are considering all their options even as Republican and Democratic Senate leaders try to craft a deal on the debt ceiling, said a GOP leadership aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Obama stressed that he is willing to work with lawmakers wherever they can agree, but the tone he struck amounted to a rebuke of Republicans, whom Americans largely blame for pushing the United States to the brink of an economic calamity.

“The American people are completely fed up with Washington,” Obama said in a White House speech attended by many of the aides who worked day and night through the various stages of the latest fiscal stalemate.

Hours after he signed into law a bill hastily cobbled together to end the crisis, Obama said events over the past two weeks had inflicted “completely unnecessary” damage on the U.S. economy.

An increase in borrowing costs caused by the near-debt default was harmful and consumers cut back on spending with hundreds of thousands of government workers suddenly idled, he said.

“There was no economic rationale for all of this,” he said.

Though bruised by the battle, Obama emerged as the clear winner. He immediately sought to use the political capital gained to advance a domestic policy agenda centered around a fresh round of budget talks and an effort to win approval of two stalled items, immigration reform and a farm bill.

He did not mention an urgent challenge facing him now: Repairing the flaws in his signature healthcare law that have prevented many Americans from even signing up for it.

Obama issued an aggressive challenge to Congress, particularly the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, to stop focusing on who wins and loses political battles and get to work with him on issues critical to improving the economy.

LOBBYISTS, BLOGGERS, TALKING HEADS

“All of us need to stop focusing on the lobbyists and the bloggers and the talking heads on radio and the professional activists who profit from conflict and focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do,” he said.

Obama said his opponents should “go out there and win an election” and push to change policies they do not like, but not try to break apart America’s system of governing.

Republicans were not impressed.

“Eventually the president has to realize Republicans won the majority in the House, and he has a shared responsibility to govern,” said Brendan Buck, spokesman for House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner. “If the president continues to refuse to negotiate, or make any real concessions, I don’t know how he expects to get anything done to help the American people.”

A senior Senate Republican aide said: “Where was he during this whole thing? To pop your head up at the end and lecture doesn’t do anything.”

Obama’s refusal to negotiate over the U.S. debt ceiling was credited by his aides as having forced Republicans to accept most of his terms for an agreement.

Even so, the strategy carried the risk of making him appear reluctant to engage his political opponents.

Leon Panetta, who served as Obama’s defense secretary, offered what seemed to be indirect criticism of Obama this week at a reporters’ breakfast hosted by the Wall Street Journal.

“You have to engage in the process. This is a town where it’s not enough to feel you have the right answers. You’ve got to roll up your sleeves and you’ve got to really engage in the process . . . that’s what governing is all about,” the Washington Post quoted Panetta as saying.

The agenda Obama laid out for the rest of the year appeared to presage more partisan fighting. He called for House action on two major items that cleared the Democratic-controlled Senate earlier this year but collapsed in the House: an overhaul of the U.S. immigration system and passage of a $500 billion farm bill.

Obama also renewed his plea for a “balanced approach” to the U.S. budget - language that means he wants to see some sources of new revenue in the budget, such as closing corporate tax loopholes, instead of simply cutting government spending.

House Republicans have ruled out tax increases.

“I understand we will not suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. Democrats and Republicans are far apart on a lot of issues,” Obama said. “And sometimes we’ll be just too far apart to forge an agreement. But that should not hold back our efforts in areas where we do agree.”"

24/7 Wall St.: The White House recently announced President Barack Obama’s support for a Senate bill that would increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. While it remains to be seen whether the bill will make it through Congress, many states are not waiting to take action.

Five states have passed measures to raise the minimum wage this year, according to data published by the National Conference of State Legislators. Only one of these states, California, has passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the states with the highest minimum wages.

Whether or not a higher minimum wage is good for the economy continues to be the subject of debate. The National Employment Law Project (NELP), which advocates raising the minimum wage, maintains that the decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage “has contributed to the growth of income inequality over the past three decades.”

Other groups maintain that raising the minimum wage is bad for business and jobs. The Heritage Foundation notes that if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, the combined costs of wages, employer penalties for not paying health insurance and taxes “would raise the minimum cost of hiring a full-time worker to $12.71 per hour.”

24/7 Wall St. A state’s cost of living may influence its minimum wage. The cost of living in six of the eight states with a minimum wage over $8 an hour is higher than the nationwide cost of living. In Connecticut, where the minimum wage is currently $8.25, the cost of living is the fourth highest in the nation. The cost of living is similarly high in California, Massachusetts and Vermont.

Another factor keeping the minimum wage high in these states likely involves labor representation. Among these eight states, only Nevada is a “right to work state,” meaning workers cannot be required to join a union or pay for a union’s costs as a condition of employment.

Many states where current minimum wages are among the nation’s highest also have high union membership. In Washington, which currently has the nation’s highest minimum wage, 18.5% of workers are union members, fourth highest nationally. Among private sector workers, five of the eight states had among the 10 highest union membership.

Based on information provided by the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the eight states with a minimum wage above $8 per hour. Additional figures on the cost of living in various states are from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC). Data on union membership by state are from the Union Membership and Coverage Database for 2012. Figures on poverty, income and income inequality as of 2012 are from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Unemployment rates are as of October 2013, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

These are the eight states with the highest minimum wages, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"

Riordan', 'Tim Rutten']",A Plan to Avert the Pension Crisis - The New York Times,"In our version of the plan, the program would essentially serve as an insurance agency. It would not bail out distressed local retirement plans. Instead, cities, and perhaps states, would be permitted to sell bonds to cover their pension liabilities, with the federal government guaranteeing repayment. Participants would pay fees — a kind of insurance premium — to finance the program, so there would be no net cost to Washington. The program would give cities access to low-cost, long-term capital. But in exchange for what would amount to federal bond insurance, the cities would have to agree to certain reforms of their pension and health care programs for current and former workers. At a minimum, those reforms should include a single national standard for projecting returns on pension investments — remarkably, there isn’t one — and negotiated reductions in current benefits.

Some will argue that the causes of Detroit’s epic civic failure are unique: white flight on an unprecedented scale, the collapse of auto manufacturing, decades of inept, often corrupt, municipal government. One significant cause of its financial debacle, however, is unfortunately shared by an alarming number of other cities, and that’s the burden of unaffordable pension and retiree health costs.

Detroit’s municipal debt is around $18.2 billion, or more than $26,000 for each of its 700,000 residents. Employee pension and retiree health schemes account for $9.2 billion of the liabilities. Until recently, officials thought the programs were fully financed. Now it appears they are short by at least $3.5 billion. That’s because Detroit consistently overestimated investment returns on its pension funds.

It is not alone in this kind of wishful actuarial accounting. California’s giant state pension fund, the world’s sixth largest, continues to assume it will earn 7.75 percent on its investments, even though its actual returns have been less than half that for a decade. Los Angeles continues to project similar annual yields on its investments, when the actual average returns are closer to 5 percent. As a consequence, the city’s unfunded pension obligations probably will grow to around $15 billion over the next four years.

According to Moody’s, the credit-rating agency, Illinois’s net public-employee pension liabilities now amount to $133 billion, or 241 percent of the state’s total annual revenues; in Connecticut, 190 percent; in New Jersey, 137 percent; and in New York, 17 percent."

“It’s fascinating to me that some of the pushback is coming from, sort of, white suburban moms who — all of a sudden — their child isn’t as brilliant as they thought they were and their school isn’t quite as good as they thought they were, and that’s pretty scary,” Duncan said. “You’ve bet your house and where you live and everything on, ‘My child’s going to be prepared.’ That can be a punch in the gut.”

Overcoming that will require communicating to parents that competition is now global, not local, he said."

As A Reporter', 'She Covered A Range Of Local', 'National Beats']","Bush, Obama focus on standardized testing leads to ‘opt-out’ parent movement","A decade into the school accountability movement, pockets of resistance to standardized testing are sprouting up around the country, with parents and students opting out of the high-stakes tests used to evaluate schools and teachers.

From Seattle, where 600 high school students refused to take a standardized test in January, to Texas, where 86 percent of school districts say the tests are “strangling our public schools,” anti-testing groups argue that bubble exams have proliferated beyond reason, delivering more angst than benefits.

“Over the last couple of years, they’ve turned this one test into the all and everything,” said Cindy Hamilton, a 50-year-old mother of three in Florida who founded Opt Out Orlando in response to the annual Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, which starts again Monday. Her group is one of dozens of new organizations opposed to such testing.

The opt-out movement is nascent but growing, propelled by parents, students and some educators using social media to swap tips on ways to spurn the tests. They argue that the exams cause stress for young children, narrow classroom curricula, and, in the worst scenarios, have led to cheating because of the stakes involved — teacher compensation and job security.

Standardized testing is one of the most controversial aspects of the accountability movement that began in earnest in 2002 when President George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act.

That law required public schools for the first time to test students annually in grades three through eight and once in high school. Schools were required to show steadily improving scores until all students tested proficient in math and reading by 2014, or face escalating sanctions. Civil rights groups, progressives and conservatives united behind the idea that testing would hold schools accountable for educating all students.

“If a test is done right . . . there is no more efficient, less expensive, no simpler way to get a snapshot of whether students are effectively learning,” said Sandy Kress, a Texas lawyer and former Bush aide who has been working on school accountability issues for 25 years and helped write No Child Left Behind.

“It should be a tool to understand where students are, where achievement gaps exist, provide diagnostic information to teachers and parents,” said Kress, who lobbies on behalf of Pearson, the education publisher that writes K-12 tests. “It’s one, objective piece of data that can push and assure quality.”

But too many school districts have gone overboard, he said.

“You’ve got drilling and benchmark testing every six weeks,” Kress said. “Clearly, there’s a lot of overtesting in a lot of places. It’s just awful, and it draws really negative reactions from parents, teachers and communities. Tests weren’t intended to be treated that way.”

Some say the Obama administration has pushed the stakes even higher through its Race to the Top program, which encourages states to use the standardized test scores to evaluate teachers. In some states, as much as half of a teacher’s job evaluation is now determined by student scores on standardized tests.

The resulting pressure is distorting education, anti-testing activists say.

They point to third-graders being coached on handling test anxiety, and 10-year-olds sent home for spring break with test prep materials. And they rail against the time devoted to bubble sheets, which can include weeks of practicing and several days of test-taking.

Noa Rosinplotz, a D.C. public school sixth-grader with a Facebook page dedicated to standardized testing, drew national attention with a firsthand critique of test-taking. She argued that school officials force her and other D.C. students to take a poorly designed test that includes questions that are either unanswerable or contain mistakes.

President Obama, whose policies might have helped fuel the testing explosion, also has suggested that standardized testing has spun out of control.

“What is true, though, is that we have piled on a lot of standardized tests on our kids,” Obama told a town hall at a D.C. middle school in 2011. “Too often what we’ve been doing is using these tests to punish students or to, in some cases, punish schools.”

The opt-out movement is relatively small, but it is hitting a nerve with many parents, said Maria Ferguson of the Center on Education Policy, a nonpartisan think tank associated with George Washington University.

“The sentiment behind it is more common than people realize,” Ferguson said.

Joshua P. Starr, Montgomery County’s school superintendent, has called for a three-year moratorium on federally required standardized testing, arguing that such tests have been the “wrong mechanism” for evaluating school success. Starr has said he is “vehemently” opposed to teacher evaluation mechanisms that “rely too heavily on individual student performance on the current state standardized tests.”

Protesters say they are not opposed to tests that measure learning and flag weaknesses or strengths. But they argue that the tests that have emerged in recent years don’t help individual students.

“It won’t tell me anything about him — we won’t even get the results until next year — but it’ll be used to directly assess his school and teachers,” said Pam Harbin of Pittsburgh, whose 10-year-old son is sitting out the state standardized tests this month. “This is not for the benefit of the student.”

But the tests do have value for school systems, said Linda Lane, the superintendent of Pittsburgh’s public schools.

“It’s one of the ways — not the only way — but one way we measure our progress as a district,” said Lane, who expects about 20 families in her system to opt out of testing. “Certainly, at the classroom level, we believe it’s helpful for teachers to know how students are doing.”

Lane said protesters are overstating the impact of standardized tests.

“People say we’ve narrowed the curriculum, that all we’re teaching is reading and math, and that is absolutely not true,” Lane said.

Critics say at the most extreme, the drive for high scores has led to cheating scandals like those alleged in the District, Philadelphia and Atlanta, where the former superintendent and 34 educators were indicted last month on criminal charges related to test tampering and changing student answer sheets to ensure correct answers.

Teachers in 18 District classrooms at 11 schools cheated on such tests last year, according to a report Friday from the Office of the State Superintendent of Education. The report found test-tampering that included providing students with answers, reading test questions aloud and encouraging students to reread specific questions.

In Sunrise, Fla., talk about the state’s standardized test began when Jared Eckert, now 13, was in kindergarten — even though the test isn’t administered until third grade, said his mother, Roseanne.

Jared is opting out because his family thinks the emphasis on the state exam has warped the classroom experience.

“By the time he was in fifth grade, he was being denied recess and physical education and doing hours of work sheets at night because there was so much pressure for the students to pass,” Roseanne Eckert said.

She is still figuring out how Jared will spend the four days this month when his peers are filling in multiple-choice bubbles on answer sheets. Reading would be a good idea, she said. “Maybe Henry David Thoreau,” she said, referring to the author of “Civil Disobedience.”

Earlier this month, several hundred people protested outside the U.S. Department of Education under the banner “United Opt Out National,” calling for test policy changes.

Because regulations differ from state to state, parents who want to opt out use various methods. In Pennsylvania, for example, parents are citing a state rule that allows opting out of testing based on religious objections. In Florida, parents are relying on regulations that allow for alternative assessments, such as a portfolio of schoolwork or SAT scores. Some school districts and state education departments have tried to discourage test boycotts, leading parents to swap information via Facebook pages and Web sites.

“Opting out is the way to truly, truly get the discussion going,” said Marjie Crist, a lawyer in Mount Lebanon, Pa., who pulled her 8-year-old daughter, Rosemary, from state testing that began last week.

Students opting out of the testing would not face individual ramifications, but if students do so in large groups, the boycotts could affect a specific school’s standing under federal law, which requires 95 percent of each school’s student population to take the tests.

In attaching consequences to standardized exams, policymakers adopted ideas from the corporate world, where success is rewarded and failure is punished. The theory was that students would have incentives to learn, educators would be motivated to teach and academic achievement would improve.

But under No Child Left Behind, a significant number of schools did not see their test scores increase, and the federal government labeled them as “failing.” That led educators and political leaders to complain that the law’s requirements were unrealistic.

Since 2011, the Obama administration issued waivers to exempt 34 states and the District from some of the more onerous requirements of No Child Left Behind.

Still, the testing has continued.

State spending on standardized testing grew from $552 million in 2001 to $1.7 billion in 2012, according to surveys performed by the Pew Center on the States and the Brookings Institution.

When the Pittsburgh Post-

Gazette printed a recent op-ed by Kathy Newman in which she explained why her 9-year-old son, Jacob, is opting out of the state test, she got e-mails from parents asking how to follow suit.

Newman, an associate professor of English at Carnegie Mellon University, said she decided to opt out after catching herself shouting at Jacob, frustrated that he wasn’t concentrating on his test prep materials.

“I don’t want to protect my son from challenges,” Newman said. “But I object to all this pressure for a single test that’s going to decide the fate of his school teacher’s salary.”

In Texas, where 10,000 people rallied in February against education cuts and testing, the House of Representatives passed a bill to reduce the number of standardized tests required before high school graduation from 15 to five.

Kress worries that the backlash against testing will stall the country’s progress in forcing schools to educate all children.

“This is about way more than testing,” Kress said. “The question is whether we’re willing to hold ourselves accountable. The question is whether there are consequences for adults and whether we’re serious about all children meeting standards. This is a test of our culture and whether we’re prepared to see these aspirations to reality. I worry that we’re not going to pass this test.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-push-universal-preschool-proposal-142600889--election.html,,[],Obama pushes universal preschool proposal,"President Barack Obama on Thursday promoted his new proposal to guarantee high quality preschool for every 4-year-old in the United States citing a need to bring low-income and minority children up to speed with higher-income children-- a move he says will translate into an economic boost.

""Every dollar we invest in high quality early education can save more than $7 dollars later on,"" Obama said during a speech at a Community Recreation Center in Decatur, Ga. repeating a line first delivered during his State of the Union address Tuesday night when he unveiled the preschool proposal and other initiatives for the coming year.

The president told his Georgia audience Thursday that children who are not exposed to quality early education aren't prepared for kindergarten. They don't know ""their numbers,"" ""shapes,"" they'll know ""fewer vocabulary words"" and don't have a ""capacity for focus."" ""They're going to be behind that first day,"" he said.

Obama argued that investing in early education will result eventually in a stronger workforce and will boost the economy.

""The size of your paycheck, though, shouldn’t determine your child’s future,"" he said.

The states of Georgia and Oklahoma have instituted universal preschool programs and the president said the same benefits seen in these states will be borne out across the country under his federal proposal.

According to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday morning, Obama's preschool plan would create a new federal-state cost-sharing partnership to guarantee high-quality preschool to all low- and moderate-income 4-year-old children, including families that earn up to 200 percent of the poverty level. The program would be extended to middle-class families who may pay on a sliding scale, and would incentivize full-day kindergarten.

The Department of Education will allocate funds to states based on the number of 4-year-olds in each state who qualify. Standards for preschools will include ""well-trained teachers, who are paid comparably to K-12 staff,"" as well as small class size and a rigorous curriculum.

Preschools will have ""qualified, highly educated teachers,"" Obama said Thursday. ""This is not babysitting.""

White House officials said the new preschool proposal will not replace or destroy the current Head Start early education government program. Instead, a new early Head Start program will be created to support communities affected by the new preschool proposal.

The White House has not released cost estimates for the new preschool plan. The president has said this proposal and others announced in his address would not add to the federal deficit.

The president on Wednesday traveled to Asheville, N.C. to promote his manufacturing initiatives in a speech. On Friday, he is scheduled to deliver remarks in Chicago related to the economy. Senior administration officials say he will also address gun violence during that trip."

It is, however, an extremely cautious proposal, one that doesn’t follow through on its own analysis. After all, if sharp spending cuts are a bad thing in a depressed economy — which they are — then the plan really should be calling for substantial though temporary spending increases. It doesn’t.

But there’s a plan that does: the proposal from the Congressional Progressive Caucus, titled “Back to Work,” which calls for substantial new spending now, temporarily widening the deficit, offset by major deficit reduction later in the next decade, largely though not entirely through higher taxes on the wealthy, corporations and pollution.

I’ve seen some people describe the caucus proposal as a “Ryan plan of the left,” but that’s unfair. There are no Ryan-style magic asterisks, trillion-dollar savings that are assumed to come from unspecified sources; this is an honest proposal. And “Back to Work” rests on solid macroeconomic analysis, not the fantasy “expansionary austerity” economics — the claim that slashing spending in a depressed economy somehow promotes job growth rather than deepening the depression — that Mr. Ryan continues to espouse despite the doctrine’s total failure in Europe.

No, the only thing the progressive caucus and Mr. Ryan share is audacity. And it’s refreshing to see someone break with the usual Washington notion that political “courage” means proposing that we hurt the poor while sparing the rich. No doubt the caucus plan is too audacious to have any chance of becoming law; but the same can be said of the Ryan plan.

So where is this all going? Realistically, we aren’t likely to get a Grand Bargain any time soon. Nonetheless, my sense is that there is some real movement here, and it’s in a direction conservatives won’t like.

As I said, Mr. Ryan’s efforts are finally starting to get the derision they deserve, while progressives seem, at long last, to be finding their voice. Little by little, Washington’s fog of fiscal flimflam seems to be lifting."

The study compiled 2010-2011 state data showing that students of all ages in 261 state school districts were receiving no specialized support to help them acquire English, as required under both state and federal law.

The districts with the largest number of students receiving no aid included Los Angeles Unified with 4,150, Compton Unified with 1,697 and Salinas Union High with 1,618, according to the report by the American Civil Liberties Union of California and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center.

Students who have been designated “English learners” make up one-quarter of all California public school students; 85% are U.S.-born. Continued failure to teach them English — they are among the lowest-performing groups of students — will leave them further behind and jeopardize California’s future, the report said.

“State educational officials are creating a caste system whereby tens of thousands of children — nearly all of whom are U.S. citizens — are denied access to the bond of English language that unites us as Californians,” said Mark Rosenbaum, chief counsel of the ACLU of Southern California.

The two organizations, along with the Los Angeles law firm Latham & Watkins, warned of possible litigation unless the state responds in 30 days with a plan for action. The legal advocates are demanding stronger state monitoring, including investigations of districts that report they provide no services, requirements to create a plan to do so and sanctions if they fail to comply.

But state education officials said that 98% of the state’s 1.4 million English learners were receiving services and that recent court decisions had found that the California Department of Education was fulfilling its legal obligations to monitor help for them.

“Despite the enormous financial strains of recent years, California has made dramatic progress in seeing that all English learners receive appropriate instruction and services,” state education official Karen Cadiero-Kaplan said in a statement. She added that any parents with concerns should contact their school district.

Jessica Price, an ACLU attorney, said some parents opt out of specialized programs for their children but that the law still requires districts to provide aid until the students are no longer classified as English learners. She said some districts simply don’t know how to help the students, while others willfully ignore them — state compliance monitors found that one Northern California district had used state and federal funds for English learners to buy computer monitors and cameras, she said.

One parent, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation by school officials, said she only learned at a district meeting four months ago that her children were entitled to special classes designed for English learners.

She began investigating and learned that her children had never been placed in any of the specialized classes. Neither she nor her children knew they existed, she said.

L.A. Unified’s unserved students represented just 2% of its 194,904 English learners. Six of the 15 districts with the highest percentage of students without services were in the northern counties of Yuba, Siskiyou, Shasta, Butte, Sutter and El Dorado.

William S. Hart Union High School District in Los Angeles County reported it provided no services to 1,142 students, representing 54% of all English learners.

You can watch it here and we'll post live updates throughout.

As you probably already know, compared to previous years, the biggest new element of Obama's budget is that it would cut Social Security benefits through chained CPI. Somewhat bizarrely, the White House is saying the proposal is actually a Republican idea and that the president is just including it as a sign of good faith for ongoing fiscal negotiations. Republicans, however, didn't propose the cut in their budget and have already rejected the president's overall plan.

At the summary level, the president's budget is a dollar-for-dollar replica of his proposal earlier this year to replace the sequester. It even includes the same Social Security cut. So what's new here isn't the proposal, but the fact that it is being formally included in the budget. Republicans, obviously, repeatedly rejected the plan in its former life.

The plan calls for a total of $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction compared to the sequester's $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions. It includes $100 billion in defense spending cuts and $580 billion in revenue increases. It also includes $50 billion in stimulus spending and would fund pre-K education for lower- and middle-income families, paid for by raising tobacco taxes.

President Obama takes the podium.

By the way, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have already ""prejected"" the president's plan earlier this morning.

Deficits are already dropping, says the president, but ""we can do more."" Obama then pivots to criticizing the negative impacts of the sequester spending cuts. He wants ""smarter"" cuts instead.

""We can grow our economy and shrink our deficits ... nothing shrinks deficits faster than a growing economy."" He's right, but the budget doesn't fully reflect that sentiment.

The president pivots from his comments on deficits to talking about supporting investments in education, from pre-K to high school to college.

Calls out members of Congress who voted for spending cuts and are now complaining about them. ""My budget replaces these cuts with smarter ones.""

""Our deficits are already falling. Over the past two years I've signed legislation that will reduce our deficits by $2.5 trillion, more than two-thirds through spending cuts. [...] My budgets will reduce deficits by nearly another $2 trillion. [...] It does so in a balanced and responsible way.""

""If we want to keep Medicare working as well as it has, if we want to keep the ironclad guarantee, then we need to make some changes [...] The reforms I'm suggesting will strengthen Medicare ... by reducing the cost of health care, not by shifting costs to seniors or their families.""

""My budget does also contain the compromise I offered to Boehner"" (aka Chained CPI). The president basically tries to disclaim ownership of the proposal, saying it's a Republican idea, but that he's willing to accept it as part of a comprehensive deal, as long as there are ""protections"" for lower-income seniors. Definitely seemed defensive on that subject.

President Obama has concluded his remarks—nothing we didn't already know, but he did seem defensive on Social Security, which he talked about without explicitly calling it Social Security. He's got a nearly impossible task, trying to explain why he's proposing something that he says he doesn't really want to support but is nonetheless willing to accept."

The Next Generation Science Standards, which were released Tuesday after development by 26 states and several national scientific organizations, recommend that educators for the first time identify climate change as a core concept and stress the relationship between that change and human activity.

“Human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth’s mean surface temperature (global warming),” according to the elementary school standards, which are not federally mandated and will be adopted on a state-by-state basis.

“This is a major undertaking, but one that should result in students with greater ability to reason critically in an increasingly complex world."" — Kelly McGrath, Pearson

The process to implement the new guidelines — the first time in nearly 15 years to change the science K-12 education nationwide — could take years in some cases, but some of the nation’s major education publishers have already taken notice.

Kelly McGrath, a science editor at Pearson, one of the so-called “big three” education publishers alongside McGraw-Hill Education and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, said its materials will need revision to “reflect the depth of coverage” in the new guidelines.

“With the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards, we will need to revise our coverage of climate change and many other science core ideas, to reflect the depth of coverage in the new standards and the shift to focus on scientific practices,” McGrath wrote in an email to FoxNews.com. “In a digital learning environment, we’ll have greater capacity to deliver materials that meet the news standards, and teachers and students will benefit from the personalization capabilities that digital provides.”

For example, one of the new middle school science standards recommends that teacher ask questions to “clarify evidence” of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures throughout the past century.

“In order for students to demonstrate their understanding of this performance expectation, we will need to incorporate new experiences into our curriculum materials,” McGrath’s email continued. “Our materials will need to provide access to multiple examples of the evidence, as well as give students and teacher the support to know how to ask clarifying questions about this topic.”

Teachers will also need support to determine what successful demonstration of that expectation might look like, McGrath said.

“This is a major undertaking, but one that should result in students with greater ability to reason critically in an increasingly complex world,” McGrath’s email concluded.

Officials at McGraw-Hill Education, meanwhile, told FoxNews.com the company will wait to see which states adopt the guidelines before revising their materials.

“At McGraw-Hill Education, we work closely with educators to develop products that meet the needs of our customers,” vice president of product marketing Lisa O’Masta wrote in an email. “One common need of our customers is for materials that align to state or national education standards. Our current science offerings for the K-12 market are tightly aligned to address the existing National Science Education Standards and individual state standards. In the weeks and months ahead, we will be paying close attention to the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards by states across the country. Our development of new products will focus on a deep alignment to the standards that states choose to adopt.”

At Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, materials are currently being reviewed for ""alignment"" with the new standards, according to Leigh Ann Garcia, HMH's director of product management and strategy for grades 6-12 in math and K-12 in science.

“We are currently reviewing HMH programs for their alignment with NGSS and will make the necessary revisions to support NGSS implementation,"" Garcia wrote FoxNews.com.

The new guidelines, which are based on a framework by the National Research Council, were released at a critical juncture, as jobs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are expected to grow by 17 percent from 2008 to 2018, compared to just 9.8 percent for non-STEM jobs. Despite those figures, only 8 percent of college graduates enter the workforce with a STEM degree, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

Frank Niepold, climate education coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Program Office, said the key underlying effort behind the new guidelines is to make students “really deeply understand” key topics like climate change, physical science and biological evolution rather than mere memorization.

“We’re really not getting mastery, that’s the fundamental drive here,” Niepold told FoxNews.com. “And the reality is that this a very positive improvement to the standards, there’s no way around that It’s a very sizeable improvement.”

Asked about potential blowback to standards regarding climate change, Niepold said there was nothing in the 93-page document that wasn’t “well-established” by science. Others, however, said the very presence of climate change instruction in classrooms will create controversy.

Neal McCluskey, associate director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, said climate change is undeniably a “very hard” topic to handle delicately.

“It’s something that’s very hard to strike a balance on,” McCluskey told FoxNews.com. “There’s nothing wrong with talking about climate change in science classrooms, but this opens up the huge possibility that interpretations of climate change or analysis that a lot of people disagree with will still be taught. The degree to which human beings are impacting the climate and how bad that impact may be is controversial.”

Some state Department of Education offices, including those in Pennsylvania and Florida, told FoxNews.com that no meetings have been scheduled in connection to the new standards. In California, the state Board of Education is expected to vote on them in December. In Kansas, it’s believed they’ll be voted upon as early as this summer and educators in Colorado will conduct a “thoughtful and sequenced” review of them following the adoption of new science standards there in 2009. Texas, meanwhile, has indicated they will not adopt the guidelines.

Regardless of if and when they’re adopted, Richard Hull, executive director of the Text and Academic Authors Association, said he welcomed the new guidelines and downplayed the potential impact of politically-divisive topics like climate change and evolution.

“The influence of political and religious views on evaluators and adopters in state education departments should be minimized by these new standards.,” Hull wrote FoxNews.com. “Students who are educated in accordance with them will have a far better chance for success in college courses and in competition on the employment market than those steeped in creationism design, new earth theory, and other alternative accounts.”"

As A Reporter', 'She Covered A Range Of Local', 'National Beats']","Bush, Obama focus on standardized testing leads to ‘opt-out’ parent movement","A decade into the school accountability movement, pockets of resistance to standardized testing are sprouting up around the country, with parents and students opting out of the high-stakes tests used to evaluate schools and teachers.

From Seattle, where 600 high school students refused to take a standardized test in January, to Texas, where 86 percent of school districts say the tests are “strangling our public schools,” anti-testing groups argue that bubble exams have proliferated beyond reason, delivering more angst than benefits.

“Over the last couple of years, they’ve turned this one test into the all and everything,” said Cindy Hamilton, a 50-year-old mother of three in Florida who founded Opt Out Orlando in response to the annual Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, which starts again Monday. Her group is one of dozens of new organizations opposed to such testing.

The opt-out movement is nascent but growing, propelled by parents, students and some educators using social media to swap tips on ways to spurn the tests. They argue that the exams cause stress for young children, narrow classroom curricula, and, in the worst scenarios, have led to cheating because of the stakes involved — teacher compensation and job security.

Standardized testing is one of the most controversial aspects of the accountability movement that began in earnest in 2002 when President George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act.

That law required public schools for the first time to test students annually in grades three through eight and once in high school. Schools were required to show steadily improving scores until all students tested proficient in math and reading by 2014, or face escalating sanctions. Civil rights groups, progressives and conservatives united behind the idea that testing would hold schools accountable for educating all students.

“If a test is done right . . . there is no more efficient, less expensive, no simpler way to get a snapshot of whether students are effectively learning,” said Sandy Kress, a Texas lawyer and former Bush aide who has been working on school accountability issues for 25 years and helped write No Child Left Behind.

“It should be a tool to understand where students are, where achievement gaps exist, provide diagnostic information to teachers and parents,” said Kress, who lobbies on behalf of Pearson, the education publisher that writes K-12 tests. “It’s one, objective piece of data that can push and assure quality.”

But too many school districts have gone overboard, he said.

“You’ve got drilling and benchmark testing every six weeks,” Kress said. “Clearly, there’s a lot of overtesting in a lot of places. It’s just awful, and it draws really negative reactions from parents, teachers and communities. Tests weren’t intended to be treated that way.”

Some say the Obama administration has pushed the stakes even higher through its Race to the Top program, which encourages states to use the standardized test scores to evaluate teachers. In some states, as much as half of a teacher’s job evaluation is now determined by student scores on standardized tests.

The resulting pressure is distorting education, anti-testing activists say.

They point to third-graders being coached on handling test anxiety, and 10-year-olds sent home for spring break with test prep materials. And they rail against the time devoted to bubble sheets, which can include weeks of practicing and several days of test-taking.

Noa Rosinplotz, a D.C. public school sixth-grader with a Facebook page dedicated to standardized testing, drew national attention with a firsthand critique of test-taking. She argued that school officials force her and other D.C. students to take a poorly designed test that includes questions that are either unanswerable or contain mistakes.

President Obama, whose policies might have helped fuel the testing explosion, also has suggested that standardized testing has spun out of control.

“What is true, though, is that we have piled on a lot of standardized tests on our kids,” Obama told a town hall at a D.C. middle school in 2011. “Too often what we’ve been doing is using these tests to punish students or to, in some cases, punish schools.”

The opt-out movement is relatively small, but it is hitting a nerve with many parents, said Maria Ferguson of the Center on Education Policy, a nonpartisan think tank associated with George Washington University.

“The sentiment behind it is more common than people realize,” Ferguson said.

Joshua P. Starr, Montgomery County’s school superintendent, has called for a three-year moratorium on federally required standardized testing, arguing that such tests have been the “wrong mechanism” for evaluating school success. Starr has said he is “vehemently” opposed to teacher evaluation mechanisms that “rely too heavily on individual student performance on the current state standardized tests.”

Protesters say they are not opposed to tests that measure learning and flag weaknesses or strengths. But they argue that the tests that have emerged in recent years don’t help individual students.

“It won’t tell me anything about him — we won’t even get the results until next year — but it’ll be used to directly assess his school and teachers,” said Pam Harbin of Pittsburgh, whose 10-year-old son is sitting out the state standardized tests this month. “This is not for the benefit of the student.”

But the tests do have value for school systems, said Linda Lane, the superintendent of Pittsburgh’s public schools.

“It’s one of the ways — not the only way — but one way we measure our progress as a district,” said Lane, who expects about 20 families in her system to opt out of testing. “Certainly, at the classroom level, we believe it’s helpful for teachers to know how students are doing.”

Lane said protesters are overstating the impact of standardized tests.

“People say we’ve narrowed the curriculum, that all we’re teaching is reading and math, and that is absolutely not true,” Lane said.

Critics say at the most extreme, the drive for high scores has led to cheating scandals like those alleged in the District, Philadelphia and Atlanta, where the former superintendent and 34 educators were indicted last month on criminal charges related to test tampering and changing student answer sheets to ensure correct answers.

Teachers in 18 District classrooms at 11 schools cheated on such tests last year, according to a report Friday from the Office of the State Superintendent of Education. The report found test-tampering that included providing students with answers, reading test questions aloud and encouraging students to reread specific questions.

In Sunrise, Fla., talk about the state’s standardized test began when Jared Eckert, now 13, was in kindergarten — even though the test isn’t administered until third grade, said his mother, Roseanne.

Jared is opting out because his family thinks the emphasis on the state exam has warped the classroom experience.

“By the time he was in fifth grade, he was being denied recess and physical education and doing hours of work sheets at night because there was so much pressure for the students to pass,” Roseanne Eckert said.

She is still figuring out how Jared will spend the four days this month when his peers are filling in multiple-choice bubbles on answer sheets. Reading would be a good idea, she said. “Maybe Henry David Thoreau,” she said, referring to the author of “Civil Disobedience.”

Earlier this month, several hundred people protested outside the U.S. Department of Education under the banner “United Opt Out National,” calling for test policy changes.

Because regulations differ from state to state, parents who want to opt out use various methods. In Pennsylvania, for example, parents are citing a state rule that allows opting out of testing based on religious objections. In Florida, parents are relying on regulations that allow for alternative assessments, such as a portfolio of schoolwork or SAT scores. Some school districts and state education departments have tried to discourage test boycotts, leading parents to swap information via Facebook pages and Web sites.

“Opting out is the way to truly, truly get the discussion going,” said Marjie Crist, a lawyer in Mount Lebanon, Pa., who pulled her 8-year-old daughter, Rosemary, from state testing that began last week.

Students opting out of the testing would not face individual ramifications, but if students do so in large groups, the boycotts could affect a specific school’s standing under federal law, which requires 95 percent of each school’s student population to take the tests.

In attaching consequences to standardized exams, policymakers adopted ideas from the corporate world, where success is rewarded and failure is punished. The theory was that students would have incentives to learn, educators would be motivated to teach and academic achievement would improve.

But under No Child Left Behind, a significant number of schools did not see their test scores increase, and the federal government labeled them as “failing.” That led educators and political leaders to complain that the law’s requirements were unrealistic.

Since 2011, the Obama administration issued waivers to exempt 34 states and the District from some of the more onerous requirements of No Child Left Behind.

Still, the testing has continued.

State spending on standardized testing grew from $552 million in 2001 to $1.7 billion in 2012, according to surveys performed by the Pew Center on the States and the Brookings Institution.

When the Pittsburgh Post-

Gazette printed a recent op-ed by Kathy Newman in which she explained why her 9-year-old son, Jacob, is opting out of the state test, she got e-mails from parents asking how to follow suit.

Newman, an associate professor of English at Carnegie Mellon University, said she decided to opt out after catching herself shouting at Jacob, frustrated that he wasn’t concentrating on his test prep materials.

“I don’t want to protect my son from challenges,” Newman said. “But I object to all this pressure for a single test that’s going to decide the fate of his school teacher’s salary.”

In Texas, where 10,000 people rallied in February against education cuts and testing, the House of Representatives passed a bill to reduce the number of standardized tests required before high school graduation from 15 to five.

Kress worries that the backlash against testing will stall the country’s progress in forcing schools to educate all children.

“This is about way more than testing,” Kress said. “The question is whether we’re willing to hold ourselves accountable. The question is whether there are consequences for adults and whether we’re serious about all children meeting standards. This is a test of our culture and whether we’re prepared to see these aspirations to reality. I worry that we’re not going to pass this test.”"

Tea party groups, along with some skeptical liberals, say the [bipartisan-developed Common Core] standards amount to a federal takeover of education in a country with a long tradition of local control over public schools. Some conservatives have seized on an optional side project that would have made it possible for states to share student records and test results with researchers, education officials and even software developers. Supporters described the voluntary data sharing, funded by private foundations, as a tool to help educators design effective classroom practices. But critics decried it as a Big Brother intrusion — and several states have indicated that they won’t participate.

Basic principles: you cannot work in the tea party on anything, and they are paranoid about everything. Their paranoia is aided and abetted by the national press (yet again) over non-scandals. Lesson learned yet, Washington?

“Now, we’re seeing the arrogance. We’re seeing the cronyism in practice in this second term,” Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin recently asserted, sounding a lot like his vice-presidential candidate self from 2012, when Republicans spent a good deal of time attacking the president as a self-satisfied autocrat who used his power to reward friends and punish enemies. Not everyone in the party, however, is so sure that they can expand their ranks in Congress or improve their standing among voters by personally attacking the president, whose likability ratings stand near 80 percent even if only half of Americans approve of his job performance. And they are cautioning their fellow party members to avoid building their campaigns around the same kinds of messages that have fallen flat before.

Japan, the largest market for U.S. wheat exports, suspended imports from the United States and canceled a major purchase of white wheat on Thursday after the recent discovery of unapproved genetically modified wheat in an 80-acre field in Oregon. How the altered crop made its way to the Oregon field remains a mystery. The strain was developed by Monsanto to make wheat resistant to the company’s own industry-leading weed killer. Monsanto tested the type of altered seed in more than a dozen states, including Oregon, between 1994 and 2005, but it was never approved for commercial use.

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court sidestepped a sweeping decision on the use of race-conscious school admission policies, ruling Monday on the criteria at the University of Texas and whether it violates the equal protection rights of some white applicants.

The justices threw the case back to the lower courts for further review.

The court affirmed the use of race in the admissions process, but made it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity.

The 7-1 decision avoids the larger constitutional issues.

Abigail Noel Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas.

She claims it was because she is white and that she was being treated differently than some less-qualified minority students who were accepted.

In a statement after the ruling Fisher said, “I am grateful to the justices for moving the nation closer to the day when a student’s race isn’t used at all in college admissions.”

The decision comes as the justices work toward wrapping up a busy term.

Among the big issues yet to be resolved: federal enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and the politically blockbuster constitutionality of same-sex marriage.

The Supreme Court plans to meet again on Tuesday to issue additional opinions.

In the Texas case, the school defended its policy of considering race as one of many factors, such as test scores, community service, leadership, and work experience, designed to create a diverse campus.

University encouraged by decision

The university said it was encouraged by the decision.

“We remain committed to assembling a student body at The University of Texas at Austin that provides the educational benefits of diversity on campus while respecting the rights of all students and acting within the constitutional framework established by the court,” said school President Bill Powers.

The Obama administration agreed with the school, saying to grow a nation built on differing complexions and backgrounds will depend on future leaders “who possess the understanding of diversity that is necessary to govern and defend the United States.”

In ruling narrowly, the court reaffirmed earlier decisions allowing for a limited use of race-conscious public policies.

“The attainment of a diverse student body serves values beyond race alone, including enhanced classroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and stereotypes,” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority opinion.

Ex-student challenges university’s affirmative action policy

But Kennedy said that such admissions programs must withstand close review.

Kennedy said the “university must prove that the means chosen” to attain diversity “are narrowly tailored to that goal,” adding that the highest level of legal standard must be met before institutions use diversity programs.

“Strict scrutiny (of the policy) imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classification, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice,” he said.

The Supreme Court in recent decades has established a three-pronged test to balance the government’s interest against a constitutional right or principle, and decide which laws may go too far. These standards of review are rational basis scrutiny, heightened scrutiny, and strict scrutiny.

Kennedy said the appropriate standard was not applied properly by the lower federal courts in the Fisher case.

He said state universities must demonstarte to the courts that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the desired educational and social benefits.

Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, who are more left-leaning, agreed with the Supreme Court’s five conservatives.

Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas also agreed with the limited reach of the ruling, but separately suggested continuing use of diversity programs in the classroom were unconstitutional.

“Although cloaked in good intentions, the university’s racial tinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping,” said Thomas, the court’s only African-American, who himself benefited from affirmative action programs early in his academic and professional career.

Only Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg disagreed with the majority’s conclusion lower courts should take another look at the Fisher case.

“Government actors need not be blind to to the lingering effects of an overtly discriminatory past,” she said. “I have said before and reiterate here that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternative as race unconscious.”

Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case because she apparently had been briefed on the issue as the Obama administration’s solicitor general before joining the high court.

Three questions for Clarence Thomas

Ideological differences

The justices said in 2003 that state universities can, in limited circumstances, tailor their admissions policies to consider an applicant’s race.

And this court was clearly divided along ideological lines during last October’s oral arguments about whether affirmative action essentially has run its social and legal course, and should no longer be used in the way schools like the Texas university has done.

The state of Texas provides for a hybrid admissions policy: Automatic acceptance to its university’s main campus in Austin for in-state students finishing in the top 10 percent of their high schools, ensuring a measure of non-subjective diversity. Three-fourths of the in-state student body get in this way.

Fisher just missed that opportunity, so had to compete in a separate pool of students seeking to attend the highly competitive school. It is that selection process that was before the court.

The school, with 52,000 students, has touted its “holistic” policy of considering race as one of many factors.

African-Americans in Texas as a whole represent about 12 percent of the overall population, but only make up about 5 or 6 percent of University of Texas admissions.

The high court will get another crack at the issue this fall in a separate appeal.

The justices will decide the constitutionality of a voter referendum in Michigan banning race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions. Oral arguments are likely in October.

The case is Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin (11-345).

Cohen'],Group: Northeastern Illinois president retaliated against professor,"""To see that decision reversed at the president's level, in the way it occurred, with very little justification for her decision, was a serious departure from the AAUP guidelines,"" said Rebecca Williams, an English professor at the University of Central Arkansas and a member of the AAUP investigating committee. ""Not that reversals can't happen, but it must be for a compelling reason.""



Hahs' stated reasons for Boyle's rejection were that he did not meet a deadline for filing a plan regarding student advising and that he did not cooperate adequately with colleagues and students. For example, Boyle was accused of steering students to study linguistics instead of Teaching English as a Second Language in his role as a student adviser, according to the AAUP report.



The AAUP said neither reason was credible and instead concluded that the president was retaliating against Boyle for his role in a dispute between faculty in the departments of linguistics and TESL. The dispute, including the decision to split the disciplines into two distinct programs, preceded the no confidence vote against Hahs.



The linguistics faculty members were among those who voted against the president, though Boyle did not participate.



The NEIU administration, in a response to the report, said it would not detail reasons for Boyle's tenure denial because it was ""confidential personnel information."" It said the university ""strongly disagrees with virtually every aspect"" of the report. It also noted that the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board previously ruled that there was no retaliatory action against Boyle.



""The committee proved all-too-ready to interpret the University's commitment to preserving the confidentiality of its personnel decisions as an admission of retaliatory or bad motives on the part of the University or even the Board of Trustees,"" according to the university's response. ""The University takes the strongest possible exception to the committee's highly personalized, misguided attacks.""



Boyle's last day at the university was May 31. He taught courses on grammar, syntax and Native American languages. He lives in Oak Park and is looking for a university job.



""This report is really vindication that I did not do anything wrong,"" Boyle said. ""One of the problems, if you are denied tenure, there is always in the back of everyone's mind, this sliver of doubt that there must have been something. The AAUP report shows there is absolutely nothing that I did wrong.""

Rather than increase the debt ceiling by a few hundred billion dollars, buying them time for further talks on the budget, they have opted to “suspend” the debt ceiling. Its a blatant abdication of their constitutional authority. It’s an ominous sign of the talks to come.

Article 1 of the US Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to borrow money to fund the government. Up until World War I, Congress would approve every bond issuance. The borrowing demands of the war made this impractical, so Congress authorized a “debt ceiling,” where the government could freely borrow up to a statutory limit and then go back to Congress to approve additional borrowing. Think of it as giving your teenager a pre-paid debit card.

With this measure, the government had more flexibility to manage its affairs while preserving the Constitutional principle that Congress controlled the purse strings.

“Suspending” the debt ceiling until May upends this principle. Upon enactment, the government’s borrowing authority would be unlimited until May. Presumably, the government could borrow trillions in this window, providing either the markets or the Fed would meet the new supply of debt.

Worse, however, is that the GOP move establishes a very slippery precedent. The left has been agitating to simply eliminate the idea of a debt ceiling entirely. For all its flaws, the ceiling at least guarantees we will have some debate about government spending. The left finds this annoying. Unfortunately, the GOP plan to “suspend” the ceiling provides at least partial support to this argument. If we can “suspend” it for three months, why not a year? Once you’ve surrendered the constitutional principle behind the ceiling where and how can you draw a line?

Despite their past history of punting on difficult fiscal issues, I was willing to give the House GOP a skeptical benefit of the doubt on their plan for a short-term lift in the ceiling. The deficit debate has three components, ie. debt ceiling, sequestration, and budget expiration, which happen close to each other, but not simultaneously. It made some strategic sense to weave them together into a single debate.

I assumed, however, that this would entail an increase in the debt ceiling of a few hundred billion dollars, to provide the time to negotiate a longer-term deal. I did not anticipate it would feature the House GOP surrendering its constitutional obligations.

When the GOP took control of the House, they vowed that every piece of legislation would contain specific language citing the constitutional authority for the proposed law. It would be interesting to see their interpretation of the constitutional authority to suspend the document.

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: When Republicans were problem-solvers,"We interrupt this highly partisan and ideological moment with some contrarian news: President Obama is not the only politician who thinks that expanding access to pre-kindergarten is a good investment.

In Alabama, Republican Gov. Robert Bentley urged a 60 percent increase in preschool funding in his state, with the goal of having a universal preschool system in place within 10 years. “I truly believe by allowing greater access to a voluntary pre-K education,” Bentley declared this month in his State of the State message, “we will change the lives of children in Alabama.” The state Bentley leads is not a notoriously liberal place.

In Michigan, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder just proposed a large increase in preschool funding — from $109 million this fiscal year to $174 million in 2014 and $239 million in 2015.

Nobody should pretend that the president has found in pre-K education the key that will unlock bipartisanship. Right out of the box, Andrew J. Coulson of the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom told the New York Times that Obama’s plan “just doesn’t make any sense” while Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.), who chairs the House Education and Workforce Committee, sounded a skeptical note in saying the president “needs to explain how this program will be different.”

But by today’s partisan standards, Kline’s comment was remarkably restrained. So it’s worth pausing to wonder if we might be slowly opening an era when Republicans will be feeling a little less pressure to mouth tea-party attacks on government and more incentive to say that they, too, want to solve problems that concern the vast majority of Americans.

In pushing universal pre-K, Obama made a shrewd choice in both political and policy terms. There are enough studies to show that early childhood education programs make a real difference, which is why Republicans such as Snyder and Bentley embrace them. And Obama is structuring his initiative to work with the states to build on what many of them are already doing or would like to do.

This beachhead of cooperation might also serve as a reminder to Republicans that the idea of politics as all-ideology, all-the-time is a relatively recent invention. Education reform was a thoroughly bipartisan cause in the 1980s. Governors such as Democrats Bill Clinton in Arkansas and Richard Riley in South Carolina and Republican Lamar Alexander in Tennessee teamed up to push for higher standards. Alexander, who is now in the Senate, was willing to raise taxes to finance his education initiatives.

There is also the tale of Tommy Thompson, who as governor of Wisconsin in the 1990s tried to broaden health insurance coverage with his “BadgerCare” program. Early in the debate over Obama’s Affordable Care Act, Thompson called it “another important step” toward achieving reform.

Thompson had to eat those words when he sought the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate last year in the face of tea party opposition. The rebuke of Thompson from Chris Chocola, president of the conservative Club for Growth, was representative. “The world has changed since he was elected to office,” said Chocola, who had endorsed one of Thompson’s primary opponents. “Now we’re talking about how much less we’ll spend rather than how much more we’ll spend.” That was right-wing ideology speaking.

Thompson survived the primary but was then defeated by Democrat Tammy Baldwin. While liberals cheered Baldwin’s victory, there was something poignant in Thompson’s losing, in part because he traded in his problem-solving past for a new anti-government disposition that didn’t really fit him.

Despite the abuse of the rules on Chuck Hagel’s confirmation, you sense that Republicans such as Thompson and Alexander (there are many others) are exasperated with the view that the only point of seeking public office is to shrink government. But it will take considerable courage for such Republicans to move their party back to a time when conservatives and progressives did not have to disagree on everything — when causes such as helping 4-year-olds to learn and thrive could encourage politicians to lay down their arms at least momentarily.

There are other issues that ought to be like this: training and education programs to restore mobility and ease inequalities; immigration reform; and at least parts of Obama’s agenda to curb gun violence. But progress will require conservatives to give up certain recent habits and remember when they, too, believed that government could successfully remedy some of the nation’s ills.

""Since Darwin's groundbreaking theory of evolution by natural selection, scientists all around the world have found monumental amounts of evidence in favor of the theory, now treated as scientific fact by 99.9% of all scientists,"" the document's author, A.J. of Vienna, Va., wrote. ""However, even after 150 years after the establishment of evolution, some schools across the U.S. are ""teaching the controversy,"" including creationism and intelligent design. Both of these so-called ""theories"" have no basis in scientific fact, and have absolutely zero evidence pointing towards these conjectures. These types of loopholes in our education are partially to blame for our dangerously low student performances in math and science.""

The solution, A.J. concluded, is for Obama to seek a federal ban on teachings that contradict evolution.

The Christian Post interviewed Ken Ham, founder and president of the creationist organization Answers in Genesis, about the matter. Ham noted that executive action on such an issue would be unusual, considering school curriculums are typically determined at the local level by elected board members.

The Supreme Court already ruled in 1987 that the teaching of creationism was unconstitutional in public schools, as it violated the separation of church and state. The White House petition doesn't differentiate between public and private school curriculums, however, meaning that perhaps the poster would like to see such teachings removed from private schools as well.

And while religious teachings have no place in public school science classrooms according to current federal statutes, not all states are following that line intently. A school district in Ohio attracted controversy last month when it considered a proposal that would allow its schools to discuss controversial topics, including creationism, in its classrooms.

In Louisiana, state lawmakers have repeatedly refused to close the door on creationism by keeping a law on the books that allows certain ""supplemental"" materials to be used in the classroom. Critics say the law essentially allows teachers to teach religious alternatives to evolution without oversight.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) has been more direct in his support for religious teachings, going so far as to say earlier this year that he was fine with public schools providing students with learning materials about creationism or intelligent design and letting children make up their own minds about whether those theories trumped evolution.

The petition had more than 7,000 signatures as of Wednesday morning. It will need to meet a threshold of 100,000 signatures in order to warrant a response from the White House."
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-18/news/ct-met-sign-language-20100416_1_american-sign-language-silent-dinners-foreign-language,2010-04-18 00:00:00,"['Angie Leventis Lourgos', 'Tribune Reporter']",Is American Sign Language a ‘foreign’ language?,"Twenty students are holding several animated small-group discussions, but no one in this Northern Illinois University classroom utters a word.

Their fingers weave in complex patterns as they converse in American Sign Language, which the university has declared an official foreign language.

To the students, the new label is fitting: They say that American Sign Language is distinct from spoken English and that its coursework provides a new perspective akin to the cultural immersion they'd experience in French, Spanish or other traditional language classes.

""It shapes how you view the world around you,"" said Christine Theobold, a sophomore from Streamwood who is taking the most advanced sign class at NIU. ""I guess it's how you view the word ‘foreign.'""

But the practice of awarding foreign language credit for American Sign Language coursework has been fiercely debated at universities across the country. Some educators argue an indigenous language by definition can't be considered foreign. Others say a language must have literature for proper study.

The University of Michigan-Flint several years ago denied a student's request of foreign language credit for American Sign Language proficiency, but the school reversed its stance in the past year after about 14 months of debate. Students at Boston University are now able to apply American Sign Language credits in this manner, but for years some school officials were against the practice because they said it lacked the same elements of culture as other foreign language courses.

""It's not a foreign language,"" said Robert Belka, a former chair of the foreign language department at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah. Belka, who is now retired, long opposed requests for American Sign to count as a foreign language, though he said the university eventually acquiesced.

""These are people … dependent on the English language,"" he said. American Sign Language ""is not sufficient to sustain a culture.""

Silent dinners

The Pizza Hut at NIU is loud during dinnertime, but one table of two dozen students is conspicuously quiet. The patrons don't speak. They order by pointing at the menu.

This is a ""silent dinner,"" one of many extracurricular events American Sign Language students attend for additional practice. Their instructor Sara Bianco, who is deaf, said these events give students a taste of deaf culture.

Kelsey Borg, a sophomore from Maple Park, is in the beginning American Sign Language class and described her first silent dinner as a bit nerve-racking. Signing felt different in public and she became lost when more advanced students had intricate conversations, she said.

NIU has offered American Sign Language since the 1970s as part of its rehabilitation counseling program, mainly for students in that program. But lately more students from other disciplines have asked to enroll because the skill is marketable in fields like teaching and health care.

This semester, 155 students there are taking American Sign Language, about three times the enrollment in spring 2005.

Vice Provost Gip Seaver said reclassifying the discipline as a foreign language wasn't controversial at NIU, in part because it has been accepted at so many other universities.

The Illinois General Assembly in 2009 passed legislation declaring American Sign Language a fully developed language and encouraged schools to accept its coursework for foreign language credit.

Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign allowed this long before the legislation was passed.

Eastern Illinois University accepts it as long as course work includes a cultural component, said Stephen Canfield, chairman of the foreign language department there.

He notes that many foreign language departments across the country are altering their names to ""world languages"" or ""classical and modern languages.""

""The whole idea of language being foreign is kind of disappearing,"" he said.

Structure differences

""APPEAR tooth = PAIN ++BAD DENTIST GO NEED""

This is written in gloss, a transcription of American Sign Language, and essentially means, ""It seems I have a toothache; I need to go to a dentist.""

While the sentence seems convoluted to most people who can hear, it makes sense to Joe Lellman, an NIU senior from Buffalo Grove. He uses the sentence to show how different American Sign Language grammar is compared with spoken English.

Lellman is considered legally deaf, but with a hearing aid, he can hear about two-thirds as well as the average hearing person. He was taught in a deaf school until third grade, when he entered regular public school. Though he continues to think in American Sign Language, he lost many of his signing skills and is now relearning much of the language at NIU — and embracing a part of himself that was lost.

American Sign Language is the fourth-most studied language other than English at colleges across the country, according to a 2006 Modern Language Association study.

At least 150 postsecondary schools offer it for foreign language credit, said Sherman Wilcox, chair of the department of linguistics at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. He said it's no less a foreign language than Navajo, which is also indigenous to the United States. He adds that most languages around the world, including many African languages, lack a written component.

Timothy Reagan, an education professor at Central Connecticut State University, said American Sign Language has a rich tradition of poetry, history and culture that shouldn't be dismissed.

""One of the worst things you can do to a human being is to say, ‘Your language doesn't count,'"" he said.

The allegations, first reported in The Times, surround the recruitment of Andrew Basham, a former defensive lineman at Lynnwood High in Washington, who signed a letter of intent with the Huskies in February but did not qualify academically to enroll.

Compliance officials from USC and Washington and possibly the NCAA are scheduled to meet Friday in Seattle with Mike Davis, who alleged that Tosh Lupoi, Washington’s defensive line coach, gave him $3,000 to cover private tutoring for Basham through a test preparation company. Davis also alleged that he received $1,500 from Lupoi to reimburse Basham’s father for online classes Andrew could use to raise his grade-point average.

Lupoi has denied violating NCAA rules in the recruitment of Basham.

USC Athletic Director Pat Haden was part of a working group that developed the NCAA’s four-tier penalty structure and head coach responsibilities that became effective Oct. 30, 2012.

The bylaws state that a head coach is presumed to be responsible for violations occurring within his program, unless the head coach can prove that he has promoted an atmosphere of compliance and monitored his staff. The penalties can include suspensions. Because the penalty structure is new and has yet to be testedwith a similar case, it is unclear how the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions would deal with a coach’s new school.

John Infante, a former compliance director at Loyola Marymount and Colorado State, said Thursday that if the allegations in this case were proved true, Sarkisian would need to show, “that he did enough in terms of promoting an atmosphere of compliance and that he monitored his program so that he should not be held responsible.”

Sarkisian is not coaching USC in the Las Vegas Bowl, but he attended the Trojans’ practice at a Las Vegas high school. Sarkisian reiterated to reporters that he “did everything to promote a compliant atmosphere” at Washington and would do the same at USC.

Asked if he was concerned that he could be penalized if the allegations regarding Lupoi were found to be true, Sarkisian said, “I don’t know if concerned is the right word. I know what I did on a daily basis and I know the environment that I promoted there every single day that I went to work there.

“If and or when … the NCAA wants to talk to me, I’ll feel confident in my ability to show, factually, the ability that I exhibited to promote that atmosphere. So I don’t know if concerned is the right word. But I will be prepared.”

Lupoi, who is part of a Washington staff preparing for the Dec. 27 Fight Hunger Bowl, posted a message to his Twitter feed Thursday that included the passage: “I won’t let these sorts of untrue attacks break my focus! I look forward to an honest & thorough investigation.”

Simon Foundation and director of the Manhattan Institute’s Center for the American University. Naomi Schaefer Riley is the author of “The Faculty Lounges: And Other Reasons Why You Won’t Get the College Education You Paid For.”

This fall, Georgetown University announced the creation of a new school of public policy , thanks to a gift of $100 million from an alumnus. And in October, the University of New Hampshire announced that it would use a $20 million gift to launch a public policy school of its own.

It is easy to understand the impulse behind such actions. “It’s an awfully frustrating time in the world,” David Ellwood, dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, told us. “There are large and challenging problems, including climate change, demography, budget problems, terrorism, extremism and partisanship.” At public policy schools, he explains, “we think it’s our job to fix these things.” The faculty and students, Ellwood says, “are united by the principle of making the world a better place.”

But are policy schools making a dent in Ellwood’s long and varied list of problems? The Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration already lists some 285 such institutions in the United States, and new ones are opening up — but the field as a whole seems to be having an identity crisis. The schools’ curricula and missions have become at once too broad and too academic, too focused on national and global issues at the expense of local and state-level ones. It’s not clear that the schools are preparing their graduates to fix all that needs fixing.

“Policy schools used to be much more about how to translate ideas into solutions to public problems,” says Anne-Marie Slaughter, former dean of Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and now president of the New America Foundation. Scholars at policy schools “do extremely important work,” she asserts, but often, “that’s not work that policymakers read.”

The basic premise behind a school of policy derives from the modern idea of constitution-making — that wisely crafted laws can shape the character and conduct of citizens. Philosopher David Hume articulated this view in his 1742 essay, “That Politics May Be Reduced to a Science,” arguing that while sound administration is crucial in a monarchy, the structure of the constitution and laws is more important in republican systems, where individual freedoms and public good come together. James Madison and other American founders became early practitioners of Hume’s science of politics.

In the 20th century, political science moved from the design of constitutions to the crafting of policies by neutral experts. Progressive leaders such as John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson and Louis Brandeis argued that modern industrial society had grown too complex for the common citizen or the average elected official. It required a new class of public servants to adjudicate conflicts between business and labor and to serve on boards and commissions regulating corporate activity in the public interest.

Some of the first public policy schools were founded in the 1930s in response to the creation of New Deal government agencies. The virtue of these schools is that “they trained many people who went into government and did good things,” says John DiIulio, who runs the Fox Leadership Program at the University of Pennsylvania and was the first director of President George W. Bush’s White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. “They wired the house of American bureaucracy.”

Sizable government initiatives in the postwar era created more demand for such institutions, which became “an expression of the Progressive idea that bigger government was better government,” DiIulio explains. For example, he says, “no one had ever built an interstate highway system before,” and no one knew how to make the federal government work with state and local governments and for-profit contractors to make it happen. Enter public policy schools.

The mission of these institutions began to change in the 1970s, when the Ford Foundation issued multimillion-dollar grants to eight universities, including Yale, Duke and the University of Michigan. According to Graham Allison, writing in 2006 in the Oxford Handbook of Public Policy, the new cadre of students needed to be versed in not only “budgetary cost and efficacy” but also “social equity, civil rights, and quality of life.” People who were concerned with intragovernmental relations and American federalism began to seem “old and crusty,” DiIulio says. Now the goals of these schools were to dream up ways to “make the world a better place.”

Lofty goals have often produced research and teaching that is further and further removed from the day-to-day operations of government. While the field is so disparate that “it’s hard to talk about public policy schools as a whole,” Slaughter cautions, she and other school leaders identify certain trends, including a renewed zeal for quantitative analysis. When Georgetown President John J. DeGioia announced his university’s new policy school, he explained that “the availability of massive data to provide new analytic tools have resulted in an invaluable opportunity for our university.” The new emphasis on big data is reminiscent of the Progressive idea that if we just gather enough information, the policy conclusions will be obvious to all.

James Wilburn, dean of Pepperdine University’s School of Public Policy, worries that too often, “what gets studied depends on whether there is an available database.” He accuses economists at policy schools of being “more interested in their models than in the people” whom public policy will affect.

Many schools have begun to look like a mishmash of the academic departments from which their faculty members hail — such as political science, economics and sociology. But those people may have no more or less interest than colleagues from their home departments in shaping actual policy. Of course, many of these schools draw at least some faculty members from politicians who have lost elections or wonks whose parties are out of power in Washington. But such celebrity instructors are short-timers and do little to draw the academic faculty — which dominate the schools — out of their bubbles.

There is also a certain grandiosity that characterizes the missions of these institutions. With the exception of certain schools such as the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, most schools are concerned more with national and international policy than with local and state matters. Many of the places that do focus on the latter, DiIulio says, “are not among the more prestigious.”

It is not that the better-known schools never do local projects. Ellwood told us how Kennedy School students helped the mayor of Somerville, Mass., remake his city’s finances with “performance-based budgeting” — measuring how much snow gets plowed, for example, not how many snowplows are used. Ellwood offered this as an example of how policy schools have to focus on “management as much as big, bold, creative solutions.”

But one wonders how many Kennedy School graduates aspire to solve Somerville’s fiscal problems as opposed to, say, climate change and terrorism? Only 6 percent of the school’s 2012 graduates went into local, regional or state-level government jobs.

To understand how much the trajectories of policy school alums have changed, one need only take note of a lawsuit against Princeton by the Robertson family. In 1961, the heirs to the A&P fortune gave $35 million to the university specifically for the purpose of training people to go into government service through the Woodrow Wilson School. Forty years later, they found that the school was instead training people to go into a lot of other fields — from nonprofits to Wall Street. (After a six-year legal battle, an agreement was struck whereby Princeton retained control of the endowment, which had grown to $900 million , but would pay out $50 million to create a new foundation aimed at preparing students for government service.)

Of course, public-private partnerships are ubiquitous now; public policy isn’t shaped solely by government staffers but by various sectors and players as well, and it makes sense that graduates’ ambitions would reflect that. Indeed, Slaughter says that if she were starting a policy school today, it would offer only joint degrees, so that students could develop expertise in the various arenas they might encounter in the years ahead. But training people to be competent in multiple sectors only makes the job of policy schools even more diffuse.

So, what should these schools be doing in terms of training and research? DiIulio suggests that maybe it’s time for them to return to their roots, teaching students to focus on implementing policy and making the government we have work better. “These seem like technical, boring matters, [but] someone has to get under the hood,” DiIulio says. For instance, he adds with a laugh, “How do you build an IT system for a new federally financed system of health care?”

Henry Brady, the dean at the University of California at Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy, told us in an e-mail that his school has been “quite successful with a real impact on bringing tough-minded economic and analytical methods into government and bringing evidence based research into the formulation of regulations and the appraisal of programs (although politicians often ignore the research).”

That last caveat may prove the most important. Slaughter notes that the research coming out of public policy schools is “less and less accessible to the lay reader. The jargon has become more and more specialized.” She says she “doesn’t know anyone in government who would read the academic journals that policy school professors get rewarded for publishing in,” and while the “need for translation [for lay readers] is ever greater, the rewards for translation in the academy are ever smaller.” Indeed, she says, “in many departments you will be less valued by your colleagues because you’re no longer doing ‘cutting edge’ research.”

If policymakers ignore policy school research or can’t understand it, what can policy professors and graduates possibly accomplish?

Arthur Brooks, formerly a professor of business and government at Syracuse’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs and now president of the American Enterprise Institute, says that students coming out of policy programs are “no match for the trillions of dollars in unfunded mandates and liabilities,” not to mention the “power of the unions and the bureaucracies.” Public policy schools “could produce 10,000 graduates a year,” he adds, “and it wouldn’t hold a candle to the power of those interests.” Asking whether public policy grads have made a dent in the budget crisis “is like sending 75 Jesuits to China and complaining that the country isn’t Christian.” Brooks says, “At Maxwell, we were just trying to train graduates to be good in whatever careers they had.”

It’s probably true that experts are no match for organized interests, from public-sector unions to corporations, in which case the Progressive idea was bound to fail. Unfortunately, though, it’s not clear that the policy schools ever fought these battles — or that they are equipped to do so now.

The opinions expressed are his own.

Reuters invited leaders in education to reply to Steven Brill’s op-ed on the school reform deniers. Below is Biddle’s reply. Here are responses from Joel Klein, Randi Weingarten, Diane Ravitch and others.



The vitriol over Steven Brill’s piece this week from Randi Weingarten, Diane Ravitch, Alex Kotlowitz and other defenders of the status quo isn’t surprising. After all, they are especially good at ignoring reality – especially when it comes to the role of the nation’s education crisis in fostering poverty in a knowledge-based economy in which what you know is more important than what you can do with your hands. And they are particularly willing to ignore the reality that school reform – including making sure that all kids are taught by high-quality teachers – is the long-term solution for saving 1.2 million children a year from poverty and prison.

One of the biggest reasons why America’s economic malaise may last for decades is because high school dropouts among the nation’s long term unemployed are essentially shut out of the jobs market. Fifteen percent of American high school dropouts age 25 and older were unemployed on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s nearly double the rate for high school graduates with some amount of college education and three times higher than that of collegians with bachelor’s degrees. The problem is even worse with the new generation of dropouts who have fewer prospects for employment; nearly a third of dropouts age 16-to-24 are out of work on a not seasonally-adjusted basis. These young men and women can’t get into high-paying white-collar jobs, or even get into apprenticeships for blue-collar jobs such as welding, which can provide them with middle-class incomes.

It is simple: The better-educated a person is — and the more education they get, the more likely they will avoid economic and social despair. The average African-American with some form of education will earn at least $9,142 more in annual income than a high school dropout. The higher levels of income not only benefit people and their families. The rewards flow into the communities in which they live, with higher levels of home ownership, entrepreneurial activities, and civic activities that lead to high quality of life that benefits everyone.

High-quality education and good-to-great teachers can’t alleviate economic poverty for the short term. But it does help young men and women get the knowledge they need to avoid poverty in adulthood. Education, unlike food stamps, equals empowerment. For our kids, for whom schools are at the centers of their worlds and communities, high-quality teachers and strong principals can help foster shelters from the storms around them.

This isn’t fiction. I can easily point to the example of my grandma, the daughter of menial workers who were barely literate, who struggled with reading until she was nurtured by her fourth-grade teacher. Thanks to that teacher, my grandma became the first person in our family attend college – and paved the way for my mother and I to achieve things she could only dream about. There are also numerous studies, including the famed Coleman Report, which concluded that if teaching is of high-quality, schooling will be a bigger factor than socioeconomic background.

The problem is that while we have many high quality teachers working in our classrooms, we also have far too many who are not capable of helping any of our children – especially those from poor and minority households – succeed. Thanks to the practices Weingarten, Ravitch and their fellow-travelers defend – including near-lifetime employment granted by tenure, which can be easily granted within three years in all but a few states –just 2.1 percent of teachers are ever dismissed. This isn’t just the fault of teachers’ unions alone. Our nation’s schools of education also do an abysmal job of recruiting and training teaching candidates. Just 13 percent of 77 education schools surveyed three years ago by the National Council on Teacher Quality had high quality math instruction programs. And far too many school districts are doing a poor job of supporting good-to-great teachers, while letting their poor-performing colleagues stay on the job. But Weingarten, Ravitch, Kotlowitz and their supporters have opposed the very reforms that would address all of these issues – and thus, are willing to let poor kids remain mired in poverty.

This isn’t to say that Weingarten, Ravitch, and others don’t care about children. Not at all. What I am saying – and what Brill is alluding to – is the reality that they and other education traditionalists defend a failed, amoral vision of American public education that has condemned far too many young men and women, especially poor black, white and Latino children that look just like me, to poverty and prison."

“It’s fascinating to me that some of the pushback is coming from, sort of, white suburban moms who — all of a sudden — their child isn’t as brilliant as they thought they were and their school isn’t quite as good as they thought they were, and that’s pretty scary,” Duncan said. “You’ve bet your house and where you live and everything on, ‘My child’s going to be prepared.’ That can be a punch in the gut.”

Overcoming that will require communicating to parents that competition is now global, not local, he said."
http://news.yahoo.com/ward-churchill-finally-aces-075033160.html,,[],Ward Churchill is finally all out of aces,"You remember Ward Churchill — he’s the former University of Colorado ethnic studies professor who claimed that the United States deserved the September 11, 2001 attacks because of “ongoing genocidal American imperialism.”

Well, he’s been fighting a losing battle to get his job back ever since he was eventually fired for (unrelated) plagiarism and fabricated research.

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court rejected Churchill’s appeal without comment.

Officials at the University of Colorado and David Lane, Churchill’s attorney, both told the Daily Camera that the Supreme Court’s decision effectively exhausts Churchill’s legal options.

In a joint statement, CU President Bruce Benson and Boulder campus Chancellor Phil DiStefano said that the Supreme Court upheld a “unanimous line of rulings from the Colorado courts.”

“This decision is a victory for the thousands of men and women on our faculty who live up to that obligation and for the students who benefit from their professionalism,” the administrators wrote.

Lane was substantially less effusive.

“It’s disappointing from the perspective that the First Amendment has suffered as a result of this,” the attorney told the Daily Camera. “I am sorry that the regents have been given the green light to violate the Constitution any time they feel a need.”

Intriguingly, Lane also mentioned that the former ethnic studies professor has found work lecturing in Atlanta, but provided no further details.

Churchill faced national criticism after an obscure 2001 essay called “On the Justice of Roosting Chickens” found its way into the national mainstream. In the inflammatory essay, Churchill described the people who worked in the World Trade Center as a “technocratic corps” of “little Eichmanns.” (The a reference is to Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi who played a big role in organizing the Holocaust.)

Story continues

Administrators at CU-Boulder, where Churchill taught, concluded that Churchill’s essay was protected under the First Amendment, and so the school would have to keep the tenured professor employed.

However, it was all downhill from there for Churchill’s career. In 2007, CU found a reason to fire him: allegations of academic fraud and plagiarism in other writings unrelated to the provocative “little Eichmanns” essay.

Churchill won a free-speech lawsuit against CU-Boulder in 2009, as the Daily Camera notes. It wasn’t much of a win, though. The jury awarded him a single, solitary dollar in damages and the judge refused to reinstate him as a professor.

Colorado’s state supreme court denied Churchill’s appeal in September 2012.

Except Education.,"When I saw the headline I was excited. As someone who inherited her challenge to authority from her father at a very young age, I wanted to cheer him on. Damn the man! Fight the system! But the system he has a problem with, isn't the teacher's fault. See.... our rebel with a cause is in Texas. That's right, y'all, that Rick Perry lovin' state that has cut its public education budget to bits and pieces so while the number of students in public schools in Texas have exploded, costs haven't kept up.

In elementary school they teach you this nifty thing called ""cause and effect."" What's it look like when you live in a state where the cost per pupil gets cut? Well, you get a dive in graduation rates for one. Hey 42nd in the nation isn't too bad, everyone will always be better than Mississippi!

This is the day to day representation of No Child Left Behind and ""teaching a test."" This is what happens when you tie someone's job to a performance by a student. Work packets that teach the test. Not to think. Not to learn. Not creativity and engagement, but memorize the information. Rinse and repeat. At the same time, they've been in fierce arguments over curriculum standards where the religious right wants to demand that science teach religion and the earth is only a few thousand years old. But at the end of the school day, the fault doesn't lie only with Rick Perry's bad governing, or even local school boards run amuck. It's part of a much greater problem we have in the United States called governmental preeminence discombobulation. In south speak we'd say ""y'all, ain't right.""

This is a photo of President Barack Obama sitting at a Bar-B-Q joint in Austin, Texas after a speech he gave on Thursday to a crowd at Manor New Technology High School. See those folks sitting with him? That one woman... is Caroline Sweet an educator talking to the President about Charter Schools - photo by White House Photog Pete Souza and meme'd by Education Austin.

Our entire education system is so messed up and the President is just compounding the problem. At Manor New Technology High School the President said (these are excerpts of his speech):



""Every young person in America deserves a world-class education. We've got an obligation to give it to them. And, by the way, that helps the whole economy. Every business in America we want to draw from the world's highest-skilled and most educated workforce. We can make that happen. But we're going to have to put our shoulder against the wheel and work a little harder than we're doing right now as a nation. ""We've also got to start rethinking and redesigning America's high schools. That's part of what's happening here is there's innovation going on that equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. There's a lot of hands-on learning here. People aren't just sitting at a desk reading all the time."" ""And finally, we know that even with better high schools, if you want a good job and work your way into the middle class, most young people are going to need some higher education. Unfortunately, in recent years, college costs have skyrocketed and that's left too many students and their families saddled with a mountain of debt. So we've worked to make college more affordable for millions of students already and families through tax credits, grants; more access to student loans that go farther than before. We've reformed the student loan process by putting students ahead of big banks, providing options to make it easier for young people to repay these loans. ""

""Enacted largest reform of student aid in 40 years"" - Right so you basically didn't make education cheaper you just took over taking my payments. Cost didn't change, accessibility didn't change... just who I write my check to did. Ok. Check. ""Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010"" - Here's the description. The Affordable Care Act. So basically you won't have medical debt and student loan debt at the same time. Doesn't stop Philly from closing 47 schools or 50 in Chicago. Or college more affordable or create more jobs for new graduates or pay interns for their work. But, you don't have to file for bankruptcy at 23 if you're in a car wreck. ""Established President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability to assist in financial education for all Americans."" - Was Google down in the office or something? You gotta have a ""council"" to figure out about how much it sucks to try and pay for school? What's next a blue ribbon commission on how school doesn't prepare you for life? ""Increased funding for land-grant college."" - Which is awesome because that funding was about to get cut by their states who would rather give tax cuts. So did it really go up? Or just did we just shift responsibility to the federal budget? ""Provided means for students struggling to make college loan payments to refinance."" Sorry Timmy, you still own $120,000 for that Art History degree, but now we can refinance it so suicide doesn't look quite as appealing as it once did. ""Expanded Pell Grants for low-income students."" - Cost of college has increased 1120% in the last 30 years are these Pell Grants even keeping up needs? #JustSayin. Look, this is good, it really does help, but it's a band-aid on a blown off leg ten years too late. There is an entire generation of young people who needed help then and who are working more than full time and can't pay their bills. I work with some, I use to live with one. What can be done for those who graduated between 2000 and 2010.

Here's my question: What legislation has the White House come out in supportive of or actively lobbied for since 2009 that would achieve this rhetorical bloviation? Well... let's use ObamaAchievements.org under education:

Rhetoric is all well and good, but let's talk about the reality. The President has no power to control the budget for Texas high schools or state funding to higher education to decrease contributions required by students and/or their families. The only bills that can make it better come with a dead president's pictures on them. You gotta show me the money. Instead.... all we do is what Caroline Sweet pointed out. We create the Two Americas where if you can kick in some extra money for a charter school you have a fancier education even if it doesn't result in better test scores. Maybe that charter school can afford to pay a college prep person who can help students apply for the coveted public/private partnership so the 1% can bless us with their trickle down scholarships. Even Senator Elizabeth Warren's bill, which is awesome and wonderful and hey she's from my home state, really only seeks to reduce the interest rate on student loan payments, because she knows she's powerless to reduce the high cost of education or lack of education funding. What she's doing, is realistically all she can do, and bless her for it, but we need Elizabeth Warren's in state houses across America.

So, Mr. President, can we cut the BS and talk about truly reforming education? No. Actually, we can't. Because that reality would cost this country more than we're willing to spend and there is no way we'd ever get the 113th Congress to agree to prioritize young people over tanks and missiles defense contractors. So.... we give speeches and we talk about how we want to have high standards and don't want to pay for it, and then we blame the teacher and the student for complaining. We publicly humiliate educators who could make more working less at Starbucks and we punish the student who sees tests for what they are.

So what do we do? I actually think closing the school district in Michigan was a good idea. The students walking out in protest in Philly is a better one. I think regardless of which of these options is preferred we as students, teachers, parents, community allies we just stand up and walk out. We say stop. Until elected officials develop the political will to create lasting and meaningful education reform that works and prioritizes learning and not just facts and figures and ""sit down and shut up"" I think we stop school. Time for some tough love. Walk out of your class rooms and straight into state houses across the country and say no more."

Pollak'],Media Ignore Obama's Catholic School Gaffe in Ireland,"The mainstream media in the United States have ignored comments made by President Barack Obama during his a speech in Northern Ireland this week in which he described religious education as a source of conflict.

The president’s comments have sparked widespread controversy and criticism in the Irish media, as well as in Catholic media in the U.S., but the mainstream media have ignored Obama’s contentious remarks.

Obama, who attended an elite private high school, told an audience in Belfast on Monday [emphasis added]:

Because issues like segregated schools and housing, lack of jobs and opportunity — symbols of history that are a source of pride for some and pain for others — these are not tangential to peace; they’re essential to it. If towns remain divided — if Catholics have their schools and buildings, and Protestants have theirs — if we can’t see ourselves in one another, if fear or resentment are allowed to harden, that encourages division. It discourages cooperation.

Catholic media have interpreted the remarks as an attack on religious education itself, and Catholic education in particular. The mainstream media, which seized on every remark made by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney during his 2012 international trip as a near-disqualifying “gaffe,” have been entirely silent.

While gaffes are usually defined as extemporaneous, off-the-cuff errors or poorly judged statements, Obama’s remarks were planned in advance. The “gaffe” in Obama’s Belfast remarks lies in the fact that Obama did not consider the sensitivities of his audience–or that he inadvertently revealed his own anti-religious prejudice.

To travel to a city troubled by conflict, and to then insult the members of at least one of the two communities, is not only a gaffe, but a serious diplomatic error.

Unless, of course, the speaker is President Barack Obama."

(CNN) - It started with one, then two, and the next thing you know, it was a flash mob.

Students at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University surprised former President George H.W. Bush with a ""Bush-whack Boogie"" flash mob during Bush's first visit to the school since his recent hospitalization.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""We as students, we always try to find some sort of way to honor him to thank him for everything he's done for us,"" Carly Hilley, one of the student organizers of the ""Bushwhack Boogie,"" told Soledad O'Brien on Thursday on CNN's ""Starting Point.""

Hilley said they came up with the idea to do a flash mob as a tribute to the former president last fall and began practicing about a month and a half ago.

Bush was visiting the school that bears his name on March 1 when country duo Brooks & Dunn's song ""Boot Scootin' Boogie"" started playing. A young man yells, ""Yeehaaaww,"" and starts line dancing in front of Bush. Soon others join in.

The 88-year-old Bush sat on his red mobility scooter looking a bit bewildered at first, but soon the confused look turned into a smile. Barbara Bush pulled out her iPhone and started recording the dance.

""That's a flash mob, Grandpa,"" Jenna Bush Hager can be heard telling her grandfather at the end of the performance.

""Of all the flash mobs I have ever seen this was the best,"" NBC reported Bush saying to his granddaughter, a correspondent for the ""Today"" show.

Bush Hager says to him, ""The best?""

Bush says, ""Yes, the very best.""

Bush Hager asks, ""Was this the only one you've seen?""

It was also the only flash mob Bush had ever seen.

The Bushes enjoyed the tribute so much that they stayed an extra 30 minutes to shake hands with the students.

Bush was recently discharged from a hospital in Houston where he spent several weeks receiving treatment for bronchitis, a bacterial infection and a persistent cough.

While in the hospital, Bush cheered on the Texas A&M and the Houston Texans football teams to victories and enjoyed a special performance by the Oak Ridge Boys via telephone. His exchanges with doctors and nurses included singing, spokesman Jim McGrath said."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/29/next-generation-science-standards_n_3672418.html,2013-07-29 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],Next Generation Science Standards In Kentucky Draw Hostility From Religious Groups,"Supporters and opponents of the Next Generation Science Standards sparred during hearings in Kentucky last week, as critics took issue with the standards’ teaching of evolution and climate change.

The new standards were developed with input from officials in 26 states –- including Kentucky –- and are part of an effort to make science curricula more uniform across the country. While supporters feel the standards will help beat back scientific ignorance, some religious groups take issue because the standards treat evolution as fact and talk about the human role in climate change.

The Kentucky Board of Education adopted the standards in June and held hearings to get public feedback on the standards last week before they were presented to the state legislature for official approval.

Matt Singleton, a Baptist minister, is one of the opponents who spoke to the board about why the standards should not be adopted, according to The Courier-Journal. “Outsiders are telling public school families that we must follow the rich man’s elitist religion of evolution, that we no longer have what the Kentucky Constitution says is the right to worship almighty God,” Singleton said. “Instead, this fascist method teaches that our children are the property of the state.”

Another opponent, Dena Stewart-Gore, suggested that the standards will make religious students feel ostracized. “The way socialism works is it takes anybody that doesn’t fit the mold and discards them,” she said, per the The Courier-Journal. “We are even talking genocide and murder here, folks.”

Supporters of the standards contended that opponents’ fears are unfounded and that the standards’ curriculum is based on evidence.

A handful of states including Kansas, Maryland and Vermont have already adopted the Next Generation Science Standards. The Kentucky Board of Education will be accepting written testimonies regarding the standards until July 31."

The new chair of the House of Representatives science committee has drafted a bill that, in effect, would replace peer review at the National Science Foundation (NSF) with a set of funding criteria chosen by Congress. For good measure, it would also set in motion a process to determine whether the same criteria should be adopted by every other federal science agency. The legislation, being worked up by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX), represents the latest—and bluntest—attack on NSF by congressional Republicans seeking to halt what they believe is frivolous and wasteful research being funded in the social sciences. Last month, Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) successfully attached language to a 2013 spending bill that prohibits NSF from funding any political science research for the rest of the fiscal year unless its director certifies that it pertains to economic development or national security. Smith's draft bill, called the ""High Quality Research Act,"" would apply similar language to NSF's entire research portfolio across all the disciplines that it supports.

Researchers know that human activities including fossil fuel use, agriculture and land use have been the dominant causes of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past 250 years. In addition, aerosols and land surface changes are also altering the Earth's climate, making it extremely likely1 that human activities have had a net warming effect since 17502. These human-caused changes to the climate system, and their consequences, provide much of the impetus for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) climate change research. Researchers funded by NSF have discovered signs of a changing climate in nearly every corner of the globe, from the icy expanses of Earth's polar regions to its equatorial ecosystems. Our planet's climate affects--and is affected by--the sky, land, ice, sea, life and the people found on it. To piece together the entire puzzle of climate change--what we know, what we still have to learn and what humankind can do to prepare for the future--we must study all of the physical, natural and human systems that contribute to and interact with Earth's climate system. As researchers piece together the climate puzzle, they are revolutionizing the way we understand the Earth system as a whole. Researchers have realized that they must reach across disciplinary boundaries to study questions that extend beyond any one field of science or engineering. In fact, because of the complexity of Earth's climate, this research involves contributions from nearly every field of science, math and engineering.

Republicans finally are doing something about the increasing conflict between science and their own political ideologies and beliefs. They're trying to stop such science from happening. As explained by Jeffrey Mervis of Science Magazine:Of course, the Republicans claim it's about cutting waste and duplicative research, and ensuring that the funded science has value. Because it's not scientists who would know what scientific research has value, it's Congress. Which is an interesting position for Republicans to take, given their supposed antipathy to government. Or maybe that antipathy is limited to government regulating the Republicans' corporate owners. But here's one clear area where Congressional Republicans might consider scientific research of little value:

The science proving human-caused climate change is overwhelming. Republicans overwhelmingly ignore and deny what the science proves. So, with scientific reality so consistently demonstrating a liberal bias, the Republicans are trying to legislate that science away."
http://news.yahoo.com/school-districts-quit-healthier-lunch-program-170113831.html,,[],Some school districts quit healthier lunch program,"After just one year, some schools around the country are dropping out of the healthier new federal lunch program, complaining that so many students turned up their noses at meals packed with whole grains, fruits and vegetables that the cafeterias were losing money.

Federal officials say they don't have exact numbers but have seen isolated reports of schools cutting ties with the $11 billion National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools for meals served and gives them access to lower-priced food.

Districts that rejected the program say the reimbursement was not enough to offset losses from students who began avoiding the lunch line and bringing food from home or, in some cases, going hungry.

""Some of the stuff we had to offer, they wouldn't eat,"" said Catlin, Ill., Superintendent Gary Lewis, whose district saw a 10 to 12 percent drop in lunch sales, translating to $30,000 lost under the program last year.

""So you sit there and watch the kids, and you know they're hungry at the end of the day, and that led to some behavior and some lack of attentiveness.""

In upstate New York, a few districts have quit the program, including the Schenectady-area Burnt Hills Ballston Lake system, whose five lunchrooms ended the year $100,000 in the red.

Near Albany, Voorheesville Superintendent Teresa Thayer Snyder said her district lost $30,000 in the first three months. The program didn't even make it through the school year after students repeatedly complained about the small portions and apples and pears went from the tray to the trash untouched.

Districts that leave the program are free to develop their own guidelines. Voorheesville's chef began serving such dishes as salad topped with flank steak and crumbled cheese, pasta with chicken and mushrooms, and a panini with chicken, red peppers and cheese.

In Catlin, soups and fish sticks will return to the menu this year, and the hamburger lunch will come with yogurt and a banana — not one or the other, like last year.

Story continues

Nationally, about 31 million students participated in the guidelines that took effect last fall under the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.

Dr. Janey Thornton, deputy undersecretary for USDA's Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, which oversees the program, said she is aware of reports of districts quitting but is still optimistic about the program's long-term prospects.

""The vast majority of schools across the country are meeting the updated meal standards successfully, which is so important to help all our nation's children lead healthier lives,"" Thornton said.

""Many of these children have never seen or tasted some of the fruits and vegetables that are being served before, and it takes a while to adapt and learn,"" she said.

The agency had not determined how many districts have dropped out, Thornton said, cautioning that ""the numbers that have threatened to drop and the ones that actually have dropped are quite different.""

The School Nutrition Association found that 1 percent of 521 district nutrition directors surveyed over the summer planned to drop out of the program in the 2013-14 school year and about 3 percent were considering the move.

Not every district can afford to quit. The National School Lunch Program provides cash reimbursements for each meal served: about $2.50 to $3 for free and reduced-priced meals and about 30 cents for full-price meals. That takes the option of quitting off the table for schools with large numbers of poor youngsters.

The new guidelines set limits on calories and salt, phase in more whole grains and require that fruit and vegetables be served daily. A typical elementary school meal under the program consisted of whole-wheat cheese pizza, baked sweet potato fries, grape tomatoes with low-fat ranch dip, applesauce and 1 percent milk.

In December, the Agriculture Department, responding to complaints that kids weren't getting enough to eat, relaxed the 2-ounce-per-day limit on grains and meats while keeping the calorie limits.

At Wallace County High in Sharon Springs, Kan., football player Callahan Grund said the revision helped, but he and his friends still weren't thrilled by the calorie limits (750-850 for high school) when they had hours of calorie-burning practice after school. The idea of dropping the program has come up at board meetings, but the district is sticking with it for now.

""A lot of kids were resorting to going over to the convenience store across the block from school and kids were buying junk food,"" the 17-year-old said. ""It was kind of ironic that we're downsizing the amount of food to cut down on obesity but kids are going and getting junk food to fill that hunger.""

To make the point, Grund and his schoolmates starred last year in a music video parody of the pop hit ""We Are Young."" Instead, they sang, ""We Are Hungry.""

It was funny, but Grund's mother, Chrysanne Grund, said her anxiety was not.

""I was quite literally panicked about how we would get enough food in these kids during the day,"" she said, ""so we resorted to packing lunches most days."""

Henderson will shutter 15 schools, affecting more than 2,400 students and more than 540 employees. Closing half-empty schools will allow her to use resources more efficiently, she said, redirecting dollars from administration and maintenance to teaching and learning.

The move is another benchmark in the fundamental remaking of public education in the District, where the school system has lost more than 100,000 students since its peak enrollment in the 1960s.

City leaders have been faced with underenrollment for years, but the situation has become more pronounced with the rapid growth of charter schools since the mid-1990s. Funded with taxpayer dollars but operated independently of the school system, charters now enroll more than 40 percent of the city’s students, putting Washington at the leading edge of a national movement toward charters.

“We can’t ignore the fact that we as a city have embraced school choice,” Henderson told D.C. Council members during a briefing Thursday. “If we proliferate charter schools, we have to know that is going to have an impact.”

View Graphic Fifteen schools in the District will close within the next two school years.

Five years ago, then-Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee accelerated the downsizing of the D.C. school system when she moved quickly to close 23 schools, igniting angry protest and long-lasting political backlash while spurring an exodus of students to the city’s charters.

Henderson’s proposed closures also triggered opposition, but she is widely seen to have handled community relations more deftly than her predecessor, sponsoring a series of public meetings throughout the city and inviting parents and activists to help refine the closure plan.

That feedback persuaded the chancellor to remove five schools from her original closure list, including Garrison Elementary and Francis-Stevens Education Campus, two Northwest Washington schools in relatively affluent neighborhoods. Parents at both schools mounted vigorous campaigns against closure.

Henderson cited parents’ willingness to help recruit new students and demographic data showing that Northwest neighborhoods, particularly around Garrison, are growing faster than officials previously understood. Francis-Stevens will fill its extra space by serving as a second campus for the School Without Walls, a selective high school nearby.

Faced with criticism that she hadn’t given equal consideration to parental concerns and ideas emerging from less-privileged parts of the city, Henderson said that many of the proposals she received included requests for extra investments of millions of dollars.

“Lots of folks came up with plans. Some we were able to move with, others we were not able to,” Henderson said. “Leadership is about making hard decisions.”

Smothers Elementary in Northeast also will stay open, as will Malcolm X Elementary in Southeast, which will be operated in partnership with a “high-performing charter school” that Henderson declined to identify. Southeast’s Johnson Middle School will stay open because school officials say they think that moving the students to other schools filled with teenagers from rival neighborhoods could cause safety concerns.

All 15 schools marked for closure are east of Rock Creek Park, many of them east of the Anacostia River in some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods, and all had below-average test scores. They include the first high school to close in recent memory — Spingarn Senior High in Northeast — and Kenilworth Elementary, in the middle of a neighborhood that last month won a $25 million grant to strengthen local education and other services.

Thirteen of the schools will close at the end of this academic year, with the remaining two — Sharpe Health and Mamie D. Lee, schools for students with disabilities — to close in 2014.

On Thursday, Henderson for the first time offered an estimate of money to be saved through the closures: $19.5 million in staffing costs. Approximately $11 million will be needed for transition costs, Henderson said, resulting in a net savings of $8.5 million.

The last round of closures, in 2008, cost millions more than initially reported, according to an audit released in August. Henderson said the school system is more confident in its savings estimates now.

The savings will be plowed back into schools to improve programming, including into libraries and arts and foreign language offerings, Henderson said, adding that the public will get a detailed view when school-by-school budgets are released in the coming months.

About 140 staff positions will be lost, but given normal attrition through resignations and retirements, Henderson said, “we actually feel like the loss will be minimal.” She said she does not expect any teacher evaluated “effective” to be out of a job.

The chancellor said she does not anticipate releasing any buildings from the D.C. Public Schools inventory. She said she needs to keep control of the facilities so they can be reopened as enrollment rebounds.

That news was maddening for charter school advocates, who often struggle to find suitable and affordable D.C. real estate. City law requires that surplus public school buildings be made available to charter schools.

“The mayor is making a mistake,” said Robert Cane, executive director of the pro-charter Friends of Choice in Urban Schools. “What we have here, it’s about defending DCPS from the popularity of the charter schools, and it has nothing to do with getting more kids into quality schools. Nothing.”

Henderson said her staff has plans for reusing some buildings, such as Spingarn, which will become a vocational education campus focused on transportation careers. But officials are still working on plans for many of the buildings.

The prospect of closures triggered intense debate in recent months about the future of the city school system, including at community meetings and two D.C. Council hearings that together lasted more than 14 hours.

Some parents, activists and politicians worry that shutting the schools will drive families into the city’s charter schools, which could lead to declining enrollment and further closures in the traditional school system. After the 2008 closures, thousands of children left the system for charter schools, according to a study by three think tanks.

The school system now enrolls about 46,000 students in 123 schools.

“We cannot repeat what happened with the last closures,” said D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). “DCPS has got to be much more aggressive than it was three years ago in retaining students and recruiting students.”

D.C. Council members will have a chance to quiz Henderson about her school closure plan Wednesday at the first hearing of the newly constituted education committee, which is led by David A. Catania (I-At Large).

Across the city Thursday afternoon, schools that had been slated to close cleaved into two groups: those that were spared, and those were not.

“My kids like this school, and I don’t want to see them start over,” said Raheem Bates, 24, the father of two Kenilworth students.

A few miles away, Shannon Smith prepared for a protest at the chancellor’s home. Her two grandchildren attend Ferebee-Hope Elementary, which will close over the objections of parents and staff. “I don’t know why they would want to close this school,” said Smith, who called the move “ridiculous.”

But across town at Garrison, relieved parents hugged each other and high-fived their kids. Kierra McPherson, 23 wiped away tears as she picked up her preschool son. McPherson graduated from Garrison, as did her mother and cousin.

“It’s a tradition,” McPherson said. “This is my school. We got our school back.”

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama on Tuesday unveiled a $100 million initiative to unlock the “enormous mystery” of the human brain in hopes of boosting the understanding and treatment of brain disorders.

“What if computers could respond to our thoughts? Or language barriers could come tumbling down? Or if millions of Americans were suddenly finding new jobs in these fields – jobs we haven’t even dreamt up yet because we chose to invest in this project? That is the future we are imagining. That is what we are hoping for,” the president said in an event in the East Room of the White House.

The initiative, dubbed Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, or BRAIN, “aims to help researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury,” the White House said in a release issued in advance of the event.

“There is this enormous mystery waiting to be unlocked,” Obama said, “and the BRAIN Initiative will change that by giving scientists the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action and better understand how we think and how we learn and how we remember. And that knowledge could be – will be – transformative.”

Mapping the brain: Top brain scientist is ‘philosopher at heart’

Obama said he will seek the $100 million funding in the budget he sends to Congress next week. In an environment where both parties are seeking significant spending cuts, the expenditure faces an uncertain reception.

In his remarks, Obama said the funding would be in line with a promise he made earlier this year to increase levels of research.

In his State of the Union address in February, he said, “If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas,” and alluded to scientists “mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s.”

The money to study the brain would support research by the National Institutes of Health, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Science Foundation.

The research would involve both federal research agencies and private partners.

A major goal is to reveal “how individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact at the speed of thought,” the White House said.

Brain map seeks to unlock mysteries of the mind

“Our ultimate objective is a deep understanding of the human brain and its understanding,” said Arati Prabhakar, director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, in a conference call with reporters.

In the same call, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said that “advances in tech which are coming along very quickly make it possible to take a look at what’s happening in the brain,” and the research “leads us to believe we can accomplish something very dramatic.”

The hope is that these new technologies will lead to insights into how the brain processes information and how it is linked to behavior.

“We aim through this ambitious project to try to unravel these mysteries,” Collins said."

The goals of the program reflect the first lady’s own life and will immerse her more directly in her husband’s policies.

“I’m here today because I want you to know that my story can be your story,” Mrs. Obama is to tell students at Bell Multicultural High School in Washington on Tuesday, according to an advance text of her remarks. “The details might be a little different, but so many of the challenges and triumphs will be just the same.”

The first lady will add that whether students want to be doctors, teachers, mechanics or software designers, “you have got to do whatever it takes to continue your education after high school — whether that’s going to a community college, or getting a technical certificate, or completing a training opportunity, or heading off to a four-year college.”

Aides in Mrs. Obama’s office said she would visit other schools around the country and use social media to appeal to students, conveying the message that higher education is a door to a wider world. Mrs. Obama, the daughter of a pump worker at the City of Chicago Waterworks, graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School."

The book, “Barack Obama,” was published by Lerner Publishing in 2010 as part of their series “History Maker Bios.” All presidents going back to Richard Nixon -- except George W. Bush -- were the subjects of similar biographies published by Lerner, which did not respond to questions from FoxNews.com.

Critics also say the new Obama book is biased, pointing to a passage that reads, “but some people said Americans weren’t ready for that much change. Sure Barack was a nice fellow, they said. But white voters would never vote for a black president.”

[pullquote]

Kyle Olson, founder of the conservative Education Action Group Foundation and EAGnews.org, said that is a problem.

“I have no problem with kids learning about Barack Obama ... he’s the President of the United States,"" said Olson. ""However, the book teaches fourth graders that white voters didn’t want to vote for black men.”

Asked whether the sentence could also be interpreted as simply noting that some people said that white voters would be racist, he agreed but said such nuance could easily be lost on fourth-graders.

Another passage of the book discusses Obama’s youthful identity crisis and drug use, which Obama himself wrote about in his own biography. One passage reads, “When Barry looked in the mirror, he saw a young black man. But he didn't know how to be black. And no one was there to teach him. He decided to act like the black characters he saw on TV. He started acting tough. He cursed. Was that what it meant to be black? As he got older, he started smoking and drinking. Was that what it meant to be black?""

Some parents also found the content of the book problematic.

“The content of this book should be found objectionable by everyone in the country. America is a melting pot - it's not made up of hyphenated Americans (African-American for example) separated by those who like to foment discord,” Oklahoma mother of five Jenni White told FoxNews.com.

Olson also took issue with book’s general tone.

“I’m not saying fourth-graders shouldn’t know about drugs – I think what I find troubling about books like these is they’re kind of like the Oliver Stone version of history, where kids are not getting an accurate picture of his background and his policies – it’s generating a mythical character of the man,” Olson said.

Much of the book is publicly viewable on Google Books. The author, Jane Sutcliffe, did not respond to a request for comment.

Olson added that depictions of Republican presidents, by the same publisher, have had different tones.

“The George H. W. Bush book had lines about how wealthy he was, how many maids he had, all of those sorts of things,” Olson said.

Specifically, the book about the elder President Bush reads in one part:

“The Bushes had money for a cook, two maids, a chauffeur (driver), and private schools,” it reads on page 8."

Marco Rubio gave a short speech on Thursday’s first day of the Conservative Political Action Conference, avoiding the sensitive topic of immigration reform and instead emphasized his pro-life stance, traditional marriage and his belief that many Americans can no longer attain the American Dream.

Education was a main focal point of the speech. Rubio urged the friendly CPAC crowd to focus on the concerns of middle class and blue-collar Americans, saying that vocational career pathways are both admirable and necessary.

“We should encourage career education,” Rubio said, presenting the idea during his speech as something of an aside. “Not everyone has to go to a four-year liberal arts college. We still need plumbers. We still need carpenters.”

Rubio suggested that there three million unfilled jobs in the United States because Americans don’t have the skills to do those jobs.

“Why aren’t we graduating more kids not just with a high school diploma but with an industry certification and a career — a real middle class career?” he also asked.

The first-term senator focused considerably on the $1 trillion student-debt crisis, noting that American college graduates in massive numbers are failing to find jobs that match their costly degrees — or pay enough so that recent grads can pay back their student loans.

Rubio warned the crowd about the rising number of young Americans who are unable to pay their student-loan debt.

“It is the next big bubble in America,” he predicted. “I know something about it. I graduated with over $100,000 in student loans.”

Jerry Brown has placed a renewed focus on the state’s struggling community colleges, the world’s largest system of two-year schools that are often overshadowed by the University of California and Cal State systems.

The governor’s recommendations are aimed at keeping community colleges affordable, keeping classes accessible and moving students faster through the system to allow them to graduate or transfer to a four-year university at higher rates. Brown’s spending plan must clear the Legislature, and some college officials have vowed to oppose — or at least try to modify — some portions.

These proposals are among the most significant policy shifts in years and could reshape many campus operations.

FULL COVERAGE: California’s community colleges in crisis

“It’s a courageous plan,” said Eloy Oakley, president of Long Beach City College. “The governor is focusing on policy issues we’ve been talking about for many years but dancing around the margins. A lot of this has been on the table in statehouses throughout the nation, but we’re addressing these issues in California in a meaningful way.”

Community colleges play a vital role in California’s higher education system, training large segments of the state’s workforce. But the 112-college system has strained under the pressure of huge funding cuts and increased demand. Thousands of courses have been slashed and enrollment has been shrunk by more 500,000 students in recent years.

Most of the schools’ 2.4-million students are unprepared for college-level work: 85% need remedial English, 73% need remedial math and only about a third of remedial students transfer to a four-year school or graduate with a community college associate’s degree.

Education leaders praised the governor’s efforts to follow through on his commitment to voters to restore education funding through the passage of Proposition 30, the school tax initiative —- even while expressing misgivings about aspects of the plan. The budget includes nearly $200 million in additional funding for the colleges.

“It’s wonderful to have an environment where we’re going to have some provocative conversations about policy,” said community colleges Chancellor Brice Harris. “We’re not going to shy away and [we] actually look forward to the discussion.”

State officials said the plan is meant to build on changes proposed last year by a statewide task force charged with improving the colleges. Measures approved by the Legislature and Board of Governors establish registration priorities, including preventing students from repeating courses to improve their grades and allowing students who participate in orientation and academic assessment programs and have 100 units or less to enroll in classes first. Students also would have to maintain satisfactory grades to continue to qualify for fee waivers.

Brown goes further toward moving students through the system. He is seeking to limit the number of credits students can accumulate. Beginning next fall, he suggests a cap on state-subsidized classes at 90 units, requiring students who exceed that to pay the full cost of instruction, about $190 per semester unit versus $46 per unit. In the 2009-10 academic year, nearly 120,000 students had earned 90 units or more.

Students said they are particularly concerned that the unit cap is punitive for those who have a double major, who may be returning to college to train for a new job or who want to explore their interests before deciding on a field of study.

“We’re going to work very hard to get rid of this,” said Rich Copenhagen, a College of Alameda student who is president of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges. “The governor does seem to be interested in pushing through a lot of policy in this budget. He’s in a position to say I got you more money, now you need to make your system better.”

Perhaps one of the more controversial elements of Brown’s plan is to change the funding formula for community colleges to pay schools for students who complete courses. Funding is now based on the number of students enrolled at the third or fourth week of the term.

The goal, said state officials, is to provide incentives for colleges to improve.

Brown’s performance-based plan would be phased in over several years, and savings would be reinvested in support services.

Advertisement

The task force considered and rejected a similar funding plan.

Harris and others were cautious about many of Brown’s proposals. Performance-based funding might encourage colleges to cut courses that are difficult to complete and cause students to switch to less demanding classes. He argued that enrollment priorities suggested by the task force — he served on the panel as chancellor of the Los Rios Community College District — would accomplish the same goals.

The new funding formula also might be an incentive to keep students in classes they are not suited for, said Michelle Pilati, president of the Academic Senate for California Community Colleges. She cautioned that the limit on units could create a two-tiered system of those who can afford to pay and continue their education and those who can’t.

“I think he’s putting policies on the table we really need to look at and think about,” said Pilati, who teaches psychology at Rio Hondo College in Whittier. “As with so many things, the devil is in the details.”

The governor also urged UC, Cal State and community college systems to find ways to provide more online classes. The budget provides nearly $17 million to increase those classes for the two-year schools. Brown is proposing a “virtual campus” with 250 new courses available to students statewide that would be transferrable to all colleges. Currently, about 27% of students take at least one course online each year.

System-wide technology, for example, would allow Long Beach City College to expand its online offerings — only about 5% of Long Beach students now take online classes — while keeping down costs, Oakley said.

In a new approach to speeding students’ time in school, the governor would allow those with knowledge of a subject to receive course credit by taking a special exam rather than attending classes. The credits would be transferrable to Cal State or UC.

The emphasis on college completion has drawbacks, said some education leaders, and tends to ignore the realities of the typical community college student: They are older and have jobs and families and many attend part time.

“It’s probably closing the door and becoming a little more privileged, benefiting students who can go full time,” said John S. Levin, executive director of the California Community College Collaborative at UC Riverside.

The governor is also looking to shift some programs from the lower education system to community colleges. For example, the budget provides $315.7 million to shift adult education and apprenticeship programs from K-12, with funding directed to vocational education, English as a Second Language and citizenship classes. Students would be required to pay the full cost of instruction for other adult education courses.

Harris said he expected lively negotiations with the governor and legislators.

“This is about fine-tuning what we think is a great budget,” the chancellor said. “We’re not going to restore all the access we lost, but it is a modest investment in our future.”

Technology veterans including Zuckerberg, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Dropbox co-founder Drew Houston will be on hand to advise them, and Fwd.us, Zuckerberg’s lobbying group, has pledged to get the projects up and running.

Zuckerberg organized his first hackathon in his Harvard dorm room, and Facebook employees routinely pull all-nighters to build new products and features. Now Fwd.us is borrowing the concept to press for a comprehensive overhaul of the nation’s immigration policies.

Among the young immigrants who will code for 24 hours straight is 24-year-old Justino Mora from Los Angeles.

Mora’s group plans to build a mobile app that will tell people who their representatives are in Washington, where those representatives stand on immigration reform and ways in which people can take action, either by signing a petition or sending a message to their representatives.

Mora said he is excited to meet Zuckerberg and the other technology leaders.

“They have an amazing record in the tech sector. They know what works,” he said. “We have a different type of experience. We come from communities that are dealing with a broken immigration system. The combination will come up with very powerful tools that are going to change the discussion on immigration.”

The hackathon comes as Fwd.us tries to refocus attention on the issue of immigration reform, which has stalled in Washington. Zuckerberg’s group wants to change U.S. immigration policy and loosen restrictions on visas for skilled workers such as engineers and scientists.

“We hope that momentum coming from our hackathon — and the technology it creates — can help move immigration reform forward,” Fwd.us President Joe Green said in a blog post announcing the hackathon.

Zuckerberg visited Capitol Hill in September to press members of Congress in private meetings to support an immigration overhaul. The legislation has bogged down in the GOP-led House of Representatives months after the Senate passed a bill that eventually would grant citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants.

Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed piece in the Washington Post in April that he was inspired to launch Fwd.us after teaching a class on entrepreneurship in an after-school program.

“These students are smart and hardworking, and they should be part of our future,” Zuckerberg wrote.

Mora crossed the U.S. border illegally from Mexico with his mother, brother and sister when he was 11, fleeing poverty and physical abuse from his father.

He worked his way through high school and graduated with nearly a 3.9 grade-point average. He was a captain of the cross-country and track-and-field teams and a youth group leader with his local Catholic church.

Mora said he was thrilled to get acceptance letters from his “dream” colleges, only to realize that because he was undocumented he was not eligible for financial aid. He attended community college instead.

He became involved as a political activist for immigrant rights, including the California Dream Act, which gives undocumented students state-funded scholarships.

Last year he received authorization to live and work in the United States as part of the reprieves granted by the Obama administration to young people who were brought to the U.S. by their parents. Mora went to the White House along with eight other immigrants in May to tell his story in person to President Obama and Vice President Biden.

Mora said he had never seen a computer before he came to the U.S. In community college, he took his first computer science class.

Now he builds websites and he is pursuing a double major in computer science and political science at UCLA. He says one day he wants to open his own business that would put technology in the hands of advocacy organizations.

“What motivated me was what my mom taught us: that education is the key to success and to a better life, and that education allows people not only to improve their own skills but also stand up for one’s rights and to advocate for the rights of the community,” Mora said.

25 states now require students to pass exam to earn high school diploma

Alabama%2C Arizona%2C Georgia%2C Nevada have made moves to phase out those exams

Florida%2C Iowa%2C Minnesota%2C Mississippi%2C Texas also looking at the issue

GREENVILLE, S.C. — South Carolina Rep. Phil Owens says a story he heard from one of his constituents convinced him it was time to do away with the state's requirement that students pass an exit exam to earn their high school diploma.

The man had three sons, all close in age and approaching graduation from high school. One of the brothers had a learning disability in math. He had been unable to pass the math portion of the exit exam after three attempts, even though he had passed all his classes.

""He was devastated by the fact that his brothers would continue on to tech school or to college, and he wouldn't, simply because of this test,"" the Easley Republican said.

Owens, a Republican, found that several states have already had dropped their exit exam or are in the process of doing so, and introduced a bill that would scrap the requirement.

Some of the 25 states that now require students to pass an exit exam to graduate are looking to replace them with tests that yield better information about students' aptitude for college or jobs, but without requiring a specific grade to earn a diploma.

Among the exit exam policy changes taking place in the states:

• The Nevada legislature passed a bill this year that will phase out its exit exam and replace it with end-of-course tests and college entrance exams that are aligned with the Common Core State Standards that have been adopted in 45 states, according to Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a Las Vegas Democrat.

• Arizona passed a bill that did away with its exit exam and other national tests and calls for the state Board of Education to develop another test that will better measure critical thinking skills, according to state Rep. Doris Goodale, a Phoenix Republican.

• Alabama is phasing out its exit exam and using tests developed by ACT that measure students' readiness for college or work, according to state Department of Education spokeswoman Malissa Valdes-Hubert.

• Georgia eliminated an outdated exit exam and is replacing it with end-of-course tests, according to Department of Education spokesman Matt Cardoza.

Legislatures also have been dealing with the exit exam issue this year in Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas, according to Julie Bell, director of the National Conference of State Legislature's education program.

Valdes-Hubert said the Alabama High School Graduation Exam that the state had been using wasn't correlated to any of the tests students were being given in earlier grades.

The new system will give educators a continuum of information about individual students' performance by using tests developed by ACT, most known for its college entrance exam, beginning in third grade.

""So essentially when a child gets into third grade all the way through 12th grade, we're going to have different types of assessments that they're going to take — none of which are high stakes — that can show a parent, teacher or a counselor how the student is developing through the years and if they're going to be ready for the ACT or similar tests that they may take after high school or in college,"" she said.

Owens' bill in South Carolina has been passed in the state House and referred to the Senate Education Committee. It calls for setting up a committee to recommend whether to continue using the High School Assessment Program exit exam for federal and state accountability requirements or replace it with something else. But it wouldn't be required for graduation, regardless.

Anna Huguley, a sophomore at J.L. Mann High in Greenville, S.C., says she took the exit exam this year and didn't find it very hard. Students typically take it in 10th grade and have two more chances before they graduate to pass it.

""I think the test is similar to, like, the end-of-course and the other exams like midterm that we're required to take,"" she said. ""So I think it might not matter that much if they take it away.""

""For some students it is extremely easy,"" said Jamie Hueble, a government and economics teacher at J.L. Mann. ""And to make it more difficult, then you can't give it to a sophomore, which is the year they start taking it. So I don't know that it's a great measure of a student's ability and qualifications for a diploma anyways.""

The opinions expressed are his own.

Reuters invited leaders in education to reply to Steven Brill’s op-ed on the school reform deniers. Below is Biddle’s reply. Here are responses from Joel Klein, Randi Weingarten, Diane Ravitch and others.



The vitriol over Steven Brill’s piece this week from Randi Weingarten, Diane Ravitch, Alex Kotlowitz and other defenders of the status quo isn’t surprising. After all, they are especially good at ignoring reality – especially when it comes to the role of the nation’s education crisis in fostering poverty in a knowledge-based economy in which what you know is more important than what you can do with your hands. And they are particularly willing to ignore the reality that school reform – including making sure that all kids are taught by high-quality teachers – is the long-term solution for saving 1.2 million children a year from poverty and prison.

One of the biggest reasons why America’s economic malaise may last for decades is because high school dropouts among the nation’s long term unemployed are essentially shut out of the jobs market. Fifteen percent of American high school dropouts age 25 and older were unemployed on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s nearly double the rate for high school graduates with some amount of college education and three times higher than that of collegians with bachelor’s degrees. The problem is even worse with the new generation of dropouts who have fewer prospects for employment; nearly a third of dropouts age 16-to-24 are out of work on a not seasonally-adjusted basis. These young men and women can’t get into high-paying white-collar jobs, or even get into apprenticeships for blue-collar jobs such as welding, which can provide them with middle-class incomes.

It is simple: The better-educated a person is — and the more education they get, the more likely they will avoid economic and social despair. The average African-American with some form of education will earn at least $9,142 more in annual income than a high school dropout. The higher levels of income not only benefit people and their families. The rewards flow into the communities in which they live, with higher levels of home ownership, entrepreneurial activities, and civic activities that lead to high quality of life that benefits everyone.

High-quality education and good-to-great teachers can’t alleviate economic poverty for the short term. But it does help young men and women get the knowledge they need to avoid poverty in adulthood. Education, unlike food stamps, equals empowerment. For our kids, for whom schools are at the centers of their worlds and communities, high-quality teachers and strong principals can help foster shelters from the storms around them.

This isn’t fiction. I can easily point to the example of my grandma, the daughter of menial workers who were barely literate, who struggled with reading until she was nurtured by her fourth-grade teacher. Thanks to that teacher, my grandma became the first person in our family attend college – and paved the way for my mother and I to achieve things she could only dream about. There are also numerous studies, including the famed Coleman Report, which concluded that if teaching is of high-quality, schooling will be a bigger factor than socioeconomic background.

The problem is that while we have many high quality teachers working in our classrooms, we also have far too many who are not capable of helping any of our children – especially those from poor and minority households – succeed. Thanks to the practices Weingarten, Ravitch and their fellow-travelers defend – including near-lifetime employment granted by tenure, which can be easily granted within three years in all but a few states –just 2.1 percent of teachers are ever dismissed. This isn’t just the fault of teachers’ unions alone. Our nation’s schools of education also do an abysmal job of recruiting and training teaching candidates. Just 13 percent of 77 education schools surveyed three years ago by the National Council on Teacher Quality had high quality math instruction programs. And far too many school districts are doing a poor job of supporting good-to-great teachers, while letting their poor-performing colleagues stay on the job. But Weingarten, Ravitch, Kotlowitz and their supporters have opposed the very reforms that would address all of these issues – and thus, are willing to let poor kids remain mired in poverty.

This isn’t to say that Weingarten, Ravitch, and others don’t care about children. Not at all. What I am saying – and what Brill is alluding to – is the reality that they and other education traditionalists defend a failed, amoral vision of American public education that has condemned far too many young men and women, especially poor black, white and Latino children that look just like me, to poverty and prison."

The vote was a major defeat for teachers’ unions and the state’s governor, John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat who campaigned heavily in support of the measure to provide $1 billion mostly for educational improvements. It was also a blow to charter-school advocates and a group of deep-pocketed philanthropists who had supported the effort as a rare opportunity to infuse new money into poor and struggling schools. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York contributed $1 million, as did Bill and Melinda Gates, whose foundation is a major contributor to education projects.

Opponents of the education measure were vastly outspent, but they offered a simple argument to voters leery of higher taxes, saying that the increase would hurt job creation, cost small businesses money and bruise the state’s economic recovery, with no guarantees that the changes would actually work.

The vote came one year after Californians approved a $6 billion tax increase to shore up the state’s finances and schools. But, unlike in California, voters in Colorado sent a message that they were unwilling to shoulder higher taxes, even in the name of a popular issue like education."

The bill passed Thursday in the General Assembly and is headed to the desk of Democratic Gov. Martin O’Malley for signing after Monday, the final day of Maryland’s 2013 legislative session.

The bill is also part of a larger progressive agenda put forth this year by leaders of the Democrat-controlled Assembly that includes the approval of tax increases and one of the toughest gun-control proposals in the country.

State Sen. David Brinkley calls the fees a “forced tax” and disagrees with union claims that representation will benefit every teacher.

“If the representation is so exceptional, then everybody would join,” he said. “I just don’t buy it. It’s a political payback that has nothing substantial to do with the merits of education.”

The bill will require tens of thousands of public school teachers to pay close to 1 percent of their paychecks in so-called “fair share” fees to cover the cost of contract negotiations and grievance representation.

Union leaders say the legislation attempts to create uniformity across Maryland and that non-union workers should share the cost.

“We just have a patchwork of bills with no consistency,” said Sean Johnson, the Maryland State Teachers Association’s managing director of legislative and legal affairs.

Johnson acknowledged some issues are best decided on a local level but not in this case, in which some workers pay for union representatives to negotiate fair pay and benefits while others do not.

Right now, 24 states have right-to-work statues, which prohibit unions from requiring employees to join or pay dues as a condition of employment, according to the National Right to Work Foundation.

“The right to work has been on the march for several decades,” said Greg Mourad, vice president for the Right to Work Committee. “And Maryland is moving in the wrong direction in relation to the rest of America.”

He also said the recent efforts by governors in Indian and Michigan that made their states right to work states “stunned a lot of people.”

Mourad said the key points are employees want freedom in the workplace and employers want to open businesses where they can treat their employees fairly and they won’t be forced to join unions.

The new Maryland legislation is an extension of 2009 legislation passed by the Assembly -- at the request of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees – that requires all state workers except teachers to pay the fees.

Right now, teachers in Baltimore City and nine of the state’s 23 counties already pay the fee, as do all other state employees including prison guards and state troopers.

Johnson also said the fees are not automatic and will be decided during future contract negotiations between the union and local school boards. The fees will not go toward political activities and workers are not being forced to join the union, he also said.

The legislature has already passed O’Malley incremental gas-tax increase that will up the price of a gallon of gas by as much as 20 cents by 2016 and the governor’s gun-control bill, which is considered among the toughest in the county. The bill includes bans on assault weapons, limits on high-capacity magazines and fingerprinting for buyers.

Mourad said he expects O’Malley will sign the union bill.

O’Malley’s office said Wednesday the bill was not part of the governor’s legislative agency and “no decision has been made” whether he would sign it.

""Gov. O’Malley has been competing with (New York) Gov. Cuomo to make Maryland the most liberal and high taxed state in the nation,"" said state Republican Delegate Susan Krebs. ""It is a race to the bottom for Maryland. This is all an effort by the governor to position himself to the left of his potential presidential contenders. There is no doubt that Maryland has become the bluest of blue states."""

A battle has been raging in Texas, and it's all about evolution.

On one side are creationist-minded members of the state Board of Education. They don't believe evolution should be taught in public schools in Texas. On the other side are board members who don't want religious or political ideologies to suppress a widely accepted theory.

Huffington Post Science reached out to Bill Nye to get his take on the ongoing debate, which had recently flared during a board discussion about whether to approve new science textbooks. And the ""Science Guy"" had some choice things to say.

""This textbook business is, to my way of thinking, a very serious matter, because of the economic impact,"" Nye said in an email to HuffPost. ""Everyone should take a moment and think what it will mean to raise a generation of students who might believe that it is reasonable to think for a moment that the Earth might be 10,000 years old.""

""It's an outrageous notion,"" Nye continued. ""It's not a benign idea. It's inane or silly. These students will not accept the process of science, which will stifle or suppress innovation.""

How so?

Using a Dallas-based high-tech company as an example, Nye said the suppression of science ultimately would mean that such companies ""would not be able to find competent engineers to come up with new ideas and create new products.""

""It's not a religious issue, as such. It's the future of the United States' economy that's at stake,"" Nye said.

So what can parents across the U.S. do to make sure their kids' scientific education isn't being stunted?

Vote -- every chance you get, Nye concluded. ""Make your voice heard."""

Teachers receiving pink slips%2C Duncan says

He blames %27dysfunction%27 in Congress

Spending cuts would more than a million students%2C thousands of teachers

WASHINGTON — U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan came out swinging Thursday, directing his harshest words at congressional lawmakers before what he calls ""increasingly likely"" mandatory spending cuts for ""real kids, real teachers and real classrooms"" from sequestration this March.

Speaking to reporters at a breakfast roundtable, Duncan said teachers are beginning to receive pink slips based on school districts' fears of sequestration, the mandated, across-the-board 5% cuts created by Congress to push lawmakers into a budget deal. ""This stuff is real,"" he said.

A former Chicago schools CEO, Duncan blamed what he called ""the height of dysfunction"" in Congress: ""There's no one in their right mind who would say this is good for kids and good for the country, yet somehow it becomes tenable in Washington. I just think people don't spend enough time in the real world. And if we spent more time in the real world, we wouldn't have this kind of intransigence here.""

The Obama administration estimates that the automatic spending cuts would slice $725 million from federal Title I programs for poor children, affecting 1.2 million students in 2,700 schools and putting the jobs of about 10,000 teachers at risk.

Also on the chopping block, according to Duncan: $598 million for federal aid to disabled students, affecting an additional 7,200 teachers. Public schools on Indian land, as well as Department of Defense schools on military bases, which rely more directly than most on federal aid, could see the fallout more quickly — as soon as this spring, said Carmel Martin, a top Duncan aide. A few schools could even be forced to shorten their school day or school year, she said.

Duncan called the situation ""very, very worrying,"" saying schools already operate with too few resources and personnel.

""The (school) day is too short. The year's too short. We don't have enough after-school. And now to say, 'OK, because we can't sit at a table and compromise and find some middle ground, we're just going to let a bunch of kids start to suffer and a bunch of teachers start to get pink slips?' How's that rational? How's that leadership? Is that why you ran for office and got elected and did all these things? Do you feel proud about that? I don't get it.""

Andrew Coulson, director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the libertarian Cato Institute, a Washington think-tank, said losing that many teachers won't have as devastating an effect as Duncan predicts.

The public school system has, in effect, hired too many people over the past four decades, he said. Since 1970, enrollment has grown by 8.5%, while employment has doubled, he said, with little to show in either higher high school graduation rates or a smaller achievement gap between poor and middle-class students.

""We have too many public school employees, not too few,"" Coulson said. ""What we've done is to warehouse people in an ineffective, inefficient bureaucracy.""

Duncan, a Harvard graduate who briefly played professional basketball in Australia, is fond of pointing out that U.S. students are locked in global competition with their counterparts in other developed countries. He invoked the image Thursday: ""This is not what South Korea is doing right now. This is not what Singapore is doing right now. This is not what India is doing right now. This is not what China is doing right now. Do they care more about their kids and their education system than we do? This is a choice. We're making a choice to go down this path and it's mind-boggling to me that this possibility might actually become reality.""

Mike Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a right-leaning Washington think-tank, said the scale of possible cuts would actually be smaller than what recession-weary districts have already experienced. Federal funding accounts for only about 10% of most budgets, so 5% of that is ""pretty small"" on an individual school basis.

He said the forced cuts might push districts to find ""federal money spent on fluff"" and get rid of it. ""If a little bit of it goes away, schools are going to be able to adapt without making huge changes,"" he said. ""This is not the end of the world as we know it — there are lots of ways to protect teacher jobs and still make cuts."""

The districts with the largest number of students receiving no aid included Los Angeles Unified with 4,150, Compton Unified with 1,697 and Salinas Union High with 1,618, according to the report by the American Civil Liberties Union of California and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center.

Students who have been designated “English learners” make up one-quarter of all California public school students; 85% are U.S.-born. Continued failure to teach them English — they are among the lowest-performing groups of students — will leave them further behind and jeopardize California’s future, the report said.

“State educational officials are creating a caste system whereby tens of thousands of children — nearly all of whom are U.S. citizens — are denied access to the bond of English language that unites us as Californians,” said Mark Rosenbaum, chief counsel of the ACLU of Southern California.

The two organizations, along with the Los Angeles law firm Latham & Watkins, warned of possible litigation unless the state responds in 30 days with a plan for action. The legal advocates are demanding stronger state monitoring, including investigations of districts that report they provide no services, requirements to create a plan to do so and sanctions if they fail to comply.

But state education officials said that 98% of the state’s 1.4 million English learners were receiving services and that recent court decisions had found that the California Department of Education was fulfilling its legal obligations to monitor help for them.

“Despite the enormous financial strains of recent years, California has made dramatic progress in seeing that all English learners receive appropriate instruction and services,” state education official Karen Cadiero-Kaplan said in a statement. She added that any parents with concerns should contact their school district.

Jessica Price, an ACLU attorney, said some parents opt out of specialized programs for their children but that the law still requires districts to provide aid until the students are no longer classified as English learners. She said some districts simply don’t know how to help the students, while others willfully ignore them — state compliance monitors found that one Northern California district had used state and federal funds for English learners to buy computer monitors and cameras, she said.

One parent, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation by school officials, said she only learned at a district meeting four months ago that her children were entitled to special classes designed for English learners.

She began investigating and learned that her children had never been placed in any of the specialized classes. Neither she nor her children knew they existed, she said.

L.A. Unified’s unserved students represented just 2% of its 194,904 English learners. Six of the 15 districts with the highest percentage of students without services were in the northern counties of Yuba, Siskiyou, Shasta, Butte, Sutter and El Dorado.

William S. Hart Union High School District in Los Angeles County reported it provided no services to 1,142 students, representing 54% of all English learners.

Mike Miles, who the Dallas Independent School District hired from Colorado Springs a year ago to help reform the big-city district, may have ended the teaching career of Cristy Nicole Deweese almost before it began. The 21-year-old beauty was about a month into the school year when word got out that she had been featured as a “Coed of the Month” in the men’s mag three years ago. But just a few weeks ago, Miles barely saved his own skin from the very fate he meted out to Deweese.

[pullquote]

Trustees voted 5-3 against a proposal to fire Miles after a report by a former U.S. Attorney found he violated district policy and his contract by ""contacting witnesses"" in the internal investigation and by ""discussing case facts"" with potential witnesses. The case grew out of allegations Miles interfered with a contract the district sought for parent education services. He was cleared on the initial allegations but accused of violating district policy by talking to witnesses and attempting to publicly disparage board members.

""It may not rise to the level … of a fireable offense, but what it does do is give us very grave concerns about whether we have trust-based leadership, and whether we as a district should place trust in that leader when that leader has violated that trust,"" Trustee Elizabeth Jones told WFAA-TV after the vote.

The board voted 7-0 to give Miles a written reprimand and to amend his contract to bar him from disparaging the school board, bullying, abusive behavior and the release of confidential information.

The teachers union wanted Miles fired, but didn’t take a position on Deweese. That’s because Texas is a right to work state, and Deweese opted not to join up.

“The union was not able to represent her, because she was not a member,” George Rangel, executive vice president of Alliance AFT, told FoxNews.com.

Miles decision to fire Deweese has generated controversy, from both parents who don’t want their young boys’ minds wandering in class at Townview Magnet High School, as well as sympathizers who say a photo shoot that took place when Deweese was just 18 should not haunt her. Deweese plans to put the classroom in her rear-view mirror and pursue a career in modeling."

Simon Foundation and director of the Manhattan Institute’s Center for the American University. Naomi Schaefer Riley is the author of “The Faculty Lounges: And Other Reasons Why You Won’t Get the College Education You Paid For.”

This fall, Georgetown University announced the creation of a new school of public policy , thanks to a gift of $100 million from an alumnus. And in October, the University of New Hampshire announced that it would use a $20 million gift to launch a public policy school of its own.

It is easy to understand the impulse behind such actions. “It’s an awfully frustrating time in the world,” David Ellwood, dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, told us. “There are large and challenging problems, including climate change, demography, budget problems, terrorism, extremism and partisanship.” At public policy schools, he explains, “we think it’s our job to fix these things.” The faculty and students, Ellwood says, “are united by the principle of making the world a better place.”

But are policy schools making a dent in Ellwood’s long and varied list of problems? The Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration already lists some 285 such institutions in the United States, and new ones are opening up — but the field as a whole seems to be having an identity crisis. The schools’ curricula and missions have become at once too broad and too academic, too focused on national and global issues at the expense of local and state-level ones. It’s not clear that the schools are preparing their graduates to fix all that needs fixing.

“Policy schools used to be much more about how to translate ideas into solutions to public problems,” says Anne-Marie Slaughter, former dean of Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and now president of the New America Foundation. Scholars at policy schools “do extremely important work,” she asserts, but often, “that’s not work that policymakers read.”

The basic premise behind a school of policy derives from the modern idea of constitution-making — that wisely crafted laws can shape the character and conduct of citizens. Philosopher David Hume articulated this view in his 1742 essay, “That Politics May Be Reduced to a Science,” arguing that while sound administration is crucial in a monarchy, the structure of the constitution and laws is more important in republican systems, where individual freedoms and public good come together. James Madison and other American founders became early practitioners of Hume’s science of politics.

In the 20th century, political science moved from the design of constitutions to the crafting of policies by neutral experts. Progressive leaders such as John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson and Louis Brandeis argued that modern industrial society had grown too complex for the common citizen or the average elected official. It required a new class of public servants to adjudicate conflicts between business and labor and to serve on boards and commissions regulating corporate activity in the public interest.

Some of the first public policy schools were founded in the 1930s in response to the creation of New Deal government agencies. The virtue of these schools is that “they trained many people who went into government and did good things,” says John DiIulio, who runs the Fox Leadership Program at the University of Pennsylvania and was the first director of President George W. Bush’s White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. “They wired the house of American bureaucracy.”

Sizable government initiatives in the postwar era created more demand for such institutions, which became “an expression of the Progressive idea that bigger government was better government,” DiIulio explains. For example, he says, “no one had ever built an interstate highway system before,” and no one knew how to make the federal government work with state and local governments and for-profit contractors to make it happen. Enter public policy schools.

The mission of these institutions began to change in the 1970s, when the Ford Foundation issued multimillion-dollar grants to eight universities, including Yale, Duke and the University of Michigan. According to Graham Allison, writing in 2006 in the Oxford Handbook of Public Policy, the new cadre of students needed to be versed in not only “budgetary cost and efficacy” but also “social equity, civil rights, and quality of life.” People who were concerned with intragovernmental relations and American federalism began to seem “old and crusty,” DiIulio says. Now the goals of these schools were to dream up ways to “make the world a better place.”

Lofty goals have often produced research and teaching that is further and further removed from the day-to-day operations of government. While the field is so disparate that “it’s hard to talk about public policy schools as a whole,” Slaughter cautions, she and other school leaders identify certain trends, including a renewed zeal for quantitative analysis. When Georgetown President John J. DeGioia announced his university’s new policy school, he explained that “the availability of massive data to provide new analytic tools have resulted in an invaluable opportunity for our university.” The new emphasis on big data is reminiscent of the Progressive idea that if we just gather enough information, the policy conclusions will be obvious to all.

James Wilburn, dean of Pepperdine University’s School of Public Policy, worries that too often, “what gets studied depends on whether there is an available database.” He accuses economists at policy schools of being “more interested in their models than in the people” whom public policy will affect.

Many schools have begun to look like a mishmash of the academic departments from which their faculty members hail — such as political science, economics and sociology. But those people may have no more or less interest than colleagues from their home departments in shaping actual policy. Of course, many of these schools draw at least some faculty members from politicians who have lost elections or wonks whose parties are out of power in Washington. But such celebrity instructors are short-timers and do little to draw the academic faculty — which dominate the schools — out of their bubbles.

There is also a certain grandiosity that characterizes the missions of these institutions. With the exception of certain schools such as the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, most schools are concerned more with national and international policy than with local and state matters. Many of the places that do focus on the latter, DiIulio says, “are not among the more prestigious.”

It is not that the better-known schools never do local projects. Ellwood told us how Kennedy School students helped the mayor of Somerville, Mass., remake his city’s finances with “performance-based budgeting” — measuring how much snow gets plowed, for example, not how many snowplows are used. Ellwood offered this as an example of how policy schools have to focus on “management as much as big, bold, creative solutions.”

But one wonders how many Kennedy School graduates aspire to solve Somerville’s fiscal problems as opposed to, say, climate change and terrorism? Only 6 percent of the school’s 2012 graduates went into local, regional or state-level government jobs.

To understand how much the trajectories of policy school alums have changed, one need only take note of a lawsuit against Princeton by the Robertson family. In 1961, the heirs to the A&P fortune gave $35 million to the university specifically for the purpose of training people to go into government service through the Woodrow Wilson School. Forty years later, they found that the school was instead training people to go into a lot of other fields — from nonprofits to Wall Street. (After a six-year legal battle, an agreement was struck whereby Princeton retained control of the endowment, which had grown to $900 million , but would pay out $50 million to create a new foundation aimed at preparing students for government service.)

Of course, public-private partnerships are ubiquitous now; public policy isn’t shaped solely by government staffers but by various sectors and players as well, and it makes sense that graduates’ ambitions would reflect that. Indeed, Slaughter says that if she were starting a policy school today, it would offer only joint degrees, so that students could develop expertise in the various arenas they might encounter in the years ahead. But training people to be competent in multiple sectors only makes the job of policy schools even more diffuse.

So, what should these schools be doing in terms of training and research? DiIulio suggests that maybe it’s time for them to return to their roots, teaching students to focus on implementing policy and making the government we have work better. “These seem like technical, boring matters, [but] someone has to get under the hood,” DiIulio says. For instance, he adds with a laugh, “How do you build an IT system for a new federally financed system of health care?”

Henry Brady, the dean at the University of California at Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy, told us in an e-mail that his school has been “quite successful with a real impact on bringing tough-minded economic and analytical methods into government and bringing evidence based research into the formulation of regulations and the appraisal of programs (although politicians often ignore the research).”

That last caveat may prove the most important. Slaughter notes that the research coming out of public policy schools is “less and less accessible to the lay reader. The jargon has become more and more specialized.” She says she “doesn’t know anyone in government who would read the academic journals that policy school professors get rewarded for publishing in,” and while the “need for translation [for lay readers] is ever greater, the rewards for translation in the academy are ever smaller.” Indeed, she says, “in many departments you will be less valued by your colleagues because you’re no longer doing ‘cutting edge’ research.”

If policymakers ignore policy school research or can’t understand it, what can policy professors and graduates possibly accomplish?

Arthur Brooks, formerly a professor of business and government at Syracuse’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs and now president of the American Enterprise Institute, says that students coming out of policy programs are “no match for the trillions of dollars in unfunded mandates and liabilities,” not to mention the “power of the unions and the bureaucracies.” Public policy schools “could produce 10,000 graduates a year,” he adds, “and it wouldn’t hold a candle to the power of those interests.” Asking whether public policy grads have made a dent in the budget crisis “is like sending 75 Jesuits to China and complaining that the country isn’t Christian.” Brooks says, “At Maxwell, we were just trying to train graduates to be good in whatever careers they had.”

It’s probably true that experts are no match for organized interests, from public-sector unions to corporations, in which case the Progressive idea was bound to fail. Unfortunately, though, it’s not clear that the policy schools ever fought these battles — or that they are equipped to do so now.

House speaker%2C GOP chairman say language is %27offensive%27

GOP trying to improve standing with Hispanics%2C who strongly supported President Obama

Congressman said he used %27poor choice of words%27

WASHINGTON — GOP Rep. Don Young of Alaska apologized Friday for using a racial slur to describe migrant farmworkers after being denounced by top Republicans for ""offensive"" language as the party tries to boost its standing with Hispanics.

""I apologize for the insensitive term,"" Young, a House member since 1973, said in a statement. ""There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words.""

In an interview this week with an Alaska radio station, Young used the word ""wetbacks"" and said the term had been commonly used when he was growing up on a ranch in central California. He issued a statement late Thursday saying he had ""meant no disrespect,"" but the reaction throughout the day had been heated from both parties — particularly from his own Republican leadership.

House Speaker John Boehner, Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus, Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn and Sen. John McCain, a leader in the Senate's efforts to rewrite immigration laws, all chided Young for his language and said it had no place in the Republican Party. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Xavier Becerra of California were among the Democratic leaders to criticize Young.

Boehner in particular was incensed, saying Young's remarks were ""offensive and beneath the dignity of the office he holds."" The House's top Republican said there was ""no excuse,"" and the language warranted ""an immediate apology.""

Young, 79, said Friday the word he used ""and the negative attitudes that come with it should be left in the 20th century.""

His timing was bad. A bipartisan group of senators and House members plans to unveil bills in April that would dramatically revamp the nation's immigration laws and include a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants in the USA.

The Republican National Committee (RNC) is spending $10 million starting this year on outreach efforts to minorities, women and gay voters as the party seeks to become more inclusive and welcoming. The new outreach is the result of the GOP's scathing post-election ""autopsy"" report, which noted that much work needs to be done to attract Hispanics. In the last election, President Obama won 71% of the Hispanic vote.

Earlier in the day, Priebus said Young's original words ""emphatically do not represent the beliefs of the Republican Party.""

""As I have continued to say, everyone in this country deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,"" he said. ""Our party represents freedom and opportunity for every American and a beacon of hope to those seeking liberty throughout the world.""

Cornyn, R-Texas, noted that migrant workers come to America looking for ways to improve their lives and those of their families.

""They do not come to this country to hear ethnic slurs and derogatory language from elected officials,"" Cornyn said. ""The comments used by Rep. Young do nothing to elevate our party, political discourse or the millions who come here looking for economic opportunity.""

Members of Congress drafting immigration legislation are considering the number of work visas granted to immigrants in several areas of the economy, including high-tech workers, agricultural workers and lower-skilled fields. Many of those visas would end up going to people from Mexico, Central and South America.

Young said he was ""sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform.""

Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said an immigration overhaul will be possible only through bipartisanship. He noted that Young, who has served beside many Hispanics in his decades in Congress, ""should know terms like 'wetback' have never been acceptable.""

""Now, more than ever, we must resolve the many issues of our broken immigration system,"" Hinojosa said. ""But as we move forward, it's important that our Republican colleagues are mindful of how words have consequences. When elected officials use racial slurs, it sets back our nation and sets back legislators who are seriously working toward real, bipartisan solutions.""

Lisa Navarette, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic advocacy group, said she is heartened that GOP leaders were quick to denounce Young. She said the use of such a slur coming from a Republican in this day and age highlights the challenge for the GOP.

""It's an education issue,"" she said. ""It's not a matter of being nicer. They've got some fundamental work to do to educate their party.""

She contacted a headhunter. “I’ve got to get a job,” she said. “I just have to.” She had two job interviews lined up and her fingers crossed.

Long-term joblessness — the kind that Ms. Barrington-Ward and about four million others are experiencing — is now one of the defining realities of the American work force.

The unemployment rate has fallen to 7.3 percent, down from 10 percent four years ago. Private businesses have added about 7.6 million positions over the same period. But while recent numbers show that there are about as many people unemployed for short periods as in 2007 — before the crisis hit — they also show that long-term joblessness is up 213 percent.

In part, that’s because people don’t return to work in an orderly, first-fired, first-hired fashion. In any given month, a newly jobless worker has about a 20 to 30 percent chance of finding a new job. By the time he or she has been out of work for six months, though, the chance drops to one in 10, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Facing those kinds of odds, some of the long-term jobless have simply given up and dropped out of the labor force. So while official figures show that the number of long-term jobless has fallen steeply from its recessionary high of 6.7 million, many researchers fear that this number could mean as much bad news as good. Workers over 50 may be biding their time until they can start receiving Social Security. Younger workers may be going to school to avoid a tough job market. Others may be going on disability, helping to explain that program’s surging rolls.

Stan Hampton, 59, a veteran of the Iraq war, is now earning his associate degree. But he has not had a job since returning from active duty in 2007, and is now living in an apartment complex for veterans near Las Vegas."

Let’s move our B-1 program (one of America’s principal bombers, known affectionately in the military as “The Bone”) from California, where people earn a decent living, to Oklahoma, where they don’t know the difference between a dollar bill and a mess of okra!” This is akin to what happened with the 787 Nightmare Dream Liner, the production of which was moved from Seattle to South Carolina, resulting in the tinker-toy version of the plane which has been incinerating itself across the globe.





Well of course no one Boeing hired at bottom-of-the-barrel wages in Oklahoma had ever even heard of flying machines much less the US Air Force and strategic bombers. The result? The Air Force, hard to keep happy in the best of circumstances, were so infuriated by the new, inept and utterly useless Boeing B-1 program In Oklahoma that they abruptly terminated the contract. (Boeing’s performance was so miserable that the Air Force considered that Boeing had violated terms previously agreed to, therefore the contract was null.) So now the great, brilliant move has cost Boeing a huge chunk of its military income, which they are desperately trying to win back. The government has issued RFQs (Request For Quote) for someone else to take over the contract. Meanwhile, Boeing has been left holding the, um—okra.

She Also Previously Worked At Upi', 'The La Times.']",Race to the Top: Standardized testing for preschoolers,"On January 17, 2003, The Washington Post published a Page 1 story (that I wrote) about the Republican Bush administration’s plans to give 908,000 4-year-olds in Head Start programs nationwide a standardized assessment to see how much they were learning.

Critics howled. Early childhood development experts said preschoolers are too young to be evaluated by standardized tests in part because they don’t have sufficient ability to comprehend assessment cues. The plan was shelved.

Flash forward eight years. Today it’s the Democratic Obama administration that is pushing standardized assessments for preschoolers. Not only is there no loud shouting, but a gaggle of states are going to battle each other for the right to win federal funds that will help them implement the second wave of Race to the Top, early childhood version.

In the first part of Race to the Top, President Obama’s signature education initiative, 11 states and the District of Columbia collectively won $4 billion last year to push school reforms favored by Education Secretary Arne Duncan.

The department recently announced the early childhood education chapter of the sweepstakes, this one promising to dispense a total of $500 million to winners who wow the judges, Duncan being the ultimate decider after lesser judges make their own recommendations.

Criteria recently released for states to consider as they write their applications get to the heart of the matter immediately:

Priority 1: Absolutely Priority — Using Early Learning and Development Standards and Kindergarten Entry Assessments to Promote School Readiness.”

(And here are the rest of the stated priorities:

Priority 2: Absolute Priority – Using Tiered Quality Rating and Improvement Systems to Promote School Readiness

Priority 3: Competitive Preference Priority – Including all Early Learning and Development Programs in the Tiered Quality Rating and Improvement System Priority

4: Invitational Priority – Sustaining Program Effects in the Early Elementary Grades

Priority 5: Invitational Priority – Encouraging Private Sector Support)



There is something disturbing about an early childhood education initiative that doesn’t seem to take into account how young children learn best. Where, for example, is the priority about ensuring that all early childhood programs provide creative opportunities for kids to explore and learn? That’s how they best learn, myriad child development experts have said for years.

The institutionalization of standardized assessments for young kids threatens to turn preschool into an academic environment that is too regimented for youngsters.

I know a girl who, when given an aptitude test at age 4, refused to answer the questions because she just didn’t feel like it that day. That’s the way 4-year-olds act sometimes. She was scored as essentially having the aptitude of a monkey. That’s the way standardized assessments are, and that’s no way to judge a 4-year-old.

The Race to the Top criteria say that any assessments developed should conform with the recommendations of the National Research Council’s reports on early childhood.

One such report, published in 2008, entitled Early Childhood Assessment: Why, What, and How,” makes clear how difficult it is to create valid assessments for young children:

“Assessments of any type must be selected and implemented with care, but special attention is needed when using direct assessments with young children. It requires greater attention to establishing a relationship with the child, to ascertaining whether the task is familiar and comprehensible to him or her, to limiting length of the session and the child’s discomfort, to recognizing the role of conditions like hunger or fatigue, and to recognizing the possibility of bias if the tester is a caregiver or otherwise connected to the child. Instruments that have the most user-appeal often do not have the best psychometric properties. For example, portfolios of children’s artistic productions contain rich information but are hard to rate reliably. In the experience of committee members, selection of instruments is often more influenced by cost, by ease of administration, and by use in other equivalent programs than by the criteria proposed here.”

It is, of course, possible that these assessments will be brilliantly constructed. I’m just not holding my breath.

Schoen'],College students face another round of sticker shock,"As college acceptance letters go out in the next few weeks, prospective students and their parents are in for another round of sticker shock.

And while tuition costs keep rising, the roughly three out of every four students headed to state colleges and universities in the fall may not find all of the courses and services they sampled on their college tour.

Faced with continued budget cuts at the state and federal level, state universities continue to raise tuition and cut offerings, according to a recent analysis by the Center of Budget Policy and Priorities.

On average, states are now spending more than $2,500 less per student than they did five years ago, when the Great Recession blew a large hole in most state budgets.

That 28 percent spending cut has forced an average tuition increase of $1,850 per student over the same period. It’s also forced schools to continue to look for ways to cut back, according to Phil Oliff, a CBPP policy analyst who prepared the report.

“They’ve eliminated faculty positions and increased class sizes, frozen staff salaries and instituted furloughs, cut course offerings and even entire departments, closed down computer labs and cut library services, among other cost-saving actions,” Oliff said.

Open Channel: Caught cheating: Colleges falsify admissions data for higher rankings

In the last year alone, the total “sticker price” of a four-year public degree has risen a little over 4 percent to $17,860 for in-state students and $30,911 for those from out-of-state, according to the College Board. A private four-year degree, on average, costs nearly $40,000.

Public and private universities have also been hit by cutbacks in state and federal research funding, according to the National Science Board. Research grants now make up about a quarter the average budget among the top 101 public research universities – down from 38 percent two decades ago.

CBPP

The recent round of federal budget cuts known as the “sequester” have only made matters worse. Those cuts – which took effect March 1 – sliced some 5 percent from federal research and development spending, taking a $6 billion bite out of federal research spending, according to the American Council on Education.

The sequester is also cutting federal spending on various programs to help students pay the higher costs of a degree.

Because Congress and the White House continue to haggle over the budget cuts, students getting financial aid letters will need to take those numbers with a grain of salt. But unless Congress makes changes, college-bound students can expect to pay higher origination fees on loans and see smaller grants from various programs.

For those most reliant on aid, the sequester could cost as much as $876 a year, according to the Student Aid Alliance. Those cuts include military tuition assistance, federally supported work-study programs and so-called Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants for low-income students. (Pell grants – which helped roughly a third of all college students in 2011-2012 - were spared this year, but could be cut in the future.)

With costs rising and financial aid drying up, college students and their families are leaning ever more heavily on debt, which now stands at roughly $1 trillion outstanding. Last year, total student borrowing amounted to $113 billion – up 24 percent from five years ago, according to the College Board.

As the national housing and markets show convincing signs of recovery, higher income and property tax revenues are helping to stabilize state budgets. But Oliff says there is little sign states are reversing cuts to higher education.

“Funding has continued to go down,” he said. “The rate of decline of has moderated somewhat, but we don’t see any sign that states are re-investing in their higher education systems. And they’re coming out of an enormously deep hole.”

Bodrova and Leong had both studied Vygotsky, and they discussed whether some of his methods might help improve the climate of these classrooms. For Vygotsky, the real purpose of early-childhood education was not to learn content, like the letters of the alphabet or the names of shapes and colors and animals. The point was to learn how to think. When children enter preschool, Vygotsky wrote, they are “slaves to their environment,” unable to control their reactions or direct their interests, responding to whatever shiny objects are put in front of them. Accordingly, the most important goal of prekindergarten is to teach children how to master their thoughts. And the best way for children to do that, Vygotsky believed, especially at this early age, is to employ various tools, tricks and habits that train the mind to work at a higher level. So Tools of the Mind students learn to use “private speech” — to talk to themselves as they do a difficult task (like, say, forming the letter W), to help themselves remember what step comes next (down, up, down, up). They use “mediators”: physical objects that remind them how to do a particular task, like CD-size cards, one with a pair of lips and one with an ear, that signify whose turn it is to read aloud in Buddy Reading and whose turn it is to listen. But more than anything, they use play.

Most of Vygotsky’s counterparts in the field of child psychology, including influential figures like Jean Piaget and Maria Montessori, held that imaginary play was an immature form of expression, a preliminary stage of development. But Vygotsky maintained that at 4 or 5, a child’s ability to play creatively with other children was in fact a better gauge of her future academic success than any other indicator, including her vocabulary, her counting skills or her knowledge of the alphabet. Dramatic play, he said, was the training ground where children learned to regulate themselves, to conquer their own unruly minds. In the United States, we often associate play with freedom, but to Vygotsky, dramatic play was actually the arena where children’s actions were most tightly restricted. When a young boy is acting out the role of a daddy making breakfast, he is limited by all the rules of daddy-ness. Some of those limitations come from his playmates: if he starts acting like a baby (or a policeman or a dinosaur) in the middle of making breakfast, the other children will be sure to steer him back to the eggs and bacon. But even beyond that explicit peer pressure, Vygotsky would say, the child is guided by the basic principles of play. Make-believe isn’t as stimulating and satisfying — it simply isn’t as much fun — if you don’t stick to your role. And when children follow the rules of make-believe and push one another to follow those rules, he said, they develop important habits of self-control.

Bodrova and Leong drew on research conducted by some of Vygotsky’s followers that showed that children acting out a dramatic scene can control their impulses much better than they can in nonplay situations. In one experiment, 4-year-old children were first asked to stand still for as long as they could. They typically did not make it past a minute. But when the kids played a make-believe game in which they were guards at a factory, they were able to stand at attention for more than four minutes. In another experiment, prekindergarten-age children were asked to memorize a list of unrelated words. Then they played “grocery store” and were asked to memorize a similar list of words — this time, though, as a shopping list. In the play situation, on average, the children were able to remember twice as many words. Bodrova and Leong say they see the same effect in Tools of the Mind classrooms: when their students spend more time on dramatic play, not only does their level of self-control improve, but so do their language skills.

In the past, when psychologists (or parents or teachers or priests) tried to improve children’s self-control, they used the principles of behaviorism, reinforcing good and bad behaviors with rewards and punishments. The message to kids was that terrible things would happen if they didn’t control their impulses, and the role of adults, whether parents or preschool teachers, was to train children by praising them for their positive self-control (“Look at how well Cindy is sitting!”) and criticizing them for their lapses. And in most American prekindergartens and kindergartens, behaviorism, in some form, is still the dominant method. But Bodrova and Leong say that those “external reinforcement systems” create “other-directed regulation” — good behavior done not from some internal sense of control but for the approval of others, to avoid punishment and win praise and treats. And that, they say, is a kind of regulation that is not particularly valuable or lasting. Children learn only how to be obedient, how to follow orders, not how to understand and regulate their own impulses. The ultimate goal of Tools of the Mind is not emotional or physical self-regulation; it is cognitive self-regulation — not the ability to avoid grabbing a toy from the kid next to you (though that’s an important first step), but the much more subtle ability to avoid falling for a deceptively attractive wrong answer on a test or to concentrate on an arduous mental task. And those abilities are more difficult to affect by other-directed regulation. Because the abilities are more abstract, they are less likely to be elicited by rewards. Kids are rarely able to organize their thoughts better in order to get an ice-cream cone.

As a result, many practices that most prekindergarten teachers consider essential are more or less banned from Tools of the Mind classrooms. There are no gold stars, no telling the class that they are all going to have to wait until Jimmy is quiet; even timeouts are discouraged. When there is a conflict — when, say, Billy grabs a toy from Jamal — the Tools of the Mind teacher’s first questions are supposed to be: What was it in the classroom that made it hard for Billy to control himself? And what mediators could help him do better next time? The teacher does remind Billy that there is a rule and he broke it, but she doesn’t make a big deal out of the incident. “We pretty much try not to use this whole concept of misbehavior,” Bodrova told me. “These kids are not born criminals. Even if they do something that is completely out of bounds, they do it because they can’t stop themselves.”

There are not yet firm experimental data that prove that Tools of the Mind works. But two early studies that began in the late 1990s in Denver showed some promising results: After a year in the program, students did significantly better than a similar group on basic measures of literacy ability. And more recent studies, including one overseen by Adele Diamond, a professor at the University of British Columbia who is one of the most prominent researchers in the field of cognitive self-control, have shown that Tools students consistently score higher on tests requiring executive function. Angela Duckworth told me that when she read Diamond’s report, which was published in Science in 2007, “I got very excited.” Her failed 2003 study had persuaded her that the usual approach to self-control in early-childhood education, a brief intervention here or there, wouldn’t work. But Tools of the Mind was clearly a different strategy. “It’s an immersion approach,” she said. “It’s not that these kids are pulled out and they do self-control for half an hour a day. Everything is about self-regulation, every single moment. Everything about the culture that the classroom creates reinforces that.”"

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-push-universal-preschool-proposal-142600889--election.html,,[],Obama pushes universal preschool proposal,"President Barack Obama on Thursday promoted his new proposal to guarantee high quality preschool for every 4-year-old in the United States citing a need to bring low-income and minority children up to speed with higher-income children-- a move he says will translate into an economic boost.

""Every dollar we invest in high quality early education can save more than $7 dollars later on,"" Obama said during a speech at a Community Recreation Center in Decatur, Ga. repeating a line first delivered during his State of the Union address Tuesday night when he unveiled the preschool proposal and other initiatives for the coming year.

The president told his Georgia audience Thursday that children who are not exposed to quality early education aren't prepared for kindergarten. They don't know ""their numbers,"" ""shapes,"" they'll know ""fewer vocabulary words"" and don't have a ""capacity for focus."" ""They're going to be behind that first day,"" he said.

Obama argued that investing in early education will result eventually in a stronger workforce and will boost the economy.

""The size of your paycheck, though, shouldn’t determine your child’s future,"" he said.

The states of Georgia and Oklahoma have instituted universal preschool programs and the president said the same benefits seen in these states will be borne out across the country under his federal proposal.

According to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday morning, Obama's preschool plan would create a new federal-state cost-sharing partnership to guarantee high-quality preschool to all low- and moderate-income 4-year-old children, including families that earn up to 200 percent of the poverty level. The program would be extended to middle-class families who may pay on a sliding scale, and would incentivize full-day kindergarten.

The Department of Education will allocate funds to states based on the number of 4-year-olds in each state who qualify. Standards for preschools will include ""well-trained teachers, who are paid comparably to K-12 staff,"" as well as small class size and a rigorous curriculum.

Story continues

Preschools will have ""qualified, highly educated teachers,"" Obama said Thursday. ""This is not babysitting.""

White House officials said the new preschool proposal will not replace or destroy the current Head Start early education government program. Instead, a new early Head Start program will be created to support communities affected by the new preschool proposal.

The White House has not released cost estimates for the new preschool plan. The president has said this proposal and others announced in his address would not add to the federal deficit.

The president on Wednesday traveled to Asheville, N.C. to promote his manufacturing initiatives in a speech. On Friday, he is scheduled to deliver remarks in Chicago related to the economy. Senior administration officials say he will also address gun violence during that trip."

(AP)

In the first three months of her husband’s second term, Michelle Obama has made a splash as fashion icon, entertainer, cover girl. Her “The Evolution of Mom Dancing” video with Jimmy Fallon has racked up more than 15 million views on YouTube, and she’s back on the cover of the sartorial mag Vogue. But if this makes people think she’s settling for “soft power,” avoiding the tough issues — recent moves have shown this isn’t so.

To the first lady’s conventional issues — healthy food, exercise and military families — add violence against youth. On April 10, she will attend a youth violence event in Chicago, moving close to the gun-control debate, one of the year’s most contentious political issues. Obama will urge business and civil leaders in her home town “to invest in expanded opportunities for youth across Chicago’s neighborhoods,” members of her staff said.

This comes a couple of months after she hosted the parents of Chicago teenager Hadiya Pendleton in her box during her husband’s State of the Union speech. Hadiya, 15, was killed in January when a gunman opened fire on her and other teens while they were hanging out at a park in Chicago. (Hadiya’s mom and younger brother have been invited back to the White House for the Easter Egg Roll on Monday.) While Obama is unlikely to talk about gun control, gun violence is a problem in Chicago. Last year, Chicago police recorded more than 2,300 shooting incidents.

The event, which will be hosted by Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), comes as the first lady — who has always seemed approachable while staying keenly on message — is in the middle of a period of strategic planning. The effort, headed by her communications director, Kristina Schake, will help determine how Obama moves forward in the next four years.

“There’s a group of people who think in the second term, a first lady should step up her game and cultivate a more international profile,” said Emily Bernard, a professor of English and ethnic studies at the University of Vermont who co-authored “Michelle Obama: The First Lady in Photographs.” “I would rather not see her abandon homegrown issues.”

Far from abandoning them, Obama has pressed forward with concrete steps. In February, she announced a program to bring physical activity back to schools, supported by $50 million from Nike. That month, she also penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed calling healthy food a good investment for businesses.

“She’s brought unprecedented interest to the childhood obesity issue,” said Kelly Brownell, director of the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. “My hope is that [the dialogue Obama started] will result in significant advances in policy in the second term.”

The “Joining Forces” program, which Obama leads alongside Jill Biden, continues to include visits to military families and warm words of thanks — a nod to Obama’s role as a wartime first lady.

But a few weeks back, she attended a luncheon meeting of the chief executives of the Business Roundtable, where she gave a data-laden speech about the need to for companies to hire veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. (Obama was the second first lady to address the group; Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first during her failed push for the Clinton administration’s health-care reform in the mid-1990s.)

After her speech, UPS, whose chief executive is a member of the Business Roundtable, pledged to hire more than 25,000 veterans over the next five years. Earlier this year, Obama and Biden met with governors at the White House to urge them to ease veterans’ reentry into the workforce by giving them credit for military training and experience.

Obama has often said she favors measurable accomplishments over symbolic impact. Her staff members say her signature efforts — aimed at lowering childhood obesity rates and garnering support for military families — change the culture in the way that her clothing choices have rippled through the fashion industry. Everything she does has a message attached, an aide said, answering critics who have called performances such as the dancing video with Fallon frivolous.

The first lady does not regularly sit down with the reporters who cover her, but she told journalists traveling with her recently that children would remain central to her second-term agenda.

“Kids need to be engaged, not just intellectually. They need more than just to do well on test scores. They need to have something else in life to look forward to,” Obama told the Associated Press in February after an event promoting her “Let’s Move!” program.

Obama’s office has been a place of relative calm in the White House, with few changes after a rocky start four years ago that saw her quickly replace her first chief of staff. Two longtime aides, Director of Policy and Projects Jocelyn Frye and Deputy Communications Director Semonti Stephens, left recently. Their departures were an indication of time served, not unhappiness in the ranks, an aide said. Christina Tchen, who has roots in the West Wing and has known Michelle Obama for more than 20 years, has served as the first lady’s chief of staff since January 2011."

USA TODAY

1.3 million jobless workers could lose benefits by Jan. 1 and 850%2C000 more by March 31

Some struggling households already hit by food stamp cuts

Emergency benefits%27 expiration would detract from growth elsewhere in economy

About 1.3 million unemployed Americans are set to lose their extended jobless benefits by the end of December if Congress doesn't renew the program, delivering another blow to struggling households hit with recent cuts in food stamps.

Another 850,000 people would run out of unemployment insurance from January through March when their roughly 26 weeks of state benefits end, according to the National Employment Law Project.

""There's a view … that it would be too heavy a blow both to the economy and to struggling unemployed families to have both food stamp benefits and unemployment benefits all (be cut) within two months of each other,"" says Bob Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

On Nov. 1, a temporary increase in food stamp benefits was phased out, affecting more than 47 million Americans.

Some of those affected also receive jobless benefits, NELP says, though it had no specific data.

In 2008, in the middle of the recession, the federal government began providing up to a year or more of ""emergency"" unemployment benefits to supplement the typical 26 weeks of coverage that states provide.

In January, Congress renewed that program as part of the ""fiscal cliff"" deal on tax increases and spending cuts, but scaled it back. This year, the unemployed have received 14 to 47 weeks of emergency benefits, depending on their state's jobless rate, NELP figures show.

Those benefits are slated to end Dec. 28, abruptly cutting off payments to the 1.3 million people already receiving them and ensuring that another 850,000 will get no more checks when their 26 weeks of state benefits expire between January and March.

By some measures, the labor market has improved, with unemployment falling to 7.3% last month from a peak of 10% in October 2009. But long-term unemployment has come down only modestly, with 4.1 million Americans, or 36% of all the unemployed, out of work at least six months. They would be the most affected by a phaseout of emergency benefits.

""There's still a crisis of long-term unemployment,"" says NELP program director Maurice Emsellem.

The portion of the long-term unemployed receiving benefits has fallen to 34% from 45% a year ago, and would drop to 25% if the emergency program is shut down, NELP says.

The move also would reduce economic growth next year by 0.15 percentage points, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Each dollar the government pays out in benefits yields $1.42 in economic output because the unemployed tend to spend nearly all their payments, he says.

The economy has grown at a relatively weak annual rate of 2.1% in the first three quarters of this year.

Zandi says renewing the extended benefits program is somewhat less likely this year because there's no directly relevant bill, such as the fiscal cliff package, to which the measure could be attached.

Greenstein says it could be added to anticipated budget or Medicare legislation. The White House recently urged Congress to extend the program and last week Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee called for a hearing on the issue.

Candace Stewart, 58, says she would have to sell her townhouse if she lost her emergency benefits of about $400 week. Stewart, who was laid off from her job as a quality control inspector last April, has sent out nearly 200 résumés but gotten just two interviews.

""There's just nothing out there to get,"" she says."

(CNN) - Rep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kansas, faulted Senate Democrats on Saturday for this week's hike in student loan interest rates and urged the upper chamber to pass legislation that resolves the issue as soon as the holiday recess ends.

""For too long, politicians have been in charge of setting these rates, and we keep coming back to cliffs and deadlines like this one,"" Jenkins said in the GOP weekly address. ""Paying for college is difficult enough without all this uncertainty. I have two kids in college, I know how hard it can be.""



The interest rates on some student loans officially doubled Monday - to 6.8% from 3.4% - after the Senate failed to reach a compromise by the July 1 deadline.

The hike hits about seven million new subsidized Stafford loans this year for middle- and low-income students, but does not apply to existing loans.

Negotiators are stuck largely on the question of whether to require an overall cap above which interest rates on new loans could not rise.

Top Senate Democrats want a cap in place to protect students if interest rates spike. That is at odds with the slightly different proposals from President Barack Obama and various congressional Republicans, which are tied to 10-year Treasury bond rates and would include charges for administrative costs but would not include caps.

Republicans, who prefer a more market-based approach, often point out that the White House's proposal falls more in line with their own.

""When President Obama proposed letting the markets set interest rates instead, the Republican-led House passed a bill reflecting his plan,"" Jenkins said. ""Republicans in the Senate came to the table with similar ideas. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats attacked the president's plan, refused to work with us, and allowed this rate hike to take effect, leaving for the July 4th holiday without passing a solution.""

Senators worked through last week to try to reach a deal, but lawmakers from both parties ultimately predicted an agreement would not be made in time.

Nevertheless, many of those same senators said they hope to finalize an agreement shortly after the break and have it apply retroactively so students are not hurt by the temporary hike.

Another disagreement centers on whether the legislation is revenue-neutral. Senate Democrats say the government should not earn any money or pay down the deficit from the loans they provide, something that would happen under the other proposals.

""Republicans continue to insist that we reduce the deficit on the backs of students and middle-class families,"" Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said a week before the deadline.

Miss America from 2011%2C Teresa Scanlan%2C attends super-conservative Patrick Henry College

The school requires students to dress modestly and seek parental counsel when pursuing romance

Scanlan won the Miss America Contest at 17 representing Nebraska

PURCELLVILLE, Va. (AP) — It's a startling contrast to some observers — the glamorous, bikini-clad Miss America from 2011, Teresa Scanlan, finding her home at the tiny, super-conservative Patrick Henry College. The school requires students to dress modestly and ""seek parental counsel when pursuing a romantic relationship.""

But the match has been a good one. Scanlan returned to campus in late August to begin her sophomore year. Among the things she loves about her classmates and her campus: ""I've never had to sign an autograph, and I've never had to take a picture. Here, I can be just another student,"" she said.

Blending in is not always easy for Scanlan, who won the Miss America Contest at 17, representing Nebraska. The youngest Miss America in more than 70 years, she spent a year fulfilling her duties and enrolled at Patrick Henry in 2012. She says the school's workload matched the grueling schedule as Miss America.

The school was established in 2000 with the goal of giving home-schooled Christian conservatives a foundation to help them effect change in government, the law and journalism.

The school started with 90 students and a single major — government. It is still a tiny campus in the outer suburbs of Washington, D.C., but now has 320 students and five majors, including journalism, literature and history. The SAT scores of its students are comparable to top-tier state universities.

Scanlan, who came from a homeschooling family, says she wanted to go to Patrick Henry ever since she was 8.

She said she's frustrated by stereotypes that some hold about Patrick Henry students. She recalled a recent photo essay published about the school that she felt went out of its way to depict students as cloistered weirdos. The reality, she said, is that while the students are Christian, they come from a variety of backgrounds.

""There's this idea that we don't struggle with the same problems, that we don't understand real world problems ... that everyone comes from wonderful, happy families, that we're close-minded and brainwashed. That kind of pushes my buttons,"" she said.

The degree to which some people are willing to make snap judgments about her has occasionally taken her aback. As a teenager, she admits her schedule as Miss America and some of the accompanying expectations, wore on her. The negativity she faced from anonymous Internet critics was hurtful.

""To have someone look at a picture of you and decide just based on that picture that they hate you, and that they're going to tell the world that they hate you — that takes some getting used to,"" she said.

During her year as Miss America, she began to feel depressed and, at times, even suicidal. The depression continued during her freshman year, she said, when she found her coursework grueling, with a heavy emphasis on reading and writing. She earned a 3.75 grade-point average, but was disappointed because she had set a goal of a 3.9 or higher, which she feels she needs to get accepted into Harvard Law School.

She reached out to her parents for help during her spring semester, and she's now taking fewer classes and worrying less about others' expectations.

""I'm finally starting to let go of some of the stress, some of the responsibility,"" she said.

While she loves her school, she said she has occasionally received criticism from some there who feel the Miss America pageant, particularly the swimsuit competition, is not compatible with a Christian lifestyle because it shows too much skin or objectifies women. Scanlan respectfully disagrees.

""I have never violated my conscience. I was never compromising my morals,"" she said. ""For myself, I have never believed it's wrong for a female to wear a swimsuit that would show the same amount of skin a man. It's a bit of a double standard.""

The school's founder and chancellor, Mike Farris, also said he received sporadic complaints that Scanlan's status as a Miss America was supposedly contrary to the school's code and values.

""I don't view getting into the pageant world to be incompatible with Christian values,"" said Farris — who made his name as a lawyer defending homeschooler families.

Farris never had any doubts that Scanlan would be a good ambassador for the school. Farris sensed she could be a starter on Patrick Henry's Moot Court team, which Farris coaches and regularly wins national championships.

""She's very bright, a great communicator,"" Farris said, noting she placed third in a regional in Moot Court championships as a freshman. ""Yeah, no doubt I expect a national championship out of her.""

Kira Clark, a Moot Court teammate of Scanlan's and now a roommate, described Scanlan as ""a caring, incredibly ambitious, smart, compassionate person who puts her friends first.""

On the small campus, she said students don't dwell on the fact that Scanlan was Miss America.

""We see her as a sister we can be proud of, rather than a celebrity we can be taking advantage of,"" Clark said.

Despite her plans to reduce stress, Scanlan remains ambitious. On her LinkedIn profile, she lists herself, among other things, as ""2028 presidential candidate."" She would be 35, the constitutional minimum to serve as president.

Farris, who designed the school with the idea of launching Christian conservatives into the public sphere, said Scanlan and many other Patrick Henry students set such goals and he encourages them to aim high.

""If they mess up and only get to be governors and senators, I'll live with it,"" Farris said."
http://news.yahoo.com/school-districts-quit-healthier-lunch-program-170113831.html,,[],Some school districts quit healthier lunch program,"After just one year, some schools around the country are dropping out of the healthier new federal lunch program, complaining that so many students turned up their noses at meals packed with whole grains, fruits and vegetables that the cafeterias were losing money.

Federal officials say they don't have exact numbers but have seen isolated reports of schools cutting ties with the $11 billion National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools for meals served and gives them access to lower-priced food.

Districts that rejected the program say the reimbursement was not enough to offset losses from students who began avoiding the lunch line and bringing food from home or, in some cases, going hungry.

""Some of the stuff we had to offer, they wouldn't eat,"" said Catlin, Ill., Superintendent Gary Lewis, whose district saw a 10 to 12 percent drop in lunch sales, translating to $30,000 lost under the program last year.

""So you sit there and watch the kids, and you know they're hungry at the end of the day, and that led to some behavior and some lack of attentiveness.""

In upstate New York, a few districts have quit the program, including the Schenectady-area Burnt Hills Ballston Lake system, whose five lunchrooms ended the year $100,000 in the red.

Near Albany, Voorheesville Superintendent Teresa Thayer Snyder said her district lost $30,000 in the first three months. The program didn't even make it through the school year after students repeatedly complained about the small portions and apples and pears went from the tray to the trash untouched.

Districts that leave the program are free to develop their own guidelines. Voorheesville's chef began serving such dishes as salad topped with flank steak and crumbled cheese, pasta with chicken and mushrooms, and a panini with chicken, red peppers and cheese.

In Catlin, soups and fish sticks will return to the menu this year, and the hamburger lunch will come with yogurt and a banana — not one or the other, like last year.

Story continues

Nationally, about 31 million students participated in the guidelines that took effect last fall under the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.

Dr. Janey Thornton, deputy undersecretary for USDA's Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, which oversees the program, said she is aware of reports of districts quitting but is still optimistic about the program's long-term prospects.

""The vast majority of schools across the country are meeting the updated meal standards successfully, which is so important to help all our nation's children lead healthier lives,"" Thornton said.

""Many of these children have never seen or tasted some of the fruits and vegetables that are being served before, and it takes a while to adapt and learn,"" she said.

The agency had not determined how many districts have dropped out, Thornton said, cautioning that ""the numbers that have threatened to drop and the ones that actually have dropped are quite different.""

The School Nutrition Association found that 1 percent of 521 district nutrition directors surveyed over the summer planned to drop out of the program in the 2013-14 school year and about 3 percent were considering the move.

Not every district can afford to quit. The National School Lunch Program provides cash reimbursements for each meal served: about $2.50 to $3 for free and reduced-priced meals and about 30 cents for full-price meals. That takes the option of quitting off the table for schools with large numbers of poor youngsters.

The new guidelines set limits on calories and salt, phase in more whole grains and require that fruit and vegetables be served daily. A typical elementary school meal under the program consisted of whole-wheat cheese pizza, baked sweet potato fries, grape tomatoes with low-fat ranch dip, applesauce and 1 percent milk.

In December, the Agriculture Department, responding to complaints that kids weren't getting enough to eat, relaxed the 2-ounce-per-day limit on grains and meats while keeping the calorie limits.

At Wallace County High in Sharon Springs, Kan., football player Callahan Grund said the revision helped, but he and his friends still weren't thrilled by the calorie limits (750-850 for high school) when they had hours of calorie-burning practice after school. The idea of dropping the program has come up at board meetings, but the district is sticking with it for now.

""A lot of kids were resorting to going over to the convenience store across the block from school and kids were buying junk food,"" the 17-year-old said. ""It was kind of ironic that we're downsizing the amount of food to cut down on obesity but kids are going and getting junk food to fill that hunger.""

To make the point, Grund and his schoolmates starred last year in a music video parody of the pop hit ""We Are Young."" Instead, they sang, ""We Are Hungry.""

It was funny, but Grund's mother, Chrysanne Grund, said her anxiety was not.

""I was quite literally panicked about how we would get enough food in these kids during the day,"" she said, ""so we resorted to packing lunches most days."""

The leaders of the nation’s teachers unions immediately fired off news releases asserting that the mediocre PISA scores of American students showed that more than a decade of testing-based reform had failed our schools. Prominent reform leaders, by contrast, concluded from the test results that the U.S. was failing to change schools radically enough to aid its most disadvantaged students. Still others predicted that the U.S. economy would crash and burn because of our students’ unimpressive math scores on the PISA exams compared with other countries’ students. (American students ranked above the median in reading and science but below it in math.)

A saner interpretation of the PISA results came from researchers who have studied international rankings in great detail, and their message goes something like this: Calm down, everyone. The results on this and other international tests are more complicated than they look, and in this case, nuance makes a difference. Despite the doomsday talk, the scores a country receives on the PISA don’t necessarily predict the strength — or weakness — of its future labor force or the trajectory of its economy, according to Martin Carnoy, a professor of education at Stanford University. Some countries with relatively low scores have built thriving, tech-based economies, while the economies of some high-scoring nations have faltered.

YEAR IN REVIEW: Washington’s 5 biggest ‘fails’ of 2013

And the results on the PISA, administered every three years to 15-year-olds in 65 countries, tell us as much about cultural differences as about differences between school systems. In the Asian countries that took the top spots — including Singapore, South Korea and areas of China — families spend heavily on private tutoring to prepare their children for college entrance examinations that closely resemble the PISA tests, Carnoy said. So the high PISA results don’t necessarily reflect on their schools.

The reasons that some countries do well (or poorly) are complicated. Finland, for instance, has historically been successful on the PISA tests — so much so that governments, including California’s, have sent delegations there to figure out the educational magic. And Finland has been successful despite the fact that, unlike in Asia, testing is de-emphasized and recesses during the school day are long. But Finland also is a country with relatively few disadvantaged children, largely because of the nation’s social welfare network. And disadvantaged children, no matter what the country, fare worse on the PISA tests than students from more educated and affluent families. A Stanford study last year found that non-school factors such as the number of books in students’ homes accounted for more than two-thirds of the variation in scores on high-profile international tests like PISA.

A study published this year by Carnoy and Richard Rothstein, a researcher at the Economic Policy Institute, found that much of the difference between U.S. scores and those of high-ranking nations is because the United States has a higher proportion of disadvantaged students. But the researchers found that the scores of the most disadvantaged U.S. students have been improving markedly over the years, while scores for their counterparts in many top-ranked nations have fallen precipitously.

In contrast, the highest-scoring U.S. math students are nowhere near their peers in top-ranking countries, Carnoy said.

Though curriculum itself isn’t a cure-all, the Common Core curriculum, which California and dozens of other states are beginning to implement, should help. It is more closely aligned to the kind of conceptual understanding and deep thinking that is both called for on the PISA tests and required for true innovation.

If there is a lesson to be gleaned from PISA, it’s that moving toward a more educated nation will require helping families give their children the resources and background they need to do better in school, as well as continuing reform efforts to improve instruction and curriculum. It requires committed action over time, not warring and self-serving pronouncements."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/31/politics/obama-student-loans/index.html,2013-05-31 00:00:00,['Tom Cohen'],Obama repeats strategy in student loan fight,"Story highlights President Obama urges students to pressure congressional Republicans Sen. McConnell accuses Obama of playing politics despite common ground A Senate vote on extending the current loan rate is planned for next week Democrats launch ads in college newspapers criticizing Republicans on the matter

(CNN) —

If at first you succeed, then by all means, try, try again.

President Barack Obama returned to a successful strategy from last year’s election campaign by calling Friday for college students and their families to mount pressure on congressional Republicans to prevent a jump in some student loan rates set to occur on July 1.

“Higher education cannot be a luxury for a privileged few,” he said at the White House with college students standing behind him. “It is an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford, every young person with dreams and ambitions should be able to access and now’s not the time for us to turn back on young people.”

The Rose Garden appearance angered GOP leaders, who contend they have proposed a reasonable solution.

“No one should be fooled by today’s campaign-style event at the White House,” said a statement by Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

He added that Obama “appears more interested in needlessly stoking partisan divisions in Washington than helping young Americans avoid a higher interest rate on their student loans.”

The issue is both practical and political.

Student loan mess: What’s at stake?

If Congress doesn’t act in coming weeks, interest rates on government-subsidized Stafford loans for college students will double from the current 3.4% to 6.8% starting in July.

Only students taking out new subsidized loans after July 1 would be affected, as those getting unsubsidized loans already pay the 6.8% rate.

About 7 million students, a third of the total taking out loans, would be affected.

Obama said Friday the impact would mean those students needing subsidized loans would have to pay about $1,000 more a year.

When he asked how many in the crowd could afford that, several heads shook “no.” To qualify for subsidized Stafford loans, students must meet an income threshold.

The event allowed Obama to revert to a topic he benefited from in his successful re-election campaign last year, and to divert attention from controversies dogging his administration early in his second term such as IRS targeting of conservative groups and secret subpoenas of journalists’ phone records.

Republicans argue that Obama basically agrees with their approach, which would tie the student loan rate to economic factors instead of leaving it up to Congress. However, the two sides remain at odds over specifics including how fast and high the interest rates could rise.

A measure recently passed by House Republicans would mean that the rate for all new student loans would be about 5% for the first year, but would likely rise in the future because it would be linked to the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds, which currently are low.

Obama’s budget proposal for next fiscal year would hold down rates for subsidized loans to about 3% in the first year, with other students paying about 5%. Those rates also would be linked to the 10-year Treasury bond levels and therefore would likely increase in future years.

The president criticized the House GOP proposal as “not smart” and “not fair,” saying it would increase the burden on middle- and lower-income families to pay for a college education.

He reminded listeners that their pressure last year persuaded legislators to extend the current 3.4% rate on subsidized loans through June instead of letting it double in 2012.

“You’re going to have to call them up again or e-mail them again or tweet them again and ask them ‘what happened, what changed?’” Obama said.

Differences between the two sides involve when the rate on a loan gets locked in, with Obama calling for it to happen right away while the House measure would allow it to rise until a student graduates.

Another difference concerns maximum rates.

The House measure would cap interest rates at 8.5% for student loans while the Obama proposal would contain no such cap but would include a program to limit a former student’s annual expenditures on the loan to no more than 10% of discretionary income.

A House GOP aide noted that the Democratic-controlled Senate has yet to act on the issue, and echoed McConnell’s statement in saying that the House and Obama agree on the principle of tying the student loan rate to economic factors.

Later Friday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced he planned for the chamber to vote next week on a Democratic measure to extend the current 3.4% rate for subsidized loans for two years, which would put off the matter until after the 2014 congressional elections.

The measure would eliminate some tax breaks, including one for oil companies, to pay the federal cost of extending the lower interest rate. Such tax components appear certain to ensure Republican opposition.

Meanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Friday it was launching ads in six college newspapers that urge students to pressure Congress to keep loan rates low.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-exhorts-good-deeds-morehouse-graduates-160712553.html,,[],Obama exhorts good deeds by Morehouse graduates,"ATLANTA (AP) — President Barack Obama, in a soaring commencement address on work, sacrifice and opportunity, on Sunday told graduates of historically black Morehouse College to seize the power of their example as black men graduating from college and use it to improve people's lives.

The president said his success was due to ""the special obligation I felt, as a black man like you, to help those who need it most, people who didn't have the opportunities that I had — because there but for the grace of God, go I. I might have been in their shoes. I might have been in prison. I might have been unemployed. I might not have been able to support a family. And that motivates me.""

Noting the Atlanta school's mission to cultivate, not just educate, good men, Obama said graduates should not be so eager to join the chase for wealth and material things, but instead should remember where they came from and not ""take your degree and get a fancy job and nice house and nice car and never look back.""

""So yes, go get that law degree. But if you do, ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and powerful, or if you can also find time to defend the powerless,"" Obama said. ""Sure, go get your MBA, or start that business, we need black businesses out there. But ask yourself what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood.""

""The most successful CEOs I know didn't start out intent on making money. Rather, they had a vision of how their product or service would change things, and the money followed,"" he said.

For those headed to medical school, Obama said, ""Make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too.""

Before Obama arrived in Atlanta, thunderstorms drenched hundreds of people who gathered on the campus lawn for the outdoor ceremony, forcing many guests to wear clear plastic ponchos over what amounted to their Sunday-best clothes. Rain began falling again, accompanied by more thunder and lightning, minutes after Obama began to speak.

Story continues

""I also have to say you all are going to get wet,"" he said. ""I would be out there with you if I could. But Secret Service gets nervous, so I'm going to have to stay here, dry. But know that I'm with you in spirit.""

Obama urged graduates to ""inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves.""

Obama used the speech to once again share his personal story of growing up without a father, confessing that along the way he made unspecified bad personal choices ""like too many men in our community.""

""Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down,"" he said. ""I had a tendency to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is, there's no longer any room for excuses.""

Speaking in personal terms as he often does when addressing predominantly black audiences, particularly of black males, the nation's first black president also spoke intimately of his desire to be a better father to daughters Malia and Sasha than his absent father was to him, and to be a better husband to his wife, Michelle.

He told the graduates to pay attention to their families, saying success in every other aspect of life means nothing without success at home.

""I was raised by a heroic single mother and wonderful grandparents who made incredible sacrifices for me. And I know there are moms and grandparents here today who did the same thing for all of you,"" he said. ""But I still wish I had a father who was not only present, but involved. And so my whole life, I've tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my father wasn't for my mother and me. I've tried to be a better husband, a better father, and a better man.

""It's hard work that demands your constant attention, and frequent sacrifice. And Michelle will be the first to tell you that I'm not perfect,"" he continued. ""Even now, I'm still learning how to be the best husband and father I can be. Because success in everything else is unfulfilling if we fail at family.

""I know that when I'm on my deathbed someday, I won't be thinking about any particular legislation I passed, or policy I promoted. I won't be thinking about the speech I gave, or the Nobel Prize I received,"" said Obama, 51. ""I'll be thinking about a walk I took with my daughters, a lazy afternoon with my wife, whether I did right by all of them.""

The speech was Obama's second commencement address of the season, following remarks last Sunday at Ohio State University in Columbus. His third and final graduation address will come Friday at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.

About 500 students received undergraduate degrees on Sunday and became ""Morehouse Men.""

After the speech, Obama joined about 100 people at a fundraiser at the office of the foundation of Arthur M. Blank, co-founder of Home Depot and owner of the Atlanta Falcons. It was the first of six money events that officials say he will headline for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is recruiting candidates and strategizing to keep control of the Senate in next year's midterm elections. Democrats will be defending more Senate seats than Republicans, including six held by long-serving Democratic senators who have decided not to seek re-election.

After briefly discussing the economy, early childhood education, energy independence, climate change and infrastructure, Obama said ""the good news is we've got good, common-sense solutions that we can implement right now,"" on those issues. ""The bad news is there's a shortage of common sense in Washington.""

He told the donors, who paid anywhere from $10,000 per couple to $32,400 per couple to attend the fundraiser, that their support is important because it will help elect more non-ideological senators like Michael Bennet, D-Colo., ""who don't come at this thinking there's just one way of doing things."" Bennet chairs the campaign arm for Senate Democrats and introduced Obama at the event.

""That kind of approach, if we get a critical mass in the Senate, and we can potentially get a critical mass of folks like that in the House, means that the sky's the limit,"" Obama said. ""Nothing can stop us.""

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",McManus: Tax reform that hits home,"Would you support a tax reform measure that could help reduce the federal deficit, remove a needless distortion in the economy and make the system fairer?

Me too, which is why I’m taking aim at a sacred cow: the home mortgage interest deduction.

Advertisement

That’s right, the mortgage interest deduction that every homeowner, including me, loves.

If you listen to home builders and real estate agents, they’ll tell you that the mortgage interest deduction is what makes homeownership possible for millions of Americans.

Yet last year, homeownership in the United States, battered by mortgage foreclosures, sank to 65%, a 17-year low, while next door in Canada, where taxpayers don’t get a deduction for mortgage interest, homeownership continues to rise, reaching more than 69% last year, according to Toronto’s Financial Post.

The reason is that our mortgage interest deduction doesn’t directly support homeownership; instead, it supports mortgage indebtedness, which isn’t the same thing at all.

Advertisement

If the goal is really to increase homeownership, a better idea might be to offer a tax break aimed more precisely at middle-income families buying starter houses — a tax rebate for interest on the first $200,000 in mortgage debt, for example.

But that’s not how the mortgage deduction works. First, it’s only useful to people who itemize deductions, which only about 30% of taxpayers do. Second, it helps people with big mortgages more than those with small ones. Third, like all deductions, it helps people with the highest incomes (who get the equivalent of 39.6% of their mortgage interest knocked off their tax bill in the top bracket) more than people with lower incomes (who get 25% or less off if they itemize). Moreover, if someone buys a vacation home, that mortgage interest is deductible too, as long as the total debt is under $1 million.

Advertisement

But don’t take it from me. Take it from the economists at the Mercatus Center, a mostly conservative think tank at Virginia’s George Mason University.

“Most taxpayers do not benefit from this deduction at all or receive a very small benefit,” they wrote in a report issued last month. “The only taxpayers who do receive a large benefit are those in the upper income brackets.... Its primary effect is to encourage Americans who would have already been able to afford a house to take on even more debt.

Advertisement

“Recent empirical research suggests that the mortgage interest deduction increases the size of homes purchased but not the overall rate of homeownership,” they wrote.

And it’s not just conservatives: Policy wonks in both political parties believe that trimming the mortgage interest deduction is a good idea.

Advertisement

President Obama has proposed limiting the value of tax deductions for upper-income taxpayers to 28%, even if they’re paying a higher tax rate. But that idea hasn’t caught fire.

Mitt Romney, last year’s Republican presidential candidate, proposed eliminating all tax deductions for very-high-income taxpayers and putting a cap on deductions — $17,000, for example — for the rest of us. (He wanted lower tax rates too.)

Advertisement

The co-chairmen of Obama’s bipartisan debt commission, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, offered a more homeowner-friendly proposal: a 12% tax credit that would go to all taxpayers, even low-income families, on mortgages up to $500,000. (A credit directly reduces your taxes; a deduction merely reduces the amount of your income that’s taxed.)

But wait, you and your real estate agent will say. Won’t a change in the mortgage interest deduction knock a hole in home values?

Advertisement

Yes — at least at the high end, where high-bracket taxpayers take on million-dollar mortgages. At the lower end, where modest homes are bought by people of modest means? No effect on prices at all, economists say.

And even at the high end, the Mercatus report found, “it is likely to have little effect.”

Advertisement

You can be sure that home builders and Realtors, whose businesses thrive on big houses and high prices, will push back hard against any proposal for change.

“We’ve been preparing for this debate for a year and a half,” Jim Tobin, chief lobbyist at the National Assn. of Home Builders, told me recently. “The housing industry is just coming out of its depression,” he argued. “This is not the time to dampen that recovery.”

Advertisement

OK; not this month, then. But by the end of the year, the economy, and the housing industry, are likely to be in better shape.

The mortgage interest deduction subsidizes big houses and bigger mortgages, but that’s not a good use of tax dollars. Its benefits flow disproportionately to the wealthy and do nothing for the working poor.

Advertisement

The deduction currently costs the Treasury about $100 billion a year. That’s money we could use to lower taxes, shrink the deficit or pay for Medicare — a debate Obama and the Republicans will surely have.

There aren’t many policy changes that would increase government revenue, remove distortion from the economy and make the distribution of income fairer all at the same time.

Fellow homeowners, let’s take this one for the team.

For more than four years, it has been my honor and privilege to serve our country under President Obama. Together we have accomplished important milestones in improving education for Americans at all levels, especially for those most in need. I know from experience that great teaching, learning and research have the power to transform our nation and the world. To build on the work and considerable outcomes we have achieved, I have decided to return to academia and will leave federal government service this fall.



Delivering a world-class education for all is what I have dedicated my life to get done every day. Serving as your Under Secretary has deepened my understanding and appreciation of what “service to improve the public good of our nation” really means. The promise and power of delivering good government to our students and families is a tireless, phenomenal effort, often with few external rewards if done honestly, fairly and well. What unfolds each and every day never ceases to amaze me, even now. I could never have imagined a more exciting and challenging opportunity. For that I thank President Obama, Secretary Duncan and each of you.



Over the next few months, my priority is to ensure a seamless transition for the Department until a new Under Secretary comes on board. I remain committed to achieving the goals for our nation’s postsecondary students, institutions and communities: access, affordability, quality and completion. I will continue to pursue these ends during this transition period and beyond.



I have assured Secretary Duncan that the postsecondary team will continue to advance our ambitious statutory, regulatory and administrative agenda. We can’t afford to miss a beat as you all know. For me, it is simply that single, unwavering commitment to help our students and institutions aspire to excellence that inspires me each and every day.



As always, I welcome your ideas and feedback about our work going forward. Thank you for all that you continue to do and for the opportunity to serve as your Under Secretary of Education.



Full speed ahead!

(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images)

A battle has been raging in Texas, and it's all about evolution.

On one side are creationist-minded members of the state Board of Education. They don't believe evolution should be taught in public schools in Texas. On the other side are board members who don't want religious or political ideologies to suppress a widely accepted theory.

Huffington Post Science reached out to Bill Nye to get his take on the ongoing debate, which had recently flared during a board discussion about whether to approve new science textbooks. And the ""Science Guy"" had some choice things to say.

""This textbook business is, to my way of thinking, a very serious matter, because of the economic impact,"" Nye said in an email to HuffPost. ""Everyone should take a moment and think what it will mean to raise a generation of students who might believe that it is reasonable to think for a moment that the Earth might be 10,000 years old.""

""It's an outrageous notion,"" Nye continued. ""It's not a benign idea. It's inane or silly. These students will not accept the process of science, which will stifle or suppress innovation.""

How so?

Using a Dallas-based high-tech company as an example, Nye said the suppression of science ultimately would mean that such companies ""would not be able to find competent engineers to come up with new ideas and create new products.""

""It's not a religious issue, as such. It's the future of the United States' economy that's at stake,"" Nye said.

So what can parents across the U.S. do to make sure their kids' scientific education isn't being stunted?

Vote -- every chance you get, Nye concluded. ""Make your voice heard."""

But when one set of presidents honors conservative icons such as Midge Decter, Hilton Kramer and the Hoover Institution, and another set of presidents bestows medals upon liberal voices such as Anna Dea­vere Smith, Toni Morrison and Philip Roth, a political message is being sent.

When President Obama hands out this year’s National Humanities Medals and National Medals of Arts at an East Room ceremony Wednesday, he will make a markedly different statement than his predecessors. By honoring William Bowen, the former Princeton University president who wrote one of the most rigorous defenses of affirmative action, and Tony Kushner, the playwright who turned the AIDS epidemic into a metaphor for a society suffering from a selfishness intrinsically linked to Reaganism, he takes a stand in the nation’s continuing culture wars.

The honorees are selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, whose chairmen are appointed by the president.

Obama is by no means the first president whose arts and humanities awards aligned his administration with a particular intellectual approach. George W. Bush’s annual honorees tended to celebrate tradition, broad appeal and middle American tastes: He honored conservative actor Robert Duvall, jazz traditionalist Wynton Marsalis, the genial TV host Art Linkletter, the PBS show Austin City Limits, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association.

Bill Clinton shared Bush’s preference for celebrities, but his administration’s choices tended to come from more liberal sectors of the culture, such as Hollywood (Robert Redford, Gregory Peck, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee) and media (Studs Terkel, Garrison Keillor, Norman Lear and National Public Radio).

Some choices seem to be above politics: When Obama honors Tijuana Brass trumpeter and record label mogul Herb Alpert this year, when Bush gave an arts medal to electric guitar pioneer Les Paul or when Clinton honored violinist Isaac Stern, ideology does not appear to be at play.

But the 24 honorees that Obama’s staff selected this year continue this administration’s turn away from celebrities and, especially in the humanities choices, toward writers and academics known for strong and even harsh critiques of U.S. government and policy. Journalist Joan Didion’s early writings against American policy in Central America and editor Robert Silvers’ direction of the New York Review of Books as a forum for criticism of U.S. policy from Vietnam to Iraq, along with Kushner’s work as an acutely political playwright, indicate a view of the medals as an opportunity to support a certain stripe of artistic and intellectual activism.

Although some administrations have sought to avoid controversy in their selections, the choice of Kushner represents the opposite pole. The playwright, one of eight New York City residents among the 24 honorees, wrote a scathing short play in 2004 in which Laura Bush reads a bedtime story to Iraqi children who have been killed by American bombs. Kushner is best known for his two-part AIDS/Age of Reagan play “Angels in America.”

More recently, the City University of New York rescinded an invitation to Kushner to receive an honorary degree because of allegations by a college trustee that the playwright had insulted the state of Israel. The invitation was later restored. Kushner has called the removal of Palestinians from their homes in Israeli-occupied territories ethnic cleansing, but he said he is a strong supporter of Israel’s right to exist.

Many of this year’s choices are less controversial, including screenwriter and playwright Elaine May, who was half of the 1950s comedy team Nichols and May and went on to direct movies such as “The Heartbreak Kid” and co-write films such as “Tootsie” and “Reds.”

Another arts medal is going to George Lucas, creator of the “Star Wars” franchise, which helped introduce the blockbuster culture that has dominated Hollywood since the 1970s. “Star Wars” represented a break from the cynicism and edgy aesthetics that defined post-Vietnam cinema, instead immersing viewers in a nostalgic “far, far away” world that had more to do with the movie serials and sci-fi adventures of baby boomers’ youths than with the probing self-examination that characterized movies in the years just before “Star Wars.”

Lucas is less well-known for his important contributions to the medium in sound and visual effects technology. With the THX sound system and his Industrial Light & Magic firm, Lucas vastly improved the clarity and precision of image and sound, which audiences now take for granted in theaters and home entertainment systems.

Among the music awardees this year is Allen Toussaint, a songwriter and producer who wove New Orleans’ rich, dense musical history into the R&B, funk and soul of the 1960s and ’70s. He’s an alchemist who took a local sound and made it universal — sparking imitations and echoes in the work of the Rolling Stones, Glen Campbell and scores of hip-hop producers.

Herb Alpert’s A&M Records introduced many Americans to mariachi and Brazilian music, and then went on to make a huge impact on pop music, producing hit albums by Carole King, Cat Stevens, Janet Jackson, the Police and Soundgarden.

Alpert and Toussaint also share a connection: “Whipped Cream,” the title track of Alpert and the Brass’s chart-topping 1965 album, was written by “Naomi Neville,” Toussaint’s pseudonym.

There’s only one Washington-area honoree on this year’s list, an arts medal for the Washington Performing Arts Society. Medals have been given to arts institutions and sponsors before, including Hallmark Cards and Exxon Corporation (both under President Ronald Reagan), the MacDowell artists colony (Clinton), the Interlochen Center for the Arts summer camp (George W. Bush) and the Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival (Obama).

But WPAS gets its award before Carnegie Hall or Lincoln Center, and the honor comes just as the D.C. organization has embarked on a major change of direction, having hired a new leader, Jenny Bilfield. The award reflects the 10-year tenure of her predecessor, Neale Perl, who ramped up WPAS’s educational activities and presented an increasing number of rising artists.

Although this year’s list is weighted heavily toward New York artists and scholars, the medalists do include some regional figures, such as Joan Myers Brown, who has brought African American dance and dancers into the national spotlight by founding Philadanco (the Philadelphia Dance Company) and by supporting black dance artists around the country by creating the International Association of Blacks in Dance and the International Conference of Black Dance Companies.

Honorees often recall their moment in the White House as a career highlight. The poet Donald Hall, who won an arts medal in 2010, cherished his brief embrace with Obama, but noted that “honors inevitably bring on self-doubt. Everyone knows that all medals are rubber.”

""Since Darwin's groundbreaking theory of evolution by natural selection, scientists all around the world have found monumental amounts of evidence in favor of the theory, now treated as scientific fact by 99.9% of all scientists,"" the document's author, A.J. of Vienna, Va., wrote. ""However, even after 150 years after the establishment of evolution, some schools across the U.S. are ""teaching the controversy,"" including creationism and intelligent design. Both of these so-called ""theories"" have no basis in scientific fact, and have absolutely zero evidence pointing towards these conjectures. These types of loopholes in our education are partially to blame for our dangerously low student performances in math and science.""

The solution, A.J. concluded, is for Obama to seek a federal ban on teachings that contradict evolution.

The Christian Post interviewed Ken Ham, founder and president of the creationist organization Answers in Genesis, about the matter. Ham noted that executive action on such an issue would be unusual, considering school curriculums are typically determined at the local level by elected board members.

The Supreme Court already ruled in 1987 that the teaching of creationism was unconstitutional in public schools, as it violated the separation of church and state. The White House petition doesn't differentiate between public and private school curriculums, however, meaning that perhaps the poster would like to see such teachings removed from private schools as well.

And while religious teachings have no place in public school science classrooms according to current federal statutes, not all states are following that line intently. A school district in Ohio attracted controversy last month when it considered a proposal that would allow its schools to discuss controversial topics, including creationism, in its classrooms.

In Louisiana, state lawmakers have repeatedly refused to close the door on creationism by keeping a law on the books that allows certain ""supplemental"" materials to be used in the classroom. Critics say the law essentially allows teachers to teach religious alternatives to evolution without oversight.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) has been more direct in his support for religious teachings, going so far as to say earlier this year that he was fine with public schools providing students with learning materials about creationism or intelligent design and letting children make up their own minds about whether those theories trumped evolution.

The petition had more than 7,000 signatures as of Wednesday morning. It will need to meet a threshold of 100,000 signatures in order to warrant a response from the White House."

NCAA has beefed up its police force under Emmert by 44 percent

Emmert wants NCAA%27s Committee on Infractions to work faster on violation cases

NCAA deserves an %27A%27 for its stronger academic progress standards for athletes%2C Emmert says

INDIANAPOLIS -- No other chief executive in the history of the NCAA has stirred up a storm quite like this.

Since the hiring of President Mark Emmert in 2010, the NCAA has handed down 48 major rules violation cases against member schools – a rate that is far higher than any of Emmert's predecessors, according to a review by USA TODAY Sports. It's 25% higher than the previous NCAA president and doesn't even include the two most controversial punishment cases under Emmert's watch – Penn State and Miami.

Emmert, 60, also created some strife at NCAA headquarters in Indianapolis, having ousted several well-regarded NCAA management officials with decades of experience.

He's beefed up the rules enforcement staff – the NCAA's police force – by 44%, from 41 in 2010 to a new high of 59.

By August, Emmert hopes to see a broader and faster crackdown on rule-breaking schools by increasing the NCAA's committee on infractions – its judge and jury -- from 10 to as many as 24 members.

""That's as aggressive as we can possibly be with it,"" Emmert told USA TODAY Sports in an exclusive interview last week at NCAA headquarters.

It's all part of a jolting reform process designed to change the NCAA – step up rules enforcement in college sports while speeding up the process with a rulebook that's less complex. But it's a mission that has been hounded by resistance to some proposals and controversy, particularly over the handling of the Miami and Penn State cases. While Emmert says he is trying to transform an organization with nearly 1,100 member schools, he's faced lawsuits and accusations of moving too fast, overstepping his bounds and firing employees who thought they were doing what he wanted.

""You get confronted with all the schools and interests (in the NCAA) and all the reasons why things move slowly come up, and it hit him in the face,"" said Jo Potuto, a Nebraska law professor and former chair of the NCAA infractions committee.

Under the supervision of his bosses on the NCAA executive committee, Emmert's task is to lead major reforms at the NCAA. The agenda has three main components, all stemming from a retreat Emmert held with college presidents in August 2011: improve the academic performance of athletes, get tougher on rule-breakers and simplify its notoriously complex rulebook.

Many member schools also wanted reform to help curb the runaway costs in college athletics – an effort that has failed to take off because of disagreement about what to do about it between schools with athletic programs struggling to pay bills versus the powerhouses that drive the price tag ever higher.

Overall, Emmert says the reform effort ""has been quite successful despite all the noise that's been screaming around in the background.""

A progress report:

Academic performance: The NCAA increased the Academic Progress Rate standard and enforced a postseason ban for teams that fall below it. If you're not on track to graduate at least half your players, you don't play in the postseason. ""Sitting here today, I'd say we got an `A' on that one,"" Emmert says.

But there is a side effect that can form in college sports when academic expectations are increased. Some athletes flock toward majors that give them more flexibility to remain eligible for competition. For example, at LSU, where Emmert was chancellor from 1999-2004, the 2004 LSU football media guide listed about 44 of 90 football players as general studies majors. It's an issue that has continued at many schools.

Emmert acknowledged the tradeoff.

""Whenever we increase academic expectations… we run the risk of student-athletes having a more difficult time filling in specific majors, and you see fewer students gravitating toward engineering majors or other majors where they don't have as much flexibility,"" Emmert says. ""It doesn't surprise me.""

Rules enforcement: More rules enforcement staff has led to more infractions cases. The rate of major infractions cases under Emmert is more than double that of longtime NCAA chief Walter Byers, who retired in 1987, according to NCAA data. Of the 48 major infractions cases under Emmert, 13 were in major college football and another 13 were in Division I men's basketball

""We set up a penalty structure that reinforced the serious concerns – those infractions that were serious threats to integrity – in a way that the penalty structure was shifted so there was much greater emphasis on those and not so much worry about little things,"" Emmert says.

Emmert said this effort is ""on track."" But more aggressive enforcement has brought controversy. The NCAA lacks subpoena power – the power to compel witnesses to cooperate. Instead, ""innovative"" investigative techniques were encouraged, at least until they backfired during the NCAA's recent investigation of the University of Miami football program. In that case, an NCAA investigator arranged to pay the attorney of a Miami booster to gather evidence through the booster's bankruptcy court proceeding.

After the tactic became public, Emmert and Miami President Donna Shalala condemned it. The investigator was fired, and so was the NCAA's vice president for enforcement, Julie Roe Lach, who recently was replaced by attorney Jon Duncan on an interim basis. To critics, it seemed Emmert was feigning outrage and sacrificing his subordinates in the face of criticism over his own agenda. Moreover, what innovative tools can the NCAA use to gather evidence and stay on the right side of ethics?

""That's a conversation we're having right now in the enforcement department,"" Duncan told USA TODAY Sports last month.

Deregulation: In 1952, the NCAA published its first rulebook. It was 25 pages and included just three paragraphs to regulate recruiting. In 1977, the rulebook had grown to 148 pages. In 1987, it was 299. Now it's over 700 pages covering three divisions. The Division I rulebook is ""overly complex,"" Emmert says.

Emmert says the effort to reduce it is making ""good progress, but we're going have to debate some of the more controversial pieces and see where they go.""

It probably won't be easy.

One example came recently when coaches and athletic directors objected to NCAA plans to deregulate restrictions on recruiting staff size and printed materials that can be sent to recruits. Without limits, many coaches and athletic directors grew concerned it would lead to an ""arms race"" to outdo and outspend the competition, more like the NFL.

""Historically any time the association has tried to have any significant reform, it learns those rules were all put there for a reason,"" former NCAA President Cedric Dempsey told USA TODAY Sports.

Misunderstood job?

Emmert says the hardest part of his presidency so far is dispelling what he says are ""mythologies"" about the way the NCAA makes decisions and the power of his office. Unlike the heads of pro sports leagues, Emmert does not decide punishments. He also doesn't make the rules. Those generally are the duties of the NCAA's committee on infractions and the representatives of NCAA schools.

""I always tell people, Don't think about it as a command-control structure,'"" Emmert said of the NCAA's balance of power. ""Think of it like the United Nations. The decision-making structure looks and feels much more like that. In many ways, it's more complex than Congress.""

Some Penn State supporters argue the structure is less democratic than that. Last year, the NCAA slammed Penn State with a four-year bowl ban and $60 million fine last year related to the alleged cover-up of child sex abuse by former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.

Instead of investigating the case on its own, the NCAA bypassed its judicial arm -- the NCAA infractions committee – and accepted the findings of an investigation commissioned by the university. The case was fast-tracked by Emmert, the NCAA executive committee and the Division I board of directors. Penn State ultimately agreed to the penalties under the threat of even harsher punishment from the NCAA.

The state of Pennsylvania is now suing the NCAA, saying the aggressive action was an overreach to ""boost the reputation and power of the NCAA's president.""

Yet, to some degree, Emmert is herding cats – nearly 1,100 schools have 1,100 different and often conflicting interests. At the same time, critics wonder where the buck stops at the NCAA when things go wrong. Emmert is the public face of the NCAA but often notes the limitations on his power. He also points out the NCAA president doesn't get involved in infractions cases.

""It is as if each entity or individual within the (NCAA) system can point a finger at another entity or individual actor,"" says Richard Southall, director of the College Sport Research Institute at the University of North Carolina.

Southall described it as a ""deflection of responsibility."" To Emmert, he is serving the wishes of his membership.

""I think it's important to differentiate Mark Emmert's agenda, from what's the membership's agenda,"" he says. ""The confusion that occurs most frequently with the NCAA is people tend to think of the NCAA as like the NFL or NBA. In fact, we're this very complex 1,100-member voluntary association, and every rule, every policy, every bylaw is a creature of that membership.""

The legislation%2C affecting seven million students this year%2C would tie loan rates to the financial markets

The Republican-controlled House is expected to pass it before the August break

President Obama %22strongly supports%22 the bill%2C the White House said Wednesday

WASHINGTON--Despite strong opposition from liberals, the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate approved a bill Wednesday to tie federal college loan rates to financial markets to retroactively roll back an unpopular July 1 rate hike.

The bipartisan legislation was approved 81-18.

The GOP-controlled U.S. House is expected to approve the legislation before the August recess. President Obama supports the bill and commended the bipartisan effort that produced it, the White House said in a statement issued Wednesday. The legislation will affect seven million students heading to college this fall.

The bill will bring down interest rates for subsidized Stafford loans in the short-term. These rates doubled to 6.8% on July 1 because Congress could not come to terms on an agreement ahead of that deadline. Under the legislation, undergraduates will be able to borrow at 3.9% for this school year; graduate students at 5.4%, and parents at 6.4%.

Liberal Democrats are wary that the legislation could allow interest rates to rise above 6.8% in future years as the financial markets recover and interest rates rise.

""The truth of the matter is, if the bill on the floor passes without amendment, it would be a disaster for the young people of our country who are looking to go to college and for the parents who are looking to help pay their bills,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who voted against the bill. Sanders offered an amendment to sunset the legislation in two years, but it was rejected.

The legislation includes loan interest rate caps at 8.25% for undergraduates, 9.5% for graduates, and 10.5% for parents. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates rates would not hit the rate caps within the next decade.

An effort by Sens. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to put tighter interest rates caps on student loans was also rejected. Reed and Warren also voted against the bill.

Instead of Congress continuing to set interest rates on student loans, future borrowers will see their loans tied to the U.S. Treasury 10-year borrowing rate. The legislation creates a three tier systems, to charging an additional 1.85% for undergraduate Stafford loans, 3.4% for graduate Stafford loans, and 4.4% for PLUS loans, which parents can take for their children. The interest rate would be fixed over the life of the loan.

The legislation provided a rare area of accord between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans. The president included a similar proposal in his budget this year, which House Republicans touted in initial legislation.

House Speaker John Boehner's office noted the similarities between the House GOP proposal and the final bill. ""A victory indeed, and one that shows when we have common ground, we should seize it on behalf of the people we serve,"" said a blog posted Wednesday on the speaker's official Web site."

States would have done almost anything for extra money, and when the Obama administration dangled Race to the Top grants in front of them, many of them did indeed race to adopt the policies that would win federal approval — such as including student test scores in teachers’ performance rankings and adopting common curriculum standards.

Because public education falls almost entirely under state authority, this sort of arm-twisting was the only way the administration could persuade states to do its bidding. The No Child Left Behind Act, the school accountability law adopted during the George W. Bush administration, also used money — federal Title 1 funding for disadvantaged students — to press its rigid standards on states.

Race to the Top pressured financially strapped states to adopt education policies that varied widely in their value. Many of the policies, such as the push to tie teacher evaluations to student test scores, were not backed by any sort of evidence. Yet they were adopted quickly because of application deadlines, and there was little time for thoughtful crafting of new rules.

EDUCATION: California Schools Guide

Yet for all the excitement, Race to the Top provided little actual cash. California would have received a one-time award of $700 million — less than 2% of what it spends on education every year. It failed to win a grant, but nonetheless had committed itself, as most states did, to the Common Core curriculum standards that the Obama administration supported. Implementing the standards, which are set to take effect in a year, will cost the state well over $1 billion.

Was adopting Common Core a mistake? A lot depends on how well it’s carried out. In theory, the new standards, which cover only math and English for the moment, look promising. They’re intended to foster more analytical thinking and polished writing — important preparation for higher education — and to minimize rote memorization. At the same time, there are valid concerns about mandates to reduce the amount of fiction read in English classes and about material that won’t be taught because of the focus on learning fewer subjects in more depth. Implementation so far has not been promising. Schools in New York state have been rattled by the start of Common Core-based tests even though the curriculum isn’t in place and the teachers haven’t been trained. As Los Angeles Times staff writer Howard Blume recently reported, there have been missteps in California, such as when schools in the Santa Ana Unified School District tried to start the new curriculum before the state had approved its own version or adopted instructional materials.

Advertisement

Now that the costs and complications of Common Core are becoming better known, both liberals and conservatives have expressed some buyer’s remorse. School administrators and teachers say it will be a long time before schools will be up to speed on the new curriculum, and that it would be unfair to judge schools and teachers based on the tests during the early years of implementation. Tea party Republicans complain about the federal government’s interference in curriculum, and a few states have withheld funding for the start of the new standards — though no one forced them into this to begin with.

Resistance among conservatives seems to be more about picking a winnable battle against President Obama than providing the best possible education for students. Concern that the rollout of the new standards is moving too fast for thoughtful, successful implementation is better grounded; we’d rather see a smoother, more successful implementation than further disruption in schools. In any case, test results during the first years should not be counted until teachers have gained training and experience in the new curriculum and the kinks have been worked out.

Whether Common Core will provide the promised results remains to be seen, but the ruckus over it — as well as over other reforms passed in an effort to win Race to the Top grants — shows this much: States are better off adopting new educational policies because they’ve been shown to work better for students rather than because they come with a financial prize attached."

White student%27s case against University of Texas took eight months to decide

First major ruling on racial preferences at universities in 10 years

Case was one of the biggest on high court%27s docket for 2012-13

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court drew new limits on colleges' use of affirmative action Monday, saying that although racial preferences remain constitutional, they are permissible only if schools can first show that there are ""no workable race-neutral alternatives.""

The court's 7-1 decision, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, suggests that public schools can use affirmative action only as a last resort for creating a diverse student body, and raises the prospect that colleges will face a tougher burden of justifying them in the future.

But the justices stopped short of issuing a broader decision either fully cementing or eliminating schools' ability to take account of an applicant's race.

Kennedy wrote that public universities could adopt affirmative action plans only if they can demonstrate that ""no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the benefits of educational diversity.""

The decision came in a closely watched challenge to the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policy that is based, in part, on applicants' race. But the justices declined to decide whether the university's program met that tough new standard.

Instead, they said that a lower federal court had acted too deferentially by, in essence, taking the university's word for the fact that such preferences were necessary. They instructed the lower court to hear the case again, and this time to require the university to prove that it had no other way to assemble a diverse student body.

""Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a school's assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without a court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the process works in practice,"" Kennedy wrote. ""The university must prove that the means chosen by the university to attain diversity are narrowly tailored to that goal.""

Kennedy was joined by the court's conservative justice and two of its liberals, Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a four-page dissent, saying the lower court already had enough evidence. Even the university's purportedly race-neutral method of accepting the top 10% of students from all high schools uses race as a factor, she said, because of segregated neighborhoods.

""Only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternatives as race-unconscious,"" she said. ""It is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that drives such plans.""

Why it took more than eight months to issue what was a fairly short, 13-page decision remained a mystery Monday, raising images of the justices pushing and pulling Kennedy, the court's perennial swing vote. In the end, the ruling was unremarkable in its likely effect, keeping the court in between proponents and opponents of racial preferences.

NEXT STEP UP TO LOWER COURTS, SCHOOLS

How the decision will play out remains to be seen, and could depend on how well colleges are able to justify their policies to lower courts. The decision left in place -- at least for now -- the University of Texas' affirmative action plan.

Advocates on both sides of the often-fraught debate over the use of race in higher education said they saw reasons for optimism, even if none of them got precisely what they wanted from the court.

""It's extremely disappointing that the Supreme Court did not affirm the constitutionality of the University of Texas affirmative action plan,"" said Barbara Arnwine, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""But it's not a total loss because for the time being, the University of Texas plan is still in place.""

Edward Blum, who was instrumental in bringing the case to the high court as head of the Project on Fair Representation, said the decision almost certainly spells the end of affirmative action at the University of Texas at Austin and other schools.

""The Supreme Court has established exceptionally high hurdles for the University of Texas and other universities and colleges to overcome if they intend to continue using race preferences in their admissions policies,"" he said. ""It is unlikely that most institutions will be able to overcome these hurdles.""

Abigail Fisher, the woman who challenged Texas' plan, said in a statement, ""I am grateful to the justices for moving the nation closer to the day when a student's race isn't used at all in college admissions.""

A decision calling into question the continued use of race in college admissions had been widely anticipated in light of the court's ruling in 2003 narrowly upholding the University of Michigan's use of racial preferences. At that time, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said such programs should be obsolete within 25 years; O'Connor, who has since left the court, was on hand when Kennedy announced Monday's decision.

Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, said they were prepared to declare affirmative action unconstitutional. Thomas, the court's lone African American, wrote in a separate opinion that in his view, ""use of race in higher education admissions decisions is categorically prohibited."" He said admissions policies that help blacks can work against them by placing them at universities where they cannot succeed, so that ""the university's racial tinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping.""

But none of the other justices seemed ready to adopt that view.

ABBY FISHER'S DENIAL TRIGGERED LAWSUIT

Denied admission to the University of Texas in 2008, Fisher claimed her only fault was being white. ""I didn't take this sitting down,"" she said before oral arguments last October.

""There were people in my class with lower grades who weren't in all the activities I was in who were being accepted into UT, and the only other difference between us was the color of our skin,"" she said in a video posted by the Project on Fair Representation, a conservative group that solicited her case. ""For an institution of higher learning to act this way makes no sense to me.""

The university's policy was to accept the top 10% of students from each Texas high school, which because of housing patterns produced a relatively diverse class. It then filled out its freshman class by assessing a number of factors including race – a system it said was devoid of quotas or numerical targets but was designed to achieve what it called ""critical mass.""

The school — backed by others that use affirmative action programs to increase the percentage of minorities gaining admission — argued that a diverse student body contributes to a well-rounded educational experience for all.

It was supported by 73 ""friend of the court"" briefs filed by a broad array of universities, student groups and athletics coaches, as well as federal, state and local government officials, business executives and retired military leaders. They argued that diversity in education is needed to assure a steady stream of qualified minority applicants for public service, private enterprise and the armed forces.

Though the court upheld the University of Michigan law school's affirmative action program in 2003, it struck down the undergraduate school's program and cautioned that the days of racial preferences should be numbered. It has since accepted for its next term the state of Michigan's defense of its constitutional amendment barring racial preferences in education, employment and contracting.

Since the 2003 decision, the court has taken a turn to the right, thanks to Justice Samuel Alito replacing O'Connor. By the time the Texas case was argued in October, five justices were on record opposing racial preferences.

For that reason, college administrators and civil rights groups feared that the court could issue a sweeping declaration against such preferences affecting not only public universities but possibly private schools, such as Harvard and Yale, that receive federal funds.

Still, Monday's decision reaffirmed that educational diversity remains a compelling government interest, freeing public schools to use otherwise impermissible racial classifications.

""While the decision requires the university to jump through additional hoops to demonstrate that their methods for creating diversity are appropriate, it does reaffirm diversity as a compelling interest,"" said Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress.

ROOTS IN 1950 INTEGRATION CASE

The case hearkened back to 1950, when Heman Sweatt sued the university after being denied admission because he was black. As his attorney, Sweatt chose Thurgood Marshall, who would go on to become the high court's first black justice. He won the case, marking the first time the court had ordered a black student admitted to an all-white institution.

Since then, colleges and universities have become more integrated. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the court's 5-4 decision upholding the Michigan law school's limited use of affirmative action, O'Connor predicted, ""The court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.""

That case wasn't a slam dunk for the civil rights movement. At the same time, the court ruled 6-3 against the undergraduate school's more numerical system of racial preferences. And O'Connor's decision upholding the law school's racial preferences included a dissent from Kennedy, now the swing vote on the court.

""Preferment by race, when resorted to by the state, can be the most divisive of all policies, containing within it the potential to destroy confidence in the Constitution and in the idea of equality,"" Kennedy said then.

Four years later, in a decision that barred voluntary integration programs in the Seattle and Louisville public schools, Chief Justice John Roberts issued one of his most oft-quoted lines: ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.""

Two members of the court were being watched closely in this case: Justice Thomas, the lone black justice, who has written that his Yale Law School degree was devalued by racial preferences; and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the lone Hispanic, whose recent book, My Beloved World, credits affirmative action for giving her access to Princeton and Yale.

In the end, the ruling was so narrow that both Thomas and Sotomayor signed on.

Kagan recused herself from the case, presumably because she was involved with it during her tenure as solicitor general at the Justice Department in 2009-10.

http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/03/what-finland-can-teach-america-about-education/,2013-12-03 00:00:00,[],What Finland can teach America about education,"Fareed speaks with journalist Amanda Ripley, author of 'The Smartest Kids in the World and How They Got That Way,' about what other countries can teach the U.S. about education. Watch the video for the full interview.

America is exceptional in many ways. Sadly, secondary education is not one of them. The most recent rankings for the Program for International Student Assessment has American 15 year-olds ranked 14th in reading, 17th in science and 25th in math, among other developed nations. Countries like Finland and South Korea always rank near the top.

In a 2011 GPS special, we went to those two countries to see what they were doing differently. Investigative journalist Amanda Ripley went one step further. She followed some American kids as they spent a year abroad in high school in those two countries and in Poland. The results are fascinating. The book is called The Smartest Kids in the World and How They Got That Way.

Amanda Ripley joins me now. So what did you find about those three countries that struck you? You actually have three models that you say that they represent. What are they?

So, South Korea is the pressure cooker model. The extreme case of what you see all over Asia, where kids are working night and day, literally, under a lot of family pressure, to get very high test scores. Now, South Korea does get those high test scores, but at great cost. So that’s one, the pressure cooker model.

Finland is, in many ways, the opposite extreme of South Korea. Not in all ways, but in some. And Finland is what I call the utopia model – they've really invested in quality over quantity and the kids are, on average, doing less homework than our kids, but still achieving at the very top of the world on tests of critical thinking and math, reading and science, with very little variation from school to school or from socioeconomic status from one to the other.

And why did you choose Poland?

Poland is the surprise. Poland is an example of the metamorphosis, a country that has a high rate of child poverty and plenty of trouble and trauma in its background, and yet has radically improved its education outcomes over the past 10 years.

So Poland is not yet at the level of Finland or Korea, but a place that shows that there is hope. You know, change happens, even in places with problems. So in a way, looking at Poland is almost like going back in time and looking at Finland and Korea 50 years ago.

Talk a little bit more about the Finland model, because that's the one that's the most intriguing. What makes Finland work? Why are those test scores so high?

It's remarkable to everyone, including everyone in Finland. They can't quite believe it, year after year. One thing that they've done that's very clear and is very unusual around the world is, in the late 1960s, they shut down their teacher training colleges, which were like ours, of highly variable selectivity and quality. And they reopened them in the top eight most elite universities in the land as part of a broader reform of higher education.

More from CNN: Shanghai schools the best in the world?

When they did that, it set off a series of cascading consequences that I don't even know that they realized. One thing that happened is the obvious – you eventually have teachers who, themselves, have the advantage of a very strong education, which makes it easier to teach higher order thinking skills.

And they're, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they draw their teachers from the top 10 or 20 percent of the graduating class. We tend to draw teachers from the bottom third.

Yes. Thank you. We educate twice as many teachers as we need. And in many, many of these colleges, there's a very low bar for entry. So you don't have to have very good grades yourself in order to get in. And that's true around the world, actually. That's very common.

So Finland is unusual.

Finland is unusual, yes, for doing that. But I think what's really surprising about it, and what I noticed when I spent time with kids in Finland, is that the kids pick up on this. So there's a signaling effect, like economists would say, where you know how hard it is to get into teacher training colleges.

And that alone isn't enough, but it sends this message to everyone – the parents, the taxpayers, the politicians and the students – that this is serious, that you are serious about education and that teaching is really hard, not just in rhetoric, but in reality. And so it adds this credibility to the whole enterprise that helps kids buy into the promise of education.

You also point out something about all these countries – and this is true of all three of them – which is, there is almost no sports in the best schools in the world.

Right. Kids play sports, but not in school. It's sort of separate from school – pickup games or community rec centers, but it’s not a part of the core mission of school. This is controversial. I get in a lot of trouble when I talk about this, because Americans love their sports and American kids love their sports. And when I surveyed hundreds of exchange students, you know, they all agreed that sports were more important to their American peers than their peers back home.

But many of them actually really like that. They liked that there was this school spirit and this bonding. The problem is that sports can sometimes, if you don't constantly keep it contained, eat away at the mission of school, which is supposed to be education, right?

So when we are routinely spending two to three times per football player what we spend per math student, when we routinely have teachers leaving to go coach away games and have to bring in substitutes, and we're spending tens of thousands of dollars on buses for the marching band, that's something that should be weighed against the benefit.

It seemed to me, what you really said is that the systems are quite different in all these three countries, the structures are different. The one thing that's true is there's a psychology that says school is hard. You've got to spend a lot of time at it. You've got to work hard. You've got to succeed. And that's missing in America.

It's almost exactly the same attitude many of us take towards sports, towards academics. It's literally: this is important, there's a big contest at the end, not everyone is going to win. To get better, critically, you have to practice and work harder, you know, and get more help. But you're not innately just bad at math.

So that's a really powerful combination, when you take that intensity on education, when you make it rigorous through highly trained, highly supported teachers and then back it up. Kids know if this is bogus or not.

Did it leave you depressed about America?

No. Actually, oddly, I felt more optimistic when I came back than when I left. I feel like, you know, we have 45 states that have now adopted the common core state standards. Big fights still happening and still to come about that. But those are more rigorous in math and reading, which is much more aligned, particularly in math, with what these countries are doing. It's an obvious first step. Not enough, but exciting that it's even happening in 45 states. I mean that's a huge deal for America.

And I think, you know, more and more people are starting to talk about the quality of our education colleges. To get into education college in Finland is like getting into MIT in the United States. And imagine what could follow if that were true here. I mean you could make a case to pay teachers more, to give them more freedom in the classroom, and to finally give that profession the respect it deserves.

Good luck getting sports out, though.

Yes, forget about that. That's never going to happen.

Amanda Ripley, a pleasure to have you on.

Thank you."

Columbus, Ohio (CNN) - President Obama told graduates Sunday that ""the institutions that give structure to our society have at times betrayed your trust"" but called on young people to take a more active role in the political process as part of the solution.

Obama delivered his first commencement address of the spring to nearly 10,000 graduates at The Ohio State University in Columbus. He urged students to reject the ""voices"" that ""incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that's the root of our all our problems, even as they do their best to gum up the works.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

On the stage in Ohio Stadium, Obama told the crowd that ""your democracy does not function without your active participation. At a bare minimum, that means voting, eagerly and often. It means knowing who's been elected to make decisions on your behalf, what they believe in and whether or not they deliver.""

His comments came exactly one year after Obama went to the heart of the key battleground state of Ohio to officially kick off his re-election campaign with a rally at The Ohio State University.

On Sunday he called for voters to hold officials accountable, saying, ""if they let you down, there's a built-in day in November where you can really let them know that's not OK.""

""I'm not going to get partisan, because that's not what citizenship is about,"" the president said. And he invoked the words President George W. Bush used in a graduation address in the same stadium, saying, ""America needs more than taxpayers, spectators and occasional voters. America needs full-time citizens.""

But Obama seemed to refer to the congressional defeat of stronger background checks for gun buyers and other parts of his domestic agenda when he told the graduates, ""when we abdicate that authority, we grant our silent consent to someone who'll gladly claim it. That's how we end up with lobbyists who set the agenda, policies detached from what middle-class families face every day, the well-connected who publicly demand that Washington stay out of their business, then whisper in its ear for special treatment that you don't get. That's how a small minority of lawmakers get cover to defeat something the vast majority of their constituents want.""

The president's remarks came as the administration vowed that the defeat of the background check measure was not the end of the fight. Obama spoke out on the gun issue on his trip to Mexico City last week, and Vice President Joe Biden wrote a Sunday opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle as the National Rifle Association met there.

Obama called on graduates on ""harness the ingenuity of your generation"" to tackle issues like gun violence, climate change, road and airport repairs and education. ""We can always aspire to something more. That doesn't depend on who you elect to office. It depends upon you as citizens, how big you want to be, and how badly you want it.

""I dare you to do better"", he added, ""I dare you to be better. From what I have seen of your generation, I have no doubt you will"".

In his Ohio State speech, Obama said he's been ""obsessed"" with the idea of keeping citizenship alive at the national level, ""not just on Election Day or in times of tragedy,"" because he spends most of his time in Washington, ""a place that sorely needs it.""

He told the students ""you don't have to run for office yourself,"" later saying, ""only you can ultimately break the cycle.""

In lighter moments during the commencement, Obama donned a black hat with an Ohio State O on it. He joked about speaking at archrival University of Michigan graduation in 2010, referring to a ""certain university up north.""

To laughs, he said he had been to OSU's campus five times recently and added, ""to be fair, you did let President Ford speak here once, and he played football for Michigan.""

Obama teased students about eating breakfast so late, at 11:30 a.m. when he dropped by a campus eatery during one stop. But he mispronounced the name of Sloopy's, named for the song that's an OSU tradition. He asked for forgiveness, noting that it's a Sunday after a foreign trip. He returned from Costa Rica on Saturday evening."

Follow Him On Twitter At""]",Common Core critics warn of fuzzy math and less fiction,"If the new national Common Core educational standards influence curriculum the way some fear they will, students can say goodbye to literary classics and hello to fuzzy math, say critics.

The Common Core State Standards initiative, a plan devised by the nation's governors and backed by the Obama administration, seeks to set a uniform standard for grades K-12, to ensure kids all over the nation reach the same minimum level of learning. Some 45 states, in many cases enticed by federal grants, have signed on and testing of students in grades 3-8 and once in high school is scheduled to begin next year.

Supporters say Common Core only tests students in math and English, but critics say school districts will devise curriculum to maximize their students' performance on the national exams, and, in fact, have already begun that measure. And those same critics claim Common Core math standards barely cover basic geometry or second-year algebra and that the classics are all but ignored in English classes.

“The math standard focuses on investigative math, which has been shown to be a disaster,” Glyn Wright, executive director of Eagle Forum, told FoxNews.com. “With the new math standard in the Common Core, there are no longer absolute truths. So 3 times 4 can now equal 11 so long as a student can effectively explain how they reached that answer.”

Stanford Prof. James Milgram, the only mathematician on the Common Core Validation Committee, refused to sign off on the math standards, calling the whole thing “in large measure a political document” during testimony he gave in May 2011 in which he advocated for Texas not to adopt the Common Core standards.

“I had considerable influence on the mathematics standards in the document. However, as is often the case, there was input from many other sources -- including State Departments of Education -- that had to be incorporated into the standards,” he said during the testimony.

[pullquote]

“A number of these sources were mainly focused on things like making the standards as non-challenging as possible. Others were focused on making sure their favorite topics were present, and handled in the way they liked,” he also said, adding that it led to a number of “extremely serious failings” in the Common Core that made it premature for any state hoping to improve math scores to implement them and that the Core Math standards were designed to reflect very low expectations.

But an official for the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, which backs Common Core, says the new standards have the opposite effect and can actually encourage critical thinking in students. She denied that the standards allow for wrong answers, but said the emphasis is on the process.

“One of the things we learned from research, and there’s a lot of it out there, is that kids do not necessarily learn from the algorithmic method,” Linda Gojak, president of the NCTM said to FoxNews.com. “The assessment is that it is more about kids making sense of what they are learning instead of memorizing a step-by-step process.”

But Wright believes critical thinking could actually be a casualty of Common Core.

“We think the goal of education is to make individual thinkers of our children,” she said. “The Common Core does the opposite. The [literacy] standard severely de-emphasizes classic literature which will surely lower critical thinking.”

Timothy Shanahan, a professor at the University of Illinois who also was part of an independent expert panel that reviewed the standards, speculates why many are opposed to Common Core.

“The reason that this criticism is coming up is because the Common Core is promoting greater attention to science, history and other informational texts,” he said to FoxNews.com. “Studies show that American kids do better with stories than with science or history materials, placing them at a real disadvantage in international economic competition.”

Because the actual Common Core exams have not yet been formulated, there is no list of what literature students may or may not be tested on. But critics say the stated policy of emphasizing ""informational,"" or non-fiction reading, in English will inevitably come at the expense of literature classics. Those time-tested books are not simply fun to read, according to Brigham Young University English Prof. Alan Manning, they teach students how to write.

""An argument can be made that any improvement in reading/writing instruction should include more rather than fewer exercises where students write stories themselves that are modeled on the classics,"" Manning wrote in an e-mail to Utah activists opposed to Common Core. ""This creates a more stable foundation on which students can build skills for other kinds of writing. The Core standards would prevent public schools from testing these kinds of approaches.""

But Shanahan rejects the premise that more non-fiction will mean less fiction.

“Common core doesn't downgrade literature in our schools, but it does push for a big increase in those other kinds of reading,” he added.

While Common Core has plenty of defenders -- and may prove beneficial -- the main criticism is that it is not the federal government's job to impose educational standards, say critics. Finding out what works is the job of local districts, working with parents, they say.

“The bottom line is that the Common Core Initiative is nationalized education -- to which we are starkly opposed,” Wright also said. “Formerly, parents would have control over what their children are being taught in the classroom, but under Common Core everything comes down from a central, national group. Because the tests and standards are copyright and must be used as-is, parents will not be able to control the material on which their children are taught and tested.”

Groups that support Common Core disagree.

“Just because you have state standards, doesn’t mean a district will have a standardized curriculum,” Chad Colby, a spokesman for education non-profit Achieve, told FoxNews.com.

“Many states already have standards in place and curriculum varies district to district and even school to school,” he added, referring to the state standards in Arkansas which have been in place for 20 years but allows every school to independently choose their curriculum.

“The common core doesn’t tell you how to teach students,"" Colby said. ""The curriculum will still be at the state level.”"

Mr. Obama, dressed in shirt sleeves, was showered with cheers by the visibly energized students and a cadre of New York politicians as he took the podium at Pathways in Technology Early College High School. “Hello Brooklyn,” he said, before starting into his argument for creating more schools like the one he was visiting, casting them as essential in preparing the next generation for competition in a shrinking world marketplace.

“This country should be doing everything in our power to give more kids the chance to go to schools just like this one,” the president said, calling the school, known as P-Tech, a ticket into the middle class.

“In previous generations, America’s standing economically was so much higher than everybody else’s that we didn’t have a lot of competition,” he added. “Now, you’ve got billions of people from Beijing to Bangalore to Moscow, all of whom are competing with you directly.

School officials on reservations across Minnesota have begun making painful cuts to the current budget in anticipation of sequester cuts, adding students to classrooms, slashing course offerings and leaving vacant jobs unfilled, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. At least one reservation is considering shortening the school year to save money.

“There’s a real sense of frustration for everybody,” Red Lake Superintendent Steve Wymore told the newspaper.

[pullquote]

State education advocates say the cuts could threaten hard-won progress made by Native Americans. Last year saw graduation rates at 22 Native American school districts rise 3 percentage points, up to about 45 percent.

“It is indefensible that the first wave of reckless sequestration cuts to education will hit our most vulnerable students,” U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., who co-chairs the Congressional Native American Caucus, told the newspaper.

But in Washington, education funding cuts did not stop the appointment this month of a former elementary school teacher and aide to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. to the job of executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African-Americans. David Johns was given the newly created job, where he will be “asked to identify evidence-based best practices to improve African-American student achievement from cradle to career,” according to the Department of Education.

The goal of the initiative is to work with federal, state and local agencies, as well as community groups, to ""produce a more effective continuum of education programs for African-American students.""

Previously, the White House has created similar initiatives to serve Hispanics, Asian-American and Pacific Islanders and American Indian and Native Americans and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. While all of these may be well-intended, the latest job was announced on March 7, barely a week after the sequester cuts were locked into place.

Johns had been serving as a senior education policy adviser to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Before that, he was a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Fellow in Rangel’s office. Johns’ salary in the new job is $123,758, according to a department official.

Outside the beltway, budget cuts are taking a visible toll. The department must cut 5 percent from all education programs to comply with the Budget Control Act, commonly known as sequestration. While most school districts are funded with local taxes, those on tax-exempt Native American lands depend on federal funding.

The selective austerity shown by the Department of Education and other federal agencies shows the Obama administration is trying to emphasize the budget cuts' effect on the public, said Kyle Olson, founder of the Michigan-based education watchdog Education Action Group.

""It seems like there's no rhyme or reason for the cuts that they're making,"" Olson said. ""They are trying to maximize the public effect -- the pain -- in order to make their point. But the fact of the matter is, the sequester is not a cut, it is a reduction in the rate of growth. The choices they're making are absurd."""

(JONATHAN ERNST/REUTERS)

College campuses are supposed to be marketplaces of ideas. But some ideas, and some people, are less welcome than others these days. Just ask Robert Zoellick and Ben Carson.

Zoellick, the former World Bank president, and Carson, the world-renowned Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon, have withdrawn as college commencement speakers in the past week following protests from students and professors. Zoellick accepted and then turned down an invitation from Swarthmore College — his alma mater — after students objected to his support of the Iraq war and his record at the World Bank; Carson this week reconsidered his invitation from Johns Hopkins after a furor over his remarks lumping together homosexuality, pedophilia and bestiality.

Commencement speaker controversies have become so common that they’re practically a springtime ritual, like the opening of the baseball season or the blossoming of daffodils. Figures as diverse as President Obama and actor James Franco, whom some UCLA students knocked as lacking gravitas, have all been the object of graduation brouhahas in recent years.

“Overall, there seems to be an increased sensitivity to things that in the past we might have let it roll off our backs,” says Josh Wheeler, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression, a First Amendment legal policy group at the University of Virginia. “Nowadays, people aren’t afraid to express their objections, which isn’t a bad thing, but people are more willing to censor [speech] to remove the offending speech or language.”

Wheeler refers to this phenomenon as “ the heckler’s veto,” the ability of a small but vocal group to limit the choices of a much larger majority.

“We shouldn’t ignore [protest] but at the same time to allow a minority to determine what we see or hear is very concerning from a free-speech point of view,” Wheeler said. “Too often, it’s easier to eliminate the problem than deal with the controversy.”

Such issues have risen and fallen on college campuses for decades, leading to familiar complaints that the nation’s institutions of higher learning are dens of “political correctness.” The charge is often leveled by conservatives against what they perceive as the liberal orthodoxy of college campuses.

In fact, conservative writer Ann Coulter was forced to cancel an appearance at the University of Ottawa in Canada in 2010 after about 2,000 students crowded the entrance to the hall at which she was scheduled to speak and protested her views. Former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin faced protests from students and controversy over her fees when she was invited to speak at California State University-Stanislaus in 2010, but she went ahead with her appearance.

The recent furors over Carson and Zoellick fit this pattern, too. Carson, a self-described Christian conservative, apologized for remarks he made in a Fox News interview in March in which he said “no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality” had the right to change the traditional definition of marriage.

Students at Hopkins protested his remarks and took up a petition for a new speaker. Despite another apology, Carson decided to withdraw on Wednesday. “My presence is likely to distract from the true celebratory nature of the day,” Carson wrote in an e-mail to the dean of the university’s medical school, Paul Rothman. “Commencement is about the students and their successes, and it is not about me,”

Zoellick, a former George W. Bush administration official, was to have received an honorary degree at Swarthmore, but he also pulled out this week after students mounted a campaign on Facebook calling him an “architect of the Iraq war” and a “war criminal” for his support of the 2003 invasion. Although Zoellick did support the war, he did not plan it; he was Bush’s U.S. trade representative and later worked to resolve the conflict in Darfur as a State Department official. He ran the World Bank from 2007 until last year.

As the attacks on Zoellick mounted last month, Swarthmore’s student newspaper, the Daily Gazette, exercised its own free speech by mocking the controversy. In an April Fool’s Day edition, it wrote that the school “would not be offering degrees to any member of the Class of 2013 who does not intend to found a vegan coffee shop after graduation, calling other professional choices ‘antithetical to Swarthmore values.’ ”

But figures on the left have received similar treatment as well. Weeks of protest by anti-abortion advocates, for example, preceded President Obama’s commencement address at Notre Dame University in 2010. Also that year, the University of Wyoming canceled a speech by former 1960s radical William Ayers after hundreds objected.

Meanwhile, protests flared this week at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law in New York after it gave its “International Advocate for Peace Award” to former president Jimmy Carter on Wednesday. A group of Cardozo alumni set up a Web site calling on the school’s graduates to withdraw their financial support to protest Carter’s criticism of Israel.

At the least, the current climate of protest strikes former university president Robert O’Neil as reasonably civilized. When O’Neil headed the University of Wisconsin in the early 1980s, a student group invited former Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver to speak. His first appearance was canceled because of security concerns; a second appearance led to violence between rival student groups and eight arrests for disorderly conduct. Cleaver cut his speech short.

“What people see as evidence of political correctness [today] is not what’s going on,” says O’Neil, who also ran Indiana University and the University of Virginia during his academic career. “The harshest thing I see is that we engage more in self-censorship, but that’s a long way from succumbing to political correctness. It’s not P.C. to make a special effort to respect people’s beliefs and to try to accommodate them.”

Rather than viewing the campus climate as evidence of growing censorship, O’Neil sees it as more hospitable to open debate. “The discourse is more orderly,” he says. “There’s more willingness to reason. People don’t always agree, and they can disagree aggressively, but that’s how the marketplace of ideas works.”"

Follow Him On Twitter At""]",Common Core critics warn of fuzzy math and less fiction,"If the new national Common Core educational standards influence curriculum the way some fear they will, students can say goodbye to literary classics and hello to fuzzy math, say critics.

The Common Core State Standards initiative, a plan devised by the nation's governors and backed by the Obama administration, seeks to set a uniform standard for grades K-12, to ensure kids all over the nation reach the same minimum level of learning. Some 45 states, in many cases enticed by federal grants, have signed on and testing of students in grades 3-8 and once in high school is scheduled to begin next year.

Supporters say Common Core only tests students in math and English, but critics say school districts will devise curriculum to maximize their students' performance on the national exams, and, in fact, have already begun that measure. And those same critics claim Common Core math standards barely cover basic geometry or second-year algebra and that the classics are all but ignored in English classes.

“The math standard focuses on investigative math, which has been shown to be a disaster,” Glyn Wright, executive director of Eagle Forum, told FoxNews.com. “With the new math standard in the Common Core, there are no longer absolute truths. So 3 times 4 can now equal 11 so long as a student can effectively explain how they reached that answer.”

Stanford Prof. James Milgram, the only mathematician on the Common Core Validation Committee, refused to sign off on the math standards, calling the whole thing “in large measure a political document” during testimony he gave in May 2011 in which he advocated for Texas not to adopt the Common Core standards.

“I had considerable influence on the mathematics standards in the document. However, as is often the case, there was input from many other sources -- including State Departments of Education -- that had to be incorporated into the standards,” he said during the testimony.

[pullquote]

“A number of these sources were mainly focused on things like making the standards as non-challenging as possible. Others were focused on making sure their favorite topics were present, and handled in the way they liked,” he also said, adding that it led to a number of “extremely serious failings” in the Common Core that made it premature for any state hoping to improve math scores to implement them and that the Core Math standards were designed to reflect very low expectations.

But an official for the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, which backs Common Core, says the new standards have the opposite effect and can actually encourage critical thinking in students. She denied that the standards allow for wrong answers, but said the emphasis is on the process.

“One of the things we learned from research, and there’s a lot of it out there, is that kids do not necessarily learn from the algorithmic method,” Linda Gojak, president of the NCTM said to FoxNews.com. “The assessment is that it is more about kids making sense of what they are learning instead of memorizing a step-by-step process.”

But Wright believes critical thinking could actually be a casualty of Common Core.

“We think the goal of education is to make individual thinkers of our children,” she said. “The Common Core does the opposite. The [literacy] standard severely de-emphasizes classic literature which will surely lower critical thinking.”

Timothy Shanahan, a professor at the University of Illinois who also was part of an independent expert panel that reviewed the standards, speculates why many are opposed to Common Core.

“The reason that this criticism is coming up is because the Common Core is promoting greater attention to science, history and other informational texts,” he said to FoxNews.com. “Studies show that American kids do better with stories than with science or history materials, placing them at a real disadvantage in international economic competition.”

Because the actual Common Core exams have not yet been formulated, there is no list of what literature students may or may not be tested on. But critics say the stated policy of emphasizing ""informational,"" or non-fiction reading, in English will inevitably come at the expense of literature classics. Those time-tested books are not simply fun to read, according to Brigham Young University English Prof. Alan Manning, they teach students how to write.

""An argument can be made that any improvement in reading/writing instruction should include more rather than fewer exercises where students write stories themselves that are modeled on the classics,"" Manning wrote in an e-mail to Utah activists opposed to Common Core. ""This creates a more stable foundation on which students can build skills for other kinds of writing. The Core standards would prevent public schools from testing these kinds of approaches.""

But Shanahan rejects the premise that more non-fiction will mean less fiction.

“Common core doesn't downgrade literature in our schools, but it does push for a big increase in those other kinds of reading,” he added.

While Common Core has plenty of defenders -- and may prove beneficial -- the main criticism is that it is not the federal government's job to impose educational standards, say critics. Finding out what works is the job of local districts, working with parents, they say.

“The bottom line is that the Common Core Initiative is nationalized education -- to which we are starkly opposed,” Wright also said. “Formerly, parents would have control over what their children are being taught in the classroom, but under Common Core everything comes down from a central, national group. Because the tests and standards are copyright and must be used as-is, parents will not be able to control the material on which their children are taught and tested.”

Groups that support Common Core disagree.

“Just because you have state standards, doesn’t mean a district will have a standardized curriculum,” Chad Colby, a spokesman for education non-profit Achieve, told FoxNews.com.

“Many states already have standards in place and curriculum varies district to district and even school to school,” he added, referring to the state standards in Arkansas which have been in place for 20 years but allows every school to independently choose their curriculum.

“The common core doesn’t tell you how to teach students,"" Colby said. ""The curriculum will still be at the state level.”"

Children of undocumented immigrants who live in New Jersey will pay same in-state tuition rates currently available to students who are citizens

Gov. Chris Christie will make the bill effective immediately

Tuition assistance grants were not included in the legislation

TRENTON — The Legislature and Gov. Chris Christie reached a compromise on a tuition equality bill that will allow the children of New Jersey's undocumented immigrants to pay in-state rates to attend state colleges and universities.

Senate President Stephen M. Sweeney announced the compromise, in which a Democratic proposal to include tuition assistance grants to the legislation will be scrapped, during a news conference at the Statehouse before the Senate and Assembly sessions on Thursday. Christie's administration signaled just before Sweeney's event that it would accept a compromise and sign the bill immediately.

""I would have loved to have had the TAG grant. ... The only piece of this bill that didn't survive is the TAG grant,"" said Sweeney, D-Gloucester. ""I'm disappointed with that, but I still view this as a victory for young people that are Americans in everything but on paper.""

Under the compromise, the bill was passed by the Assembly Thursday, was conditionally vetoed by Christie and then both houses of the Legislature concurred with the governor's changes. Christie was scheduled to sign the bill Friday.

The governor said that one other change he would make in the bill would be to make it effective immediately.

Under current law, children of undocumented immigrants who live in New Jersey are not eligible for the lower in-state tuition rates currently available to students who are citizens. The compromise bill would extend the in-state rates to children of the undocumented, a change that advocates have labeled ""tuition equality.""

Some conservatives have pointed to Christie's backing of tuition equality as kowtowing to a liberal constituency and raised the specter that his position may come back to haunt him in any bid for the GOP nomination for president in 2016.

Tuition equality advocates, however, slammed Christie for demanding that the TAG grants be removed from the bill and for his rejection of criticism by Giancarlo Tello of the New Jersey Dream Act Coalition, who said that the governor only wanted to give him and others ""crumbs.""

""If they want more, I'm sorry,"" Christie said. ""But they're getting a lot more than they've ever gotten before because I believe it's in the best interests of the people of this state to do it. But you can't be a second-class citizen if you're not a citizen in the first place.""

Sweeney said the compromise would help DREAM act students get in-state tuition rates immediately. He said the assistance grants would be taken up again in the future.

Sen. Teresa Ruiz, D-Essex, said the practical impact of the compromise is that the next generation of New Jersey leaders will now have an easier time getting a college education and a better shot at success.

""I'll finally be able to go back to school,"" Tello agreed.

""I've been a resident of New Jersey now for 17 years — since first grade. … I'm proud of that. I'm proud of the Garden State,"" Tello said. ""This is the state where I grew up in. This is the state I call home. This is the state ... I want to work in.""

Tello, too, said his group would be back to fight for tuition assistance grants.

Christie had signaled that he would veto the Senate version of the bill because he felt the benefits included in it went far beyond providing in-state tuition rates for children of undocumented immigrants. He previously said he was in favor of a state version of the so-called DREAM act, and Democrats had lashed out at Christie for saying he would veto the Senate bill.

But Sweeney said negotiations with the administration had produced the compromise announced Thursday. Christie, in an afternoon, said he budged on the issue of out-of-state students boarding at New Jersey schools being allowed to qualify for the in-state tuition. In the end, he said, his strongest objection to the bill remained the tuition assistance grants.

Christie criticized those who said his support for tuition equality and subsequent objections to the Senate bill were political calculations in an election year. He said those who claimed his motives were political owed him an apology.

""What we've done here is to put forward exactly what I said I wanted to do, which was to responsibly and affordably implement tuition equality for all students in New Jersey,"" Christie said.

As governor decades ago, he shook up the UC Regents with such unconventional board appointments as music mogul David Geffen, a local YMCA director and a Zen Buddhist porpoise expert. He said faculty pay should be reduced because professors derive “psychic income” from their job.

Now he is challenging the UC and Cal State systems again -- minus the eccentricity. Brown hopes to use state purse strings to force down their expenses, hold the line on tuition and fees, and graduate more students more quickly.

He wants more teaching, less research and more online courses to save money and increase offerings. He says more students should be accepted from California’s community colleges.

The universities must “reconfigure themselves so that they are more effective and they’re able to do excellent work, but do it in a way that will not keep the costs escalating,” said the governor, who attended UC Berkeley.

It is unclear whether the schools will go along. The public universities are among the few areas to which Sacramento devotes a great deal of money without much say in how it is spent -- particularly in the UC system, whose independence is enshrined in California’s Constitution. Relationships between governors and the two systems can be rocky.

In the state budget he proposed last week, Brown increased money for the two systems by more than $250 million each -- less than they requested, but enough to avert tuition hikes in the fall, leaders of both systems have indicated. If they want more in the future, the governor said, they’ll need to do as he asks.

Brown, who sits on the boards of both systems, will make his pitch to UC Regents in San Francisco on Wednesday and to the Cal State University Board of Trustees in Long Beach next week.

Some university leaders said they welcome his input.

“I personally am overjoyed,” said Sherry Lansing, the former head of Paramount Studios who is now the president of the UC Regents. “For me, there’s nothing better than to have the governor come so he can understand the problems that we’re facing, and work with us to find some solutions.”

In addition to a 12% to 18% funding hike in the coming fiscal year, Brown is proposing 4% to 5% increases for both systems over the four subsequent years if they will keep student costs steady during that time.

He wants limits on the number of units that students can take, charging more for those who accumulate more credits without graduating. That, he said, would free up space for others to get courses they need to finish their degrees in a timely manner.

The governor has said both systems should trim their administrative expenses. A 2010 study by a faculty group showed the number of senior administrators had increased by 125% since 1997, while the number of students increased 33%.

“I’ve got a whole book showing how the university is spending money it doesn’t have to,” Brown has said, referring to “certain kinds of research, sports, gardeners, a lot of things.”

Former Regent Ward Connerly said the universities frown upon meddling by governors and other politicians.

“There’s a feeling that this is our domain and the governor shouldn’t be too engaged, shouldn’t be playing in our backyard,” he said in an interview.

“That creates a tendency to resist.”

Former Gov. Gray Davis, who served on both boards from 1995 to 2003 as lieutenant governor and governor, said academics “have a much longer time horizon and move much more slowly.”

“If they don’t want to do something you propose,” Davis said, “they will just slow-walk you and wait for you to be out of office.”

But Brown has been working for months to cultivate university leaders, even taking the unusual step of participating in regents meetings. He needed the schools’ support for his tax hikes, passed by voters in November, and the universities were happy to help: The new revenue spared them $500 million in combined budget cuts.

Robert Powell, chairman of the UC Academic Senate, said he and other faculty leaders met for three hours with the governor in Oakland last fall.

“He was really drilling down,” asking detailed questions about increasing summer courses, the obstacles students face to graduating in four years and the possibility of three-year degrees, Powell said.

But he was skeptical of Brown’s hope that online courses would save significant money.

“You’re not going to teach students more cheaply,” he said. “No one has demonstrated an ability to do that.”

Advertisement

Bob Samuels, president of the UC union for more than 4,000 lecturers and librarians, said his members have mixed feelings about the new attention from Brown. They appreciate being spared the budget ax, but they’re wary too.

History has shown, Samuels said, that Brown “is a very unpredictable person.”

William Tierney, director of USC’s Pelias Center for Higher Education, welcomed Brown’s overtures.

“Significant reform of higher education almost always happens when the governor is centrally involved,” Tierney said, adding that Brown should use the political capital from his tax victory to also tackle such challenging issues as duplicative courses and administrative functions.

Brown says he’ll be “listening a lot” as he pursues change, and his approach will be less sensational than in the past.

“Before when I used to go to the regents, I’d go armed and I was attacking,” Brown said. ""... You’ve got to be more subtle; you need more allies.”

The half-million-dollar tab was doled out to three firms that assisted the administration and UNC trustees in dealing with negative media attention. The PR help included tweaks to op-eds and running UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Holden Thorp through a four-hour session to prepare for questions he'd likely face from reporters. The News & Observer reports that the bill will be paid by UNC's privately funded foundation.

The majority of the money -- $367,000 -- went to The Fleishman-Hillard firm. Another $144,000 went to political consultant Doug Sosnik and $20,000 went to Sheehan Associates.

The News & Observer obtained the correspondence through an open records request, which also revealed a series of communications between UNC administrators and faculty involved in the academic fraud scandal.

The academic scandal involved courses being offered as ""paper"" classes that did not require attendance, and a number of unauthorized grade changes, the majority of which involved student athletes. It prompted several investigations, including those by former North Carolina Gov. James G. Martin, the National Association of Academic Advisors for Athletics and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

As a consequence of the scandal Thorp resigned and Bruce Carney left his post as executive vice chancellor and provost.

UNC's bill tops what Florida State University spent for its own academic fraud scandal: $300,000 between 2007 and 2010.

But as large as UNC's bill is for PR advice, it's nothing compared to the $2.3 million Rutgers University has already spent due to the scandal involving former basketball head coach Mike Rice.

Both Rutgers and UNC's costs are dwarfed by the $100 million (or more) in costs due to penalties, fees and lost revenue that Penn State University faces in the wake of Jerry Sandusky's sex crimes."

She Also Previously Worked At Upi', 'The La Times.']",Race to the Top: Standardized testing for preschoolers,"On January 17, 2003, The Washington Post published a Page 1 story (that I wrote) about the Republican Bush administration’s plans to give 908,000 4-year-olds in Head Start programs nationwide a standardized assessment to see how much they were learning.

Critics howled. Early childhood development experts said preschoolers are too young to be evaluated by standardized tests in part because they don’t have sufficient ability to comprehend assessment cues. The plan was shelved.

Flash forward eight years. Today it’s the Democratic Obama administration that is pushing standardized assessments for preschoolers. Not only is there no loud shouting, but a gaggle of states are going to battle each other for the right to win federal funds that will help them implement the second wave of Race to the Top, early childhood version.

In the first part of Race to the Top, President Obama’s signature education initiative, 11 states and the District of Columbia collectively won $4 billion last year to push school reforms favored by Education Secretary Arne Duncan.

The department recently announced the early childhood education chapter of the sweepstakes, this one promising to dispense a total of $500 million to winners who wow the judges, Duncan being the ultimate decider after lesser judges make their own recommendations.

Criteria recently released for states to consider as they write their applications get to the heart of the matter immediately:

Priority 1: Absolutely Priority — Using Early Learning and Development Standards and Kindergarten Entry Assessments to Promote School Readiness.”

(And here are the rest of the stated priorities:

Priority 2: Absolute Priority – Using Tiered Quality Rating and Improvement Systems to Promote School Readiness

Priority 3: Competitive Preference Priority – Including all Early Learning and Development Programs in the Tiered Quality Rating and Improvement System Priority

4: Invitational Priority – Sustaining Program Effects in the Early Elementary Grades

Priority 5: Invitational Priority – Encouraging Private Sector Support)



There is something disturbing about an early childhood education initiative that doesn’t seem to take into account how young children learn best. Where, for example, is the priority about ensuring that all early childhood programs provide creative opportunities for kids to explore and learn? That’s how they best learn, myriad child development experts have said for years.

The institutionalization of standardized assessments for young kids threatens to turn preschool into an academic environment that is too regimented for youngsters.

I know a girl who, when given an aptitude test at age 4, refused to answer the questions because she just didn’t feel like it that day. That’s the way 4-year-olds act sometimes. She was scored as essentially having the aptitude of a monkey. That’s the way standardized assessments are, and that’s no way to judge a 4-year-old.

The Race to the Top criteria say that any assessments developed should conform with the recommendations of the National Research Council’s reports on early childhood.

One such report, published in 2008, entitled Early Childhood Assessment: Why, What, and How,” makes clear how difficult it is to create valid assessments for young children:

“Assessments of any type must be selected and implemented with care, but special attention is needed when using direct assessments with young children. It requires greater attention to establishing a relationship with the child, to ascertaining whether the task is familiar and comprehensible to him or her, to limiting length of the session and the child’s discomfort, to recognizing the role of conditions like hunger or fatigue, and to recognizing the possibility of bias if the tester is a caregiver or otherwise connected to the child. Instruments that have the most user-appeal often do not have the best psychometric properties. For example, portfolios of children’s artistic productions contain rich information but are hard to rate reliably. In the experience of committee members, selection of instruments is often more influenced by cost, by ease of administration, and by use in other equivalent programs than by the criteria proposed here.”

It is, of course, possible that these assessments will be brilliantly constructed. I’m just not holding my breath.

25 states now require students to pass exam to earn high school diploma

Alabama%2C Arizona%2C Georgia%2C Nevada have made moves to phase out those exams

Florida%2C Iowa%2C Minnesota%2C Mississippi%2C Texas also looking at the issue

GREENVILLE, S.C. — South Carolina Rep. Phil Owens says a story he heard from one of his constituents convinced him it was time to do away with the state's requirement that students pass an exit exam to earn their high school diploma.

The man had three sons, all close in age and approaching graduation from high school. One of the brothers had a learning disability in math. He had been unable to pass the math portion of the exit exam after three attempts, even though he had passed all his classes.

""He was devastated by the fact that his brothers would continue on to tech school or to college, and he wouldn't, simply because of this test,"" the Easley Republican said.

Owens, a Republican, found that several states have already had dropped their exit exam or are in the process of doing so, and introduced a bill that would scrap the requirement.

Some of the 25 states that now require students to pass an exit exam to graduate are looking to replace them with tests that yield better information about students' aptitude for college or jobs, but without requiring a specific grade to earn a diploma.

Among the exit exam policy changes taking place in the states:

• The Nevada legislature passed a bill this year that will phase out its exit exam and replace it with end-of-course tests and college entrance exams that are aligned with the Common Core State Standards that have been adopted in 45 states, according to Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a Las Vegas Democrat.

• Arizona passed a bill that did away with its exit exam and other national tests and calls for the state Board of Education to develop another test that will better measure critical thinking skills, according to state Rep. Doris Goodale, a Phoenix Republican.

• Alabama is phasing out its exit exam and using tests developed by ACT that measure students' readiness for college or work, according to state Department of Education spokeswoman Malissa Valdes-Hubert.

• Georgia eliminated an outdated exit exam and is replacing it with end-of-course tests, according to Department of Education spokesman Matt Cardoza.

Legislatures also have been dealing with the exit exam issue this year in Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas, according to Julie Bell, director of the National Conference of State Legislature's education program.

Valdes-Hubert said the Alabama High School Graduation Exam that the state had been using wasn't correlated to any of the tests students were being given in earlier grades.

The new system will give educators a continuum of information about individual students' performance by using tests developed by ACT, most known for its college entrance exam, beginning in third grade.

""So essentially when a child gets into third grade all the way through 12th grade, we're going to have different types of assessments that they're going to take — none of which are high stakes — that can show a parent, teacher or a counselor how the student is developing through the years and if they're going to be ready for the ACT or similar tests that they may take after high school or in college,"" she said.

Owens' bill in South Carolina has been passed in the state House and referred to the Senate Education Committee. It calls for setting up a committee to recommend whether to continue using the High School Assessment Program exit exam for federal and state accountability requirements or replace it with something else. But it wouldn't be required for graduation, regardless.

Anna Huguley, a sophomore at J.L. Mann High in Greenville, S.C., says she took the exit exam this year and didn't find it very hard. Students typically take it in 10th grade and have two more chances before they graduate to pass it.

""I think the test is similar to, like, the end-of-course and the other exams like midterm that we're required to take,"" she said. ""So I think it might not matter that much if they take it away.""

""For some students it is extremely easy,"" said Jamie Hueble, a government and economics teacher at J.L. Mann. ""And to make it more difficult, then you can't give it to a sophomore, which is the year they start taking it. So I don't know that it's a great measure of a student's ability and qualifications for a diploma anyways.""

William Penn -- a professor in the university’s creative writing program -- was featured in a YouTube video (see above) in which he told students “if you go to the Republican convention in Florida, you see all of the old Republicans with the dead skin cells washing off them.”

“They are cheap. They don’t want to pay taxes because they have already raped this country and gotten everything out of it they possibly could,” Penn continued. “They don’t want to pay for your tuition because who are you? Well to me, you are somebody.”

Penn, who has won a distinguished faculty award, added, “I’m a college professor. If I find out you’re a closet racist, I’m coming after you. OK. This country still is full of closet racists.”

In the video, uploaded by a conservative collegiate news outlet called Campus Reform, Penn then describes Republicans as “dead white people, or dying white people,” and then disparages former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann.

“I absolutely don’t mean to offend you,” Penn said. “Even if you are a Republican, I don’t mean to offend you in this class.”

On Thursday -- two days after the video’s publication and a review by the campus provost -- Michigan State University officials announced that Penn’s “teaching duties have been reassigned to others.”

“Michigan State University is committed to creating a learning environment that is characterized by mutual respect and civility where diverse ideas can be explored,” university spokesman Kent Cassella said in a statement.

Cassella added that, in a meeting with university officials, Penn “acknowledged that some of his comments were inappropriate, disrespectful and offensive and may have negatively affected the learning environment.”

Penn didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman told the Los Angeles Times that he had not been otherwise suspended or fired.

According to his academic bio, Penn writes under the name “W.S. Penn” and has published seven books of fiction and essays.

Jerry Brown has placed a renewed focus on the state’s struggling community colleges, the world’s largest system of two-year schools that are often overshadowed by the University of California and Cal State systems.

The governor’s recommendations are aimed at keeping community colleges affordable, keeping classes accessible and moving students faster through the system to allow them to graduate or transfer to a four-year university at higher rates. Brown’s spending plan must clear the Legislature, and some college officials have vowed to oppose — or at least try to modify — some portions.

These proposals are among the most significant policy shifts in years and could reshape many campus operations.

“It’s a courageous plan,” said Eloy Oakley, president of Long Beach City College. “The governor is focusing on policy issues we’ve been talking about for many years but dancing around the margins. A lot of this has been on the table in statehouses throughout the nation, but we’re addressing these issues in California in a meaningful way.”

Community colleges play a vital role in California’s higher education system, training large segments of the state’s workforce. But the 112-college system has strained under the pressure of huge funding cuts and increased demand. Thousands of courses have been slashed and enrollment has been shrunk by more 500,000 students in recent years.

Most of the schools’ 2.4-million students are unprepared for college-level work: 85% need remedial English, 73% need remedial math and only about a third of remedial students transfer to a four-year school or graduate with a community college associate’s degree.

Education leaders praised the governor’s efforts to follow through on his commitment to voters to restore education funding through the passage of Proposition 30, the school tax initiative —- even while expressing misgivings about aspects of the plan. The budget includes nearly $200 million in additional funding for the colleges.

“It’s wonderful to have an environment where we’re going to have some provocative conversations about policy,” said community colleges Chancellor Brice Harris. “We’re not going to shy away and [we] actually look forward to the discussion.”

State officials said the plan is meant to build on changes proposed last year by a statewide task force charged with improving the colleges. Measures approved by the Legislature and Board of Governors establish registration priorities, including preventing students from repeating courses to improve their grades and allowing students who participate in orientation and academic assessment programs and have 100 units or less to enroll in classes first. Students also would have to maintain satisfactory grades to continue to qualify for fee waivers.

Brown goes further toward moving students through the system. He is seeking to limit the number of credits students can accumulate. Beginning next fall, he suggests a cap on state-subsidized classes at 90 units, requiring students who exceed that to pay the full cost of instruction, about $190 per semester unit versus $46 per unit. In the 2009-10 academic year, nearly 120,000 students had earned 90 units or more.

Students said they are particularly concerned that the unit cap is punitive for those who have a double major, who may be returning to college to train for a new job or who want to explore their interests before deciding on a field of study.

“We’re going to work very hard to get rid of this,” said Rich Copenhagen, a College of Alameda student who is president of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges. “The governor does seem to be interested in pushing through a lot of policy in this budget. He’s in a position to say I got you more money, now you need to make your system better.”

Perhaps one of the more controversial elements of Brown’s plan is to change the funding formula for community colleges to pay schools for students who complete courses. Funding is now based on the number of students enrolled at the third or fourth week of the term.

The goal, said state officials, is to provide incentives for colleges to improve.

Brown’s performance-based plan would be phased in over several years, and savings would be reinvested in support services.

The task force considered and rejected a similar funding plan.

Harris and others were cautious about many of Brown’s proposals. Performance-based funding might encourage colleges to cut courses that are difficult to complete and cause students to switch to less demanding classes. He argued that enrollment priorities suggested by the task force — he served on the panel as chancellor of the Los Rios Community College District — would accomplish the same goals.

The new funding formula also might be an incentive to keep students in classes they are not suited for, said Michelle Pilati, president of the Academic Senate for California Community Colleges. She cautioned that the limit on units could create a two-tiered system of those who can afford to pay and continue their education and those who can’t.

“I think he’s putting policies on the table we really need to look at and think about,” said Pilati, who teaches psychology at Rio Hondo College in Whittier. “As with so many things, the devil is in the details.”

The governor also urged UC, Cal State and community college systems to find ways to provide more online classes. The budget provides nearly $17 million to increase those classes for the two-year schools. Brown is proposing a “virtual campus” with 250 new courses available to students statewide that would be transferrable to all colleges. Currently, about 27% of students take at least one course online each year.

System-wide technology, for example, would allow Long Beach City College to expand its online offerings — only about 5% of Long Beach students now take online classes — while keeping down costs, Oakley said.

In a new approach to speeding students’ time in school, the governor would allow those with knowledge of a subject to receive course credit by taking a special exam rather than attending classes. The credits would be transferrable to Cal State or UC.

The emphasis on college completion has drawbacks, said some education leaders, and tends to ignore the realities of the typical community college student: They are older and have jobs and families and many attend part time.

“It’s probably closing the door and becoming a little more privileged, benefiting students who can go full time,” said John S. Levin, executive director of the California Community College Collaborative at UC Riverside.

The governor is also looking to shift some programs from the lower education system to community colleges. For example, the budget provides $315.7 million to shift adult education and apprenticeship programs from K-12, with funding directed to vocational education, English as a Second Language and citizenship classes. Students would be required to pay the full cost of instruction for other adult education courses.

Harris said he expected lively negotiations with the governor and legislators.

“This is about fine-tuning what we think is a great budget,” the chancellor said. “We’re not going to restore all the access we lost, but it is a modest investment in our future.”

http://news.yahoo.com/dream-act-aid-illegal-immigrants-153934615.html,,[],Dream Act would provide aid to illegal immigrants,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Legislation to provide financial aid and other assistance to college-bound illegal immigrants is gaining political support in New York a year after the idea withered in Albany and Washington.

The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act is being pushed by powerful Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. Now, fellow Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Republicans who share control of the state Senate are interested in discussing the bill.

Known as the Dream Act, the bill would provide a way to help poor immigrant families afford college through the state Tuition Assistance Plan and academic assistance programs. It would also create a commission to raise money for scholarships.

""Our immigrant families, like many struggling in these trying economic times, need financial help to achieve their educational goals,"" said Silver. ""Investing in these inspiring students represents an investment in our future.""

Immigrant community leaders and Latino legislators say national and state political trends are helping their cause. In New York, the Latino vote has been courted by Republicans and Democrats.

""We can no longer exclude New York's Dream youth from the promise of higher education afforded their classmates,"" said Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of The New York Immigration Coalition.

New York would join Texas, New Mexico and California in offering financial aid to immigrant children, including illegal immigrants. In New York, lower in-state resident tuition at public colleges has been offered since 2002 to illegal immigrants. A federal Dream Act proposal that would provide federal financial aid to college-bound immigrants and a pathway to citizenship for younger adults has been stalled by Republican opposition in Congress.

New York's proposal is expected to be debated by the Legislature in its budget negotiations and could surface as early as Cuomo's budget presentation on Tuesday if he endorses the idea. The roughly $132 billion budget is forecast to have a deficit of more than $1 billion.

Story continues

Senate Republican spokesman Scott Reif said the GOP conference, which balked last year because of cost, will consider several proposals, including Silver's.

This year, the Senate majority is controlled by an alliance between Republicans and breakaway Democrats that is expected to send more progressive proposals like the Dream Act to floor votes.

Jeffrey Klein, a Bronx-Westchester Democrat who is among the chamber's leaders, is making a top priority of the Dream Act. His proposal would provide $19.5 million a year for the state financial aid from a licensing fee on the proposed expansion of casino gambling. He estimates the fee could generate $28 million to fund the academic assistance programs in the act and create the commission to raise money for scholarships.

""We have a tremendous opportunity to help educate thousands of smart young people from around the world who have moved here to pursue the American dream,"" he said.

Cuomo proposed three upstate casinos in his State of the State address earlier this month, but he wants to devote all the money to schools and the counties and municipalities where casinos are built.

The labor-backed, progressive Fiscal Policy Institute estimates the cost of the Dream Act to be $17 million a year, while the Senate Republicans a year ago estimated the cost at as much as $30 million.

Advocates have estimated the cost at $20 million."

A slim majority of parents there, fed up with the lack of progress toward a satisfactory education for their children, signed petitions and exercised their right under California law to oust the principal.

It hardly needs saying that the principal, Irma Cobian, did not much appreciate the campaign. She sees it as the work of politically motivated interlopers and disaffected parents — “a personal vendetta met a political movement,” as she told me.

The parents behind the effort don’t view it that way. They contend that they’ve pushed for improvement, only to be met with brusque indifference. Meanwhile, test scores at the school have dropped, adding to the alarm. Just a few years ago, Weigand was on a slow but upward march — its API score rose from 643 to 717 over two years. Since Cobian’s arrival, those numbers have turned south, and the score for last year was down to 689.

By the numbers, Weigand is one of the worst-performing schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and that’s saying something. These parents describe their work as one of necessity, the requirement that they do what they can for their children.

Advertisement

So which is it? Is Weigand’s division the result of impetuous parents and outside forces, or an expression of principled disagreement over the future of the school? Is the fight over bureaucratic inertia or competing visions?

I would submit that although the dispute contains elements of all of those, it’s really about something else: The fight at Weigand is a contest between school authorities who believe change can only be accomplished over time against parents who have no time to waste. In that, it is emblematic of a fundamental collision that is playing out across California.

Take Cobian’s turnaround plan for the school. It’s full of ideas and principles, methods of engaging parents and determination to push teachers. But none of it is quick. Indeed, the ideas guiding the proposal are known as the “Six Principles for Gradual Improvement,” and the first of those states: “Expect improvement to be continual, gradual and incremental.”

Cobian is proud of that plan, and even some of the parents who are unhappy with her like many aspects of it. It relies heavily on fundamentals and stresses the importance of imparting knowledge, values and communication skills to the students.

Where it’s frustrating, though, is in the patience it demands. And it’s easy to understand why. Imagine being the parent of a second-grade student at the school. For the last several years, that student would have been enrolled in a struggling school that showed signs of getting worse. And the administration’s answer to that is a program for slow improvement. Will it come in time for that second-grader to get any benefit? No parent could be expected to be patient in the face of that record or that program.

None of that is a hypothetical to Llury Garcia. Her daughter is in second grade and has received considerable praise from her teachers. But Garcia worries. “They tell me she’s doing great, but I see something different,” she told me last week. Garcia is concerned about her little girl’s spelling, her mastery of reading. All parents worry, but Weigand’s record reinforces those concerns.

Moreover, Garcia is not alone. Parents of more than half of the school’s students signed a petition demanding Cobian’s firing. Under California’s “parent trigger” law, that was all it took to force that outcome, so Cobian will soon be out of work. Some of the school’s teachers are outraged, and some parents are dismayed. Cobian blames Parent Revolution, a community organizing group that helps parents band together to transform schools using the parent trigger law. Even the name of the group offends Cobian: “It’s a revolution. It’s bloody. There’s violence.”

Cobian would prefer a gentler system, an approach to reform that is less divisive, less confrontational. The trouble with that is that too many educators and administrators have tolerated failure for too long. They have allowed too many students — the vast majority of whom are poor — to complete their educations without being able to read or write or master the skills of a modern culture.

When school officials ask for more time, parents whose patience has been tested for too long are unwilling to give it. They will seize the authority they have in order to protect what they care about most: their children. Who can blame them?

As the controversy at Weigand reminds us, education reform may be painstaking, but childhood is fleeting.

""As a country, as a society, we live and breathe the idea of religious freedom and religious tolerance, whatever the religion, and political freedom and political tolerance, whatever the point of view,"" Kerry told the students in Berlin, the second stop on his inaugural trip as secretary of state.

""People have sometimes wondered about why our Supreme Court allows one group or another to march in a parade even though it's the most provocative thing in the world and they carry signs that are an insult to one group or another,"" he added.

""The reason is, that's freedom, freedom of speech. In American you have a right to be stupid - if you want to be,"" he said, prompting laughter. ""And you have a right to be disconnected to somebody else if you want to be.

""And we tolerate it. We somehow make it through that. Now, I think that's a virtue. I think that's something worth fighting for,"" he added. ""The important thing is to have the tolerance to say, you know, you can have a different point of view.""

Kerry made the comments on his first foreign trip since becoming secretary of state on Feb. 1. After one-night stops in London and Berlin, he visits Paris, Rome, Ankara, Cairo, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha before returning to Washington on March 6.

While speaking to the students and earlier to U.S. diplomats, Kerry reminisced about the time he spent in Berlin in the 1950s as the intrepid son of an American diplomat and retold a story of sneaking across to East Berlin with his bike.

""I used to have great adventures. My bicycle and I were best friends. And I biked all around this city. I remember biking down Kurfuerstendamm and seeing nothing but rubble. This was in 1954 ... the war was very much still on people's minds,"" he told the diplomats, referring to West Berlin's main shopping avenue.

""One day, using my diplomatic passport, I biked through the checkpoint right into the east sector and noticed very quickly how dark and unpopulated (it was) and sort of unhappy people looked,"" he added, saying it left an impression ""that hit this 12-year-old kid.""

""I kind of felt a foreboding about it and I didn't spend much time. I kind of skedaddled and got back out of there and went home and proudly announced to my parents what I had done and was promptly grounded and had my passport pulled,"" he added.

""As a 12-year-old, I saw the difference between East and West,"" he later told the students. ""I never made another trip like that. But I have never forgotten it. And now, it's vanished, vanished."" (Reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Jon Hemming)"

Bullying is used to describe behaviors ranging from rolling of the eyes to sexual assault

Victimization is a better term%2C researchers say

Educators hampered by policies that require mistreatment to be repetitive

SAN FRANCISCO – Schools that want to do a better job fighting bullying ought to start with one key step, a group of researchers said Tuesday: Stop using the term ""bullying.""

Because it's ""being used for everything from rolling eyes to 'not wanting to be your friend' to sexual assault, the word 'bullying' has really obscured our ability to focus on what's happening"" to children, said Dorothy Espelage of the University of Illinois.

Educators have been ""spinning our wheels for decades"" in a bid to treat bullying, but they're often hampered by policies that require mistreatment to be repetitive, for example, part of the classic definition of bullying. That focus also obscures whether specific acts are happening more or less, she said.

Espelage co-led a group of researchers that worked for a year to produce a new primer on bullying, released here on Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, the USA's largest education research organization. The association commissioned the research last year in the wake of several high-profile bullying cases and school shootings.

Espelage has served as an expert witness in legal cases in which a child committed suicide after being bullied. In several cases, she said, school staff members said in depositions that they were waiting for the alleged bullying behaviors to be repeated so they could treat them as bullying, in accordance with school policies. ""In some ways, our obsession with 'What is it?' has stalled us in creating safe schools,"" she said. ""The bottom line is, kids are being victimized – let's move on from that.""

A helpful way to look at the problem, she said, is to consider how colleges treat behavior such as hazing or sexual harassment. ""To call what's happening with 18-to-22-year-olds 'bullying,' when in fact some of it is criminal behavior … it's a disaster,"" she said.

Espelage and a colleague, Ron Astor of the University of Southern California, are pushing for schools to use the more simple term ""victimization.""

Astor acknowledged the irony of the idea: Speaking to a small group of reporters, he said of the booklet they produced, ""If this was titled 'Victimization,' you wouldn't be here."""

More states taking on the issue

Vermont%2C Connecticut%2C Washington have advanced legislation

Agriculture increasingly turning to genetically altered crops

From Maine to Washington, a growing number of states are taking on the issue of genetically engineered foods, fanning the flames of a decades-old debate about whether the products are dangerous to human health.

This month, Connecticut became the first state to pass a law requiring the labeling of food made from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In May, the Vermont House passed a similar bill, which will now be taken up by the Senate. Right to Know GMO , a self-described grass-roots coalition with members in 37 states, counts 26 states that have introduced labeling bills.

In Washington state, a referendum on GMO labeling is scheduled for November. Last November, a referendum in California failed 53-47 after the biotech industry spent nearly $45 million on opposition ads.

At the federal level, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., introduced a bill in April – separate from the farm bill – that would direct the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ""clearly label"" genetically engineered foods. Boxer notes she has 11 co-sponsors of the bill, which she first introduced in 2000. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., introduced the House version.

Boxer also attached two amendments to the farm bill, one saying that the United States should join the 64 other nations, including those in the European Union, that have labeling requirements for genetically engineered foods. The other amendment requires a report in six months from several federal agency heads reviewing the labeling methods used internationally, and the ""probable impacts"" of having differing labeling requirements passed by states rather than a federal standard.

""As more and more states take action, I believe lawmakers in Washington will realize that Congress and the FDA must ensure that all Americans know what's in the food they're eating,"" Boxer said in an e-mail.

""The companies have such complete control over who can do independent research into the nature of these things and their impact that we really don't know very much,"" said Andrea Stander, executive director of Rural Vermont, a non-profit farm advocacy group. ""We don't know nearly as much as we should.""

The FDA ruled in 1992 that genetically engineered foods are not ""materially different"" from their traditional counterparts and therefore do not have to be labeled, a ruling opponents of GMOs won't accept.

Monsanto, based in St. Louis, Mo., is a leading supplier of seeds for genetically engineered crops to farmers in the United States and around the world, and a frequent target of protests against GMOs. The company has clearly stated why it is opposed to labeling, saying mandatory labeling ""could imply that food products containing these ingredients are somehow inferior to their conventional or organic counterparts.""

About 90% of the corn, cotton, soybeans and sugar beets grown in the United States are genetically engineered, according to BIO, the trade group representing Monsanto, Bayer, Dow, DuPont and other giant firms that dominate the industry.

The modifications to the DNA of seeds, which started in the mid-1990s, fall into two categories: seeds that have built-in genetic resistance to insects, forgoing the need for insecticides, and seeds that tolerate herbicides, making it possible to spray crops, such as soy beans, that are prone to weeds.

Genetic engineering is the fastest growing technology in the history of agriculture, with upward of 17 million farmers around the world using genetically altered seeds, BIO spokeswoman Karen Batra said.

The problem with requiring labels on genetically engineered foods, Batra said, is that they would imply those foods are unsafe.

""In the United States, food packaging labels are reserved to convey food safety information about allergens that might be in a food or to convey nutritional composition,"" she said. ""If the federal government were to mandate by law that a particular food product needed to be labeled that would infer it would be for a safety reason.""

Jerry Brown will push this year to upend the way schools are funded in California, hoping to shift more money to poorer districts and end requirements that billions of dollars be spent on particular programs.

Brown said he wants more of the state’s dollars to benefit low-income and non-English-speaking students, who typically are more expensive to educate.

“The reality is, in some places students don’t enjoy the same opportunities that people have in other places,” the governor said in an interview. “This is a way to balance some of life’s chances.”

He would also scale back — and possibly eliminate — dozens of rules that districts must abide by to receive billions in state dollars. Some of those requirements, such as a mandate to limit class size, have been suspended amid Sacramento’s recurrent budget problems but are set to resume by 2015.

Brown and his aides are keeping most details under wraps. But advisers say his proposals, part of the budget blueprint to be unveiled early this month, will amount to the most extensive changes in decades in the relationship between school districts and state government.

His intentions are already raising concerns among school administrators, district officials and labor unions. The governor postponed earlier plans to push for the changes when the discord threatened to distract from his campaign for higher taxes. Voters approved the tax hikes in November, averting billions of dollars in education cuts.

Advertisement

Now, the transformation of school funding is at the top of his agenda. He says his goal is more local control.

“What the state has done for 40 years is develop one new program after another to compensate for underperforming” schools, he said. “What we have now is command and control issuing from headquarters in Sacramento.”

Advertisement

Scores of programs set up by state mandate — for smaller classes, bilingual education and summer school, for example — have their own pots of money sent from Sacramento to pay for them. ¿The Public Policy Institute of California found that nearly 40% of every dollar sent to schools from both the state and federal governments is earmarked for such a purpose.

The programs vary in size and scope: $4.5 million to meet the needs of Native American students, $10 million to improve school Internet access, more than $618 million set aside for school buses, etc.

Advertisement

According to Brown’s Department of Finance, 56 such programs received a total of $11.8 billion in state funds last year. ¿The result, the governor says, is a bloated school bureaucracy that takes money away from core instruction.

“You have to have administrators at the state level, district level and at the school level who are engaged in making sure this money is used for what it’s supposed to be used for,” Brown said. “This constant articulation of rules is a world unto itself that is not directly supporting the teacher in the classroom.”

Advertisement

But many of the programs are popular with parents and various interest groups and have staunch defenders in the Capitol. They say lifting restrictions on how schools spend their money could hurt struggling students.

In recent years, state lawmakers have offered districts some flexibility to cope with rounds of budget cuts. The results, some say, have not always been good, leading to larger classes and sharp reductions in programs for adults trying to earn a high school degree.

Advertisement

Since 2008, the average class size in kindergarten through third grade has grown from 20 to 23, among the largest in the nation, according to a study from the Public Policy Institute of California. During the same period, the average class size elsewhere in the country remained at around 15 students.

In addition, “since schools have been given greater flexibility, adult education ... has been decimated throughout the state,” said Jeff Freitas, secretary-treasurer of the California Federation of Teachers. “You can’t just give the locals carte blanche with the money.”

Advertisement

Shifting money to poorer schools at the expense of wealthier ones is also certain to stir protest.

Under a similar proposal the governor floated last year, the Department of Finance estimated that Compton Unified schools would see an uptick of more than $4,700 per pupil by the 2017-18 school year. Manhattan Beach Unified would get a per-student increase of just $681.

Advertisement

Those who have met with Brown’s top education aides expect the governor to propose a similar formula in January, asking districts to account for the expenditures to make sure the funds serve higher-needs students.

Adonai Smith, a lobbyist for the Assn. of California School Administrators, said his members would not support a plan that amounts to a “redistribution of resources.”

Advertisement

The governor says that even if funding is tweaked to favor more poor students and English learners, all schools will receive more money now that state revenue is on the uptick.

“I want to align more closely the money schools receive with the problems that teachers encounter,” Brown said. “When somebody’s teaching in Compton, it’s a much bigger challenge than teaching in Beverly Hills.”

Children of undocumented immigrants who live in New Jersey will pay same in-state tuition rates currently available to students who are citizens

Gov. Chris Christie will make the bill effective immediately

Tuition assistance grants were not included in the legislation

TRENTON — The Legislature and Gov. Chris Christie reached a compromise on a tuition equality bill that will allow the children of New Jersey's undocumented immigrants to pay in-state rates to attend state colleges and universities.

Senate President Stephen M. Sweeney announced the compromise, in which a Democratic proposal to include tuition assistance grants to the legislation will be scrapped, during a news conference at the Statehouse before the Senate and Assembly sessions on Thursday. Christie's administration signaled just before Sweeney's event that it would accept a compromise and sign the bill immediately.

""I would have loved to have had the TAG grant. ... The only piece of this bill that didn't survive is the TAG grant,"" said Sweeney, D-Gloucester. ""I'm disappointed with that, but I still view this as a victory for young people that are Americans in everything but on paper.""

Under the compromise, the bill was passed by the Assembly Thursday, was conditionally vetoed by Christie and then both houses of the Legislature concurred with the governor's changes. Christie was scheduled to sign the bill Friday.

The governor said that one other change he would make in the bill would be to make it effective immediately.

Under current law, children of undocumented immigrants who live in New Jersey are not eligible for the lower in-state tuition rates currently available to students who are citizens. The compromise bill would extend the in-state rates to children of the undocumented, a change that advocates have labeled ""tuition equality.""

Some conservatives have pointed to Christie's backing of tuition equality as kowtowing to a liberal constituency and raised the specter that his position may come back to haunt him in any bid for the GOP nomination for president in 2016.

Tuition equality advocates, however, slammed Christie for demanding that the TAG grants be removed from the bill and for his rejection of criticism by Giancarlo Tello of the New Jersey Dream Act Coalition, who said that the governor only wanted to give him and others ""crumbs.""

""If they want more, I'm sorry,"" Christie said. ""But they're getting a lot more than they've ever gotten before because I believe it's in the best interests of the people of this state to do it. But you can't be a second-class citizen if you're not a citizen in the first place.""

Sweeney said the compromise would help DREAM act students get in-state tuition rates immediately. He said the assistance grants would be taken up again in the future.

Sen. Teresa Ruiz, D-Essex, said the practical impact of the compromise is that the next generation of New Jersey leaders will now have an easier time getting a college education and a better shot at success.

""I'll finally be able to go back to school,"" Tello agreed.

""I've been a resident of New Jersey now for 17 years — since first grade. … I'm proud of that. I'm proud of the Garden State,"" Tello said. ""This is the state where I grew up in. This is the state I call home. This is the state ... I want to work in.""

Tello, too, said his group would be back to fight for tuition assistance grants.

Christie had signaled that he would veto the Senate version of the bill because he felt the benefits included in it went far beyond providing in-state tuition rates for children of undocumented immigrants. He previously said he was in favor of a state version of the so-called DREAM act, and Democrats had lashed out at Christie for saying he would veto the Senate bill.

But Sweeney said negotiations with the administration had produced the compromise announced Thursday. Christie, in an afternoon, said he budged on the issue of out-of-state students boarding at New Jersey schools being allowed to qualify for the in-state tuition. In the end, he said, his strongest objection to the bill remained the tuition assistance grants.

Christie criticized those who said his support for tuition equality and subsequent objections to the Senate bill were political calculations in an election year. He said those who claimed his motives were political owed him an apology.

""What we've done here is to put forward exactly what I said I wanted to do, which was to responsibly and affordably implement tuition equality for all students in New Jersey,"" Christie said.

For more than four years, it has been my honor and privilege to serve our country under President Obama. Together we have accomplished important milestones in improving education for Americans at all levels, especially for those most in need. I know from experience that great teaching, learning and research have the power to transform our nation and the world. To build on the work and considerable outcomes we have achieved, I have decided to return to academia and will leave federal government service this fall.



Delivering a world-class education for all is what I have dedicated my life to get done every day. Serving as your Under Secretary has deepened my understanding and appreciation of what “service to improve the public good of our nation” really means. The promise and power of delivering good government to our students and families is a tireless, phenomenal effort, often with few external rewards if done honestly, fairly and well. What unfolds each and every day never ceases to amaze me, even now. I could never have imagined a more exciting and challenging opportunity. For that I thank President Obama, Secretary Duncan and each of you.



Over the next few months, my priority is to ensure a seamless transition for the Department until a new Under Secretary comes on board. I remain committed to achieving the goals for our nation’s postsecondary students, institutions and communities: access, affordability, quality and completion. I will continue to pursue these ends during this transition period and beyond.



I have assured Secretary Duncan that the postsecondary team will continue to advance our ambitious statutory, regulatory and administrative agenda. We can’t afford to miss a beat as you all know. For me, it is simply that single, unwavering commitment to help our students and institutions aspire to excellence that inspires me each and every day.



As always, I welcome your ideas and feedback about our work going forward. Thank you for all that you continue to do and for the opportunity to serve as your Under Secretary of Education.



Full speed ahead!

Martha Kanter

Henderson will shutter 15 schools, affecting more than 2,400 students and more than 540 employees. Closing half-empty schools will allow her to use resources more efficiently, she said, redirecting dollars from administration and maintenance to teaching and learning.

The move is another benchmark in the fundamental remaking of public education in the District, where the school system has lost more than 100,000 students since its peak enrollment in the 1960s.

City leaders have been faced with underenrollment for years, but the situation has become more pronounced with the rapid growth of charter schools since the mid-1990s. Funded with taxpayer dollars but operated independently of the school system, charters now enroll more than 40 percent of the city’s students, putting Washington at the leading edge of a national movement toward charters.

“We can’t ignore the fact that we as a city have embraced school choice,” Henderson told D.C. Council members during a briefing Thursday. “If we proliferate charter schools, we have to know that is going to have an impact.”

View Graphic Fifteen schools in the District will close within the next two school years.

Five years ago, then-Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee accelerated the downsizing of the D.C. school system when she moved quickly to close 23 schools, igniting angry protest and long-lasting political backlash while spurring an exodus of students to the city’s charters.

Henderson’s proposed closures also triggered opposition, but she is widely seen to have handled community relations more deftly than her predecessor, sponsoring a series of public meetings throughout the city and inviting parents and activists to help refine the closure plan.

That feedback persuaded the chancellor to remove five schools from her original closure list, including Garrison Elementary and Francis-Stevens Education Campus, two Northwest Washington schools in relatively affluent neighborhoods. Parents at both schools mounted vigorous campaigns against closure.

Henderson cited parents’ willingness to help recruit new students and demographic data showing that Northwest neighborhoods, particularly around Garrison, are growing faster than officials previously understood. Francis-Stevens will fill its extra space by serving as a second campus for the School Without Walls, a selective high school nearby.

Faced with criticism that she hadn’t given equal consideration to parental concerns and ideas emerging from less-privileged parts of the city, Henderson said that many of the proposals she received included requests for extra investments of millions of dollars.

“Lots of folks came up with plans. Some we were able to move with, others we were not able to,” Henderson said. “Leadership is about making hard decisions.”

Smothers Elementary in Northeast also will stay open, as will Malcolm X Elementary in Southeast, which will be operated in partnership with a “high-performing charter school” that Henderson declined to identify. Southeast’s Johnson Middle School will stay open because school officials say they think that moving the students to other schools filled with teenagers from rival neighborhoods could cause safety concerns.

All 15 schools marked for closure are east of Rock Creek Park, many of them east of the Anacostia River in some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods, and all had below-average test scores. They include the first high school to close in recent memory — Spingarn Senior High in Northeast — and Kenilworth Elementary, in the middle of a neighborhood that last month won a $25 million grant to strengthen local education and other services.

Thirteen of the schools will close at the end of this academic year, with the remaining two — Sharpe Health and Mamie D. Lee, schools for students with disabilities — to close in 2014.

On Thursday, Henderson for the first time offered an estimate of money to be saved through the closures: $19.5 million in staffing costs. Approximately $11 million will be needed for transition costs, Henderson said, resulting in a net savings of $8.5 million.

The last round of closures, in 2008, cost millions more than initially reported, according to an audit released in August. Henderson said the school system is more confident in its savings estimates now.

The savings will be plowed back into schools to improve programming, including into libraries and arts and foreign language offerings, Henderson said, adding that the public will get a detailed view when school-by-school budgets are released in the coming months.

About 140 staff positions will be lost, but given normal attrition through resignations and retirements, Henderson said, “we actually feel like the loss will be minimal.” She said she does not expect any teacher evaluated “effective” to be out of a job.

The chancellor said she does not anticipate releasing any buildings from the D.C. Public Schools inventory. She said she needs to keep control of the facilities so they can be reopened as enrollment rebounds.

That news was maddening for charter school advocates, who often struggle to find suitable and affordable D.C. real estate. City law requires that surplus public school buildings be made available to charter schools.

“The mayor is making a mistake,” said Robert Cane, executive director of the pro-charter Friends of Choice in Urban Schools. “What we have here, it’s about defending DCPS from the popularity of the charter schools, and it has nothing to do with getting more kids into quality schools. Nothing.”

Henderson said her staff has plans for reusing some buildings, such as Spingarn, which will become a vocational education campus focused on transportation careers. But officials are still working on plans for many of the buildings.

The prospect of closures triggered intense debate in recent months about the future of the city school system, including at community meetings and two D.C. Council hearings that together lasted more than 14 hours.

Some parents, activists and politicians worry that shutting the schools will drive families into the city’s charter schools, which could lead to declining enrollment and further closures in the traditional school system. After the 2008 closures, thousands of children left the system for charter schools, according to a study by three think tanks.

The school system now enrolls about 46,000 students in 123 schools.

“We cannot repeat what happened with the last closures,” said D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). “DCPS has got to be much more aggressive than it was three years ago in retaining students and recruiting students.”

D.C. Council members will have a chance to quiz Henderson about her school closure plan Wednesday at the first hearing of the newly constituted education committee, which is led by David A. Catania (I-At Large).

Across the city Thursday afternoon, schools that had been slated to close cleaved into two groups: those that were spared, and those were not.

“My kids like this school, and I don’t want to see them start over,” said Raheem Bates, 24, the father of two Kenilworth students.

A few miles away, Shannon Smith prepared for a protest at the chancellor’s home. Her two grandchildren attend Ferebee-Hope Elementary, which will close over the objections of parents and staff. “I don’t know why they would want to close this school,” said Smith, who called the move “ridiculous.”

But across town at Garrison, relieved parents hugged each other and high-fived their kids. Kierra McPherson, 23 wiped away tears as she picked up her preschool son. McPherson graduated from Garrison, as did her mother and cousin.

“It’s a tradition,” McPherson said. “This is my school. We got our school back.”

Jerry Brown’s controversial plan to shift money from rich schools to poor ones, an ominous sign as he works to win support for the idea from skeptical lawmakers and the state’s powerful teachers unions.

A new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll found that 50% of respondents agreed with such a move, to help school districts that serve low-income children and English-language learners.

But a significant minority, 39%, opposed the plan, which is embedded in the governor’s budget blueprint and is the centerpiece of his education agenda. Brown has described his bid as “a classic case of justice to unequals.”

Support broke along ethnic and socioeconomic lines, with 67% of Latinos backing the proposal, compared with 42% of whites.

Voters solidly endorsed a separate Brown proposal to give school districts more control over the state funds they receive, with 59% in favor. Only 41% approved of a legislative effort to make it easier for local governments to raise more education money through parcel taxes — a priority for many Democratic lawmakers.

In the past, Democrats and their allies in teachers unions have resisted upending the way schools are funded. Brown’s most contentious proposal this year would give all districts a base grant, with extra funding for each student who is low-income, struggling with English or in foster care.

“Our future depends not on across-the-board funding, but in disproportionately funding those schools that have disproportionate challenges,” he said as he unveiled his plan in January.

With race and class at its core, the proposal could open a thorny debate.

“The challenge for the governor here is to make a case that this is not a divisive issue but a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats” proposal, said Drew Lieberman of the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, which conducted the survey in conjunction with the Republican company American Viewpoint.

Lisa Andrews, a Latina from Fresno, approves of the plan. The 47-year-old Democrat grew up in a small Central Valley farming community where her elementary school classmates struggled with English skills.

“If you’re going to set tax money aside, then give it to those who would benefit the most from it,” she said. “You have to be able to speak English and learn your grammar first, because the other classes are useless if you’re not on equal ground” with other students.

On the other side of the issue, Dave Kanevsky, a pollster for American Viewpoint, described the governor’s plan as “class warfare applied to schools” because it is framed “in terms of taking from one and giving to another.”

Respondent Debra Sexton, 57, a Democrat and retired photographer from Corona, expressed a similar view. She said the idea of giving more money to poor schools at the expense of wealthier ones was fundamentally unfair, particularly to high-performing campuses.

“I don’t think those schools should be punished because a lesser school isn’t making the grade,” she said.

Brown’s proposal to give districts more spending flexibility would eliminate dozens of state requirements for specific programs, such as vocational training and summer school, and instead allocate more money to districts with no strings attached.

“Nobody knows better than the local school district,” said Johnnie White, a 35-year-old Democrat and cashier from Venice. “It’s tough for somebody in Sacramento to say what a kid needs in South L.A. or Hawthorne.”

Forty-nine percent of respondents opposed legislation that would ask voters to change the state Constitution to lower the threshold for passage of parcel taxes, from two-thirds to 55% of the vote. State Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), the measure’s author, has touted it as a way to give school districts the power to offset potential losses under Brown’s funding plan.

But poll participants were not in the mood for more taxes, after an election in which billions of dollars in new levies were approved to help stave off education cuts. The Democratic and unaffiliated voters who supported Brown’s tax-hike proposal in big numbers last November were lukewarm on a parcel-tax change. Republicans were firmly opposed.

“There’s enough money there,” said Ron Simington, 40, a Republican military contractor from Ramona. “I think it really comes down to mismanagement. The money just needs to be dealt with properly.”

Since 2000, when voters lowered the vote threshold for local bonds to fund school construction, the passage rate for those measures increased dramatically. Less than half of the successful measures secured the two-thirds vote that was previously required.

Pennsylvania state Rep. Stephen Bloom (R) is under fire after seeking cosponsors for legislation that critics say would allow creationism to be taught in the classroom. Bloom denies such claims, saying the bill would spur intellectual debate by allowing K-12 students in public schools to question scientific theories like evolution and climate change, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

“With free discourse in the classroom under threat, I will soon be introducing a bill to preserve academic freedom in Pennsylvania’s schools,” Bloom said in a memo. “Efforts to squelch and stifle free critical inquiry in the classroom have too frequently arisen, often in the context of the teaching and debate of controversial scientific theories and paradigms.”

In the memo, sent Aug. 1, Bloom began soliciting fellow politicians to cosponsor the bill, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

""In the real world, outside of academia, scientific theory is up for all kinds of argument,"" Bloom said of the bill, which has not been written. ""I don't think it's right to exclude any particular kind of argument prima facie. If a student wants to discuss a criticism, he or she should be able to,"" reports the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Bloom told a local ABC affiliate that he did not intend to insert religion into the classroom, but rather to expand students’ academic freedoms.

""The free exchange of ideas was being quelled by these very strict speech codes in school,"" said Bloom. ""And, so for me ... it's just something from the heart.""

Still, the idea of Bloom’s bill already has prompted opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union in Pennsylvania.

Andy Hoover, legislative director for the Pennsylvania branch of the ACLU, said that it would be difficult to ensure that scientific debates regarding evolution would not veer into religious territory.

""We do think that ultimately some teacher somewhere or students ... will bring religious doctrine into public school classrooms,"" he told a local ABC affiliate.

States like Louisiana and Tennessee currently have similar academic freedom laws in place. At the same time, comparable bills in states like Colorado and Indiana recently failed to pass."

Last year, researchers at Stanford and Harvard reported that the vast majority of high-achieving, low-income students do not apply to any selective colleges.

“Kids who’ve never heard of most elite institutions, who don’t know anyone who’s gone to one, who assume they can’t afford one, aren’t going to apply unless you go out and recruit them,” said Anthony W. Marx, president of Amherst from 2003 to 2011.

Most of the top private colleges rely on nonprofit groups like Questbridge and the Posse Foundation to help them find promising disadvantaged students. However, some recruit heavily that way while others only take one or two students per year. And some elite institutions, like Washington University, do not work with such groups.

For colleges that have the resources, another factor is how willing they are to spend the money to hunt for those applicants, and the much larger amount needed to help lower-income students go to a $60,000-a-year college. In addition, poor students face bigger challenges to remain enrolled and colleges often spend money on support services for them.

Among the 50 most selective private colleges, as measured by test scores and the percentage of applicants admitted, about four-fifths have need-blind admissions, meaning that they pledge to judge applicants without considering their ability to pay. Most of the colleges that do consider financial need to varying degrees, including Colby College and Washington and Lee, have lower Pell enrollments than most of their peers.

At a forum last fall, Mark S. Wrighton, the chancellor of Washington University, said of need-blind admission, according to the student newspaper, “It’s not our highest priority” — a comment that Mr. Berg said was taken out of context."

The Board', 'Which Operates Separately The Newsroom', 'Proceeds On The Presumption That Serious']",Was adopting Common Core a mistake?,"Think back to the dark days of 2009, when school districts in California and across the nation faced dire budget shortfalls. States would have done almost anything for extra money, and when the Obama administration dangled Race to the Top grants in front of them, many of them did indeed race to adopt the policies that would win federal approval — such as including student test scores in teachers’ performance rankings and adopting common curriculum standards.

Because public education falls almost entirely under state authority, this sort of arm-twisting was the only way the administration could persuade states to do its bidding. The No Child Left Behind Act, the school accountability law adopted during the George W. Bush administration, also used money — federal Title 1 funding for disadvantaged students — to press its rigid standards on states.

Race to the Top pressured financially strapped states to adopt education policies that varied widely in their value. Many of the policies, such as the push to tie teacher evaluations to student test scores, were not backed by any sort of evidence. Yet they were adopted quickly because of application deadlines, and there was little time for thoughtful crafting of new rules.

EDUCATION: California Schools Guide

Yet for all the excitement, Race to the Top provided little actual cash. California would have received a one-time award of $700 million — less than 2% of what it spends on education every year. It failed to win a grant, but nonetheless had committed itself, as most states did, to the Common Core curriculum standards that the Obama administration supported. Implementing the standards, which are set to take effect in a year, will cost the state well over $1 billion.

Was adopting Common Core a mistake? A lot depends on how well it’s carried out. In theory, the new standards, which cover only math and English for the moment, look promising. They’re intended to foster more analytical thinking and polished writing — important preparation for higher education — and to minimize rote memorization. At the same time, there are valid concerns about mandates to reduce the amount of fiction read in English classes and about material that won’t be taught because of the focus on learning fewer subjects in more depth. Implementation so far has not been promising. Schools in New York state have been rattled by the start of Common Core-based tests even though the curriculum isn’t in place and the teachers haven’t been trained. As Los Angeles Times staff writer Howard Blume recently reported, there have been missteps in California, such as when schools in the Santa Ana Unified School District tried to start the new curriculum before the state had approved its own version or adopted instructional materials.

Advertisement

Now that the costs and complications of Common Core are becoming better known, both liberals and conservatives have expressed some buyer’s remorse. School administrators and teachers say it will be a long time before schools will be up to speed on the new curriculum, and that it would be unfair to judge schools and teachers based on the tests during the early years of implementation. Tea party Republicans complain about the federal government’s interference in curriculum, and a few states have withheld funding for the start of the new standards — though no one forced them into this to begin with.

Resistance among conservatives seems to be more about picking a winnable battle against President Obama than providing the best possible education for students. Concern that the rollout of the new standards is moving too fast for thoughtful, successful implementation is better grounded; we’d rather see a smoother, more successful implementation than further disruption in schools. In any case, test results during the first years should not be counted until teachers have gained training and experience in the new curriculum and the kinks have been worked out.

Advertisement

Whether Common Core will provide the promised results remains to be seen, but the ruckus over it — as well as over other reforms passed in an effort to win Race to the Top grants — shows this much: States are better off adopting new educational policies because they’ve been shown to work better for students rather than because they come with a financial prize attached."

Invited by the school's principal and hosted by a fundamentalist organization called ""Believe in West Virginia,"" which advertised the event by circulating flyers with the tag-line God's plan for sexual purity, Stenzel's mission was to convince students that condoms aren't safe and that those who use birth control have mothers who hate them.

High school student Katelyn Campbell, a senior, had another mission: let students know her message was bunk. She filed a complaint with the ACLU and began speaking out against Stenzel's visit.

And that's when her principal began threatening her.

This from ThinkProgress:



A West Virginia high school student is filing an injunction against her principal, who she claims is threatening to punish her for speaking out against a factually inaccurate abstinence assembly at her school. Katelyn Campbell, who is the student body vice president at George Washington High School, alleges her principal threatened to call the college where she’s been accepted to report that she has “bad character.” [...] Despite being threatened, Campbell is not backing down. She hopes that filing this injunction will protect her freedom of speech to continue advocating for comprehensive sexual health resources for West Virginia’s youth. “West Virginia has the ninth highest pregnancy rate in the U.S.,” Campbell told the Gazette. “I should be able to be informed in my school what birth control is and how I can get it. With the policy at GW, under George Aulenbacher, information about birth control and sex education has been suppressed. Our nurse wasn’t allowed to talk about where you can get birth control for free in the city of Charleston.”

According to Campbell, her principal said, “How would you feel if I called your college and told them what bad character you have and what a backstabber you are?” Campbell alleges that Aulenbacher continued to berate her in his office, eventually driving her to tears. “He threatened me and my future in order to put forth his own personal agenda and make teachers and students feel they cant speak up because of fear of retaliation,” she said of the incident.

The bravery of Campbell should not be underestimated, for her principal's threats were quite severe, particularly when viewed through the lens of a prospective college student.Speakers like Stenzel cause irreparable harm by frightening students with misinformation into believing that contraception is dangerous; approximately 60 percent of teens are misinformed about contraception, and speakers like Stenzel and fundamentalist figures are often to blame for this.

Luckily for George Washington's students, this misinformation is coming to the fore, and students are rallying around Campbell's cause, planning to take the matter before the school board.

The assembly was supposed to publicly shame high school students. The ones being shamed now? School officials and a conservative speaker who has no business talking to a group of young people.

(CNN) - Rep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kansas, faulted Senate Democrats on Saturday for this week's hike in student loan interest rates and urged the upper chamber to pass legislation that resolves the issue as soon as the holiday recess ends.

""For too long, politicians have been in charge of setting these rates, and we keep coming back to cliffs and deadlines like this one,"" Jenkins said in the GOP weekly address. ""Paying for college is difficult enough without all this uncertainty. I have two kids in college, I know how hard it can be.""



The interest rates on some student loans officially doubled Monday - to 6.8% from 3.4% - after the Senate failed to reach a compromise by the July 1 deadline.

The hike hits about seven million new subsidized Stafford loans this year for middle- and low-income students, but does not apply to existing loans.

Negotiators are stuck largely on the question of whether to require an overall cap above which interest rates on new loans could not rise.

Top Senate Democrats want a cap in place to protect students if interest rates spike. That is at odds with the slightly different proposals from President Barack Obama and various congressional Republicans, which are tied to 10-year Treasury bond rates and would include charges for administrative costs but would not include caps.

Republicans, who prefer a more market-based approach, often point out that the White House's proposal falls more in line with their own.

""When President Obama proposed letting the markets set interest rates instead, the Republican-led House passed a bill reflecting his plan,"" Jenkins said. ""Republicans in the Senate came to the table with similar ideas. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats attacked the president's plan, refused to work with us, and allowed this rate hike to take effect, leaving for the July 4th holiday without passing a solution.""

Senators worked through last week to try to reach a deal, but lawmakers from both parties ultimately predicted an agreement would not be made in time.

Nevertheless, many of those same senators said they hope to finalize an agreement shortly after the break and have it apply retroactively so students are not hurt by the temporary hike.

Another disagreement centers on whether the legislation is revenue-neutral. Senate Democrats say the government should not earn any money or pay down the deficit from the loans they provide, something that would happen under the other proposals.

""Republicans continue to insist that we reduce the deficit on the backs of students and middle-class families,"" Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said a week before the deadline.

N.Y. attorney general is suing Trump and his business school for %2440M

Trump says Schneiderman tried to leverage campaign contributions Ivanka

%27Wild accusations%2C%27 says Schneiderman spokesman

ALBANY, N.Y. — Celebrity developer Donald Trump has filed two ethics complaints against state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, accusing him of misconduct.

Trump says the Democratic attorney general solicited campaign donations from Trump's daughter even as Schneiderman's office was investigating the real estate mogul's ""Trump University,"" according to the complaints.

Schneiderman hasn't solicited Trump for a campaign contribution since he took office in January 2011, according to a spokesman. And while Schneiderman says he met socially with Ivanka Trump and her husband, neither is an official of Trump University, and anyone who contributes must certify he or she has no matters under investigation by the attorney general's office, the spokesman said.

In August, Schneiderman sued Trump and his business school for $40 million. Schneiderman said the school engaged in persistent fraud and illegal and deceptive conduct and violated federal consumer protection law. In a conflict that was nasty from the start, Schneiderman said then that, ""No one, no matter how rich or famous they are, has a right to scam hard-working New Yorkers.""

Trump, who is considering a run for governor as a Republican, filed complaints this month with two state ethics panels, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics and the state Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption. Schneiderman has appointees and staff working for the Moreland Commission and deputized many of its commissioners. The commission is charged with uncovering ""pay-to-play"" corruption involving campaign contributions and official state action throughout state government.

""We consider and review all communications that are submitted to the commission,"" Moreland spokeswoman Michelle Duffy said. ""However, we do not discuss potential or ongoing investigations.""

Neither she nor John Milgrim of the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, New York's ethics and lobbying board, would comment on any action their panel is taking as a result of the complaints.

Trump's attorney in the ethics case, former state lobbying regulator David Grandeau, said Schneiderman tried to use his leverage while running an investigation to wring out more campaign contributions from Trump's daughter, Ivanka.

""It's pay-or-pray fundraising tactics,"" Grandeau said.

""Donald Trump and his associates will say and do anything to avoid talking about the facts in this case,"" Schneiderman spokesman Matt Mittenthal said. ""His wild accusations, outlandish conspiracy theories and outright distortions will not distract Attorney General Schneiderman from pursuing justice for the students victimized by Mr. Trump and his scam university."""

The new standards were developed with input from officials in 26 states –- including Kentucky –- and are part of an effort to make science curricula more uniform across the country. While supporters feel the standards will help beat back scientific ignorance, some religious groups take issue because the standards treat evolution as fact and talk about the human role in climate change.

The Kentucky Board of Education adopted the standards in June and held hearings to get public feedback on the standards last week before they were presented to the state legislature for official approval.

Matt Singleton, a Baptist minister, is one of the opponents who spoke to the board about why the standards should not be adopted, according to The Courier-Journal. “Outsiders are telling public school families that we must follow the rich man’s elitist religion of evolution, that we no longer have what the Kentucky Constitution says is the right to worship almighty God,” Singleton said. “Instead, this fascist method teaches that our children are the property of the state.”

Another opponent, Dena Stewart-Gore, suggested that the standards will make religious students feel ostracized. “The way socialism works is it takes anybody that doesn’t fit the mold and discards them,” she said, per the The Courier-Journal. “We are even talking genocide and murder here, folks.”

Supporters of the standards contended that opponents’ fears are unfounded and that the standards’ curriculum is based on evidence.

A handful of states including Kansas, Maryland and Vermont have already adopted the Next Generation Science Standards. The Kentucky Board of Education will be accepting written testimonies regarding the standards until July 31."

Her appointment also means the 10-campus system will be headed by a woman for the first time in its 145-year history.

Napolitano’s nomination by a committee of UC regents came after a secretive process that insiders said focused on her early as a high-profile, although untraditional, candidate who has led large public agencies and shown a strong interest in improving education.

UC officials believe that her Cabinet experiences –- which include helping to lead responses to hurricanes and tornadoes and overseeing some anti-terrorism measures -- will help UC administer its federal energy and nuclear weapons labs and aid its federally funded research in medicine and other areas.

“While some may consider her to be an unconventional choice, Secretary Napolitano is without a doubt the right person at the right time to lead this incredible university,” Sherry Lansing, the regent and former film industry executive who headed the search committee, said in a statement being released Friday. “She will bring fresh eyes and a new sensibility -- not only to UC, but to all of California. She will stand as a vigorous advocate for faculty, students and staff at a time when great changes in our state, and across the globe, are presenting as many opportunities as challenges.”

Napolitano, who is a Democrat, was appointed by former President Clinton as the U.S. attorney in Arizona and then won elections as state attorney general and twice as governor, a position she held from 2003 to 2009. President Obama then named her to lead Homeland Security, an agency with an annual $60-billion budget and 240,000 employees.

She has been a strong voice in favor of immigration reform that would provide a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally, a stance that has angered some Republicans who contend she has not done enough to secure the nation’s borders.

TALK BACK: Is Janet Napolitano a good choice for UC president?

A source close to Napolitano, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said that Napolitano deliberated for a long time after the executive search firm hired by UC quietly contacted her.

“I think she loves working for President Obama and serving the American people, but at the same time, this is a unique opportunity,” he said. Napolitano knows “UC is probably the premier institution in the country. She is motivated by the fact that being a part of UC, she will be a part of educating future leaders of tomorrow and be part of a state that sets so much of the agenda nationally.”

Napolitano, 55, is no stranger to California colleges since she attended Santa Clara University and was its first woman valedictorian before earning her law degree at University of Virginia. Her father was dean of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, a family connection that UC regents also liked since they oversee medical centers. In Arizona, she helped to enact plans to provide full-day kindergarten and to renovate university buildings, winning fans among educators.

The Napolitano friend insisted that nothing was pushing her out of Washington now, although the Senate’s recently approved compromise plan on immigration faces an uncertain fate in the Republican-controlled House.

REACTION: Obama lauds UC’s choice of Napolitano

The secretary faced some controversy in Congress when critics alleged the Boston Marathon bombings, reportedly perpetrated by ethnic Chechens from Russia who had been granted political asylum, exposed shortcomings in security.

The UC regents are expected to approve her nomination as UC’s 20th president on Thursday during a meeting in San Francisco. Napolitano is expected to take up the UC reins some time in September, officials said.

UC has an annual budget of $24 billion, 230,000 students, 191,000 faculty and staff, five medical centers and three national laboratories.

Her proposed salary has not been released, pending discussions among the regents. But since her Cabinet salary of about $200,000 is about a third of the annual $591,000 that current UC president Mark G. Yudof makes, the regents presumably will be able to avoid a potential furor and not feel pressured to give her a big pay raise over Yudof’s.

Yudof, a former top administrator at state universities in Texas and Minnesota, will step down after five years as UC president in late August, in part due to some health issues. Yudof, who plans to teach law at UC Berkeley, also has said it was a good time to leave as UC’s finances were improving and most tuitions are frozen, thanks to extra state tax revenues that are helping to reverse years of brutal budget cuts and fee hikes.

In an era of tight budgets, public universities are seeking leaders who can bargain as peers with governors and legislators and also impress alumni and parents. Napolitano will deal with Gov. Jerry Brown, who is a UC regent and has been pressing UC to move more quickly into online education and to improve graduation rates.

Robert Powell, the chairman of UC’s systemwide faculty Senate and who consulted on the UC search, said Napolitano stood out among the more than 300 potential candidates. She “has demonstrated an outstanding ability to deal with complex organizations under demanding circumstances,” he said.

Acknowledging that she will be a departure from UC’s traditions of having a president with strong records in campus administration or academic research, he stressed that her political skills will be important. “When she goes to Sacramento, clearly the conversations will be on a different plane,” he said.

As for any possible complaints that UC would be led by a Democratic politician, Powell noted that the regents’ search committee included Republicans who joined in the choice for Napolitano and that she won elections in a Republican state.

A switch from politics and the Cabinet to university leadership is not unheard of. Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services during the Clinton administration, became chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and is now president of the University of Miami. Former Indiana governor Mitch Daniels now heads Purdue University.

Napolitano, who is unmarried and has no children, underwent a mastectomy for breast cancer in 2000, just weeks before she addressed the Democratic National Convention. She has been mentioned as a possible nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court and as U.S. attorney general.

One finding of the report that received little attention, however, was about cultural attitudes toward success. Of the five nationalities polled, Americans were least likely to believe that success in life was determined by forces outside our control.

Just 36 percent of Americans believe in this fatalistic statement, while the vast majority of their compatriots are greater believers in self-determination. Put another way, Americans are (not surprisingly) more likely to believe in the American dream.

Americans with less education are more fatalistic, however. The study found that 22 percent of college graduates believe they have little control over their fate, compared to 41 percent of Americans without a college degree.

Even so, American nongraduates still seem to think they have more control over their destinies than the average German, Frenchman or Spaniard does. Almost three-quarters of Germans, for example, believe that success is determined by factors outside our control.

These findings are particularly interesting when juxtaposed with a separate report from the Pew Economic Mobility project. That report, which examined economic and social mobility in 10 Western countries, found that Americans actually appear to have less control over their success in life than their counterparts do.

In particular, the educational attainment of a person’s parents — a factor usually determined before that person’s birth — seems to matter more for mobility in the United States.

“There is a stronger link between parental education and children’s economic, educational and socio-emotional outcomes than in any other country investigated,” the report says.

As Richard Wilkinson suggested in a recent TED Talk, if you want to live the American dream — and have greater control over your own likelihood of success — you should probably move to Denmark, where the poor have a better chance of moving up in the world."

Teachers receiving pink slips%2C Duncan says

He blames %27dysfunction%27 in Congress

Spending cuts would more than a million students%2C thousands of teachers

WASHINGTON — U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan came out swinging Thursday, directing his harshest words at congressional lawmakers before what he calls ""increasingly likely"" mandatory spending cuts for ""real kids, real teachers and real classrooms"" from sequestration this March.

Speaking to reporters at a breakfast roundtable, Duncan said teachers are beginning to receive pink slips based on school districts' fears of sequestration, the mandated, across-the-board 5% cuts created by Congress to push lawmakers into a budget deal. ""This stuff is real,"" he said.

A former Chicago schools CEO, Duncan blamed what he called ""the height of dysfunction"" in Congress: ""There's no one in their right mind who would say this is good for kids and good for the country, yet somehow it becomes tenable in Washington. I just think people don't spend enough time in the real world. And if we spent more time in the real world, we wouldn't have this kind of intransigence here.""

The Obama administration estimates that the automatic spending cuts would slice $725 million from federal Title I programs for poor children, affecting 1.2 million students in 2,700 schools and putting the jobs of about 10,000 teachers at risk.

Also on the chopping block, according to Duncan: $598 million for federal aid to disabled students, affecting an additional 7,200 teachers. Public schools on Indian land, as well as Department of Defense schools on military bases, which rely more directly than most on federal aid, could see the fallout more quickly — as soon as this spring, said Carmel Martin, a top Duncan aide. A few schools could even be forced to shorten their school day or school year, she said.

Duncan called the situation ""very, very worrying,"" saying schools already operate with too few resources and personnel.

""The (school) day is too short. The year's too short. We don't have enough after-school. And now to say, 'OK, because we can't sit at a table and compromise and find some middle ground, we're just going to let a bunch of kids start to suffer and a bunch of teachers start to get pink slips?' How's that rational? How's that leadership? Is that why you ran for office and got elected and did all these things? Do you feel proud about that? I don't get it.""

Andrew Coulson, director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the libertarian Cato Institute, a Washington think-tank, said losing that many teachers won't have as devastating an effect as Duncan predicts.

The public school system has, in effect, hired too many people over the past four decades, he said. Since 1970, enrollment has grown by 8.5%, while employment has doubled, he said, with little to show in either higher high school graduation rates or a smaller achievement gap between poor and middle-class students.

""We have too many public school employees, not too few,"" Coulson said. ""What we've done is to warehouse people in an ineffective, inefficient bureaucracy.""

Duncan, a Harvard graduate who briefly played professional basketball in Australia, is fond of pointing out that U.S. students are locked in global competition with their counterparts in other developed countries. He invoked the image Thursday: ""This is not what South Korea is doing right now. This is not what Singapore is doing right now. This is not what India is doing right now. This is not what China is doing right now. Do they care more about their kids and their education system than we do? This is a choice. We're making a choice to go down this path and it's mind-boggling to me that this possibility might actually become reality.""

Mike Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a right-leaning Washington think-tank, said the scale of possible cuts would actually be smaller than what recession-weary districts have already experienced. Federal funding accounts for only about 10% of most budgets, so 5% of that is ""pretty small"" on an individual school basis.

He said the forced cuts might push districts to find ""federal money spent on fluff"" and get rid of it. ""If a little bit of it goes away, schools are going to be able to adapt without making huge changes,"" he said. ""This is not the end of the world as we know it — there are lots of ways to protect teacher jobs and still make cuts."""

A Seattle Native']",‘Miracle’ L.A. school board triumph: She thought of her students,"For a fleeting moment in her underdog campaign, Monica Ratliff faltered. The candidate for the Los Angeles school board stood outside her chief fundraiser’s home and balked at the task of asking people for money.

Then, she said, she thought of three struggling students in her fifth-grade class at San Pedro Street Elementary, located in a gritty downtown Los Angeles neighborhood. She thought of the vocational programs, better training for teachers and other ideas she could push for as a board member to keep her students from falling off track.

Her hesitancy vanished.

“I am asking for them,” she said after her electoral triumph last week. “After that, I was inspired.”

From start to finish in what supporters are calling her “miracle” win, Ratliff has been driven by thoughts of her students. The 43-year-old teacher defeated Antonio Sanchez, a political aide backed by a $2.2-million campaign (compared with Ratliff’s $52,000) and supported by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, his allies, heavyweight labor unions and others.

But, her supporters say, Ratliff had what Sanchez lacked: The authenticity of a 12-year teaching career and a deep emotional commitment to her students that visibly surfaces when she talks about those who need her help.

Advertisement

Ratliff entered the race motivated by thoughts of those students — some of whom had stumbled after leaving her school but might have stayed on track with more sustained support. She learned of the District 6 open seat just three days before the filing deadline but jumped in anyway.

“This is my chance to help these kids,” she recalled thinking. “I could change their educational lives.”

Advertisement

During the campaign, she refused to take off any time from teaching, despite urging to do so from some of her campaign advisors. She went to bed at 11 p.m. on election night not knowing whether she won or lost, because she had to wake up at 6 a.m. to make the commute from Sunland to school.

And as she prepares to join the Board of Education, Ratliff brims with ideas about how she hopes to make the nation’s second-largest school district more effective for students. How far she will get in promoting her ideas, however, is uncertain. The seven-member board is divided on many issues, although not always along the same lines.

Advertisement

One big theme Ratliff voices is more local control for schools to choose their own curriculum and spending priorities rather than follow top-down mandates.

Her classroom experience gives her strong views on what works and doesn’t. District assessment tests are a “waste of money and time” because the results come in too late to help teachers, who constantly assess their students anyway, she said. Why not free up money and let schools make their own purchasing decisions — as San Pedro has done with federal dollars to fund a nurse, library aide, teaching assistants?

Advertisement

“You’re not getting enough bang for the buck,” she said of those tests, noting that charter schools are not required to give them.

Ratliff prefers to teach reading and writing with children’s literary classics rather than the district-issued textbook anthology. So far this year, her class has dug into such favorites as “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” “Old Yeller,” “The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe” and, currently, “Holes” — books she says engages them far more than the shortened stories in district anthologies. How about encouraging all schools to make their own curriculum choices?

Advertisement

Even questions of class size and campus security should be left to the local school, she said. Smaller classes could help struggling students, but others might do fine in larger ones.

Does the district really need to spend $4.2 million for extra security aides at campuses in the aftermath of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn.? If schools were allowed to decide how best to spend those safety dollars, she said, her own campus might have decided to fund a gated buzzer system after a school staff member was threatened by someone who walked in off the street.

“I’ve felt some of the district mandates are disconnected from the classroom,” she said.

Another major interest, she said, will be working with the district and United Teachers Los Angeles to find incentives for highly effective teachers to work in low-performing schools.

Advertisement

At her own school, for instance, the staff has boosted students who are overwhelmingly low-income and not fluent in English to outperform their district peers in reading and math. Nearly two-thirds are at grade level in math and more than half are proficient in reading.

And she is keen to push for more vocational programs. One of her students, she said, could be more talented on a more technical path but may not make it if pushed along a rigorous academic track.

Advertisement

The main goal of her opponent’s biggest funders was to safeguard the job of L.A. schools Supt. John Deasy and strengthen his influence. During the campaign, Ratliff’s position on Deasy “evolved,” as she put it. Most recently, she said she wants to keep him on the job, but reserves her right to evaluate him.

As her school’s union representative, she had to defend the rights of teachers, yet she still enjoyed a strong rapport with her principal. She served in the union’s main decision-making body — its House of Representatives — yet the union did nothing of substance to elect her. As a result, she may have that rare opportunity to demonstrate true independence.

Advertisement

Her nuanced position on teacher evaluations aligns with neither Deasy nor the union. Although she’s spent her career in a traditional school, she has no innate hostility toward independently managed charter schools, most of which are non-union.

“She’s not the kind of person ever to hold a grudge or base her decisions on who scratched her back and who is her friend,” said Ruby Chavez, a San Pedro colleague. “If you know Monica, you’ll understand she has a mind of her own.”

Advertisement

For now, Ratliff is savoring her victory. At a celebration party in Granada Hills over the weekend, more than 100 supporters ate barbecue and marveled at what many called her “David and Goliath” win.

Fred Huebscher, her campaign consultant, said two decisions proved critically important: Her ballot designation as “fifth-grade teacher,” which conjured up warm memories of elementary school and images of her “teaching cute kids.” And her decision to place an accent mark over the “o” in her first name to signal her Latina heritage (she refused suggestions to use her mother’s maiden name of Asenio Padilla because she did not want to dishonor her father).

Advertisement

Other teachers who walked precincts with her said some voters told them they were repelled by Villaraigosa’s and Sanchez’s reliance on millions of dollars of outside funding. Chuck Kanganis, her boyfriend and campaign manager, said voters could connect with Ratliff’s intelligence, compassion and “absolute integrity.”

As she put it Saturday: “My grass-roots campaign was so grass-roots, it’s seeds. But thanks to you it grew and grew.”

Oh no. It's about not allowing DEMOCRATS to vote. White Democrats too.

From their brief:

DOJ’s accusations of racial discrimination are baseless. In 2011, both houses of the Texas Legislature were controlled by large Republican majorities, and their redistricting decisions were designed to increase the Republican Party’s electoral prospects at the expense of the Democrats....The redistricting decisions of which DOJ complains were motivated by partisan rather than racial considerations, and the plaintiffs and DOJ have zero evidence to prove the contrary. It is perfectly constitutional for a Republican-controlled legislature to make partisan districting decisions, even if there are incidental effects on minority voters who support Democratic candidates.

Translation:

""So, basically, we just want to fuck over all Democrats, and if the Black and Brown people are also hurt, well, they shouldn't vote for Democrats, should they? It's only collateral damage""

You know, having them actually come right out and say it--that they don't want Democrats to vote--is somehow not surprising. But it's good that they're doing it at last.

But wait! There's more. To address the actual accusations of racial bias and discrimination, Texas is using the argument that ""Yeah, there may be an isolated incident or two, but it's NOTHING like it was in 1965"".

From the article, which says it better than I can:

Furthermore, the state claims, even if Texas did discriminate, and the state stresses that it did not, it was nothing as bad as “the ‘pervasive,’ ‘flagrant,’ ‘widespread,’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination that originally justified preclearance in 1965.” So as long as Texas skies aren’t alight with flames from burning crosses, what’s the big whoop?

So, according to this, Texas is arguing that Section 2, and in fact the entire reasons for preclearance are all based on conditions in 1965. And that since ""things are better than in 1965"" then Section 2 is null and void.

I think the fact that Texas is second only to Mississippi in Section 2 lawsuits is the basis for this particular argument.

However, there is a danger here. Texas is arguing that ONLY conditions that existed in 1965 would justify Federal supervision of the elections process. Sort of like an ""originalism to the extreme"" argument.

And that can be dangerous because there are those on the Supreme Court that would like nothing more than the total eradication of the Voting Rights Act.

Not to mention the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments, but that's another story."
http://news.yahoo.com/mitt-romney-documentary-164457144.html,,[],Behind-the-scenes doc shows moment Romney learned he had lost the presidency,"Mitt Romney really thought he was going to defeat President Barack Obama in the 2012 election — a belief he held right up until the polls closed on Election Day. As he told reporters on his campaign plane en route to his election night rally in Boston, he hadn’t considered losing. He hadn’t even written a concession speech.

And that wasn’t just rhetoric. A new documentary about Romney’s 2008 and 2012 presidential bids captures the moment the GOP nominee realizes his quest for the White House is over, that the internal poll numbers that suggested a landslide victory over Obama were dramatically wrong.

“I just can’t believe you’re gonna lose,” someone tells him.

“Yeah, yep,” a stunned Romney replies.

“So what do you think you say in a concession speech,” Romney adds with a hint of a smile. “By the way, someone have a number for the president?”

It’s the opening scene from a trailer for “Mitt,” a documentary set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 17 and stream on Netflix starting Jan. 24.

The film, directed by Greg Whitley, features behind-the-scenes footage and candid interviews with Romney and his family, dating to 2006 when the former Massachusetts governor ran and lost his bid for the GOP nomination to Sen. John McCain.

The documentary shows another side of Romney, who was long criticized for being awkward and forced on the stump. In the film, Romney is joking and at ease — as he often was during off-the-record chats with reporters on his campaign plane. One scene shows him trying to iron a suit while he’s actually wearing it.

Another scene shows him bluntly acknowledging the public regards him as “the flipping Mormon” — a rare admission of the effect his religion had on his bid for the presidency.

The film also includes footage of the Romney family discussing his potential presidential bid ahead of the 2008 campaign and Romney’s blunt admission that the nominee who runs and loses a bid is branded “a loser for life.”

“If you don’t win, we’ll still love you,” his oldest son, Tagg, tells him at one point. “The country may think of you as a laughingstock, and we’ll know the truth, and that’s OK.”"

They like Homeland Security more.

They like federal bureaucrats more.

They like the IRS more. Far, far more.

A newly released Pew Research Center poll gives Congress credit for a rare miracle: uniting Democrats and Republicans. With a sense of agreement rarely seen in recent weeks, all political groups have come to the same conclusion: They dislike Congress overwhelmingly. And all sides agree that the system isn’t the problem — the actual members are.

Only 19% say they trust government to do right either always or most of the time, which matches the low last seen in August 2011, during the last congressional dispute over the debt ceiling. No coincidence there.

Yet it’s not everything in Washington that Americans dislike — despite the impression one sometimes gets of a nation rising up with pitchforks in hand. Views of governmental agencies and actions are varied and mostly positive.

Three-fourths of Americans have a favorable view of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, a figure almost matched by NASA and the Department of Defense. Of 13 government entities measured, nine had favorability ratings above 60%. Only one, the IRS, had a negative profile, with 51% disapproving and 44% approving of it.

Still — far better than Congress. Only 23% of Americans had a favorable view of that institution (unanimity: 23% among Republicans, 25% among Democrats and 20% among independents). Federal workers, often decried as exemplars of inefficiency and worthy of the furlough they just got, were almost three times as popular, with 62% of Americans feeling favorable toward them.

Incumbents tend to shrug away such results, since these polls take a national measurement and their elections are local or regional, at most. As has been written endlessly, most members reside in safe districts where their views are largely in sync with the populace, if not with the representative from across the aisle. And voters historically have tended to hate Congress as an institution but appreciate, at least, their own member of Congress.

But if numbers in the poll hold — and that is a big if, with even primary elections months away — at least some of those incumbents have cause to be more concerned.

According to Pew, almost 4 in 10 voters said they did not want their own representative reelected, a sobering percentage. Before the last two non-presidential elections, both “change” elections that altered the makeup of Congress, the percentage of Americans wanting to upend their member of Congress was in the 20s."

Dorset%2C Minn. re-elected its 4-year-old mayor

Bobby Tufts was only three when he won last year%27s race

He plans to raise money for the Ronald McDonald House Charities in Fargo%2C N.D.

DORSET, Minn. (AP) — Robert ""Bobby"" Tufts hasn't made it to preschool yet, but he's already been elected twice as mayor of a tiny tourist town in northern Minnesota.

Mayor Tufts' name was picked Sunday during annual Taste of Dorset festival to be mayor of Dorset for a second term. It has no formal city government and has a population of 22 to 28, depending on whether the minister and his family are in town.

Anyone could vote as many times as they like — for $1 a vote — at any of the ballot boxes in stores around town. The proceeds go toward organizing the festival.

Bobby was only 3 when he won election last year. His mother, Emma Tufts, said she and her son, who turns 5 in October, got choked up when his name was pulled for re-election Sunday.

The boy picked a random man out of the crowd to pick the name out of a clear tub. and the man was blindfolded twice, she said.

While this was happening, Bobby told the crowd how to musky fish, she said.

""He's been going since 3 o'clock yesterday with cameras on his face,"" she said Sunday afternoon. ""He's having a long day but he's done really well. I'm surprised.""

Asked how he felt during a phone interview, a tired Bobby made clear he was done answering questions. ""I want to be with the boys,"" he told his mother.

They were on their way to dinner and then planned to go fishing or have a bonfire to celebrate. Bobby, of nearby Nevis, starts preschool this fall.

Emma Tufts said her son's agenda includes raising money for the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Red River Valley in Fargo, N.D., and a new welcome sign for Dorset, which bills itself as the Restaurant Capital of the World.

They already raised $750 from a walk this summer and planned to donate half the proceeds of Sunday's T-shirt sales to the charity. He wants to do a snowshoe scavenger hunt this winter to raise money, she said."

Making his first public comments since losing last November’s presidential election, Romney appeared mystified still that the country didn’t see things his way. He went on the attack against President Obama during a wide-ranging interview on “Fox News Sunday,” as if the Republican hadn’t lost a beat since giving his last stump speech.

Explaining the defeat, Romney and his wife spread around the blame — Mitt to Obama winning over so many blacks and Hispanics by enacting universal health care, Ann to a news media she believed unfairly caricatured her husband. Yet although Romney said “you rehearse all the mistakes that you made,” Romney mostly did not dwell on his own failings as a candidate.

Romney insisted he is getting on with his life — Fox showed him pushing some grandkids on a swing set and cradling his youngest in his arms (“No. 19 and No. 20,” he called the newborn twins) — but he revealed flashes of pain. For him, the White House forever will remain an unfulfilled destiny.

“I look at what’s happening right now, I wish I were there,” Romney said. “It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done.”

Up until Election Day, both Mitt and Ann said, they thought they would win. “We were a little blindsided,” Ann told Fox anchor Chris Wallace. She seemed more heartbroken than her husband, saying she has cried since he lost on Nov. 6.

“You know the great ‘Princess Bride’ line, ‘Mostly dead’?” she said. “I’m mostly over it. But not completely. And you have moments where you, you know, go back and feel the sorrow of the loss. And so, yes, I think we’re not mostly dead yet.”

She added, “I know he would have been a fabulous president, and I mourn the fact that he’s not there.”

The transition from presidential nominee — life in the intoxicating and never fading spotlight, with a minute-by-minute schedule and bevies of aides, press and Secret Service agents surrounding you — to campaign has-been is always difficult. Just ask John McCain and John Kerry.

But unlike McCain and Kerry, who continued distinguished Senate careers after their failed White House bids in 2008 and 2004 respectively, Romney had no job to return to. The former Massachusetts governor tended his wounds at his San Diego beach house, largely in seclusion, making up for lost time with his family and friends.

Photographs of Romney surfaced online, including one of him pumping his own gas with his hair messed up. “None of those were done by professional photographers — or I might have, you know, combed my hair,” Romney joked to Wallace.

Romney began easing back onto the public stage with Sunday’s interview. He is scheduled to give his first speech since the election at the Conservative Political Action Conference next week.

In the Fox interview, Romney was not shy about critiquing Obama’s handling of the nation’s fiscal crises — continuing the fights that shaped the 2012 campaign.

The hardest part about losing, Romney said, has been watching “this golden moment just slip away with politics.” He accused Obama of using automatic federal spending cuts known as the sequester to score political points.

“No one can think that that’s been a success for the president,” Romney said. “He didn’t think the sequester would happen. It is happening. To date, what we’ve seen is the president out campaigning to the American people, doing rallies around the country, flying around the country and berating Republicans and blaming and pointing.”

Said Ann Romney, “I totally believe at this moment, if Mitt were there in the office, that we would not be facing sequestration right now.”

When Wallace asked him to critique his campaign, Romney said his failure to sway Hispanic and black voters was “a real weakness.” He said minorities voted Democratic in part because “Obamacare was very attractive, particularly to those without health insurance, and they came out in large numbers to vote.”

Although Stuart Stevens, Romney’s chief campaign strategist, has pushed this health-care argument, it is not a conventional analysis of why Romney lost.

Many analysts believe Romney lost because he became defined as an out-of-touch plutocrat who championed the wealthy over the middle class. For this, Ann Romney blamed the news media.

“People didn’t really get to know Mitt for who he was,” she told Wallace. “It was not just the campaign’s fault. I believe it was the media’s fault as well, that he was not being given a fair shake. . . . I’m happy to blame the media.”

Yet Romney’s strategy had been to keep warmer aspects of his biography, such as his numerous charitable deeds when he volunteered as a church bishop, out of public view. He and his family repeatedly declined interview requests on the subject. Only in the final weeks of the campaign did he talk about this part of his life, but by then it was too late.

Perhaps more than any other factor, Romney’s own words — his commentary to donors dismissing the “47 percent” of Americans who back Obama and feel entitled to government handouts — helped a negative narrative take hold.

“It was a very unfortunate statement that I made,” Romney told Wallace. “It’s not what I meant. I didn’t express myself as I wished I would have. It was very harmful. What I said is not what I believe.”

Asked to look back and rate himself as a presidential candidate, Romney said, “I see my mistakes and I see my flaws.”

“I did better this time than I did the time before,” he continued, referencing his failed 2008 run. “And I won’t get a third chance.”

The Democratic primary is scheduled for September 10th.

Weiner also admitted that he had probably misled the public about when his extramarital affairs ended.

""Should I have said it happened on a particular date? Maybe you're right, maybe I should have,"" he said. He told Guthrie it was ""fair"" to say that, by not admitting from the get-go that the behavior continued after he resigned from Congress, he allowed a misperception.

Since he was elected, Governor Rick Scott has sought to make it increasingly more difficult for citizens to vote. First, he made registering voters prohibitively complicated.3 Then, he purged hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls, many of which were legally eligible to vote.4 And his final act to suppress the vote was to shorten early voting hours, including canceling the Sunday before Election Day, which historically, is a day that many African American churches take their members to the polls.5

The result was long lines on Election Day, discouraging many Floridians from voting. And it certainly hasn’t gone unnoticed that Rick Scott’s actions have targeted Hispanics, African Americans, seniors and young people — all of which tend to lean Democratic.

The right to vote in this country is fundamental to our Democracy. It is fundamental to what this country is founded on and since the inception of this country, we have consistently worked to extend that right to all Americans. That is, until now.

When President Obama gave his second inaugural address, he said, “Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.”6 We couldn’t agree more.

Because they use the national voter registration form which states must accept, Kobach is working on a unique loophole: file that form, and you can only vote for Senate/House races, you must file a separate form if you want to vote for Governor, State Assembly, your city offices, etc.



Rep. Jim Ward, D-Wichita, an opponent of the proof-of-citizenship law, said he received confirmation from the Department of Legislative Research this week that Kobach is moving forward with the plan to limit voters who follow federal registration rules to voting only in federal elections.



Separately, a memo to all the state’s county election officials outlines procedures for identifying and tracking voters who use the federal form and creating a separate category for them in voting databases.

“This means you should take note when a federal form comes to your office and keep a list of the names of individuals who submit them … Whichever form a person uses, if an applicant does not submit a U.S. citizenship document, you must follow up and request one.” Voters who fill out the state form and don’t submit the citizenship proof have their voting privileges suspended until they do. At present about 17,500 voters are “in suspense.” Kobach, Bryant’s boss, confirmed he’s planning for elections with different ballots for different voters, depending on whether they register under federal or state rules. He said it’s “merely a contingency plan” in case he loses a lawsuit seeking to make federal officials adopt Kansas rules for voters in Kansas.

Kobach’s legal analysis of the decision is that it applies to federal elections only. “The federal government doesn’t have the authority to tell Kansas what to do in Kansas elections,” he said. That, too, will probably have to be decided by a court.

But maybe that isn't enough. Maybe voter confusion and multiple sets of ballots might also help defeat your opponents.Kobach kicks off with a great response of why this is all a good idea:See here! You can't tell us what to do! We set our own rules, we can shut out voters however we please!

The ACLU has countered if Kobach continues on this path they will begin a lawsuit in November.

For Kansans, this is just one more reason to try and make real change in this state...

Update: Thank You For making this hit the top of the Rec list. I wish this was a happier issue, but I'm glad that it gains attention. Kris Kobach has written a lot of legislation, from Arizona's immigration bill and now Kansas and soon Arizona's voting acts, which will be mirrors of each other. There has to be a real effort to change some outcomes in Kansas.. if not, Kansas will be the shining light for those who wish to oppress and deny the vote. I'd prefer my state not be the beacon that showed the way to taint elections and curtail the rights of so many."

Upstate voters have biggest changes in attitude

In December%2C 57%25 of voters outside the NYC area had favorable opinion of him

In April%2C that number was down to 42%25 of Upstate voters

ALBANY, N.Y. — Support for the re-election of New York's governor has eroded in the past four months, a Siena College poll found.

The poll released Monday found that 52% of voters outside the New York City metro area ""prefer someone else"" to the Democratic governor in 2014 when he will seek re-election; 42% selected him. Cuomo has faced backlash over a gun-control law enacted in January, mainly from upstate voters.

The drop is precipitous. Cuomo's re-election support in December among upstate voters was 57% in favor vs. 34% unfavorable. It was 47% for ""someone else"" to 45% for Cuomo last month, said Steven Greenberg, a Siena College pollster.

Greenberg said the results are indicative of Cuomo's falling popularity although the numbers have been most striking upstate.

""Four small drops in a row suddenly becomes a significant drop. And that's what we've seen with the governor on his favorable-unfavorable, his job performance and his re-elect,"" Greenberg said. ""All three of those measures have come down month by month by month.""

Cuomo had a 62% to 33% favorability rating statewide, the poll found, down from 72% to 21% in December. The poll was conducted April 14 to 18 among 811 voters registered in New York state. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.

His numbers are strongest in New York City, dominated by Democratic voters. Voters in the city said they would support Cuomo's re-election 65% to 29%, compared with 53% to 40% in the downstate suburbs.

Gun-rights groups have had three protests at the Capitol in opposition to the law, and some police organizations have questioned it.

""I think there's no question that the gun issue eroded considerable support that the governor previously enjoyed among Republicans and among upstate voters,"" Greenberg said.

No Republican candidates have come forward to challenge Cuomo, who was elected in 2010.

Cuomo would be a formidable foe: He had more than $22 million in his campaign coffers as of January, and New York has twice as many enrolled Democrats as Republicans.

Cuomo has praised lawmakers for supporting the gun-control law enacted Jan. 15. He has criticized Congress for failing to reach a deal on federal gun-control legislation."

Word of Ms. Cheney’s announcement went out just minutes after Mr. Enzi, in a barely veiled message to Ms. Cheney, issued his own statement that he would seek a fourth term. “I intend to run for re-election for Wyoming’s Senate seat in 2014,” Mr. Enzi said. “When I announce formally, I will let everyone know that date in the future. In the meantime, I will do the job I was already elected to do. My trips to Wyoming almost weekly, the public listening sessions, the groups I meet with and speak to, working behind the scenes — this is what I have been doing since I was elected, and this is what needs to be done.”

Talking to reporters in the Capitol after the video went public, Mr. Enzi said he was not notified by either Ms. Cheney or her father — whom he has known for over 30 years — about Ms. Cheney’s intentions.

“I thought we were friends,” he added.

Mr. Enzi said in an interview this month that he was planning on running again but that he wanted to delay any declaration until closer to the election. Yet he also revealed at the time that Ms. Cheney had called him to say she was considering challenging him.

Her ambitions had been rumored since she moved from suburban Washington to the Jackson Hole, Wyo., area last fall and immediately became a regular at state political and civic events.

Obama pays tribute to the 2012 NBA champs

Wade%2C James and Battier played a pickup game with Obama in 2010

LeBron relished the moment%2C saying%2C %22Hey%2C mama%2C I made it%21%22

WASHINGTON — President Obama welcomed LeBron James and the reigning NBA champs to the White House on Monday to celebrate their 2012 title.

In the long-running White House tradition, Obama has honored professional and college champs with White House ceremonies. But the president's bond with James and some of the other Heat players goes back a few years.

James and teammates Dwyane Wade and Shane Battier were among the NBA stars who came to play with Obama in Washington to mark the president's 49th birthday in 2010. The president, tongue-firmly-in-cheek, suggested that he might have helped them get over the hump and win a title.

""I'm not trying to take all the credit, coach, but I think that it's clear going up against me prepared them,"" joked Obama, who roots for his hometown Chicago Bulls.

Obama's admiration for James goes back to at least the NBA star's rookie year.

""I'm LeBron, baby. I can play on this level. I got game,"" Obama told biographer David Mendell in 2004, after his well-received keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.

At the time, James had just completed an impressive rookie season with his former team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Obama was emerging as the next great hope for his party.

It took Obama four more years to climb to the top and make it to the White House. James needed eight years and had to take his talents to South Beach to win his first championship.

James is also a big Obama fan.

James donated $20,000 to the Democratic National Committee and the White House Victory Fund in 2008 that benefited Obama.

Other Heat players have also been generous supporters of the president:

Battier has given $5,300 to Obama's Senate and presidential campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Rashard Lewis donated $10,000 to the Obama Victory Fund in 2008, a joint fund-raising committee that supported both the president's campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

Former Heat star and current front office executive Alonzo Mourning has given nearly $130,000 to Democratic campaigns over the years, including a total of $10,000 in the last election cycle to the Obama campaign and the Obama Victory Fund.

After coach Erik Spoelstra offered brief comments thanking Obama, James asked the president if he minded if he spoke.

""You can if you want,"" Obama said. ""It's your world, man.""

James appeared to relish the moment.

""We're in the White House right now,"" James said with a measure of astonishment. ""Hey, mama, I made it!"""

“Nobody was shocked more than me,” winner Dave Wilson told a local TV station after defeating a 24-year incumbent for a seat on the Houston Community College Board of Trustees.

Incumbent Bruce Austin is crying foul and says he wants a recount, after losing by 26 votes. But the reasons for his defeat appear to go beyond political hardball. The board -- whose members have been notorious for using their influence to steer government contracts to friends and family -- has shown signs of returning to its old ways.

And, Wilson says, he snatched away the election in part because Austin expected to win without campaigning.

But the electrician-turned-politician also used campaign flyers with images of black people that he says he found on the Internet and touted an endorsement from his Midwestern cousin Ron Wilson -- who happens to have the same name as a former black state representative from the Houston area. (Wilson made the distinction clear in the fine print of his campaign flyers.)

Wilson’s campaign website includes several photos of black people and his own biography -- which notes him having a son who served in Afghanistan, but does not appear to include a picture of Wilson.

Wilson also aired a radio ad featuring two ""neighborhood"" women discussing Wilson's political merits.

“That Bruce Austin voted against $6 million in scholarships or our children right here in our neighborhood,” one woman says. “Girl, please, I bet he has relatives that could have used some of that scholarship money he voted against. I’ve had about enough of him ... Dave Wilson is the man who is fighting for our neighborhoods.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/06/hillary-rock-star,2013-11-06 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],"Hillary, Rock Star","Democrat politicians, positioning themselves to share in the spoils, are heaping endorsements on Hillary Clinton to run for President in 2016. Topping the list of lawmakers exalting the former First Lady and former Secretary of State are Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).

Clinton has not openly declared she is running in 2016. Yet, according to political strategist Tad Devine who helped Al Gore and John Kerry in their presidential bids, “She’s the prohibitive front-runner. She’s in a stronger position than anyone seeking the nomination other than an incumbent president in the last 40 years.” Clinton’s front runner status provides “a powerful inducement for figures to offer her early support,” he further commented.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, hoping to regain her leadership as Speaker of the House, also shares her support for the former First Lady. Pelosi recently stated, “If she were to run, I think that she would be the candidate, and I think she’d be one of the best prepared — and she would win.”

Besides Pelosi, Reid, and Schumer clamoring to jump on the Clinton band wagon, other less influential democratic legislators are trying to clutch onto the Clinton coattails. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), is willing to forget that she suggested in 2008 former President Bill Clinton may not be a good role model and that she wouldn’t let her daughter near him. Respecting the power of the Clintons, she now boasts, “I was one of the first to do the Ready for Hillary rollout. I’ve been publicly way out there for a while.”

Needless to say, there is good reason to be lending your support to Ms. Clinton. She and husband Bill prove to be exhaustive fundraisers and help draw potential voters to the polls, including female and minority voters. All of this means positive election outcomes and greater chances for Dems to win in their individual races. Moreover, an early coronation for Hillary will avoid unnecessary in-house battles that are often damaging in presidential primaries."

Allen and VandeHai, whose day jobs are to undercut the GOP and its candidates, feign concern that the party isn’t doing enough to appeal to voters who don’t support the party. A more interesting story for the democrats-with-by-lines is the precipitous drop in support for Obama on every major issue.

According to Gallup, just 35% of Americans support Obama’s handling of the economy. In early June, before Obama embarked on an extensive tour of speeches about the economy, 42% approved of his efforts. In other words, the more he talked about the economy, the less Americans approved of how he was handling it.

It isn’t just the economy, though. Americans don’t support how Obama is handling virtually every issue. Only 26% support Obama’s handling of the federal deficit. Taxes? 36% approve. Foreign Affairs? 40%. Immigration? 39%. Health Care? 39%. Only on fighting terrorism (50%) and race relations (51%) does Obama win the backing of a majority, just, of Americans.

Obama basically has the backing of the Democrat base and no one else. With Republicans holding the House, 30 Governorships and more state legislative districts and statewide offices than almost any time in history, and likely to make gains in the Senate next year, it seems it is the Democrats who are on Allen and VandeHai’s “eve of destruction.”

To stitch together their partisan theory, Allen and VandeHei point to perceived problems the GOP has with African-Americans, Hispanics and gays. None of these demographic groups ever formed any meaningful part of a winning coalition for the GOP. No political party should actively try to alienate a block of voters, but the GOP’s path to future victory isn’t paved with pandering appeals to these groups either.

Politico’s editorial is largely built around the presumed need for the GOP to pass some kind of amnesty legislation to appeal to Hispanic voters. While it is certainly true that the nation needs to reform its broken immigration system, reform comes in many varieties. A recent poll found that 60% of Hispanics want the border secured before amnesty is granted, a position in line with a majority of the GOP caucus in the House. Allen and VandeHai make the mistake of accepting the conventional wisdom in DC that “immigration reform” means accepting the Senate “Gang of 8” bill. In the alternative universe that is reality, the issue is far more complex.

Even if the House GOP were to reverse course and embrace amnesty, it isn’t at clear they would benefit at the ballot box. George H. W. Bush was part of an Administration that actually granted amnesty to illegal immigrants, and he received the lowest percentage of support from Hispanics than almost any time previously. If Mitt Romney had magically received 70% of the Hispanic vote last year, he still would have lost to President Obama. There just aren’t enough voters in any of the demographics Politico focuses on to make that much of a difference for the GOP.

Mitt Romney largely lost the election last year because millions of conservatives and working-class whites failed to show up at the polls. In the last two cycles, the party nominated the moderate, centrist candidates the media barks the GOP needs and large swathes of the party’s base stayed home. The GOP would be better served “auditing” its outreach and messaging to these groups than fine-tune its messaging to groups preternaturally wired to vote against the party.

In modern political history, the GOP has won when it has embraced its conservative principles and articulated a message of freedom and enterprise. Freedom is the most inclusive message in politics. As the late Andrew Breitbart used to say, “If we can’t sell Freedom, we suck.”

Allen and VandeHei would rather the GOP adopt the Democrat playbook and make explicit appeals based on identity politics. An healthy dash of racial politics with a pinch of feminist rhetoric. It is a recipe for disaster for the GOP. Which is, of course, why Politico is pushing it.

If Republicans choose to take advice from hacks like Allen and VandeHai, then they deserve the failures they will surely reap."

Michael Wilson in the picture above, with myself and Anthony, served on the Vallejo City council and ran for California Assembly in 2010.



Michael Wilson is a sitting member of the Vallejo City Council and a candidate for the State Assembly in the 7th District. Michael is a strong progressive Democrat who has a fair-minded business background – making him well suited to deal with the financial insolvency within Vallejo and the State’s fiscal crisis. His primary political engagement for the past several years has also been a personal fight. He and his husband Peter have been fighting for same sex marriage rights. In 2008 they had a wedding performed by Senator Patricia Wiggins. The courts upheld their marriage, but because of Prop 8 other gay couples do not have the same right to a wedding certificate. From his website for his 2010 Assembly run: Wilson For Assembly 2010

Congratulations to Katy Miessner, and I'm looking forward to working in her capacity as member of the Vallejo City Council. Katy is a good Democrat and has been a strong voice in Vallejo for human rights and fiscal responsibility. In upcoming diaries I will continue to blog about this election where mostly all Democrats were running.

Amidst the Republicans calling for Obama's resignation, there is a certain obliviousness to the constitutional implications of it. The Twenty-Second Amendment says: ""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once."" Now, this might seem to settle it for Obama, having been ""elected to the office of the President"" twice.

Except, what if he wasn't? Republicans already believe that the 2012 election was stolen in half a dozen states. If that were the case, then it would theoretically be possible for Obama to resign from office on January 19, 2015 -- just shy of the two year mark of his second term -- and concede that he was not really 'elected' to that term, and therefore had really only served one full term, and half of ""a term to which some other person was elected."" In the meantime, Joe Biden would finish out Obama's lame duck term, and Obama would be lauded as the hero of the ongoing economic recovery, and would coast to the presidency in 2016.

Obama could even resign in secret, conveying this resignation to Joe Biden, who would legally become the President, but under his executive authority could allow Obama to continue serving as a figurehead, living in the White House and giving press conferences and such. The Republicans would not know what hit them until the primary filing deadlines. Obama could even skip the early deadlines for Iowa and New Hampshire, assured as he would be of winning the primaries, if the Republican focus on certain other Democratic candidates weakens their political standing or dissuades them from running.

But for any actual RWNJs reading this, you can relax. Barack Obama is too honest, too honorable, and too great a man to try and bend or break the Constitution to hold onto the Presidency."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/28/obama-dc-circuit-nominees_n_3983733.html,2013-10-28 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Reporter'],Senate Inches Closer To Major Battle Over Obama's Judicial Nominees,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate is inching closer to a knock-down, drag-out fight over confirming nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit -- a top priority for President Barack Obama that some Republicans are determined to sink.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) filed a procedural motion on Monday to begin debate on one of Obama's three nominees to the court. Specifically, Reid filed a ""cloture"" motion on D.C. appellate lawyer Patricia Millett, which sets her up for a confirmation vote later this week.

A top Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly predicted ""a big fight"" once the D.C. Circuit nominees hit the floor, but said the ""word is that we and [the White House] are ready to fight hard."" Reid has said that Democrats are focused on getting at least one more judge confirmed to the court, and has hinted at changes to Senate rules if Republicans stage a filibuster.

The court currently has four Democrat-appointed judges and four Republican-appointed judges, with three empty slots and three Obama nominees waiting on the sidelines. Two of the nominees -- Millett and Nina Pillard -- cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee months ago and have been awaiting floor votes. The third nominee, Robert Wilkins, is set for his committee vote on Thursday.

While partisan scuffles over Obama's nominees are nothing new, his picks for the D.C. Circuit are particularly key to his legacy. The court has broad power to review federal regulations and is considered second only to the Supreme Court in terms of its stature. The D.C. Circuit has also been a launching pad for the Supreme Court: four sitting Supreme Court justices once served on it.

Senate Republicans routinely argue that there's no need to fill the vacancies on the court. The court isn't busy enough, some say, to warrant having all 11 of its seats, and thereby should lose those slots waiting to be filled. Others have falsely accused the president of ""court-packing."" Earlier this month, GOP senators repeated those arguments to The Huffington Post.

""We do not need these judges. It's just plain as day,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""They have, by far, the lowest caseload per judge. They take the summers off.""

""It's clear they're trying to pack the D.C. court,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), also a member of the committee. ""It's probably the most important appellate court in the country ... so there's a matter of great concern.""

Both predicted Republicans will use any procedural or tactical means that they can to block the nominees.

""I'm going to fight as hard as I can,"" Sessions said.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) reiterated his party's complaints last week in a FoxNews.com op-ed.

""Republicans should remain united in blocking Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s attempt to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is America's second-most-influential judicial body,"" Cornyn wrote.

But GOP charges of ""court-packing"" are factually incorrect. The term is used to describe an attempt to increase the number of judges on a court with the goal of shifting its political balance, not to fill existing vacancies. One could even make the case that GOP efforts to prevent Obama from filling empty court seats, thereby keeping those courts from having judges appointed by a Democrat, are instances of ""court-unpacking.""

Plenty of other notable voices make the case for filling the court. Patricia M. Wald, a retired judge who served on the court for 20 years, highlighted the court's particularly complex and time-consuming caseload in a Washington Post op-ed. Sid Shapiro, an administrative law expert and Center for Progressive Reform member scholar, said the average number of cases before the court is actually up, from 1,152 cases during the Bush administration to 1,362 under Obama.

Also an advocate of filling the court's empty slots: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. He signed off on an April 5 report by the Judicial Conference of the United States that recommends keeping the court at 11 seats. Sessions, for one, hadn't heard about Roberts' recommendation.

""I want to see that quote. Where'd he say that?"" Sessions asked, jumping out of an elevator he'd just hopped into. When HuffPost cited the April 5 report, Sessions grumbled about Roberts not being a real Republican.

""He's always advocating the court. He wants pay raises for staff,"" he said. ""Otherwise, he's supposed to be conservative."""

""Double-you tee effing eff!"" I replied, because huh? The Virginia House of Delegates, by contrast, has a mere 100 members. And, oh yeah, the actual U.S. House of Representatives has 435 voting members.

These two sentences from the Wikipedia entry on the New Hampshire House of Reps is sufficient to put the fear in you: ""On average, each legislator represents about 3,300 residents. If the same level of representation were present in the U.S. Congress, that body would have approximately 99,000 members, according to current population estimates.""

On top of that, Celock told me that members of this august body receive a mere $100 a year for their participation, which means that the only people who are likely to seek these offices are people who are just beginning their political careers, people who are winding down their political careers, and people who have literally nothing better to do than run for these seats. With a system designed like this, it can't not feature a nutter like Tremblay.

So, anyone who is truly concerned about getting Stella Tremblay out of office would be well served to stop thinking about running a better candidate in ""Rockingham 4,"" and instead concentrate on making New Hampshire's legislative body a lot less bonkers.

Jackson speaks with supporters at the Lynchburg Regional Airport terminal on Tuesday. Jackson was there with Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who is running for governor, and attorney general nominee Mark Obenshain. (Jill Nance/Associated Press)

As midnight approached on the eve of the Republican convention in Virginia, party loyalists were tipping beers and listening to country music at a rollicking fete hosted by Pete Snyder, a front-runner for the nomination for lieutenant governor.

Down the hall at the Marriott in Richmond, a minister also running for Virginia’s second-highest office, E.W. Jackson, was lingering at his own party, where a Bible and a cross were displayed at the entrance. The ballroom was largely empty. If the excitement at Snyder’s gathering suggested momentum, the quiet at Jackson’s spelled a looming return to obscurity.

Twenty-four hours later, after delivering a thunderous speech that seized the convention, Jackson was the Republican nominee and the party’s first black candidate for statewide office since 1988.

Jackson’s improbable rise, one that has astonished Republicans far and wide, is the latest of a number of incarnations, including foster child, Marine, Harvard law school graduate and even Democrat. But the minister who is now GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli II’s running mate has long used his booming voice to endear himself to conservatives.

Still, Jackson’s words — sometimes eloquent, sometimes raw, often impassioned — are causing anxiety for many Republicans as the resurfacing of his past statements about homosexuality and abortion have threatened to disrupt the campaign.

Instead of promoting their new ticket, Republicans have answered for Jackson’s once calling gays “perverted” and “sick” and saying Planned Parenthood has been “far more lethal” to blacks “than the KKK.”

“The Republicans I’m talking to are saying, ‘What the hell are they doing in Virginia?’ ” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “Is this, ‘101 ways to lose an election’? You’re coming out of the gate with comments everyone has to explain. You’re wasting a lot of time and energy batting that back when you should be doing other things to get the guy known.”

Although unknown to many Republicans, Jackson in recent years has built a following among the most activist of Virginia’s conservatives, many of whom were delegates at the convention. But Republicans are now concerned, Steele said, that Jackson will turn off the party’s own voters. “You can’t have a situation where Republicans say, ‘You know what? I can’t have this’ and they stay home or vote for the other guy,” he said.

Raynard Jackson, a Republican political consultant who has known Jackson since the 1990s, said the minister’s voice has long been his most potent tool. That was the case at the convention Saturday, when thousands of delegates roared when he shouted: “Get the government off our backs! Off our property! Off our guns!”

But Raynard Jackson also said the minister has to be “more careful in the articulation” of his message. “The message will resonate if he can control his verbiage,” Raynard Jackson said. “The question is: Will he control his verbiage? He has the ability. But will he?”

Over the years, Jackson, 61, has thrust himself into the most divisive of issues, beginning in Boston, where he was a pastor and radio host during the 1980s and ’90s, and later, in Virginia, where he moved in 1998 because “we thought our values would be mainstream.” During the mid-1990s, Ralph Reed’s Christian Coalition hired him as a liaison to minority communities.

All these years later, Jackson seems uninterested in moderating himself. He paused between whirlwind campaign stops this week to tell reporters that he doesn’t have “anything to rephrase or apologize for.”

“I say the things I say because I’m a Christian, not because I hate anybody, but because I have religious values that matter to me,” he said. “Attacking me because I hold to those principles is attacking every churchgoing person, every family that’s living a traditional family life, everybody who believes that we all deserve the right to live.”

Married for more than 40 years, Jackson and his wife, Theodora, an elementary school teacher, have raised three children. In a 2011 federal financial disclosure statement, the minister, who travels in a gold Cadillac, reported an income of about $40,000, including $15,772 from his church. He listed “no reportable asset worth more than $1,000.”

On the campaign trail, the minister has captivated audiences with colorful stories of growing up as a “juvenile delinquent” in Chester, Pa., where he was born Earl Walker Jackson to parents who were splitting up. After he spent years with a foster family, Jackson has recalled, his father, a welder, took custody of him and pulled him away from street life.

“He took me out of that foster home. He sat me down the following day,” Jackson told an audience at a recent candidates’ forum. “He said, ‘Look, every day with me can be a day of heaven on earth. Or every day, I will tear your behind all to pieces. It depends on what you want.’ ”

After a tour with the Marines, Jackson graduated with honors in 1975 from the University of Massachusetts, where he majored in philosophy. Then he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1978. He spent more than 20 years in Boston, practicing law, pastoring at New Cornerstone Exodus Church, serving as a chaplain to the Boston Fire Department, and hosting radio shows, including one called “Earl Jackson Across America.”

At one point, he was a Democrat, and he was elected to the party’s Massachusetts State Committee, where he distinguished himself with his conservative views. “I thought, ‘Wow, here’s a great potential leader,’ ” said James Roosevelt, who is a grandson of Franklin D. Roosevelt and who was then and is now legal counsel to the state Democratic organization. “Then I learned of his views, and I thought: ‘What’s he doing? This is not a leader of the Democratic Party.’ ”

Jackson became a Republican in the early 1980s, explaining that Democrats’ embrace of the gay rights movement violated his religious beliefs. In 1989, he joined the opposition to a proposal to ban discrimination against gays and lesbians in Massachusetts. “We intend to blow this bill to smithereens,” he told reporters then. “We intend to defeat this legislation and bury it so deep no one will ever find it again.”

On his radio show, he liked to introduce himself as “the personification of the American Dream and liberals’ worst nightmare.” He told listeners that he was broadcasting from the “eye of Hurricane Kennedy . . . the land of the freebie and the home of the gays.”

Jackson’s views on gays prompted David Scondras, then a Boston City Council member, to oppose a resolution a colleague proposed to honor Jackson, then the Fire Department’s chaplain. “It was bad enough to have someone ranting against gay people, but it struck me as too much to have them being paid by the city,” Scondras said.

Jackson voiced opinions on other sensitive issues. He advocated the release of all juvenile offenders’ records and sympathized with white South Boston residents who opposed the integration of public housing. “I don’t like being told by some bureaucrat how I’m going to live my life either,” he told a church filled with cheering white residents.

About that time, Jackson appears to have suffered financial strains, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1993, according to court records. In 1995, court records show, he incurred a federal tax lien for $8,539, which was lifted nine years later.

But Jackson’s life as a conservative activist flourished. The Christian Coalition assigned him to help raise money on behalf of churches torched in arson fires in the South, a role that led to his testifying before Congress. The coalition also tapped Jackson to lead its Samaritan Project, an effort to forge relationships between the organization and black communities. In that role, Jackson hosted a conference of pastors in Baltimore in 1997.

“He did a good job for us,” Reed, the organization’s leader at the time, said in a recent interview. “He had credibility and spoke the language of those conservative African Americans.”

Soon, however, Reed left the Christian Coalition, and the organization became less influential. By the end of 1997, the coalition cut off funding to Jackson’s project.

The next year, Jackson and his wife moved to Chesapeake, where he began identifying himself by the title of bishop. By his own telling, he was returning to his “ancestral home.” His great-grandparents had been slaves in Orange County, and his grandfather had lived in Richmond before migrating to Pennsylvania.

In 1998, the Jacksons paid $242,000 for a house in a Chesapeake subdivision of brick and gabled facades. Leigh Cole, their next-door neighbor for the past seven years, described the couple as pleasant, and she said her daughter once tried to sell Girl Scout cookies to Jackson. The minister declined, she said, explaining that he was watching his weight. But he still made a donation.

In Chesapeake, Jackson founded Exodus Faith Ministries, a nondenominational Christian church, which has had at least three headquarters, including a storefront in a strip mall. At one point, the church became embroiled in a dispute with its landlord and was accused of owing more than $6,000 in rent, according to court records. Jackson has since settled the debt. Today, he holds services in a hotel conference room with a seating capacity of 125.

Although a clear picture of his 15 years in Virginia is still emerging, Jackson appears to have maintained a relatively low profile in Chesapeake, at least for his first decade there. In 2000, he started an annual Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast and impressed guests with his oratorical skills.

William E. “Bill” Ward, Chesapeake’s first black mayor, has attended the breakfasts, and he said Jackson seemed like a “race man, committed to the struggle of African Americans.” Later, Ward said, Jackson’s conservatism became more apparent.

“He began to, I guess, espouse more of the conservative GOP line of thinking,” Ward said. “He seemed . . . not to attack local leaders, but he shied away from the traditional black ministerial groups. He never became very active with them.”

Helena Dobson, president of Chesapeake’s local NAACP chapter, said she has no relationship with Jackson.

In 2008, as Barack Obama campaigned for the presidency, the minister became more politically active, publicly chastising the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama’s former minister who had made racially divisive statements. Over the next couple of years, Jackson distributed news releases with such headlines as “Liberals are the True Racists.” He started a Twitter account, writing at one point: “I love America. I love God. I am black. Obama does not love America & does not love God. His being black is not enough!”

In 2010, a Virginia tea party convention in Richmond invited Jackson to join a roster of speakers that included political consultant Dick Morris and the wife of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

The next year, Jackson ran for the U.S. Senate, raising $135,000, all of which he spent. He finished last in a field of four candidates seeking the Republican nomination, receiving less than 5 percent of the vote.

He then began to campaign for lieutenant governor, raising $140,000, more than a third of which came from Peter Via, a Roanoke financier. When asked about his contributions, Via, reached by phone Thursday, told a reporter, “I have nothing to say” and hung up.

After winning the nomination last weekend, Jackson joined Cuccinelli and state Sen. Mark D. Obenshain (Harrisonburg), the GOP’s nominee for attorney general, on a three-day tour of the state. The frenetic pace seemed to catch up with Jackson, who was coughing and asking for water Tuesday as he stood under a sweltering sun in Winchester.

The small crowd lavished cheers on him, a greeting that dwarfed the reception given to Cuccinelli and Obenshain. “Now, this is a learning curve for me,” Jackson acknowledged.

The next afternoon, five days after vaulting to the center of Virginia’s political stage, he returned home. Answering the door bell late in the afternoon, Jackson told a reporter he was not answering any questions.

Updated at 4:20 p.m. ET on 8/15



Boston (CNN) - New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie planted himself firmly in the Republican Party’s establishment wing Thursday with a pugnacious speech calling on his party to focus on pragmatism rather than ideology and crippling internal debates.

""We are not a debating society,” Christie told a lunchtime audience at the Republican National Committees summer meeting in Boston. “We are a political operation that needs to win.""



Some of Christie’s remarks, relayed to a reporter by GOP officials who attended the closed-press event, were interpreted by many here as another jab at Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a potential rival for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.

Christie and Paul tangled earlier this summer after the New Jersey governor criticized Paul’s libertarian-tinged worldview as “esoteric” and “intellectual,” drawing a series of pointed rebukes from Paul and his allies.

“I am in this business to win. I don’t know why you are in it. I am in this to win,” Christie said at the luncheon, his first appearance a meeting of the RNC.

“I think we have some folks who believe that our job is to be college professors,” he said. “Now college professors are fine I guess. Being a college professor, they basically spout out ideas that nobody does anything about. For our ideas to matter we have to win. Because if we don’t win, we don’t govern. And if we don’t govern all we do is shout to the wind. And so I am going to do anything I need to do to win.”

Rand Paul adviser jabs 'content-free' Christie

Christie also appeared to rap Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, another potential White House hopeful who made headlines in January when he implored the GOP to “stop being the stupid party.”

""I'm not going to be one of these people who goes around and calls our party stupid,” Christie said, a startling remark given that Jindal and Christie work hand-in-hand as chairman and vice-chairman of the Republican Governors Association.

“We need to stop navel gazing,"" he added. ""There's nothing wrong with our principles. We need to focus on winning again. There's too much at stake for this to be an academic exercise. We need to win and govern with authority and courage.""

Another Paul takes on Chris Christie

President Obama and Congressional torpor merited barely a mention in his remarks. Christie devoted the much of the speech to his record in New Jersey, highlighting efforts to fix a budget deficit and his noisy fights with teachers unions over pension reform.

“You got two choices as a governor,” he said. “You either sidle up next to them and whisper sweet nothings in their ear or try to hope they don't punch you. Or your second alternative is you punch them first.”

By most accounts, Christie’s remarks were met with enthusiasm by the nearly 200 state GOP chairmen, staffers and party insiders who attend these quarterly meetings to plot election strategy and hunt for business.

“It was really great,” said Indiana committeeman Jim Bopp. “Successful politics is a matter of heeding your principles, implementing them, but also being pragmatic about what you can accomplish and need to win. You can’t govern if can’t win.”

Cindy Costa, a national committeewoman from South Carolina, called the speech “amazing.”

“It was impressive. I forgot about the Obama bear hug,” said Tennessee GOP Chairman Chris Devaney, referring to Christie’s tour of the New Jersey coastline with President Obama just days before last year’s presidential election, a moment of bipartisan harmony that rankled GOP activists and top members of Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.

Though he earned rave reviews from a range of party leaders, a handful of RNC members, including several Paul supporters, left unimpressed. One conservative on the committee who declined to be identified called Christie “a pompous ass.”

Others expressed admiration for Christie but wondered whether his brash northeastern brand could appeal in other regions of the country.

If Christie does seek the presidency, he would face the prospect of courting voters in Iowa and South Carolina, where Republican primary contests tend to favor candidates from the conservative wing of the party.

“He wouldn’t play too well where I’m from because we’re a little bit too conservative,” said Alabama GOP Chairman Bill Armistead. “He is probably a bit more liberal socially than some folks. That would cause some problems in Alabama. But everybody loves that he tells it like it is and doesn’t flinch at the opposition.”

Christie, who is carefully balancing his re-election campaign in New Jersey this fall with efforts to build a national profile ahead of a possible presidential bid, held a handful of private meetings with some party leaders at the Westin Boston Waterfront hotel, including one with fundraiser Spencer Zwick, the national finance chairman of Romney’s 2012 campaign.

Christie avoided reporters during his day-long visit and made his way into the hotel ballroom where he gave his speech through a back entrance, rather than face a pack of nearly two dozen reporters waiting for him at the bottom of an escalator adjacent to the meeting.

Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the RNC, declined to say whether the request to keep cameras out of the speech came from Christie high command.

“The event has always been closed press,” he said.

But when Spicer agreed to allow a single photographer into the speech to capture a still image of Christie, several reporters protested, prompting a heated argument between about the meaning of “closed press"" with some prominent members of the Boston media.

Democrats couldn't win without 'em!

The most damning conclusions lay in the survey’s examination of how people view the two major parties in terms of broad attributes. For Democrats, young voters chose “tolerant,” “diverse” and “open-minded,” while for Republicans they often chose “rich” and “religious.” In focus groups in January, the report said, young voters were asked to list leaders of the Democratic Party. “They named prominent former or currently elected officials: Pelosi, the Clintons, Obama, Kennedy, Gore. When those same respondents were asked to name Republican leaders, they focused heavily on media personalities and commentators: Bill O’Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck.” So it’s not terribly surprising that when they were asked what words came to mind when they heard ""Republican Party,"" the results ""were brutal — closed-minded, racist, rigid, old-fashioned.""

18-24: Obama 60, Romney 36

25-29: Obama 60, Romney 38

30-39: Obama 55, Romney 42

40-49: Obama 48, Romney 50

50-64: Obama 47, Romney 52

65+: Obama 44, Romney 56

Republicans decided to figure out why young voters were avoiding their party like MySpace:Per the exit polls:The circle of life and all, this is horrible news for the GOP. Their strongest supporters are the most likely to not be around the next cycle. Meanwhile, those young voters aren't just young, but also heavily brown. The median age of a native-born Latino is 18. As of last month, Latinos students outnumber their white counterparts in Texas schools. In 10 years, that'll be true for everyone in the state.

So when these youngsters talk about ""racist"" and ""rigid"" and ""closed-minded"" Republicans, they do so not just as an observation, but from personal experience. And with the GOP so closely branded with the buffoonery of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Bill O'Reilly, there is little chance the party can reverse that perception; Republicans aren't about to start distancing themselves from their right-wing media overlords.

Limbaugh and O'Reilly like to brag about their power, and it's true. They've been clearly instrumental in costing Republicans the millennial vote for a generation, if not forever."

Of the state’s three House seats, a Democrat has a fighting chance only in the district encompassing Omaha and its suburbs. And the party’s sole hope there, Omaha’s popular City Council president, had declared that he was not going to run.

But suddenly, the Council president, Pete Festersen, has jumped into the 2014 race against an eight-term incumbent Republican. And a Lincoln lawyer, Dennis Crawford, declared his candidacy in a second Nebraska district where the Republican incumbent also had been unopposed. Both say their moves are fueled by popular anger over the 16-day Republican-led shutdown of the federal government.

“If I ever see Ted Cruz, all I’m going to say is ‘Thank you, thank you,’ ” Vince Powers, Nebraska’s Democratic Party chairman, said in an interview. “I would’ve been in witness protection, because I didn’t have anybody to run.”

Here and nationally, the Democratic Party is enjoying something of a boomlet in newly declared candidacies for the House. Since Oct. 1, five candidates have lined up to contest Republican-held seats, with at least four more in the wings, Democratic officials say. Almost all say they are driven to run — ostensibly, at least — by disgust over the shutdown, first espoused by Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, and embraced by Tea Party Republicans in the House and, eventually, most others as well."

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to the city to open the party's African-American Engagement Office. But if anything, the launch event put into stark relief just how much work the GOP has to do, when a largely white audience turned out to hear the senator speak.

Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus has said that attracting more minorities to the GOP is crucial for the party's future. He visited Michigan last month, hired radio personality Wayne Bradley to head the African-American Engagement effort in the state and launched the Michigan Black Advisory Council.

In the 2012 election, President Barack Obama earned the support of 90 percent of the black voters who turned out at the polls.

Paul initially spoke at the new African-American Engagement Office on Livernois Avenue in Detroit for about four minutes on Friday. According to the progressive site Eclectablog, ""The seats in the tiny space were filled with well-dressed supporters, most of whom were African-American.""

“Today’s opening of this office is the beginning of a new Republican Party,” Paul said. “This is going to be a Republican Party that is in big cities and small cities, in the countryside, in the city. It’s going to be about bringing a message that is popular no matter where you’re from, whether you're rich or poor, whether you’re black, white or brown.”

Paul then went to a larger grassroots event at the Grace Bible Chapel, where there were protesters from the civil rights group National Action Network outside. The online invitation said the event was intended to ""celebrate the opening of our African-American Engagement Office in Detroit.""

Tracking footage from the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, however, shows an overwhelmingly white audience ended up turning out:

Detroit is approximately 83 percent African-American.

Paul also spoke Friday at the Detroit Economic Club, where he proposed a plan to revitalize U.S. cities through the creation of ""economic freedom zones,"" which would cut federal taxes in communities that have an unemployment rate of 12 percent or higher.

The Michigan Democratic Party rejected Paul's advice for Detroit.

""Sen. Paul was a vocal opponent of the auto rescue, which saved over a million jobs, and led the Republican effort to shut down the government, costing Michigan's economy hundreds of millions,"" said party spokesman Joshua Pugh. ""His special interest tax handout plan is nothing new. Here in Michigan, Rick Snyder gave $1.8 billion to wealthy special interests, and paid for it with billions in devastating cuts to our local communities and public schools. It's time for our elected leaders to stop the tax giveaways, invest in communities and improve education.""

Paul has been trying to do more minority outreach in recent months. In April, Paul spoke at the historically black Howard University, becoming the first Republican elected official to speak on campus in years.

Still, he continues to generate skepticism, in part due to his criticism of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 2010, he said, ""I think it’s a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant, but, at the same time, I do believe in private ownership.""

On Sunday, Paul said he opposed extending long-term unemployment benefits, because doing so would be a ""disservice"" to workers. African-Americans have consistently had a significantly higher unemployment rate than whites.

Neither Paul nor the Michigan GOP returned a request for comment.

Carr will compete against incumbent Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) in the party’s August 2014 primary. Bristol had promised his listeners on Monday that someone would make a “major announcement” that will “alter the Tennessee political landscape,” and at 7:10 in the morning Joe Carr delivered on that promise.

“I am announcing as a candidate for the United State Senate,” Carr told Bristol.

Carr left no doubt with whom he will stand in the Senate. “Conservatives deserve a clear voice in this election, and conservative champions like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul need a strong ally from Tennessee in the US Senate.” Carr told Bristol.

In a statement released by the campaign as he announced on Bristol’s program, Carr said, “I will advance the conservative movement in Washington. I will fight for the Constitution and the first principles that made our country great: personal responsibility, individual liberty, and limited government. I will stand firm in defense of the 2nd amendment and insure that life of the unborn have a strong and vocal advocate.”

Carr blasted incumbent Republican Senator Lamar Alexander’s voting record. “Lamar Alexander has failed to advance the conservative movement and change Washington,” he charged, then hit the 73 year old Alexander on three main issues. “He voted for amnesty for 11 million illegals, supported funding Obamacare and rubber stamped Obama’s appointments to cabinet level positions and the Supreme Court. Voting with President Obama 62% of the time is unacceptable.”

A Triton Poll released on Sunday in an exclusive Breitbart story showed that Senator Alexander trails a generic “credible conservative” challenger by 5 points, 49% to 44%. Carr’s announcement on Tuesday puts an established name and face to that challenger for the first time. Bristol asked Carr if the results of that poll influenced his decision to challenge Alexander. “It confirmed what we knew. Lamar is popular, but there is a disconnect between the way he votes and what Tennesseans want.”

“If Lamar Alexander is voting with Barack Hussein Obama 62% of the time, he’s voting against Tennesseans 62% of the time,” Carr told Bristol.

As a state representative, where he is the co-founder of the Tenth Amendment Caucus, Carr has gained a reputation as a conservative firebrand. He is expected to join announced candidate Brenda Lenard and potential candidate Kevin Kookogey at an August 31 BEAT LAMAR Forum in Nashville.

Well respected conservative businessman Lee Beaman, who owns several large automobile dealerships in Middle Tennessee, will be Carr’s state campaign chairman. In a statement released by the campaign as Carr announced, Beaman said that “from the beginning, several of us . . . urged Rep. Carr to run for the US Senate. He led the fight to curb illegal immigration, abolish the death tax and protect the 2nd amendment, and we know he’ll lead from the front and change Washington.”

Before announcing for the Senate, Carr withdrew from the Fourth Congressional District race. With Carr’s departure from that race, incumbent Republican Congressman Scott Desjarlais, first elected in 2010 but beset by personal issues and weak fundraising, now faces only one major challenger, State Senator Jim Tracy. Carr currently represents a Rutherford County district in the Tennessee General Assembly.

Carr noted that his move to the Senate race is in response to widespread support for his own challenge to Senator Alexander. “Since I first announced my congressional exploratory committee eight months ago I have received literally hundreds and hundreds of requests from Tennesseans asking me to run for the US Senate instead of the US House. Tennesseans are hungry for strong, principled, conservative leadership, so I am answering the call.”

Carr sounded like a man prepared for a long and tough political battle. “I have no illusions. This is David versus Goliath. But I have extraordinary faith in my fellow Tennesseans. They will see through the spin and the rhetoric and recognize they have a clear choice to elect a conservative fighter. I will work tirelessly, and I will give my all for Tennessee.”

Carr enters the Senate race able to use the $275,000 he has in his Congressional campaign committee. With Beaman and other conservative Tennessee donors backing him, Carr is positioned to raise enough money to mount a serious challenge to the well financed Alexander.

Carr’s in-studio announcement on Bristol’s program was the first time in Tennessee political history that a major politician announced their candidacy for the United States Senate on a talk radio program.

Rep. Carr, a 1981 graduate of Middle Tennessee State University, is a business consultant who helps companies become more energy efficient. Additionally, he and his wife Ginny own and operate Cedar Snag Farms in Lascassas.?He was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 2008 and currently serves as Chairman of the Local Government subcommittee. He is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, a member of the National Federation of Independent Business, Tennessee Right to Life, Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce and the MTSU Blue Raider Athletic Association. He is also an accomplished private pilot and member of the Aircraft Owners & Pilot Association."

(CNN) —

What do you do for an encore after a landslide re-election victory? How about taking your show on the road.

And that’s just what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will do later this month, as he takes over as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, giving an already very visible governor with national aspirations even more visibility.

While the high-profile position should enhance Christie’s status as a leader of the GOP, he’s already coming under attack from some potential 2016 rivals.

Christie wins big

With three-dozen states electing governors in 2014, Christie will be crisscrossing the country, supporting some of the party’s brightest stars. But he’ll also be introducing himself to those who know only the larger-than-life figure on TV.

“I’m going to be traveling all over the country trying to elect Republican governors and that’s a pretty good thing to do for the Republican Party,” Christie said Tuesday in an interview with CNN anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper.

The states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar – Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida and Nevada – are among those holding elections next year. That itinerary works out well for someone who’s got an eye on the White House.

“The chairmanship of the RGA allows a governor to run for president before he actually runs for president, building relationships with organizers in key states and expanding his network of national contributors,” said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and veteran of numerous GOP campaigns. “It can also warehouse staff that can later move over to a presidential campaign. He can also use the RGA to collect chits by helping fellow GOP governors whom he hopes will eventually help him. It is a great platform for a Republican governor who is being urged to consider a presidential bid.”

But Christie could face intraparty sniping that he’s using the position to further his chances of winning the party’s presidential nomination. Then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who chaired the committee in 2006, ahead of his first run for the White House in 2008, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who chaired the RGA ahead of his 2012 bid for president, also got such quiet criticism.

Already under attack

Christie is touting his conservative credentials.

“I’m a conservative,” he said in his interview with Tapper, anchor of CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” adding “I’ve governed as a conservative in this state.”

But a couple of high-profile Republicans are already trying to define Christie as not being conservative enough. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a favorite of tea party activists and a likely rival in 2016 should Christie decide to run, seemed to be trying to tag Christie with the m-word.

“I think the Republican Party is a big party, and we need moderates like Chris Christie who can win in New Jersey,” Paul told Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday on “The Situation Room.”

“What that means about the national party, I’m not sure there’s an answer. But we do need moderates like Chris Christie in the party.”

Paul also took a not-so-subtle jab Wednesday at Christie for starring in ads aimed at promoting tourism in New Jersey in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. In a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing to review the federal response to last year’s deadly storm, Paul questioned Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan about whether Sandy relief funds should be spent on television ads.

Paul said that “people running for office put their mug all over these ads while they are in the middle of a campaign. In New Jersey, $25 million was spent on ads that included somebody running for political office.”

“You think there might be a conflict of interest there? You know that’s a real problem. That’s why when people who are trying to do good and trying to use taxpayer dollars wisely they are offended to see our money spent on political ads. You know that’s just offensive.”

And Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another possible GOP candidate, seemed to suggest that the impact of Christie’s landslide victory may be contained within the Garden State’s borders.

“Governor Christie has certainly shown he has a way of winning in New Jersey, in states like New Jersey … so I congratulate him on that,” Rubio said in an interview with CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash.

Rubio: Don’t jump to conclusions about Christie’s win

Will Cain, a Republican analyst and CNN contributor, said he doesn’t buy in to the idea that Christie is a moderate.

“Look, everyone is invested in defining Chris Christie as a moderate. Liberals want to ascribe his victory to a repudiation of conservatism. And his political rivals want to beat him in a primary. But I don’t know that I can accept the premise,” Cain said. “His greatest conservative sin is participating in Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. On everything else – guns, immigration – he’s given lip service to moderation, not governed that way.

An establishment Republican strategist said that infighting and sniping won’t help the party with those it’s trying to appeal to.

“The best thing that anyone who has their eye on 2016 can do for themselves and the party right now is to work together, show the American people that Republicans can govern responsibly and work to make inroads with sections of the electorate that didn’t support Republicans in the last two presidential elections,” Brian Walsh, former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director, told CNN.

Ready to run?

Christie’s everywhere in the wake of his landslide re-election. The longtime Bruce Springsteen fan’s on the cover of Time Magazine, with the headline “Born to Run” on the story, and he’s scheduled to do four of the five Sunday talk shows this weekend.

Asked Wednesday by CNN’s Debrorah Feyerick if all the talk about his potential bid for the White House is becoming a distraction, Christie pushed back, saying, “I don’t get distracted very easily. It takes a lot to distract me, and I think the way it won’t be a distraction is I simply won’t let it.”

Christie’s re-election speech Tuesday night sounded like something more – the governor touted his bipartisan successes to an audience far beyond the Asbury Park ballroom and the borders of the Garden State.

“I know tonight a dispirited America, angry with their dysfunctional government in Washington, looks to New Jersey to say, ‘Is what I think happening really happening? Are people really coming together? Are we really working, African-Americans and Hispanics, suburbanites and city dwellers, farmers and teachers? Are we really all working together?’ Let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight: Under this government our first job is to get the job done, and as long as I’m governor that job will always, always be finished,” said Christie, to loud applause.

What Christie’s win says about 2016

Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and current co-host of CNN’s “Crossfire,” knows some things about running for the White House.

“I think it was an introductory speech,” the one-time 2012 GOP frontrunner said.

Castellanos added, It wasn’t an acceptance speech, that was an announcement speech.”

Numbers to brag about

Christie’s victory was never in doubt. And as the polls in the Garden State closed Tuesday night, CNN and the other news networks rushed to project that the high-profile governor would win a second term in Trenton.

But the big questions heading into Election Day 2013 were how large a victory Christie would capture over Barbara Buono, his little-known Democratic challenger, and how Christie would perform with voters who tend to cast ballots for Democrats.

With just about all the ballots counted, Christie won 60% of the vote, the most by a Republican statewide in more than a quarter-century

And according to CNN exit polls, Christie performed well with groups that the GOP needs to win if it wants to win national elections.

Christie carried nearly six in 10 women and won all age groups other than those 18-29, which he just missed winning. Christie also won the Latino vote and took just more than a fifth of the African-American vote, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections.

Christie also grabbed two-thirds of independents and a third of Democrats in a state where Democrats and independents made up nearly three-quarters of Tuesday’s electorate.

Christie, McAuliffe took different paths to victory

The exit polls appear to bolster Christie’s case that he’s among the most electable of the potential GOP White House hopefuls heading into 2016.

But if he runs for president, Christie will have to get through a battleground of conservative voters in the Republican primaries and caucuses similar to those he faced in blue-state New Jersey this year.

Jim DeMint (R-S.C.).

The endorsement of Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin escalates the effort by outside conservative groups to back primary challenges next year against those congressional lawmakers who finally voted for the bipartisan budget deal. On Thursday, the Senate Conservatives Fund, the Club for Growth and the Madison Project all endorsed Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, a primary challenger to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.). The Madison Project had already endorsed Bevin.

McConnell himself helped craft the budget deal that left Obamacare virtually unscathed. The Senate Conservatives Fund also hammered him over a provision in the legislation boosting funding for the Olmsted Locks and Dam in Kentucky from $775 million to $2.9 billion.

""Matt Bevin is a true conservative who will fight to stop the massive spending, bailouts, and debt that are destroying our country,"" said Senate Conservatives Fund Director Matt Hoskins in a statement. ""He is not afraid to stand up to the establishment and he will do what it takes to stop Obamacare. We know that winning this primary won't be easy. Mitch McConnell has the support of the entire Washington establishment and he will do anything to hold on to power. But if people in Kentucky and all across the country rise up and demand something better, we're confident Matt Bevin can win this race.""

The Senate Conservatives Fund had previously targeted open seats that had been held by Democrats. But since DeMint left the Senate to run the Heritage Foundation at the beginning of 2013, the fund also has set its sights on incumbent Republican senators.

McConnell's campaign dismissed the endorsement.

""Matt Bevin now has the dubious honor of standing with a self-serving D.C. fundraising group that made its name by recruiting and promoting unelectable candidates that ensured Barack Obama a majority in the Senate,"" said McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore. ""They clearly care less about Kentuckians than they do about their reputation for supporting laughably bad candidates.""

A look at Hillary Rodham Clinton in relaxed moments during her tenures as secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady.

Two worlds of Hillary Rodham Clinton intersected this past week. Together they underscored not only why the former secretary of state is seen as perhaps the dominant unelected politician in the country today but also the concerns among some of her Democratic supporters as she considers a return to the political arena in 2016.

As President Obama and Clinton’s successor at State, John F. Kerry — during a dizzying week of diplomacy and threats of military action — grappled with how best to respond to Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons, Clinton was enjoying a fresh round of accolades and honors. The contrast between her recent past life and her current life was striking.

On Tuesday, on a sultry summer evening, she was in Philadelphia, where she received the Liberty Medal during a ceremony at the National Constitution Center. On Friday, she was in Scotland, where she received an honorary degree from St. Andrews University, which was marking its 600th anniversary with all appropriate academic pomp.

Tuesday’s ceremony in Philadelphia concluded an hour before Obama addressed the nation on the Syrian issue. On Friday, Clinton spoke in Scotland as Kerry was in Switzerland negotiating with his Russian counterpart on eliminating Syria’s chemical weapons stocks.

As both a former secretary of state and the prospective favorite for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, Clinton enjoys the freedom to operate in an almost idealized world. She is still in the public eye but mostly not in the line of fire. For now, the hard decisions are someone else’s responsibility.

Circuit of accolades

This fall, Clinton will maintain this circuit, receiving awards from civic and other organizations while delivering paid speeches to private audiences along the way. She is already a draw on the strength of her impressive résumé and her achievements during decades in public service. That she might also become president makes her all the more irresistible to organizations looking for someone to honor.

Clinton may be a year or more from a formal decision about running, but among those who are turning out to hear her, there already is an assumption that she will be a candidate, if not a winning candidate. It is never far below the surface when she appears and is sometimes explicitly stated.

In Philadelphia, Amy Guttman, president of the University of Pennsylvania, told the audience, “A few decades ago, when I was a child, it would have been unthinkable for a woman to be president of the University of Pennsylvania, let alone secretary of state of the United States, and something many of us can’t wait to celebrate — the first woman president of the United States.”

The Philadelphia ceremony included elements that might have been scripted for the 2016 Democratic convention, with a highlight reel of Clinton’s life and video tributes from people such as former British prime minister Tony Blair and tennis star and women’s rights advocate Billie Jean King. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R), who serves as chairman of the National Constitution Center, gave a warm introduction that included teasing references to possible competition with her in 2016.

Across the street from the ceremony and behind barricades came a reminder of Clinton’s past and possible future, as a small but vocal band of demonstrators sought to draw attention to the Obama administration’s handling of the attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, a year ago that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens.

Clinton will deliver policy speeches this fall, but up to now she has made little news with most of her appearances. As the president’s posture was shifting from threats of military strikes to an embrace of diplomacy that on Saturday produced an agreement between the United States and Russia to corral and eventually eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons, Clinton offered Obama her full support, as one would expect.

Ghosts of 2008 campaign

In between Clinton’s two public appearances this past week came unexpected news, which grew out of a long-standing federal investigation into political corruption in the capital city, particularly the activities of Washington businessman Jeffrey E. Thompson.

As first reported in The Washington Post this past week, investigators have been looking into Thompson’s role in financing a shadow campaign set up to aid Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid.

At a moment in early 2008, when Clinton’s campaign was in trouble and in debt, her advisers were approached by Troy White, a New York marketing executive and music promoter, who wanted to set up “street teams” to help build support for Clinton in several states with upcoming primaries. According to court documents and subsequent reporting by Post reporters, the offer was rejected by Guy Cecil, the campaign’s national political director.

Then, through the intercession of Minyon Moore, a senior adviser to Clinton, White’s services were enlisted, not under the Clinton campaign umbrella but for a separate and seemingly secret operation. Thompson, who is under investigation for allegedly financing a secret operation for the D.C. mayoral campaign of Vincent C. Gray (D), reportedly provided $600,000 in financing.

Clinton campaign officials and Moore have been cooperating fully with federal prosecutors, who are believed to be focused on building a case against Thompson, not going after Clinton’s campaign. Moore is a veteran of Democratic politics and campaigns and well regarded in Democratic circles. She is not a target of prosecutors, and her attorneys think that if she made a mistake, it may have been in assuming that all of what White was doing was being handled properly.

Repeat of past mistakes?

All that aside, this window into Clinton’s campaign has again pointed to systemic problems that plagued her first bid for the White House and could do so again if she runs in 2016, unless she structures her operation differently.

What has made some Democrats wince is the portrait that emerges of a Clinton campaign in which decisions did not stick, campaign leaders operated without clear lines of authority and there were endless avenues for end runs, second guessing and freelancing.

“They had a lot of wildcatting going on,” said a veteran of past Democratic presidential campaigns who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. “If that happens in ’16, it doesn’t augur well.”

Clinton is neither in the fray nor fully out, enjoying a kind of best-of-all-worlds existence as she looks toward a time when she must truly decide whether to seek the presidency. Meanwhile, some nagging questions remain that her Democratic allies hope will be addressed as she weighs the bigger decision.

http://news.yahoo.com/abortion-potential-gop-divider-ga-senate-race-160345254.html,,[],Abortion: Potential GOP divider in Ga. Senate race,"ATLANTA (AP) — The four Georgia Republicans who want to succeed retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss all call themselves conservatives who oppose abortion.

Two are congressmen who recently voted in favor of a House bill to outlaw nearly all abortions beyond the 20th week after conception. Another candidate, a former secretary of state with her own national profile in the abortion debate, expressed support for the measure. Meanwhile, Rep. Paul Broun, an obstetrician, voted against it, saying it didn't go far enough. That vote put him alongside abortion-rights advocates yet it garnered a de facto endorsement from a leading anti-abortion group in Georgia.

The divide exposes fault lines in an already divisive primary that some party figures worry could set up a repeat of 2012 losses in Missouri and Indiana, GOP-leaning states where Democrats successfully cast Republican Senate nominees as out of the mainstream based mostly on their views on abortion.

Broun, a conservative who has called President Barack Obama a Marxist and who drew national attention last year when he declared evolutionary theory ""lies from the pit of hell,"" defends his outlier vote — just six Republicans voted against the bill — because the proposal contains exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest.

As he put it: ""I am extremely disappointed that House Republican leadership chose to include language to subject some unborn children to needless pain and suffering.""

While Republicans rule state politics in Georgia, strategists in both parties say Broun pulls the GOP primary field further to the right. That potentially gives Democrats an opening for the 2014 election in a state that Obama lost by single digits in 2008 and 2012 at a time when an influx of minority voters is making Georgia fertile future ground for the president's party.

The GOP can't afford to lose a Georgia seat it already holds as the party tries to gain the six seats necessary to win Senate control for the last two years of the Democratic president's term. No Democrats have officially entered the race, though Atlanta philanthropy executive Michelle Nunn is mulling a bid. Her father, Democrat Sam Nunn, represented Georgia in the U.S. Senate.

Story continues

In the Republican primary, abortion probably won't be the only consideration for most voters. But it could affect the result in a crowded primary field in which the margins likely will be close and a runoff could be needed.

Rep. Jack Kingston, who voted for the 20-week abortion ban, said Broun's vote is an ""irresponsible approach"" for someone who opposes abortion rights. ""The question is whether unborn children are more protected with this law,"" Kingston said. ""As we live in this post Roe v. Wade world, the reality is that we have to play chess, not checkers."" Kingston said he'll always support exceptions on abortion bans in cases of rape, incest and medical necessity to protect the life of a pregnant woman.

Karen Handel, the former secretary of state, said, ""I certainly respect the views of those who didn't support that bill. But that sort of all-or-nothing approach is what's wrong with Washington."" Handel supports rape and incest exceptions, saying: ""For women in those horrible circumstances, that is something for them to work through with their family, their church and their faith counselor.""

An aide to Rep. Phil Gingrey positioned her boss between Broun and the other candidates.

Jen Talaber said Gingrey wasn't pleased with the exceptions, but ""supported the bill because it saves lives."" Gingrey, also an obstetrician, has already walked a fine line on abortion. He publicly defended as ""partly right"" failed Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's claim last year that a woman's body can avoid pregnancy from a ""legitimate rape."" Gingrey later apologized and called his own remarks ""stupid.""

The proposal itself reflects state laws that many Republican legislatures have adopted in recent years, some of them already blocked by federal courts. It won't pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, but it gives Republicans and anti-abortion advocates a key vote to measure candidates.

The National Right to Life Committee strongly supported the House bill and warned House members in a letter beforehand that a no vote would be viewed ""no matter what justification is offered, as a vote to allow unlimited abortion in the sixth month or later.""

Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the group, said Broun followed some bad advice. ""We said this was the single most important pro-life legislation since the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was enacted a full decade ago,"" Johnson said.

But the group's state affiliate, Georgia Right to Life, praised Broun. In a letter posted on the organization's website, President Dan Becker called out Gingrey and Kingston as ""Georgia politicians who say one thing and vote another."" Becker then went on to issue a de facto endorsement, saying ""Let's elect (Broun) our new U.S. senator.""

That prompted pushback from some Republicans.

RedState.com founder Erick Erickson called for the formation of a new state anti-abortion group to replace Georgia Right to Life. ""Instead of saving souls, they'd rather stone those who are trying to save souls,"" Erickson wrote in a June 19 blog posting.

Suzanne Ward, a state Right to Life executive, said the Georgia group doesn't worry about election outcomes. ""It's never wrong to do the right thing,"" she said. ""We don't set our standard on political winds. Our standards are based on the word of God, and that doesn't change.""

It's not the first time Georgia Right to Life has roiled Republican races. The group clashed with Handel during the 2010 governor's race, refusing to endorse her because she supports some exceptions to abortion bans. Handel lost a close Republican runoff but went on to become a champion for some within the anti-abortion movement after a public battle with Planned Parenthood. In the last year, she wrote a book and traveled the country, talking with various Right to Life groups about her time as an executive with the Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the public outcry over the breast cancer charity's decision to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood, whose services for women include abortion.

Ward said her group's endorsement, complete with PAC contributions and organizational muscle, will come later. Asked whether a candidate who supported the House bill could win the nod, she said, ""We would always want to leave the door open for people to become educated and change their positions. We hope and pray people would do that.""

Kingston said he doesn't think the distinctions over abortion exceptions will have a strong effect, at least in the Republican primary. Most social conservatives, he predicted, will save their energies to campaign against a Democrat next year.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.

Abortion could be a dividing issue among Republicans in the 2014 Georgia Senate race.

The declared candidates all describe themselves as conservative abortion opponents. Two of them are congressmen who recently voted in favor of a bill to outlaw nearly all abortions beyond the 20th week after conception. Another candidate, who is a former secretary of state, said she would have voted yes.

But Rep. Paul Broun voted against the ban because, he said, it didn't go far enough. That put him alongside abortion-rights defenders like former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But it also drew praise from a leading anti-abortion group in Georgia.

The divide highlights potential friction as some national Republicans worry that a nominee who is too conservative could make the race competitive in this GOP-leaning state."

Yes, it would be.

It would be the equivalent of a whole Santa’s sleigh full of toys.

For Democrats.

Last week, in the tony Detroit suburb of Birmingham, U.S. Rep. Kerry Bentivolio had an exchange with one of his constituents that was probably not that unusual. It’s the kind of thing that happens all the time in conservative Republican circles when talk turns to Obamacare and the president’s agenda.

Conveniently forgetting that the healthcare law championed by the president was passed by Congress in 2010, that the president trounced his political rival, Mitt Romney, in 2012, and that the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act, angry conservatives believe that but for a bootlicking mainstream press, Obama would be on his way back to an early retirement in Chicago, if not to prison for the terrible “crimes” he has committed against the American people.

The exchange that Bentivolio had with his constituents last week is instructive.

It shows the free-floating angst that’s out there among conservatives who have the sense that they are “losing” their country. But it also shows the delicate line that conservative politicians must walk; telling their constituents what they want to hear while grasping how nutty they’d look if they actually pursued impeachment.

Toward the end of Bentivolio’s 30-minute meeting, which you can see online, a woman asks him something that is more a plea than a question: “I need to know … who is going to stop Obama from everything that he is doing against our Constitution? He needs to be stopped.”

A man’s voice interjects: “Articles of Impeachment!”

The woman continues: “It should have been started a long time ago, and I’m getting very nervous and I need to know who and when is somebody going to finally draw up something that is going to stop this runway train that we have in the White House.”

Presumably, the runaway train she is referring to is the implementation of the president’s Affordable Care Act, though it’s not entirely clear, as Bentivolio’s response also refers to the IRS admission that it flagged groups with political-sounding names that were applying for tax-exempt status.

“If I could write that bill, it would be a dream come true,” Bentivolio said. “I feel your pain. I stood 12 feet away from the guy and listened to him, and I couldn’t stand being there, but because he is president I have to respect the office, that’s my job.”

The congressman, a former car designer and teacher, said he returned to his office and consulted with attorneys and historians: “Tell me how I can impeach the president of the United States.”

His experts were dubious, he said. “What evidence do you have? You’ve got to have the evidence. ... Until we have evidence, you are going to become a laughingstock if you submitted a bill to impeach the president.”

Sunday on “Meet the Press,” Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who did not endear himself to many of his brethren when he told the GOP in January to “stop being the stupid party,” urged Republicans to cool it on impeachment.

“The reality is, one of the great things about this country is we do have a peaceful transfer of power,” said Jindal, chairman of the Republican Governors Assn. “I disagree with this president’s policy. And stop talking about impeachment. Let’s go out there and let’s have a legitimate debate.”

A legitimate debate in this Congress, where Republicans would rather beat their heads against the wall trying to repeal the healthcare law than work on, say, meaningful immigration reform legislation?

That will happen when reindeer fly.

During his remarks on a recent 'autopsy' held by the RNC on its shortcomings in the 2012 presidential campaign, Priebus announced a series of recommendations including fewer presidential debates, an earlier national convention, and community outreach programs in addition to other new initiatives. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)

Less than two months after the Republican National Committee announced a multi-million dollar campaign to improve minority outreach, one of its state Hispanic directors is leaving the Republican Party altogether.

In a letter released by The Florida Nation on Monday, RNC State Director Of Florida Outreach Pablo Pantoja announced that he is changing his political affiliation to the Democratic Party.

""It doesn’t take much to see the culture of intolerance surrounding the Republican Party today,"" he wrote. ""I have wondered before about the seemingly harsh undertones about immigrants and others. Look no further; a well-known organization recently confirms the intolerance of that which seems different or strange to them.""

Back in March, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus announced that the organization was investing $10 million to send hundreds of workers into Hispanic, black and Asian communities to improve standing with voters. Here in May, questions continue to linger whether a line of amendments proposed by Republican voices will derail immigration reform, and subsequently dampen chances for improving relations with minority voters.

Pantoja is not the first Republican in the Sunshine State to recently change their party affiliation. Back in December, former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist moved over from the GOP to the Democratic Party, hailing how he was ""proud and honored"" to make the switch. Democrats eked out a 2012 presidential election win in Florida, with President Barack Obama defeating GOP challenger Mitt Romney by less than 75,000 votes."

Washington (CNN) - Hillary Clinton vs. Chris Christie.

It's an intriguing 2016 presidential showdown.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

And according to a new national poll, Clinton would come out on top in such a hypothetical matchup.

That's one of the findings from a survey released Thursday from Quinnipiac University, which asked American voters about nine possible general election matchups in the next race for the White House.

According to the poll, the former first lady, Democratic senator from New York and secretary of state, leads the Republican New Jersey governor 45%-37%. The survey also indicates Clinton would top Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida 50%-34% and would beat Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House budget committee chairman and last year's GOP vice presidential nominee, 50%-38%.

""Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would start a 2016 presidential campaign with enormous advantages,"" says Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ""She obviously is by far the best known and her more than 20 years in the public spotlight allows her to create a very favorable impression on the American people. But it is worth noting that she had very good poll numbers in 2006 looking toward the 2008 election, before she faced a relative unknown in Barack Obama.""

If Vice President Joe Biden became the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, the poll suggests closer general election contests.

Biden would trail Christie 43%-40% and would top Ryan 45%-42%. The three point margins in both matchups are within the survey's sampling error. According to the poll, the vice president would lead Rubio 45%-38%.

According to the poll, Christie would lead New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo 45%-28%, with Ryan ahead of Cuomo 42%-37% and Cuomo and Rubio deadlocked at 37%.

""Although some Republicans don't think New Jersey Gov. Christopher Christie is conservative enough for their taste, he runs best of the three Republicans tested and would defeat two of the top Democrats,"" adds Brown.

One caveat with such polling is that the next presidential election is still three and a half years away, and surveys this early in a campaign cycle are often heavily influenced by name recognition.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted February 27-March 4, with 1,944 registered voters nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

That's not snark, people. That's legit. We're looking for quality in this one, not quantity, and one could make a pretty compelling argument that Alaska has the most important race on Election Night.

Part of this, admittedly, is a function of geography. Alaska, as the westernmost state in the Union, has the latest poll closing time of all 50 states (midnight ET/9 PM PT, and because some precincts are even further to the west, results typically don't come in for an hour after that).

Which means, even if Democrats don't want to stomach the thought, control of the United States Senate may not be decided until very early in the morning on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2014. In a red state, the final Senate race of the night will feature a Democratic incumbent, Mark Begich, who knocked off incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Stevens by the narrowest of margins in 2008.

This time around, he gets a respectable, if somewhat generic, GOP challenger in state Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. But, in a state where both John McCain and Mitt Romney won handily, ""generic Republican"" might be enough.

State #4: Pennsylvania

One of the more artistic Republican gerrymanders in the nation has robbed us of the usual 3-6 competitive House races in the Keystone State. However, that does not mean that all is well for the GOP next year in Pennsylvania.

For one thing, Pennsylvania may well be home to the least popular Republican governor in the nation. Gov. Tom Corbett, at best, is in a tossup to earn a second term as the state's governor. More likely, he is a narrow underdog, who has to hope for a complete and total circular firing squad in the Democratic primary in order to gain a damaged opponent.

For another, Pennsylvania's GOP is in control of the state legislature (hence, the butt-ugly gerrymander). But that control is tenuous, and this seems to be a real target at the downballot level.

The state isn't completely devoid of interesting U.S. House races, either. While the seat will stay blue, the Democratic primary in PA-13 (where veteran Rep. Allyson Schwartz is among a host of Democrats challenging Corbett) will be highly entertaining. And, in PA-08, Democrat and former CIA analyst Kevin Strouse is showing some early strength, though Mike Fitzpatrick fairly easily dispatched a well-financed Democrat in 2012.

State #3: Colorado

If this were the states to watch in 2013, Colorado may well be #1. Yep, even ahead of New Jersey and Virginia. Those two state Senate recall elections looming this coming week are simply huge, and could have immense ramifications for state legislatures around the nation.

More practically, however, it could have huge implications in Colorado, which is somewhat of a mirror image of Pennsylvania in one key sense. Here, it is the Democrats that control the legislature, and that control is reasonably tenuous. If the Democrats can beat back the recalls of Democrat senators Morse and Giron, they will have a little extra cushion when 2014 rolls around.

That's not all that is on deck in the Rockies. Voters could be getting a serious case of deja vu, as both 2010 GOP contenders (gubernatorial candidate Tom Tancredo and Senate candidate Ken Buck) are back for another round. Lest anyone take either of them lightly because of ... well ... their batshit craziness, bear two stats in mind: Tancredo has been polling even with Hickenlooper (whose approval ratings have been bruised badly this year), and Buck nearly knocked off Michael Bennet in 2010.

Democrats have a real opportunity in 2014 here, as well. Indeed, one of their biggest targets in the U.S. House is suburban Republican Rep. Mike Coffman, who has drawn one of the highest profile Democratic challengers in the country in well-respected former state legislator Andrew Romanoff, the one-time speaker of the House.

State #2: Florida

Florida is still a little bit undefined, but its status as a key 2014 battleground is pretty much beyond doubt. Start at the top: Republican Gov. Rick Scott has long been one of the less-loved incumbents in the nation. Even a generic Democrat would appear to be a real contender, and one of the newest Democrats in the state (former Gov. Charlie Crist) could turn this race into a clash of the Sunshine State titans should he elect to seek a return to elective politics.

Meanwhile, downballot, there are a lot of variables, but come next Fall there could be as many as six races worth watching in Florida. One race has already pretty well defined itself, as it is already certain that sophomore GOP Rep. Steve Southerland will have a top-flight Democrat challenging him in 2014. Democrats are very high on Leon County Schools official Gwen Graham, the daughter of former Florida pol (and institution) Bob Graham. Al Lawson, who took 47 percent off of Southerland last year, may still throw his hat in the ring for round 2. Meanwhile, Bill Young is facing a rematch in the Tampa metro area, after being held to 58 percent last year. He'll be 84 on Election Day 2014, and his retirement has only been rumored for a decade or two.

Democrats, alas, will have a couple of incumbents to defend, as well. While the challengers are still undefined, you can pretty much count on freshmen Patrick Murphy (FL-18) and Joe Garcia (FL-26) to have tight races next year.

State #1: Michigan

Things could change, of course. But right now, it is hard to conceive of another state that will draw more eyeballs on Election Night 2014 than Michigan. Two hugely critical (and high-profile) statewide races, coupled with what may well be several interesting House races, plus what promises to be a huge skirmish over control of the state legislature, highlight what ought to be a fascinating Election Night in the upper Midwest.

Start with the gubernatorial race. Put first-term GOP Gov. Rick Snyder in the same mix as the aforementioned Msrs. Scott and Corbett. Rookie Republican governor, governing like he is the governor of Wyoming, instead of a state carried twice by President Obama. He has already drawn a first-tier challenger in former Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Schauer. Polls have been a little inconsistent here, but even the best polls for Snyder spot him a very modest lead, and well under 50 percent of the vote, to boot.

Meanwhile, there is also an open seat U.S. Senate race that will command a lot of attention. This one is already somewhat defined, as well, though it is certainly off to a funky start. Democrats have coalesced around third-term Rep. Gary Peters. Republicans also got a commitment from a respectable statewide candidate in former Sec. of State Terri Lynn Land. The funky part is that the Republican party seems to be less than enthused about Land, and seem open (if not eager) to see someone else get into the race.

Downballot, a couple of House Republicans deserve some focus. In the northern tier of the state, sophomore Republican Rep. Dan Benishek has already drawn a formidable Democratic challenger in former Kalkaska County Sheriff Jerry Cannon. Benishek won in 2012 by less than one percent. Meanwhile, downstate in MI-11, two questions need to be answered between now and next November: (1) Will freshman Republican Kerry Bentivolio be the Republican nominee (he is being challenged by attorney Dave Trott)?; (2) Will the Democrats have a top-flight candidate in place on the off chance that the ... ahem ... very interesting Bentivolio survives his primary? Finally, the Democrats landed a legit opponent in MI-07 for Rep. Tim Walberg, who usually underperforms in this purply-red district. Democrat Pam Byrnes is looking for a political second act, after a six year stint in the state legislature that ran from 2004-2010.

Last, but certainly not least: Watch the state legislative battles here. Democrats halved the GOP majority in the 2012 elections, and they'll be eager to finish the job in 2014. Plus, they get their first crack at the GOP majority in the state Senate, though at a 26-12 GOP majority, a switch in that chamber would require a pretty herculean effort by the Democrats.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

There were some other states that were in the mix. One could make a decent case for Maine (who doesn't want to see GOP Gov. Paul LePage become unemployed?), or North Carolina (has the GOP lege been so extreme that they can neutralize their own gerrymander?). Others, too. If you feel strongly about a state that didn't crack the top five this time around, by all means: Make your case in the comments."

We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.

What I will do as president is make sure it’s more attractive to come to America again. This is the way we’re going to create jobs in this country. It’s not by trickle-down government saying, we’re going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business to invest and grow in America.

Now, we’re going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations, that they play by the rules, and China hasn’t. One of the reasons — or one of the ways they don’t play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency, because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low. And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales, and manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can’t compete.

China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the president has a regular opportunity to — to label them as a — as a currency manipulator but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.

So we’re going to make sure the people we trade with around the world play by the rules.

But let me — let me not just stop there. Don’t forget: What’s key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish — and — and I’m going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they — they follow the law and play by the rules — but it’s also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. That’s why I want to bring down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canada’s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you’re starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we’re going to create more jobs here.

Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. I’ve talked to small businesses across the country. They say we feel like we’re under attack from our own government. I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business — not crushing it. And there’s no question but that “Obamacare” has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you’re going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules. Thanks.

MS. CROWLEY: Mr. President, two minutes here because we are then going to go to our last question.

PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK. We need to create jobs here. And both Governor Romney and I agree, actually, that we should lower our corporate tax rate. It’s too high."

Something on the order of a thousand bills have been put up assaulting women's rights and women's health. Texas is no exception and the only thing between SB5 being rammed through easily before the clock struck twelve was one brave state senator and a few hundred spectators.

Majority Leader Reid take note: this is old school filibustering. According to rules of the Texas Senate, Davis had to stand for the entire time, could not eat anything, not so much as a sip of water. She could not lean or sit or otherwise use any desk or chair for support, she could not even take a quick bathroom break! Despite these restrictions, Davis stood her ground and spoke passionately, nonstop, through the day, into the evening, and on toward midnight. Real and virtual crowds grew, #SB5 exploded to become a top trending tag on Twitter.

Thanks to the Texas Tribune's live feed and many onsite tweets with expert commentary keeping readers informed minute to minute, it soon became clear we were witnessing a rare event, indeed a very special one, the birth of a new progressive champion on the national stage was unfolding before our eyes. In the deep red Lone Star State of all places! But with midnight on the horizon, the filibuster was suddenly shut down in its tracks. Naturally, by Texas Republicans on dicey technicalities. Hopes were briefly dashed.

When I got home after 11 PM, pessimistic, I found it was not covered live on any cable news station I could find. But online was a completely different story, the excitement was palpable, someone had stood up to the powerful good ole boys who have held sway over Texas for far too long.

That's when the people took over. Democrats on the floor quickly called up parliamentary procedures buying critical minutes, news ripped through the crowds and they starting voicing their disgust. With galleries in the rotunda overflowing, the clock ticking down, the eyes of Texas and the nation upon them and the crowd now roaring, republicans were literally in disarray. They grew desperate, eventually trying to hold a quiet, hasty vote just after the midnight curfew, back-date it on the ledge page, and then adjourn, perhaps smug in the belief they had won. Early Wednesday morning the Texas Tribune reported that that blatant violation will not stand:

The nation watched on Tuesday — and into Wednesday — as Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis and hundreds of impassioned reproductive rights advocates stalled proceedings and ultimately defeated controversial abortion legislation in a storm of screams and shouts as the clock struck midnight. ""I am overwhelmed, honestly,” Davis said after standing for nearly 13 hours to filibuster Senate Bill 5, the abortion legislation. The outpouring of support from protesters at the Capitol and across the nation, she said, “shows the determination and spirit of Texas women and people who care about Texas women.""

Wendy Davis and her dedicated professional staff are no strangers to standing up for the people against long odds, even when they know they might lose, or worse. They are certainly familiar with the consequences that can follow in this day and age. The Davis Fort Worth office was fire-bombed last year. Davis is already being demonized for her stand. The GOP will try again, any way they can, to get SB5 passed. Rick Perry has already announced another special session to ram this odious bill through. We will all try again, we will try to shame them and expose them and use every legal and ethical method to kill the bill. Nevertheless, the battle field is tilted against us, we may lose the skirmish.

But one day we will win the battle. Thanks to lots of people, like Wendy Davis and her staff (A staff I'm told is almost legendary in the commitment and resources they devote to constituent services) the tide may be beginning to turn in Texas faster than we could have dared hope! In fact she's reportedly considering a run in the 2014 Texas governor's race. Even in the event of a close defeat, such a run would badly rattle the GOP and boost progressive morale. It would also field test how organized the growing coalitions of disaffected voters in Texas that would engineer that revolution are becoming. If she were to pull off an upset, the implications for future elections far and wide are devastating for the GOP beginning immediately.

That will be a major lift, we'll need all the help we can get, and I'm not talking about money, not today folks. I'm talking about support. If you want to consider getting more involved at some point, high school kids through retirees anxious to throw in with the underdog candidate against the Harkonnens might be needed in droves. I'm talking unpaid door knockers, phone banking and data entry, too. Most of all, before this can even begin to coalesce, the Davis office needs to see the mojo; something that ought to be familiar in concept here! But this isn't asking much, many have done way more for a lot less. History is rife with examples.

In the Battle of Cowpens, General Daniel Morgan only asked his rag-tag irregulars to take two good shots before retreating in the face of the better trained and heavily armed British Army. It was brilliant strategy, Continental Irregulars stood their ground and made those two shots count, the seemingly invincible British lines panicked, some began to fold, the tide soon turned in favor of the underdogs, and no less than George Washington's relative [Correction DS] chased Bernaste Tarlton off the field of battle in final defeat. It was one of the key turning points in the long, bloody Revolutionary War. Many of the fallen on that day were mere teenagers, boys really, who who never got to grow up. But thanks to them and others like them, our revolutions today are no longer fought with guns and steel on blood-stained fields littered with corpses. To our great national pride we now hold bloodless revolutions regularly, at the ballot box, in peace.

I believe we can open up fault lines in the Texas republicans using similar, proven, asymmetric tactics to bring about a modern day electoral revolution in what has been a reliable GOP stronghold critical to republican victories. No one's asking for two shots, all we need to get started is for you take two minutes to drop Davis and her staff a note of encouragement here via Daily Kos and/or here on her site.

Let them know this is not a one day phenomenon, a mere fifteen minutes of fame, and that we will always remember and support those who risk their livelihoods and careers to do what is right for millions of disenfranchised people. Who will remain increasingly isolated and exiled from meaningful political influence without progressive champions like Wendy Davis."

Michele Bachmann says 'spanking the president' will take away his 'magic wand,' so there's that","You have looked directly into her eyes. Now your fate is sealed.

It's my prediction that the House Republicans could put themselves in a position where they could actually lose the gavel in 2014. Because I think the president—even by executive order—can again wave his magic wand before 2014, and he'd say now, all of the new legal Americans are going to have voting rights. Why do I say that? He did it in 2012! Do you remember, he—anyone who was here as a Latina under, uh, age 30, he said ""You get to vote!"" What? He decides you get to vote?

I'm going to miss Rep. Michele Bachmann after she's gone. There's really only a few other prominent Republicans—well, a few dozens, two or three hundred tops—who have such a tight connection to the conservative fringe and who aren't afraid to let their fringe flag fly. Here she is explaining her opposition to ""amnesty,"" if ""explaining"" is really the right word to use here Not sure what she's going on about, but she's apparently made up a new magical power that gives the president the impressive supposed ability to give non-citizens voting rights, a right usually reserved only for American citizens and certain large energy companies. This is done, as is befitting all imaginary things, via pointed magic stick. As for the separate conspiracy theory about how he already did that last November with young female brown folks that's largely unparsable, but sounds suspiciously like an ACORN and/or lightbulb and/or Illuminati-based theory. She's saying this to World Net Daily, though, I'm sure they know exactly which one of their 20 different conspiracy theories on that subject she might be talking about. These people have a language unknown to us mere mortals.

After that goes on to say that these new magic-wand-enabled suspiciously non-white voters will allow Democrats to control the House, Senate and White House in 2014, at which point the wolf will eat the sheep and the lion will punch the lamb and the few remaining Republicans will rove the landscape looking for scraps of food and cursing their new magic-having overlords. And the only way to avoid this new dystopia of the president waving his magic wand and allowing all the non-citizens to go to the voting ball in a giant voting pumpkin is to put him through a Congressional Spanking Machine and good lord I just do not even know how her mind works but:



This is working for the president. It's not working for the American people, but it's—hey, it's great by him, he has a perpetual magic wand and nobody's given him a spanking yet and taken it out of his hand. That's what Congress needs to do, give the president a major wake-up call, and the way we spank the president is we do it through the checkbook. We're the ones who say, ""No, you can't have the money!"" What's wrong with us?

Woo, boy.

All right, what have we learned? We learned that magic wands are subject to congressional budget resolutions, so that's something. We've learned that spanking beats magic, which never came up in the Harry Potter series but which really would have saved some considerable time had it been implemented. And we've learned that the reason the current Congress is so incompetent that they cannot even manage to keep the government running is because they are all off in their own little fantasy worlds, worlds of imaginary conspiracy theories that can be seen only by them, can be explained only by them, and set right only by them.

I don't suppose America would agree to just staging an important vote to lure them and then locking them all in the building forever as America's best-appointed loony bin? We could send food in through the mail slots, and we'd even keep the cameras running so that they would not die due to lack of media exposure.

Schmidt', 'Charlie Savage']",Former Pentagon Official to Be Chosen as Homeland Security Chief,"WASHINGTON — President Obama plans to nominate Jeh C. Johnson, who framed many of the administration’s national security policies as the Defense Department’s general counsel during Mr. Obama’s first term, to become the next secretary of the Homeland Security Department, according to administration officials.

If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Johnson, 56, will fill the vacancy left by Janet Napolitano, who resigned in July to lead the University of California system.

Mr. Johnson — whose first name is pronounced “Jay” — has little experience with some of the issues that Ms. Napolitano faced, like border security and immigration. But he was a legal adviser to Mr. Obama during his first presidential campaign and has similar views to the president’s about the future of the United States’ counterterrorism operations. He was at the center of Mr. Obama’s first-term efforts to re-evaluate the counterterrorism policies of President George W. Bush.

During his tenure at the Defense Department, Mr. Johnson shaped the Obama administration’s policies on the detention of terrorism suspects and on targeted drone strikes in Yemen and Somalia. He also helped lead the drive to end the “don’t ask, don’t tell” law that had barred gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/22/Obama-Approval-Far-Below-Reagan-Clinton-Edges-Bush,2013-07-22 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],"Obama Approval Far Below Reagan, Clinton — Edges Bush","Gallup reports that President Obama’s approval rating slipped again in the 2nd Quarter, falling to 47.9%. The dip was the second quarterly drop in a row. At the end of last year, on the heels of his reelection, Obama’s approval rating stood at 51.9%. His approval rating is near the bottom of second-term Presidents at this point in their tenure.

Both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton had significantly higher approval ratings at this point in their Presidencies. Reagan enjoyed a 58.7% approval rating, while Clinton’s approval was slightly lower, 56.3%. Gallup notes that Obama’s poll numbers more closely resemble George W. Bush and Harry Truman. Truman’s approval rating was 48.7%. Bush’s was slightly lower than Obama’s at 47.3%.

Over the next three months, the 19th Quarter in office, every modern President has seen a decline in their approval ratings, with the exceptions of Reagan and Clinton. Both Presidents were presiding over a strong and growing economy. Obama will be presiding, at best, over a weak and stagnant economy.

Obama faces particular challenges over the next three months, however. This Fall, Washington will be consumed with another fight over raising the nation’s debt ceiling and passing a budget. The last time Obama and Congress fought over the debt ceiling, his approval ratings fell to the lowest of his time in office, 41%.

Also, in October a major piece of his ObamaCare law is scheduled to go into effect, the federal and state health insurance exchanges. As with any major government undertaking, there are likely going to be problems with the implementation. Massive problems, however, which are not unlikely, could further erode Obama’s approval.

Obama’s challenge is that he is in a weak position to absorb those threats to his approval. Just a drop of a few points would put his approval in the low 40s. That is a weak position heading into an important election year, when the Democrats are at serious risk of losing control of the Senate.

Senate Democrats would likely continue to chart their own course, moving themselves away from Obama and the White House. The success or failure of Obama’s second term may be decided this Fall."

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",McManus: ‘Tea party’ tempest brewing,"The “tea party” is back and is brewing trouble for the Republican establishment.

After the GOP debacle in the 2012 election, when Republicans not only failed to win the presidency but blew a chance to take over the Senate, party leaders paused to consider what had gone wrong.

The Republican National Committee issued a scathing report warning that the party was in “an ideological cul-de-sac” and resolved to act friendlier toward women, minorities and low-income voters. Strategist Karl Rove said the lesson was to nominate more moderate candidates and set about raising money to do just that.

But tea party and other conservative leaders, undaunted, drew the opposite conclusion.

Advertisement

“It was not conservatives” who lost those Senate races, 19 of them wrote in a joint attack against Rove’s efforts. “Not one moderate challenger won.” The solution, they argued, was to swing further right, not toward the center.

The tea party is as fired up as ever, even though the movement is smaller now than in its heyday of 2010. In one recent poll, only 22% of American voters said they considered themselves tea party supporters, down from 30% three years ago.

But the grass-roots small-government movement has proved remarkably resilient. According to Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol, more than 350 tea party organizations are still operating; that’s roughly two-thirds of the number that sprang up in 2009 and 2010. And they have been recently reenergized by the outbreak of scandals and quasi-scandals in the Obama administration, including one that amounts to a political windfall: the discovery that the Internal Revenue Service targeted tea party groups’ applications for tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny.

The approach of congressional primary elections makes the tea party a major force too. The groups have a track record of turning out in force for low-participation primaries, and adherents are an essential source for donations and volunteers in Republican campaigns.

“Tea party supporters are responsible for almost all of the total campaign activity performed by party supporters on the Republican side,” a team of political scientists led by Ronald B. Rapoport of the College of William & Mary reported in a recent study. “Tea party supporters are not just a faction within the Republican Party; they are a majority faction.”

The problem, of course, is that this majority faction inside the party holds views often at odds not only with a majority of all voters but with the rest of the GOP.

According to polling that Rapoport and his colleagues oversaw, 63% of tea party Republicans want to limit immigration; only 48% of non-tea party Republicans agree. Among tea party adherents, 76% want to abolish the U.S. Department of Education; only 10% of non-tea party Republicans agree.

Most strikingly, when asked whether it was more important to cut the deficit or create jobs, 63% of tea party supporters opted to cut the deficit first. Among non-tea party Republicans, the priority was reversed, with 53% putting jobs first.

That polarization already spells trouble in the House, where tea party members recently balked at “reform conservative” proposals offered by their own majority leader, Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.), beginning with a bill to increase funding for high-risk health insurance pools as an alternative to Obamacare. (Spending was spending, the conservatives objected; they opted for another vote to repeal Obamacare instead.)

It spells trouble in the Senate, where the tea party’s newest star, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), has brought old-guard GOP leaders to the edge of rage by publicly criticizing them as “a bunch of squishes.” He and other tea party senators have succeeded in blocking House-Senate budget negotiations, charging that talks might lead to a deal to raise the federal debt ceiling, which they oppose.

“I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats,” Cruz said.

And he’s not wrong: Some Republicans do want to compromise with President Obama over the debt ceiling. In the short run, GOP leaders don’t want to be blamed by the White House for touching off a financial crisis that might interrupt the economy’s recovery. And in the long run, many in the GOP establishment — including House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) — worry about being branded the party of austerity.

“That’s the label President Obama is trying to put on us,” said David Winston, a pollster and political strategist who has advised Boehner. “But if we become the party of austerity, then President Obama and the Democrats become the party of economic growth.”

Instead of standing solely for spending cuts, Winston argued, the GOP needs to present a clearer plan for economic growth if it is to make headway in the 2014 elections. “Let’s have a real discussion of what you would get with a Senate Republican majority,” he told me last week. “We have to define a choice.”

But tea party members aren’t as worried about winning elections. According to another Rapoport survey, roughly three-fourths of tea party activists say they would prefer a strongly conservative candidate who’s likely to lose over a relatively moderate candidate who’s likely to win.

On paper, 2014 should be a good election for the GOP. It’s the sixth year of the Obama presidency, a time when opposition parties historically do well. Democrats face an uphill battle to hold on to their 55-seat majority in the Senate. Midterm voter turnout is usually lower, so they can’t count on the surge of young and minority voters who helped Obama win reelection.

But they have at least one asset: the civil war within the GOP. Once again, Democrats may prove lucky in their opponents.

(CNN) - Critics have long poked fun at House Speaker John Boehner's teary-eyed tendency. But now Democrats are comparing the speaker to a baby throwing an all-out temper tantrum.

During the commercial breaks of Sunday's game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the New England Patriots, viewers in Boehner's district will catch a 30-second ad with a close up of a wailing baby.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

""Speaker John Boehner didn't get his way on shutting down health care reform,"" the ad's narrator says. ""So, he's shut down the government and hurt the economy.""

House Majority PAC, a group that backs Democratic candidates, released the ad on Friday.

""Speaker Boehner didn't get his way and so, like a child, he threw a Tea Party-inspired temper tantrum and shut down the federal government,"" Andy Stone, the group's communications director, said in a statement.

The new ad is one of many campaigns launched by groups on both sides of the aisle in recent days to fault Democrats or Republicans for the government shutdown.

House Republicans have been trying to attach anti-Obamacare provisions to a spending bill that funds the government, but Senate Democrats refuse to take up anything except a bill with no strings attached. The White House has also threatened to veto any bill that tries to change Obamacare.

Boehner grew agitated Friday morning over a Wall Street Journal article that quoted a senior administration official as saying, ""we are winning"" and ""it doesn't really matter to us"" how long the shutdown lasts ""because what matters is the end result.""

Throwing down the newspaper on the podium at a press conference, Boehner said: ""This isn't some damn game!""

""The American people don't want their government shut down and neither do I,"" he continued. ""All we are asking for is to sit down and to have a discussion and to bring fairness – re-open the government and bring fairness to the American people under Obamacare. It is as simple as that, and it all has to begin with a simple discussion.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney disavowed the comment in the Wall Street Journal.

The House is scheduled to vote on measures Saturday that will start funding certain parts of the government, but Senate Democrats demand a bill that funds the government all at once."

He Left The Post In April']","If Hillary Rodham Clinton passes in 2016, which Democrats run? The Fix ranks the tiers.","Every conversation we have with any Democratic operative about the 2016 presidential race starts this way: “Well, I mean if Hillary runs . . .” Which, of course, is to be expected. If Hillary Rodham Clinton — the former secretary of state, former New York senator and 2008 presidential candidate — runs, then the Democratic race (and the general election, too) revolves around her.

But, of late, those conversations have an interesting addendum that goes like this: “Of course, if Elizabeth Warren wanted to do it, she’d have a case to make.” Yes, she would. We’ve long believed that the freshman senator’s hero status among liberals nationally and massive fundraising capacity would make her very formidable if she ran.

Warren (D-Mass.) has been adamant about her lack of interest in the race. But things change in politics. Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois was similarly adamant about his lack of interest in running for president in 2008 — and we know how that turned out.

The simple fact is that Warren’s beloved status among rank-and-file Democrats — and an elite group of very wealthy and very liberal major donors — means that if Clinton doesn’t run, Warren will come under a significant amount of pressure to reconsider. And Warren would have a built-in excuse to explain her past comments: “Well, I never thought about it seriously, because I expected Hillary to run. But now that she’s not . . . ”

Because of that upside — with apologies to NBA draft experts — we are moving Warren into our second tier of potential Democratic presidential candidates. Clinton remains as the lone candidate in the first tier — a space she will occupy until she announces whether she is running. Our breakdown of the field is below. The candidates within each tier are listed alphabetically.

Tier 1 (If she runs, the other tiers don’t matter)

Hillary Clinton: Everything we hear privately and everything we see publicly suggests that Clinton is running — or at least allowing those around her to put the pieces in place to be ready if/when she flips the switch. Does that mean she is definitely in? No. But it means that with every passing month, we become more and more convinced that the surprise announcement would be that she’s not running.

Tier 2 (If not Hillary, then . . .)

Joe Biden : Last week, the vice president called state Rep.-elect Brian Meyer (D) to congratulate him on his special-election victory a few days earlier. Why would the VP call a not-even-sworn-in-yet state legislator? Because Meyer is from Iowa. And that tells you everything you need to know about whether Biden is thinking about running for president in 2016.

Andrew Cuomo: Unlike some of the other people on this list — Martin O’Malley, we are looking at you — the New York governor is doing the do-as-little-as-possible-to-stoke-2016-speculation thing. (That may or may not be a thing.) Cuomo, the scion of a famous political family, knows that in a field without Clinton, he is a heavyweight given his name, fundraising abilities and résumé as governor of one of the most Democratic states in the country.

Martin O’Malley : The governor of Maryland is, without question, the candidate most open about his interest in running for president. “By the end of this year, I think we’re on course to have a body of work that lays the framework for a candidacy in 2016,” O’Malley told reporters in August. His travel schedule is heavy on trips to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and O’Malley used his time as chairman of the Democratic Governors Association to build out his national fundraising network.

Elizabeth Warren: See above. There’s no one not named Clinton on this list who combines the star power and fundraising potential that Warren boasts. And, Warren has one thing that even Clinton doesn’t: a rabid following within the liberal base of the party.

Tier 3 (There’s a will and a way — sort of)

Kirsten Gillibrand: Gillibrand is a sneaky-good politician. Without all that much fanfare, the senator from New York has turned herself into a liberal champion. She’s also someone who has proved that she knows how to raise money; she took in $30 million between her 2010 and 2012 Senate campaigns.

Tier 4 (There’s a will but — probably — not a way)

Howard Dean: The former Vermont governor clearly looks back on his one-time front-running 2004 presidential campaign wistfully and wonders whether he could catch lightning in a bottle again. The answer is almost certainly no, but Dean, never someone who cared much about the party establishment’s opinion of him, might be the sort of person who would be willing to wage a campaign against Clinton from the ideological left.

Amy Klobuchar: The field above her is too crowded for the senator from Minnesota to take a flier on a presidential bid. But she has the résumé and the ambition to surprise people if things were to break just right."

http://news.yahoo.com/young-gop-leaders-see-substantive-changes-082441549.html,,[],Young GOP leaders see need for substantive changes,"MOBILE, Ala. (AP) — Republicans hoping to reach beyond the party's white, aging core must do more than retool campaign strategy and tactics, say young GOP leaders pressing elected officials to offer concrete policies to counter Democratic initiatives.

""It's very easy to just say no, and there are times where it's appropriate to say no,"" said Jason Weingartner of New York, the newly elected chairman of the Young Republican National Federation. ""But there are times where you need to lead and present ideas on the issues of the day.""

Weingartner and other under-40 activists at a recent national young Republican gathering in Mobile said their party must follow an all-of-the-above approach. Their assessment goes beyond the more general prescriptions that many party leaders, including Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, have offered since November, when Republicans lost the popular vote for the fifth time in the past six presidential elections.

The latest loss was due in large measure to President Barack Obama's advantage over Republican nominee Mitt Romney among younger and nonwhite voters.

For the most part, Priebus has avoided policy recommendations for elected Republicans and says the Republican platform, a political document that's supposed to reflect the core values of the party, isn't the problem.

Weingartner and many of his colleagues agree with Priebus on the platform, and they praise the ""Growth and Opportunity Project"" that Priebus outlined in March.

But the young Republicans' ideas are more explicit than the chairman's blueprint and stand in contrast to a hyperpartisan Congress where many Republicans tailor their actions to please primary voters who loathe cooperation with Democrats.

Weingartner said House Republicans, who won't pass the Democratic-led Senate's version of an immigration overhaul, should pass their own version that at least ""streamlines and expands"" legal slots for foreign students and workers.

Story continues

For now, he said, that would sidestep Republicans who demand border security and Democrats who demand a citizenship path for immigrants already in the country illegally.

On health care, Weingartner said that besides regularly voting to repeal Obama's law, the GOP should emphasize its own ideas such as buying insurance across state lines, while better explaining the Affordable Care Act's cost shift onto younger, healthy individuals.

On same-sex marriage and abortion, young GOP leaders say Republicans should tolerate a range of views, even while maintaining a socially conservative identity. Some of these activists say their party must tread lightly after the Supreme Court recently threw out the most powerful part of the Voting Rights Act, the law that became a major turning point in black Americans' struggle for equal rights and political power.

""We don't have to lose our principles,"" said Angel Garcia, who leads the Young Republicans in Chicago, Obama's hometown. ""But we have to have a conversation on all these issues so we don't leave Democrats to say we're just old white men and racist, bigoted homophobes.""

Chris Reid, a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer, said the GOP has to become more inclusive. ""I get really sick listening to people say it's all or nothing in order to be a good Republican,"" he said.

The GOP still controls the U.S. House, holds 30 governor's seats and stands a reasonable chance of regaining control of the U.S. Senate in the 2014 elections. But 2012 presidential returns justify concern.

Whites, who represent a shrinking share of the electorate, accounted for about 9 out of 10 Romney votes. Obama won Latinos by about 44 percentage points and African-Americans by 85 points. Those groups together accounted for almost one-quarter of all voters.

Among whites, younger age ranges trended more toward Obama. Voters from 18 to 29 years old opted for the president over Romney by a 60-37 margin. Among those age 30 to 44, Obama claimed 52 percent, 7 percentage points more than Romney.

Some Republican strategists say that Obama, as the first black president, set the high-water mark for Democrats among nonwhite voters. Weingartner said the 51-year-old president twice faced much older opponents, a circumstance that could be reversed in 2016. Of several potential GOP candidates, only Texas Gov. Rick Perry, 63, is older than 50.

The Democrats' leading hopefuls are Vice President Joe Biden, 70, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 65.

""We have youth and enthusiasm on our side this time,"" Weingartner said, though he added that it would be foolish to pin GOP hopes on age.

Speaking to delegates, Priebus promised a ""50-state strategy"" that involves hiring workers to engage minority communities. ""We can't win if we just show up four months before a presidential election every four years,"" he said.

Garcia, the Chicago Republican, said that model, patterned after Obama's use of neighborhood-based networks, will identify new supporters. But he said the outreach needs a foundation of specifics.

Expanding legal immigration, Garcia said, could make it harder for Democrats to frame Republicans as ""anti-immigrant,"" a label several Republicans said Romney cemented by advocating ""self-deportation."" After remaking legal immigration, Weingartner said House leaders could realize, as part of a border security plan, that the border will never be completely secure, while getting Democrats to consent to a ""path to legal status"" rather than a ""path to citizenship.""

That approach, both men said, would increase the likelihood that Latinos listen to Republican arguments for low taxes, light regulation and individual opportunity.

Darius Foster, a black business consultant in Alabama, said he encounters similar trust issues among African-Americans, who have overwhelmingly supported Democrats since the civil rights movement.

""I never have to defend Republican principles,"" he said. ""I have to defend Republicans."" That's even harder, he said, since neighboring Shelby County, south of Birmingham, successfully challenged part of the Voting Rights Act.

A strategy for social issues isn't as clear, given that younger voters generally are more liberal on those issues than is the GOP platform.

Of course, there's no guarantee of nuanced approaches from elected officials.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., told delegates that strong opposition to the Senate's immigration push will help Republicans win working-class votes because some wages would fall at first in an expanded labor pool.

Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley urged House Republicans to ""stand strong"" against Obama.

Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama, 37, told her fellow Young Republicans that a major problem is ""low-information voters ... who have not been exposed to our arguments."" She added: ""We win not by changing our policies but by spending more time and energy convincing people we are right.""

All three got standing ovations.

Cuccinelli, who trails Democrat Terry McAuliffe in polling, said his campaign was beating their turnout and grass roots goals.

Cuccinelli stressed repeatedly that President Obama’s decision to campaign on Sunday with McAuliffe was a “great opportunity” for the Republican’s campaign. “[The Democrats] are having a rally to celebrate ObamaCare,” Cuccinelli said. He noted that he was the “first person in the country” to fight ObamaCare, referencing the fact that he was the first to file a lawsuit challenging the health care law, and welcomed the introduction of the issue into the Governor’s race.

He dismissed the possibility that Obama’s appearance would energize Democrats to turn out for McAuliffe. He noted that McAuliffe has released very few specifics about his proposals, making it difficult to increase interest in the campaign. “Voters want to be for something,” Cuccinelli said.

McAuliffe has maintained a steady lead in recent polling. The Democrat has been helped by a significant fundraising advantage. In recent weeks, McAuliffe has enjoyed a 3 or 4-1 advantage on the airwaves. In the closing days of the campaign, union and Democrat interest groups have poured additional resources into McAuliffe’s campaign, but additional ad spending at this stage in the campaign delivers diminishing returns.

“We may be out raised,” Cuccinelli said. “But, we won’t be outworked.”

Tuesday’s election is expected to have a very low turnout, certainly much lower than the turnout in 2012. The electorate in odd-years tends to be older and more conservative than in presidential years, giving the Cuccinelli campaign hope of a strong finish.

McAuliffe certainly hopes that Obama’s campaign appearance creates enthusiasm among Democrat voters. It is just as likely, however, to galvanize the Republican and conservative base. If Cuccinelli prevails on Tuesday, it will be because conservatives returned to Republicans and opposition to ObamaCare. It’s a message that GOP leaders in DC should heed."

Although over time both Romney and Obama were perceived as moving farther away from the average voter, Romney was still closer to this voter on Election Day. The candidate who would have benefited most from a shift to the center was Obama.

So, Romney was always going to lose, even though they had all convinced themselves (even Romney!) of their impending victory. Hence, if you expect to lose, don't change anything! Just keep doing the things that made you expectedly lose.Republicans don't need to shift to the center. Democrats do! And the evidence is some YouGov chart that proved that Obama should've talked to the center. Instead, he didn't. And unfortunately for him (and lucky for Republicans!) Obama won.

If only he had shifted, all of this could've been avoided!



It is certainly true that Americans are moving left on some issues—most notably same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization. But Obama did not win the election because America is becoming more liberal, he won it despite the fact that America has become more conservative [...] Far from ushering in a liberal majority, the Obama administration has presided over a shift among Americans toward preferring less government, not more government. Obama has helped to increase the overall conservatism of the American public more than Reagan ever did, ironically enough.

Go down every single issue—every one!—and Democrats lead Republicans. Yet this unskewer takes data from a single model to claim that America has become ""more conservative"" because they want smaller government.

After Ronald Reagan's second term ... George H.W. Bush got elected. If Reagan made America ""more liberal"", America had a funny way of showing it. And if Obama made Americans more conservative, it only stands to reason that they'd reelect him again, right?

Fact is, the Democrats remain firmly in the American majority on every issue of note. So, if conservatives want to argue that some random chart proves that America is with them, they can knock themselves out. In the real world, things look a lot different.



The GOP will also benefit from what political scientist Alan Abramowitz calls the “time for a change” factor: only once since the 22nd Amendment limited the president to two consecutive terms has a party held the White House for more than two terms in a row.

perhaps we’ll realize that all this talk of a “liberal majority” or “Obama’s mandate” or even a “Democratic realignment” was overblown. And perhaps we’ll even remember that the exact opposite argument was made in 2004, when evil genius Karl Rove was supposed to have ushered in a Republican realignment and Democrats would never win another election unless they could appeal to “values voters.” Those predictions of a Republican majority were soon proved false.

Past performance is no indicator of future results. And that's doubly so in electoral politics, where the sample size is so small. I mean, the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951, so we're talking a sample of just 16 presidential elections.Those predictions were false because they weren't rooted in data, but ideology. The GOP didn't win in 2004 because of value voters, but because of warmongering. The ""ideas"" that people assumed drove the American public were bullshit—even then, big majorities of Americans believed in sensible gun restrictions, higher taxes for the rich and corporations, and protecting Social Security and Medicare. The only major social issue in which we were the minority was marriage equality, and even that's no longer the case.

Current discussions of the future electoral dominance of Democrats isn't based on ideology or perceptions of what the American people believe. Rather, they are based on the cold hard math of demographics. Our base groups are growing and becoming more Democratic. Theirs are dying off (even as they become more Republican). It's that simple.

So it's interesting to see that in an entire piece by a bunch of political scientists trying to convince us that 2012 didn't prove squat, there isn't a single mention of demographics. Not even in passing. That stunning omission is the written equivalent of putting your fingers in your ears and screaming, ""la la la I can't hear you!""

But hey, some random thing said America is more conservative and that Obama should've tacked to the center, so all's cool!

USA TODAY

House Democratic leader says the party is coalescing behind Hillary Clinton for 2016

She calls Hillary Clinton better qualified than her husband or Obama when they look office

Pelosi stayed officially neutral in Clinton%27s 2008 nomination battle with Obama

WASHINGTON — House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday the Democratic Party was coalescing behind Hillary Rodham Clinton as its presidential nominee for 2016, and she urged the former secretary of State to get in the race.

In an interview on USA TODAY's ""Capital Download,"" Pelosi stopped just short of formally endorsing Clinton.

""I'm not making endorsements right now, because I don't think that's appropriate,"" she demurred. ""But I am gauging, I'm gauging. I'm encouraging people to think about it, so in case she asks us, we have something to say to her.""

Does she think the party is coalescing behind Clinton?

""I think so; I think so,"" she said. ""There's a great deal of excitement about the prospect that she would run.""

The California congresswoman, herself a groundbreaker as the only woman to serve as speaker of the House, made it clear what her advice would be: Do it. ""I don't know why she wouldn't run,"" Pelosi said. ""She's prepared. She's well-known. She's highly respected. She knows she could do the job very, very well.""

In 2008, Pelosi was House speaker and stayed officially neutral in the primary battle between Clinton and Barack Obama. She drew ire from Clinton's campaign with a comment that it would be ""harmful"" for unelected ""superdelegates"" to determine the nomination. At that key moment, support from superdelegates was seen as the only way Clinton might prevail.

Pelosi describes Clinton as historically well-qualified to be commander in chief, noting she has served as first lady, a New York senator and a member of the Senate's Armed Services Committee as well as head of the State Department.

""If Secretary Clinton were to run — and we think if she ran, she would win — I believe that she would be the best-prepared person to enter the White House in decades, in decades,"" Pelosi said, ""with all due respect to her husband, present company and other presidents.""

In early polling, Clinton leads the 2016 field, but there are other prominent Democrats who have expressed interest in running, among them Vice President Biden. In a Quinnipiac University Poll released last month, Clinton was supported by 65% of Democrats for the nomination, trailed by Biden at 13% and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 4%."

because the depiction — as a joke, of course — of a woman on a date with a cartoon pig might encourage bestiality, while you're also demanding that Skittles remove this ad

where a woman kisses a walrus because it may — yes, you guessed it — encourage bestiality, you have to ask yourself this: Aren't you thinking a little too much about bestiality?

I mean, seriously, if I'm the depraved Hollywood liberal, how come when I see these ads, I don't think, ""Oh, bestiality, you forbidden fruit, how you tempt me!"" Not even a little. But, you, wholesome Christian do-gooder, see this and think, ""Please, Jesus, give me the strength to not fuck my cat!"" (wild audience applause)

Now, I only bring this up because the Christian pressure group responsible for protesting these ads is called One Million Moms, and they are an example of a much larger problem we need to deal with, a problem I call shit-kicker inflation. Which is the phenomenon of all things conservative being portrayed as way bigger than they really are.

To wit, I looked up One Million Moms on Twitter, and the number of followers they have is 2,258. That's how many my Aunt Marjorie has, and she's got one post, and it says, ""Is this thing working?""

And Million Moms are not alone in pretending they're not alone. The Catholic League is another group constantly in the news because they also love to get freaked out about nonsense that would make even Pat Robertson go, ""Oh, for Christ's sakes, relax!"" But just as there aren't a million moms in One Million Moms, there is no league in the Catholic League. It's one guy with a fax machine.

Now, a recent study found that politicians in both parties consistently thought that their constituents were much more conservative than they actually were. And that's because there's a relatively small group of very shrill people devoted to — and succeeding at — convincing us that this is a much more conservative and religious nation than it is. (audience applause)

Americans, for example, don't hate socialism. They just can't define it. Even though it's kind of right in the name ""Social Security"". Kinda right in the name. Which even Tea Partiers do not want to cut.

Same thing with Obamacare. As an idea, it's unpopular. But ask voters about the elements in it, they're all very popular. It's like saying, ""I hate pizza! I love tomato sauce and melted cheese on dough, but pizza? I hate that shit.""

Same with guns! We found out this week that gun ownership is actually down in this country. Way down. And yet the NRA, with just four million members, has a stranglehold on the gun policies in a nation of 300 million.

This misreading of where the public really is explains why at this moment, a cross-section of Republican politicians are at CPAC delivering a simple message to the right-wingers who keep losing them elections. And that message is: ""Whatever you do, don't change."" Among the featured speakers at CPAC this year include Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, Rick Santorum, Wayne LaPierre, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin — a virtual Who's Who of What The Fuck. (audience cheering and applause)

And look, the convention is still going on, so I won't presume to know everything that's going to be said at this open mic from hell, but.... Oh, screw it! Yes, I do know. I know exactly what'll be said, because it's exactly what they always say. They will get up, one after another, and say that they speak for the vast majority of real Americans who hate socialism and own guns and feel their values are under attack.

Except they don't speak for the vast majority of Americans, or a majority at all. (audience applause) They're just so loud they haven't noticed that America has moved on without them. They're like a nasty, old man still bitching about the kids who keep hitting the ball into his yard, even though those kids have grown up and moved away. And he's still the senior senator from Arizona. (audience cheering)"

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/ten-ways-republicans-want-change-next-election-105724986--election.html,,[],Ten ways Republicans want to change before the next election,"Growth & Opportunity Project

Within a month after last year's presidential election, the Republican National Committee launched a massive project to diagnose the problems that contributed to the party's defeat. Now, the final draft of the ""Growth & Opportunity Project"" is here and, as promised, it's a behemoth.

The RNC on Monday released the findings of the three-month project led by a group of veteran Republican strategists that propose ways the party can improve its outreach to minorities, the primary election process, messaging, fundraising and its relationship with third-party groups.

The dense, 100-page report includes 219 recommendations that are a result of input from about 36,000 online surveys, thousands of conference calls and personal meetings with the project's co-chairs, more than 50 focus groups, 3,000 listening sessions in nine states and the District of Columbia, and surveys targeting the views of women, Hispanics, pollsters, consultants, campaign volunteers and field staff.

Below are 10 lessons the Republican Party learned from its exhaustive search—and what it plans to do about it.

1. Sustain outreach to minority communities, even in years without elections



From the report:

We need to do a better job connecting people to our policies. Our ideas can sound distant and removed from people’s lives. Instead of connecting with voters’ concerns, we too often sound like bookkeepers. ... If we believe our policies are the best ones to improve the lives of the American people, all the American people, our candidates and office holders need to do a better job talking in normal, people-oriented terms, and we need to go to communities where Republicans do not normally go to listen and make our case. We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate that we care about them, too.

The RNC will devote $10 million to hire hundreds of new employees in communities across the country who will have a permanent presence. The project will focus on neighborhoods with heavy black, Hispanic and Asian populations to sustain relationships with those communities in years with and without elections and establish new, senior-level advisory councils for those voters.

Story continues

The party is also preparing an ""aggressive marketing campaign"" at historically black colleges and universities.

2. Recruit more minority Republican candidates

The RNC is launching an ambitious campaign that partners with state parties to build a recruitment program for minority candidates. The party also will hire communication specialists to work with Republican minority leaders to maximize their voice in the media.

3. Don't be afraid of going on 'The Daily Show'

To better reach young voters, the report recommends that Republicans get their candidates on more shows in popular culture and tap into the power of celebrity endorsements.

From the report:

Establish an RNC Celebrity Task Force of personalities in the entertainment industry to host events for the RNC and allow donors to participate in entertainment events as a way to attract younger voters. ... Republican leaders should participate in and actively prepare for interviews with The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, MTV and magazines such as People, UsWeekly, etc., as well as radio stations that are popular with the youth demographic.

4. Give Democratic candidates hell, and dish it early

One of President Barack Obama's re-election campaign's greatest successes was defining Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney early in the election. It was very difficult for Romney to shake that image of him as an out-of-touch rich boss by the time the Obama campaign was done with him.

The report recommends establishing an outside group ""that focuses solely on research"" of Republican opponents to ""define Democrats early in election cycles."" They want to see conservative groups tracking Democratic candidates' every move, while building websites that do ""nothing but post inappropriate Democrat utterances and act as a clearinghouse for information on Democrats.""

5. Train new Republican activists with online and mobile campaign education programs



Republicans will build a mobile voter registration program that makes it easier for voters to register online. For those who want to become actively involved in the party, the RNC is overhauling its Political Education Department to teach activists how to better use voter data and buy political ads on television and online. All of those resources will be made available on the Web.

6. Release the voter data



The Republican Party has billions of pieces of voter data that it plans to make available to friendly vendors and campaigns in a way that allows them to create new apps and programs based on the information.

The RNC hopes to integrate voter data into everything it does—from fundraising to door-to-door canvassing—to ensure every decision is more calculated and results are measurable.

The party plans to establish a new field office near Silicon Valley to have close access with tech firms, while holding ""hackathons"" in ""tech-savvy cities"" to ensure it remains up to date on the latest technologies.

7. Shrink the primary



If you thought the Republican primary process felt like it lasted forever, well, so did the top brass at the Republican Party. Next time, the RNC will compress the Republican primary season to a few months in 2016 so the candidates don't have to spend so much money and resources battling each other.

8. Hold fewer primary debates



Before Republicans chose a presidential candidate in 2012, they held more than 20 debates. Never again. The RNC will conduct only about a dozen debates that will begin no earlier than September 2015.

""While we were playing footsie debating each other 23 times, what was the other side doing? They were spending potentially hundreds of millions of dollars on data, technology, voter outreach,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""They were getting the job done.""

Indeed, many of the Republican primary candidates' most embarrassing moments occurred on debate stages across the country.

9. Adios, August convention

As part of the emphasis on securing a presidential candidate earlier in the primary process, the Republican National Convention will be held in June or July. That will allow the party and the campaign to coordinate sooner and, along with outside groups, help the candidate build more momentum before the November election.

10. Change the tone, but not the message

Republicans believe they have a communication problem, not a message problem. While the Growth and Opportunity Project was never meant to be a policy document, there appears to be no movement in the direction of shifting principles in the near future. “I don’t think our platform is the issue,” Priebus said during a stop on his listening tour in Iowa earlier this month.

It is not the increased drumbeat emanating from the Beltway press corps critical of her political operation.

It is not the obsessive focus by Washington Republicans on the events in Benghazi, who, due to their almost demented political obsession with taking Hillary Clinton down, have actually done a disservice to those seeking real answers about what happened in Libya.

[pullquote]

Instead, the biggest issue facing Hillary Clinton is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a woman who has signed a letter urging Hillary to run and who has made repeated Shermanesque statements about her own presidential ambitions in 2016.

The allure of Warren to the Democratic base is simple: she draws the starkest contrast possible between politicians who carefully calibrate their language so as not to offend any particular constituency and those who speak clearly and directly to the frustrations Americans of all stripes, from the Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street, feel about the special interests who hold our government hostage.

Last September, Warren addressed the AFL-CIO using the kind of stark, populist language that Americans on both sides of the aisle have been hungering for.

She spoke of a rigged system that benefits Wall Street to the detriment of Main Street.

She spoke of a Supreme Court held in thrall by corporate interests.

She spoke of legislation to limit the ability of big banks to gamble with depositor’s money.

This type of rhetoric should be commonplace in Washington but it is not.

The ever-increasing quest for campaign cash has prevented high-ranking elected officials from speaking out this way – and has certainly prevented them from acting on it.

Warren’s own legislation to curb Wall Street’s excesses will likely not see the light of day, even when her own party controls the Senate agenda and even though it is written jointly with Republican Senator John McCain.

Neither party in Washington today wants any part of populism.

What the Beltway punditocracy fails to understand is that many politically engaged Americans on both sides of the aisle hunger for this kind of populist agenda.

It is the same kind of longing that produced a brash challenge to the Clinton brand in 2008. Then, Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic primary to a newcomer from Illinois, who became an avatar for the frustration Democrats outside the Beltway felt towards the cautious approach Washington politicians have taken towards the entrenched, special interest establishment.

In 2016, Hillary Clinton may finally become the Democratic nominee – but not before the base forces her to throw some caution to the wind and pay attention to the Elizabeth Warrens of the party."

I love going to 270towin just to scroll through the maps and see the trends over the years. New York used to be quite the swing state, don't cha know? One day when I was perusing the maps, I noticed the seeds of our current map being planted in 1988. The 84 election was virtually a shutout for Reagan and the elections before that were from the era before the solid Republican South. 1988 was the year Iowa, Oregon, and Washington in particular, which had been consistently Republican, switched to reliably Democratic (aside from IA in 04). The only Dukakis state which has not become a part of our coalition is West Virginia. While Clinton won WV both times, we have not won the state in any of the last four elections. Clinton's victories in the south were the last gasp of that previous era combined with a spoiler factor, but in the rest of the country he was able to consolidate and expand on Dukakis' kernels of strength, leaving us essentially with the map we have today.

With Clinton's unusual circumstances in mind, I looked at the four elections since he left office to see what state are actually ""swinging"". Its a short list. And it looks really good for us.

In all, 40 states and the District of Columbia have voted for the same party in each election from 2000-2012, 18 states plus DC for the Democrat, 22 states for the Republican. More importantly, our states have 242 electoral votes to their 180. With that map, all we need to do is win Florida and its over.

Five states have gone for one party three of the last four elections. New Mexico, Iowa, and New Hampshire for us, Indiana and North Carolina for them. Clinton won the three Democratic leaning states both times and lost the Republican leaning states both times, so I will put them in their respective categories. That gives us 257 to 206 with the Democrat in the lead.

That leaves Nevada, Colorado, Florida, Ohio, and Virginia which have split their votes in the last four elections. These are all states that Gore and Kerry lost and Obama won both times. Nevada was not really considered a swing state last cycle, but the rest I think will be competitive next cycle.

What strikes me is the way our strength has expanded and consolidated on those Dukakis states. We have been playing offense from the base he established in 1988. First we turned his toeholds in the Northeast, upper Midwest, and West Coast into regional dominance, then made forays first into the Mountain West then the upper South that seem to be gaining traction.

Headed by veteran staff of Obama’s reelection, the organization’s mission is to use the resources that reelected Obama to promote his policy agenda. As a 501 c(4), it can accept unlimited donations. According to its 1st Quarter financials, however, it is struggling to attract the same big donors that fueled Obama’s reelection.

OFA raised $4.8 million in the first three months of 2013. This is a fraction of what the Obama campaign would raise each quarter, even though OFA can accept unlimited donations. OFA certainly tried to maximize this fundraising advantage. For a $500,000 contribution, donors would receive a seat on a “national advisory board” and attend quarterly meetings at the White House. The top donation to the group, however, was half this amount, $250,000 from activist Peter Munger.

Last month OFA held a founders’ summit in DC, which featured President Obama. The event was open to donors giving at least $50,000 to the group. In the 1st Quarter, however, only 16 donors gave this amount. In all, just over 1,400 donors gave more than $250.

The underwhelming haul can’t just be attributed to a post-election lull, either. In January alone, the RNC raised almost $7 million and the DNC raised over $4 million. In addition, President Obama has aggressively pushed several high-profile agenda items. Supporting these is OFA’s reason for existing and should have fueled significant contributions.

OFA’s larger challenge is that a campaign structure to support on individual candidate doesn’t necessarily translate to particular policies. Voters support a candidate for a variety of reasons, often irrespective of policies. Even when a voter completely agrees on an issue, it doesn’t always mean they will take action on that issue.

Deciding to take action in the climax of a national election is much different than taking action outside of the political frenzy, when daily life has returned.

Another challenge for OFA is that, inevitably, base activists will turn their attention to other campaigns. Second term Presidents inevitably shrink from the domestic policy debate, as party activists focus on midterm elections and the next nominee for the White House.

OFA’s struggles attracting big donors suggests this process has already started.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/09/Mike-Lee-Tea-Party-heading-to-Philadelphia-from-Boston-taking-government-over-to-shape-America-s-future,2013-11-09 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Exclusive — Mike Lee Lays Out Road Forward for Tea Party in Iowa,"In a speech Saturday evening to the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition at the group’s 13th annual fall banquet in Des Moines, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) argued that now is the time for the Tea Party movement to take its next steps, take control of American government, and frame America’s future with a focus on conservative and liberty-minded principles.

Lee compared the movement’s next stages to those of the American revolution, noting how the earliest stages of revolution began in Boston with the Boston Tea Party, where a band of protesters dumped British tea in the Boston Harbor as a sign of disapproval of the high taxes the British had levied on them. That eventually turned into the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia after Americans fought and won their independence from the British.

“In order to chart our course forward, join me on a journey back,” Lee said in the speech, according to an advance copy provided to Breitbart News. “Back to a time when the people of this continent were just as frustrated with their oppressive government as all of us here tonight are with the Federal government today.”

Lee noted that in 1773, “a group of Americans had had it with the King George establishment which was too big, too expensive and too intrusive in their lives.”

“What would become known as the Boston Tea Party became a clarion cry against the kind of government the colonists did not want,” Lee said. “It turned out to be a pretty important party and a very big deal. But had they stopped at just protesting against the kind of government they didn’t want the Boston Tea Party would not have been even a footnote in history. It would have been just one more vain protest against an oppressive federal establishment.”

Lee explained how the Founding Fathers of America “pressed forward from Boston” and continued their protest and “began a journey toward the kind of government they did want” instead of just protesting a government they disliked.

“It took them 14 long years to get from Boston to Philadelphia, where in 1787 they created, in the Constitution, the kind of government they did want,” Lee said. “Boston to Philadelphia. That is a good model for us to follow today.”

Lee argued that the Tea Party movement and conservatives must always fight against “bad government,” but that the movement must also find a way forward to fight for the right kind of government. “While we must always challenge and fight against bad government we must also be found promoting and pursing the policy path toward the kind of federal government we do want and the people deserve,” Lee said. “Unfortunately with this administration we have, of necessity, had a lot of Boston battles – from fiscal cliffs and attacks on our 2nd amendment rights to sequester and of course, Obamacare.”

“So let me be clear – we will never back down from a Boston moment – and we will never stop rallying the American people to fight those battles,” he explained. “But it is just as important to keep our eyes in the direction of Philadelphia and the principles and policies which will lead us ultimately to the kind of government we do want.”

According to Des Moines Register, Lee was in Iowa to rally conservatives for the next phases of the battle ahead. He is not running for president–“absolutely not” he answered when asked by the Iowa paper if he would consider a White House bid. Instead, what Lee is doing is becoming the intellectual leader of the conservatives in the U.S. Senate.

Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Marco Rubio (R-FL), the conservatives with whom Lee usually keeps company, are each potential presidential candidates in 2016. Lee is not, and that puts him in a unique position to focus on accomplishing building the conservative movement and a future message for the Republican Party.

In the past few weeks, Lee has developed a new agenda for the GOP focused on populism. Matt Continetti noted in the Weekly Standard that Lee argued that in a recent speech delivered to the Heritage Foundation, “Candidates need policy ideas that address the concerns of ordinary voters–and they have to campaign, and win, on those ideas.”

Lee’s goal, as he said in the Iowa speech on Saturday, is to help the GOP and the conservative movement develop a platform from which to win the hearts and minds of voters, and more importantly, get the country back on the track to prosperity.

“To deserve victory, conservatives have to do more than pick a fight,” Lee said. “We have to win a debate. And to do that, we need more than just guts. We need an agenda.”

“It is a long march from Boston to Philadelphia,” he added. “And make no mistake – there are more Boston battles ahead and ‘we the people’ must always be ready to stand up and speak out against the kind of government we do not want. Bad government and bad policy must always be hit, and stopped, head on. Likewise, we must always have the vision of Philadelphia before us – a vision and an agenda for the type of government and they kind of country we do want.”

This has been Lee’s plan since he was elected in 2010, and he is executing it step by step. In 2010, in his election night victory speech, Lee also made the argument that the Tea Party movement needs to travel from Boston to Philadelphia."

(CNN) - In their final face-to-face meeting, New Jersey's candidates for governor held nothing back. The nationally known incumbent, Republican Chris Christie, and Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono, traded personal and political barbs in a heated exchange three weeks before election day.

The 90-minute debate was interrupted twice by audience members and featured dueling narratives. Christie described himself as a bipartisan governor with overwhelming public support who has brought New Jersey out of the depths of the recession. Buono, on the other hand, pitched herself as a fierce underdog who has fought for the working class all her career.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Christie has an overwhelming majority in the polls. The latest numbers from Quinnipiac University put the Republican governor almost 30% ahead of Buono despite the state's history of leaning blue.

""Governor Christie represents the worst combination of bully and boss-ism,"" Buono said, speaking again and again about what she called the ""Boardwalk Empire of New Jersey bosses and backroom politics"" that she charged Christie stood at the center of.

Throughout the night, Christie was quick to fire back.

""You want to start throwing stones tonight, you better get out of your glass house,"" he said.

Buono didn't hit hard all night, however, knowing how popular the governor is on many issues.

""I think the governor did a great job during Sandy and the aftermath,"" she said of his leadership during the hurricane last fall. She was quick to add, ""I just wish that we could see that governor again.""

For his part, Christie, who is widely considered a contender for the 2016 presidential election, tried to combat a perception that he had already checked out of state politics on his national climb. He was asked a handful of times about his political ambition, and his opponent painted some of his policy-making as him appeasing the right wing of the national Republican Party.

Buono accused him of ""wilting"" to the NRA and New Hampshire Republicans when he vetoed a ban on a powerful model of semi-automatic assault rifle. She argued he was aligning himself with Sarah Palin and Tea Party Republicans by opposing same-sex marriage over a majority of New Jersey voters' support for it. And she tied him to the debt fights in Washington through his campaigning and fundraising for GOP leaders like Sen. Marco Rubio and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

Again and again, Christie defended his record.

""I am who I am,"" he said, and the people of New Jersey ""know that when I tell them something, I'm telling them the truth as I see it and that I'm not going to mince words about it. I think that's the way most people in New Jersey are... and they're not going to see anything different from Chris Christie in a second term if I'm lucky enough to have one.""

And on the issue of presidential politics, he remained mum.

""I have no idea what the next four years are going to bring me. Absolutely no idea,"" he said. ""And I don’t think that the people of New Jersey out there watching right now expect me to be able to predict what will happen over the next four years."""

Marco Rubio as he pressed her on past comments suggesting the U.S. should apologize for its ""sins.""

The Florida Republican repeatedly asked Power for examples of crimes ""committed or sponsored"" by the United States.

Her response was that ""the United States is the greatest country on earth"" and she ""would never apologize for America.""

Rubio, pausing, said: ""So your answer to whether we committed or sponsored crimes is that the United States is the greatest country on earth.""

Power ultimately did not say whether she thought the U.S. has committed crimes. Instead, she cited ""mistakes"" like the abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. She also cited her past criticism of the Clinton administration's inaction with regard to the Rwandan genocide.

Power made the disputed comments in a 2003 New Republic magazine article, saying American foreign policy needs a ""historical reckoning"" which would entail ""opening the files"" and ""acknowledging the force of a mantra we have spent the last decade promoting in Guatemala, South Africa, and Yugoslavia.""

Though she did not revisit those themes during her hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, she was apparently referring to past U.S. support for oppressive regimes. The comments angered some lawmakers, though, since she also seemed to draw a comparison to Nazi Germany.

She said: ""Instituting a doctrine of the mea culpa would enhance our credibility by showing that American decision-makers do not endorse the sins of their predecessors. When (German Chancellor Willy) Brandt went down on one knee in the Warsaw ghetto, his gesture was gratifying to World War II survivors, but it was also ennobling and cathartic for Germany. Would such an approach be futile for the United States?""

At her hearing on Wednesday, Power backed off some of her prior comments.

Asked by Rubio if she would have said the above passage differently if given the chance, she said, ""indeed.""

She also distanced herself from past remarks in which she recommended the U.S. send a ""mammoth protection force"" to bring order to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

""I have disassociated myself from those comments many times,"" she said, describing it as a ""remarkably incoherent response"" to a question she shouldn't have answered.

Mostly, senators at the confirmation hearing on Wednesday voiced support for Power.

Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said any criticism means ""you must be doing something right.""

""I don't believe that anyone can question your credentials,"" he said.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said her propensity for making bold comments could help at the United Nations. ""I think the U.N. could use a lot more blunt and outspoken,"" he said.

Power's opening statement expressed strong support for Israel and strong criticism of the way the U.N. works.

She said the U.S. ""has no greater friend in the world than"" Israel and slammed the U.N. General Assembly and Human Rights Council for its obsession with passing anti-Israel resolutions.

""I will stand up for Israel and work tirelessly to defend it,"" she said.

She also scorched the U.N. Security Council for its dawdling on Syria as the Assad regime commits ""atrocities"" against its people.

She described the U.N. response as a ""disgrace that history will judge harshly.""

Power is a former White House adviser and journalist/author who has written extensively about human rights abuses and genocide. She won the Pulitzer Prize for her 2002 book on genocide called ""A Problem from Hell."" She also advised Obama during the 2008 presidential primary campaign.

If confirmed, Power would replace former ambassador Susan Rice at the U.N."

House Speaker John A. Boehner bears a great deal of blame for this dismal record, but he can be commended for finally calling out the conservative activist organizations that have been cheering on the congressional drive toward ignominy.

Last week, with Congress on the verge of actually doing something – passing a compromise two-year budget that would avoid another disastrous government shutdown – right-wing groups such as the Club for Growth, Heritage Action and the tea party umbrella organization FreedomWorks demanded that Republicans vote against the spending plan and threatened that a “yes” vote could be used against incumbents in the 2014 GOP primaries.

At long last, Boehner had had enough. In a news conference Wednesday, the speaker hammered the conservative hard-liners, saying: “They’re using our members and they’re using the American people for their own goals. This is ridiculous. If you’re for more deficit reduction, you’re for this agreement.”

In another gathering with reporters Thursday, Boehner took a repeat shot. “I think they’re pushing our members in places where they don’t want to be,” he said. “And frankly, I just think that they’ve lost all credibility.”

Boehner went on to lay blame for October’s government shutdown squarely with the right-wing money groups. Those groups pushed the shutdown as a bold plan, encouraging the tea party faction of the House Republicans to resist more moderate voices in their caucus. “My members know that wasn’t exactly the strategy I had in mind,” the speaker said.

Besides the satisfaction of seeing Boehner smack down the people who have helped turn the Republican Party into a narrow cult of neo-Confederates, it is gratifying to have him lay bare the preposterous lie many of his conservative compatriots tried to foist on the American people at the time of the shutdown. The very right-wingers who engineered the government closure and were eager for a rejection of the debt ceiling raise, including Sen. Ted Cruz, Rep. Michele Bachmann and the whole crew on Fox News, are the ones who tried to pin blame for it all on President Obama. Unsurprisingly, the faction of Americans who live in a paranoid, Obama-fearing bubble eagerly swallowed this canard.

Now, though, the Republican speaker has spoken the truth. One can hope it is the first small step toward the Grand Old Party being restored to sanity and the first sign that Congress is edging toward redemption."

Marco Rubio is only a freshman senator, but his voter appeal and Cuban-American heritage -- combined with his focus on immigration reform and other key issues -- have made him a rising star in the Republican Party.

His ascension from junior Florida senator into the upper echelon of the party will be highlighted Tuesday night when he gives the Republican response to President Obama’s State of the Union address.

“Senator Rubio’s rise in the party has as much to do with his youth and ethnicity as it does with his intelligence and common-sense policy positions,” said Tyler Harber, a Republican strategist and partner in Harcom Strategies International. “Republicans realize their weakness lies with reaching younger and non-white voters. Rubio presents an opportunity to the party to coalesce around a leader who can bridge the divide.”

Time magazine recently put Rubio on its cover with the headline ""The Republican Savior"" and called him the new voice of the Republican Party.

Harber says Rubio also possesses a common-sense approach to issues that generally divide conservative and moderate wings of the party and nation.

Rubio has authored bipartisan jobs legislation, has plans for legislation on education and small business and has crafted an immigration plan likely to draw bipartisan support.

“I know both sides of this coin firsthand,” Rubio said last month on the Senate floor. “I didn't watch some movie last week about immigration. I lived this issue on a daily basis. I live in a family of immigrants, married into a family of immigrants, in a neighborhood of immigrants.”

Still, Rubio knows he must walk a political tightrope on the issue -- trying to show the welcoming face of the party on legal immigration while firmly discouraging illegal immigration.

He is expected to talk Tuesday night about a range of issues on which he's taken firm positions, including jobs, spending and taxes.

“He’s tried to walk the line between Tea Party and the establishment sides of the Republican Party, often offering a third position on policies that both groups can embrace,” Harber said.

Though Rubio was elected in 2010 as part of the Tea Party movement that helped Republicans take control of the House and is still referred to as the ""crown prince” of the movement, Republican Sen. Rand Paul will give the official Tea Party response.

The Kentucky senator will give his response to the president’s remarks a few minutes after Rubio.

As poll results came in showing the former congressman in distant fifth place, Weiner took to the stage at Connolly's Pub in Midtown and put an end to a once-promising campaign.

""Now, sadly, we did not win this time,"" he said. ""But I could not be more proud of the campaign we ran.""

""There's no doubt about it,"" he added. ""We have the best ideas. Sadly, I was an imperfect messenger.""

Weiner, who resigned from Congress in 2011 amid a sexting scandal, joined the Democratic mayoral primary earlier this summer. He quickly climbed in the polls, even briefly gaining frontrunner status.

In July, however, revelations that Weiner had more online relationships with women after his resignation caused him to plummet in the polls.

Though his wife, longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, often stood by his side on the campaign trail, she was absent from his concession speech."

New Egypt, New Jersey (CNN) - What does a candidate do if he's down in the polls, days from the election, and his opponent is a political celebrity?

Answer: Bring in his own celebrity.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

That's what Senate hopeful Steve Lonegan did this weekend, just days before he faces off against Democratic nominee and Newark Mayor Cory Booker in New Jersey's special U.S. Senate election on Wednesday.

His wild card? Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.

""Can the rest of America count on you to send Steve Lonegan to the United States Senate?"" Palin asked the crowd Saturday at a rally for Lonegan in Ocean County. It was her first appearance at a tea party rally in more than a year, when she stumped for Ted Cruz in Texas in July 2012.

Lonegan, former mayor of Bogota, faces an uphill battle against Booker, a man well known on the national stage.

""Don't be measuring the drapes there just quite yet,"" Palin said in a warning to Booker.

Palin and Lonegan paint the race as a national referendum on President Barack Obama's policies, including Obamacare.

""When we go to Washington on October 17 (the day after the special election), it's going to be Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid that are going to fold,"" Lonegan said at the rally.

Thanks in part to Lonegan's aggressive ad campaign, Booker's 28-percentage-point lead in August dipped to 12 points, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week.

That's not surprising to some voters in New Jersey, a state where Democrats greatly outnumber Republicans.

""There are a lot of people in the state that have conservative values and just don't know it,"" one woman, Alexandra Zazanis of North Arlington, said at the rally.

But another voter said he's not quite on board with Lonegan's policies.

""I'm a Republican, but I think Lonegan's a little bit too far to the right,"" Dave Munn said.

Krista Jenkins, Director of Public Mind At Farleigh Dickenson University, acknowledge that Lonegan has narrowed his gap with Booker, but added the Republican is still a longshot for the Senate seat.

""We're looking at a very blue state there's approximately 700,000 more registered Democrats than there are Republicans,"" she said. ""So anyone who runs, with the exception of Chris Christie right now, anyone who runs as a Republican, you know, for the Senate is certainly going to have a more difficult time than somebody who's a Democrat.""

And because Lonegan is a ""movement conservative,"" not a moderate Republican, his uphill fight is ""much steeper"" the Garden State, she said.

Lonegan is against abortion rights and same-sex marriage, but his views on Booker seem to be getting all the attention. Lonegan fired one of his top advisers, Rick Shaftan, Friday after that adviser gave a profanity-laced interview, ridiculing Booker for having a Twitter exchange with a stripper.

""I don't know, it was like what a gay guy would say to a stripper,"" the adviser said.

Lonegan said he can't be responsible for what one of his supporters says.

""I have hundreds of activists, volunteers, donors, people on this campaign and I can't be responsible for what all of them say, but I will take responsibility – so I terminated the gentleman for his inappropriate comment,"" he told CNN.

Lonegan was criticized for his own comments about Booker after the Newark mayor addressed questions about whether he was gay.

""People who think I'm gay, some part of me thinks it's wonderful,"" Booker told The Washington Post. ""Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, 'So what does it matter if I am? So be it. I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight.'""

Lonegan weighed in on Booker's comments during an August radio interview.

""It's kind of weird. As a guy, I personally like being a guy,"" he said.

Then there was the comment that Lonegan made during last week's debate: ""All that income tax and sales tax money gets poured into the big black hole of Newark.""

After facing some backlash from critics saying his remark was racist, Lonegan said Saturday, ""the liberal media is going to say what they want to say.""

""Newark's budget is a big black hole,"" he continued. ""And it sucks in millions and billions of suburban taxpayer dollars and we never see it again, period."""

A poll released Friday by Democrat-leaning Public Policy Polling shows Gomez, the former Navy SEAL and political newcomer, trailing Democratic Rep. Ed Markey by just 4 percentage points, 40 to 44 percent.

The poll follows one released Thursday by Emerson College that shows Gomez trailing Markey by 6 percentage points, 36-42, in the special election to fill the seat held by Democrat John Kerry, now secretary of State.

The numbers are in sharp contrast to those before the primaries in which Markey led by as many as 19 points in a hypothetical match up with Gomez.

The battle lines have already been drawn, with both candidates essentially putting new edges on a mix of familiar political strategies.

The 47-year-old Gomez, a Hispanic and private equity investor, is trying to portray Markey, a congressman for the past 36 years, as a Washington insider.

“He’s been a career politician since I was playing little league,” he told Fox News after his primary win. “He’s a poster boy for term limits.”

Markey, a progressive aligned with President Obama’s policies, is attacking Gomez for his connection to a documentary that accuses Obama of seeking political gain by leaking details of the Usama bin Laden killing that they say put troops and national security at risk.

He also told The Washington Post that Gomez not agreeing to keep their race free of outside money makes him “the poster boy for politics as usual.”

And the contest has already turned negative.

Markey now has an attack ad titled “Meet Gabriel Gomez: Just Another Republican,” which includes a split screen shot of bin Laden and Gomez.

""Markey has started his campaign with a textbook despicable political attack,"" Gomez said. ""Markey should direct his campaign to immediately stop this ad, stop his mudslinging and debate me on issues that Massachusetts voters care about, the economy and jobs.”

Political analysts are comparing the contest with last year’s Senate race in Massachusetts, in which incumbent Republican Scott Brown was defeated by Democratic political newcomer Elizabeth Warren, a progressive who supported Wall Street reform and women’s health-care choices, as Markey is expected to do.

They also point to Brown’s stunning 2010 special election victory as proof a Republican can win in this heavily Democratic state.

As a relatively unknown state senator, Brown managed to catch Massachusetts Democrats by surprise, after trailing their candidate, state Attorney General Martha Coakley, by as many as 31 points.

However, Gomez appears to have more statewide name recognition earlier in the race. And Democrats are prepared not to have a repeat of three years ago.

""While we don't pay attention to public polls, we're confident that the more people learn about Gomez..., the more people will realize his radical agenda is bad for Massachusetts,"" said Andrew Zucker, Markey's campaign press secretary.

Zucker cited Gomez's position on women's reproductive issues as part of that agenda.

The general election in June 25.

“The victory window has cracked open for Gomez,” said Rob Gray, a Republican strategist for New England-based Gray Media, who sees an enthusiasm gap among Democrats.

He argued Friday that Gomez’s relatively surprising primary victory over more established candidates and ability to raise campaign money shows he has the kind of statewide appeal that will help him win over much needed Independent voters.

“He’s at a good place to start,” Gray said.

Tim Buckley, spokesman for the state Republican Party, said Gomez’s first step toward victory came on election night when the losing candidates pledged their support and “put their eye on the prize.”

He also agrees that Gomez has “crossover appeal” and added his own historically perspective, saying “Massachusetts likes new political figures.”"

If you shove a big government program down their throats they will recoil. But many of their immediate problems flow from globalization, the turmoil of technological change and social decay, and they’re looking for a bit of help. Moreover, given all the antigovernment rhetoric, they will never trust these Republicans to reform cherished programs like Social Security and Medicare. You can’t be for entitlement reform and today’s G.O.P., because politically the two will never go together.

Can current Republicans change their underlying mentality to adapt to these realities? Intellectual history says no. People almost never change their underlying narratives or unconscious frameworks. Moreover, in the South and rural West, where most Republicans are from, the Encroachment Story has deep historic and psychological roots. Anti-Washington, anti-urban sentiment has characterized those cultures for decades.

It’s probably futile to try to change current Republicans. It’s smarter to build a new wing of the Republican Party, one that can compete in the Northeast, the mid-Atlantic states, in the upper Midwest and along the West Coast. It’s smarter to build a new division that is different the way the Westin is different than the Sheraton.

The second G.O.P. wouldn’t be based on the Encroachment Story. It would be based on the idea that America is being hit simultaneously by two crises, which you might call the Mancur Olson crisis and the Charles Murray crisis.

Olson argued that nations decline because their aging institutions get bloated and sclerotic and retard national dynamism. Murray argues that America is coming apart, dividing into two nations — one with high education levels, stable families and good opportunities and the other with low education levels, unstable families and bad opportunities.

The second G.O.P. would tackle both problems at once. It would be filled with people who recoiled at President Obama’s second Inaugural Address because of its excessive faith in centralized power, but who don’t share the absolute antigovernment story of the current G.O.P.

Would a coastal and Midwestern G.O.P. sit easily with the Southern and Western one? No, but majority parties are usually coalitions of the incompatible. This is really the only chance Republicans have. The question is: Who’s going to build a second G.O.P.?"
