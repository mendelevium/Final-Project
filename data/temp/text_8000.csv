Put simply, the recession took middle-class jobs, and the recovery has replaced them with low-income ones, a trend that has exacerbated income inequality. According to Labor Department data, about 1.7 million workers earned the minimum wage or less in 2007. By 2012, the total had surged to 3.6 million, with millions of others earning just a few cents or dollars more.

In his State of the Union address in February, President Obama made raising the federal minimum wage his banner economic proposal. The White House argued that increasing the wage to $9 an hour from its current $7.25 and indexing it to inflation would lift hundreds of thousands of families above the poverty line.

Combined with tax measures the administration has supported, Alan B. Krueger, the departing chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, said that raising the minimum wage would undo “a lot of the rise in inequality we’ve seen over the last 20 years.”"

A proposal to study whether the state should adopt its own currency is gaining traction in the state legislature from a number of lawmakers as well as conservative economists. The state House voted 65-32 earlier this week to approve the measure, and it will now go to the Senate.

While it’s unlikely that Virginia will be printing its own money any time soon, the move sheds light on the growing distrust surrounding the nation’s central bank. Four other states are considering similar proposals. In 2011, Utah passed a law that recognizes gold and silver coins issued by the federal government as tender and requires a study on adopting other forms of legal currency.

Virginia Republican Del. Robert Marshall told FoxNews.com Tuesday that his bill calls for creation of a 10-member commission that would determine the “need, means and schedule for establishing a metallic-based monetary unit.” Essentially, he wants to spend $20,000 on a study that could call for the state to return to a gold standard.

The gold standard is a system under which a country ties the value of its currency to gold, setting a fixed price at which gold can be bought or sold by the government.

“We’re not going to be printing money with Dave Matthews or Jeff Davis on the front of it,” Marshall said, referring to two famous Virginians.

Marshall said he wants to inject competition into the national economy and force the federal government to change its current policy – one he believes will lead to hyperinflation and instability. He also thinks Virginia should be armed with an alternative currency in case it comes under a cyber attack. Many of Marshall’s arguments are similar to ones made by the Tea Party.

In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt suspended the gold standard to counter deflation brought on by the Great Depression. The country continued to exchange gold internationally until 1971 when President Richard Nixon ended the practice.

Marshall’s commission would examine the impact of the Federal Reserve’s intervention in the banking and credit markets that have resulted in near-zero returns on savings accounts and retirement accounts.

“We’re not immune from the consequences of human behavior,” Marshall said. “At some point there is going to be a dollar that breaks the camel’s back.”

“This is like planning for the Titanic,” he said.

Not everyone agrees.

“He’s descending into serious la la land,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mark Sickles told FoxNews.com.

Sickles said he doesn’t think Marshall’s plan will make it through the Senate. He said the state should not be shelling out thousands of dollars in taxpayer money for the study when there are other pressing problems like unemployment and cuts to higher education that need immediate attention. He argues that Virginia has held a triple-A bond rating with Moody's since 1938. While that's true, the state has been placed on the downgrade watch list three times.

Last year, 11 states had considered bills involving the gold standard. The raft of negative public sentiment against the central banking system even caused Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to speak out against the idea during a series of lectures.

""Since the gold standard determines the money supply, there is not much scope for the central bank to use monetary policy to stabilize the economy,” Bernanke said during a speech at George Washington University last year. ""Under a gold standard, typically the money supply goes up and interest rates go down in a period of strong economic activity -- so that's the reverse of what a central bank would normally do today."""

http://news.yahoo.com/food-stamp-cuts-hit-elderly-164547526.html,,[],Food stamp cuts hit 9 million elderly and disabled people,"Cuts to the nation’s food stamp program hit 48 million Americans this week, including more than 9 million elderly and disabled people.

Nearly one in seven Americans uses the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which has doubled in cost since 2008 when Congress increased the benefits as part of the economic stimulus bill. Both Democrats and Republicans allowed the temporary benefits boost to expire on Nov. 1, and Republicans are pushing for far steeper cuts to the $80 billion program.

The average monthly decrease for a one-person household is $11. That doesn’t sound like much, but the vast majority of food stamp recipients say the assistance runs out in the first three weeks of each month, leaving them to cobble together food from other sources in the final week. The cuts amount to 16 meals a month for the average family of three, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department’s Thrifty Food Plan.

“Even though it might sound little, for some people that’s a couple of meals that they have to choose whether they eat or don’t eat,” said Bobbie Sackman, the director of public policy at the Council of Senior Centers and Services in New York City, which helps elderly people sign up for assistance. “They have to go elsewhere to find food or they’re not going to have food.”

People can turn to food pantries for additional assistance. But it’s harder for older and disabled people to fill in the gaps left by the food stamp program, since going in-person to various soup kitchens and food pantries is not an option for many of them. About 9 percent of all food stamps go to households that include senior citizens. In New York, which has a large elderly population, it’s double that.

Marc Wolfson, a disabled 62 year-old who lives in Brooklyn, spent his Tuesday afternoon calling around to various food pantries to see if any of them would deliver meals to his apartment.

One food pantry, called “God’s Love We Deliver,” told him they could drop off groceries at his apartment, but only on days when Wolfson is undergoing dialysis for his kidney disease. So the pantry had to turn him down. “They ain’t delivering it to me,” Wolfson joked.

Story continues

Wolfson has diabetes and anemia, so his diet must be low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in iron-rich foods like red meat. The first two weeks, Wolfson can manage that diet on food stamps, but then the money runs out. “The doctors want me to eat all protein,” he said. “The last two weeks the only protein I’m getting is eggs.”

Nationally, one in seven seniors lives in poverty, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. In New York City, as many as one in three elderly people are poor. As many as half of elderly people who qualify for food stamps in New York do not apply, and surveys have shown that older Americans in particular feel there is a stigma associated with the program.

Sackman said the elderly, who are often living on fixed incomes, can become “invisible” in these debates, which often focuses on why young and healthy people need assistance.

House Republicans hope to cut the $80 billion annual program further, by kicking off 3 million people each year for 10 years. Under their plan, adults without minor children must enroll in a job training program or be employed to receive the benefits. The AARP, the powerful seniors group, opposes the proposal.

“We’re really worried,” Sackman said of the proposed cuts. “This is just the start. We’re looking at a rapidly growing senior population here and across the country and a lot of poverty.”

Wolfson said he tries not to worry about whether steeper cuts could be in the pipeline. In the meantime, he plans to scour the grocery store for sales to make up for the $11 less he gets per month.

“I’ll deal with it as it’s happening,” he said. “I’m not going to dwell on it.”"

Samuelson', 'Former Columnist Focusing On Economics', 'December', 'Robert J. Samuelson Wrote A Twice-Weekly Column On Economics. He Retired In September']",Robert Samuelson: The luxury of muddling through,"The budget package crafted by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray and Republican Rep. Paul Ryan — heads of the Senate and House Budget Committees — recalls political scientist Charles E. Lindblom’s famous 1959 essay, “The Science of ‘Muddling Through.’” Wrote Lindblom: “Democracies change their policies almost entirely through incremental adjustments. Policy does not move in leaps and bounds.” People stick with what they know. Transformational (“non-incremental”) changes are usually “politically impossible” and, when they’re not, are “unpredictable in their consequences.”

More than a half-century later, Lindblom’s insights endure. Just look around. Obamacare demonstrates the perils of transformational policies — heir unpredictability. And the Murray-Ryan accord is a triumph of incrementalism, a.k.a. “muddling through.” Okay, let’s acknowledge their accomplishment. The agreement beats the alternative, which might be another senseless government “shutdown” (actually, only a partial shutdown). But the price of peace is doing almost nothing about our long-term budget problems.

Recall: The central issue is the mismatch between government’s spending promises and its willingness to tax. Although the Great Recession hurt, it’s not the crux of the matter. From 1973 to 2012, the budget was in surplus only four years. During this period, spending averaged 21 percent of the economy (gross domestic product) and taxes averaged 18 percent. Retiring baby boomers are now raising Social Security and Medicare spending and — if nothing is done — deficits.

But do what? Democrats won’t cut retiree benefits; Republicans reject tax increases. The rest of the budget (the 36 percent that includes defense and “discretionary” programs such as the FBI, school lunches and environmental regulation) has borne most cuts. In 2011, the Budget Control Act reduced this spending by imposing annual caps. When Congress couldn’t agree on further changes, it triggered “sequestration”: automatic cuts to the same spending.

Now Congress can’t stomach sequestration. Republicans worry that the military is being savaged. Training has been cut, weapons purchases delayed, force sizes reduced. By 2021, American fighting forces may shrink by about 25 percent from 2012 levels, estimates the Bipartisan Policy Center. Democrats fear that domestic programs are being gutted. A report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, lists some concerns: fewer meat inspectors and forest firefighters; less spending on Head Start and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Murray-Ryan plan aims to relieve this sequestration misery. It does this by increasing authorized spending by $45 billion in 2014 and $18 billion in 2015, split between defense and non- defense programs. To pay for the increases, the plan would, among other things: lower pension benefits for federal workers and military retirees; raise fees for airport security and premiums for federal pension guarantees; and reduce payments to states from mineral leasing.

There’s no pretense of dealing with the underlying mismatch between taxes and spending. In 2014 and 2015, budget deficits increase slightly (a good thing, say some economists). The claim that the package would provide a small amount of deficit reduction over a decade is dubious; most of the reduction occurs in 2022 and 2023 and reflects assumptions that can be instantly reversed. The broader message is that annual deficits would continue indefinitely; “the current [upward] trajectory of the debt” would not change, says the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

All this is in the best tradition of muddling. Hardly anyone wants to confront truly difficult questions. How big a government do we want? What groups or causes deserve help? Which don’t? How high can taxes go without harming the economy? For decades, Congress and presidents have dodged these and other hard issues through chronic and expedient deficits. Rhetoric aside, they’re staying with what they know, as Lindblom foretold.

But there’s a problem. Lindblom’s common-sense insight has a giant exception: crises. Change, forced by outside events, then happens by “leaps and bounds.” The recent financial crisis caused Congress and two presidents to embrace measures (the rescue of big banks, General Motors and Chrysler) that were unthinkable a few months earlier. In the 1960s, civil rights demonstrations pushed Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that, in outlawing most public racial discrimination, wasn’t “incremental.” History offers other examples, including the Civil War, the New Deal and both World Wars. Small changes won’t suffice when big changes are required.

On the budget, muddling through comes with a crucial assumption. It is that continuous deficits won’t provoke a crisis that compels political leaders to take harsh steps that they would otherwise not take. This optimism may be justified. For decades, “experts” have warned of the dire consequences of unchecked deficits. Yet no great crisis has occurred. But this conviction also could be complacency. Government debt is in territory that, except for wartime debt, is unprecedented. We don’t know the consequences. Someday, we may no longer have the luxury of muddling through.

Paul Ryan, center, arrives for the presidential inauguration on Jan. 21. On Wednesday, the budget committee chairman said that Republicans will insist that automatic spending cuts take effect March 1 unless other cuts are adopted. (POOL/REUTERS)

As House Republicans prepared to vote Wednesday on a plan to suspend the debt limit, Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan made clear that the party is in no way abandoning its uncompromising approach to the budget battle with President Obama.

Republicans will insist that automatic spending cuts take effect March 1 unless other cuts are adopted, Ryan said. They may force a shutdown of the government on March 27 unless Democrats agree to additional cuts. And they will demand that any future increase in the debt limit – likely to be necessary this summer if the measure to suspend the current debt limit is adopted -- be paired dollar-for-dollar with spending cuts or other reforms.

“We have a sequester kicking in on March 1, a continuing resolution [on the budget] expiring on March the 27. We have budgets that, if the Senate decides to do its job this year, will come out in April,” Ryan said Wednesday at a breakfast with reporters. “These are the kind of points we think force the kind of conversation we think we have to have.”

When a reporter asked why Republicans would consider shutting down the government when the brinksmanship of the past two years has put the congressional approval rating in the teens, Ryan shot back: “So, we don’t have much to lose, do we? This is not about politics and what makes us popular. This is about what is the right thing to do.”

The breakfast, hosted by the Wall Street Journal, marked just the second time the Wisconsin Republican has met with reporters since he and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost their bid for the White House in November. Wednesday’s far-ranging session covered topics ranging from Ryan’s hopes for immigration reform to his disappointment with his seating assignment on Inauguration Day – which left him in the bleachers with other lawmakers instead of standing up front in Vice President Biden’s spot.

President Obama said in a Jan. 14 White House press conference that he won’t negotiate with Republicans on the federal debt ceiling. Post economic policy reporter Zachary Goldfarb stops by to explain which bills the government will and will not pay if the debt ceiling isn’t raised. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

“I was about eight rows behind” where he had hoped to be, Ryan joked.

On gun control, Ryan tacitly chastised the National Rifle Association for a much-maligned TV ad focused on the president’s daughters.

“Our kids are out of bounds,” Ryan said. “The Obama campaign [and] the national media respected that of my family, and we’re grateful for that. Our kids ought to be out of bounds.”

But for more than an hour at the Mayflower hotel downtown, the questions focused primarily on strategy in the coming year, when Republicans say they hope to force Obama and other Democrats to agree to even sharper cuts in government spending and to tackle a wholesale overhaul of federal health programs.

The bill under consideration in the House Wednesday would suspend the nation’s borrowing limit until May 18 to give each chamber of Congress breathing room to adopt a budget blueprint. Ryan, who will again draft the GOP budget, said he would eliminate deficits within the next decade, although he offered no guidance on how his plan would meet that goal. His past budget proposals took nearly 30 years to achieve balance, even after slashing Medicaid and social safety net programs, which is completely unacceptable to Democrats.

(On Wednesday, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that panel would draft the first Senate budget proposal in four years.)

On another sticking point between the two parties, Ryan said Republicans would not consider additional tax revenue to close record budget deficits, as Democrats prefer. The “fiscal cliff” deal approved earlier this month would generate about $650 billion over the next decade, and that, Ryan said, is enough.

“They got their revenue increases already. We have yet to get anything as a result of it,” Ryan said. Reminded that Obama approved more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade as part of the last debt-limit fight in 2011, Ryan said: “That was last session. We’re going forward now.”

Ryan also said House Republicans will push for an overhaul of the tax code that trims rates and eliminates loopholes and deductions – including, perhaps, the preferential treatment of investment income.

“I think that debate ought to be open with respect to tax reform,” Ryan said. Although profits from capital gains and dividends have been taxed at lower rates than earned income for two decades, Ryan said it would be less important to preserve that difference “if your rates [on wages and salaries] are getting low enough.”

The preferential treatment of investment income amounts to the biggest break in the tax code for the ultra-wealthy and has been a cornerstone of GOP tax policy. But it caused problems last year for Romney’s presidential campaign when he revealed that he paid only about 13 percent of his income in taxes because his earnings came primarily from capital gains and dividends.

While a concession on investment income would likely be welcomed by Democrats, Obama has said he would insist that any new deficit-reduction package be balanced between spending cuts and fresh tax revenues. Asked where he sees ground for compromise, Ryan argued that reforming Social Security and Medicare over the long term is “the sweet spot in all this.”

“Changes that don’t offend either parties’ philosophy or ideology, I think,” Ryan said, “is where hopefully this ends up going.”"

As Reid rightly pointed out, ""The Republicans were in power—there were more of them."" To be sure, Democrats were trying to score political points at President Bush's expense. But there were no threats, no filibusters and no risk to the full faith and credit of the United States.

Which is what makes the GOP's hostage-taking so unique. Whether motivated by opposition to larger spending or tax legislation, or as a symbolic vote to embarrass the president and his Congressional majority (as Sens. Obama and Reid did in 2006), the 40 debt ceiling increases since 1980 have rarely been unanimous. But never before has the threat to block a debt limit increase been coupled with one party's intent and ability to actually do it. After all, while Republican Speaker John Boehner has the numbers to deny a debt ceiling increase in the House, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell can prevent it from even coming to a vote. Of course, when George W. Bush sat in the Oval Office, GOP leaders including Boehner, McConnell, Paul Ryan, Eric Cantor and John Cornyn didn't just vote for seven increases in the debt ceiling. In November 2004, they all voted for the very kind of ""clean"" debt ceiling bill they refuse to offer President Obama now.

After having increases the national debt by 40 percent since his inauguration in January 2001, President George W. Bush in October 2004 called for his fourth hike in the nation's borrowing authority. His Treasury Secretary John Snow warned, ""Given current projections, it is imperative that the Congress take action to increase the debt limit by mid-November,"" adding that his arsenal of fiscal tools, including tapping money intended for the civil service retirement fund, ""will be exhausted.""

But as the New York Times explained on November 17, 2004, Bush had to wait for his debt ceiling increase for a very simple reason:



Though an increase in the debt ceiling was never in doubt, Republican leaders in both houses of Congress postponed action on it last month, until after the elections, to deprive Democrats of a chance to accuse them of fiscal irresponsibility.

With his reelection safely secured, Republicans delivered Bush's debt ceiling increase in a stand-alone bill, with no conditions, no threats and no poison pills. By 52-44 in the Senate and 208-204 in the House, Republicans led Sen. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) boosted the borrowing limit from $7.4 trillion to $8.2 trillion. Over 100 current Republican members of Congress voted ""aye."" Among them were the today's top two Senate Republicans (Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn) and the entire House leadership team (Boehner, Eric Cantor and Paul Ryan).

And just why did President Bush and his allies insist that 11 percent increase was needed?



Administration officials contend that the annual deficits are undesirable but necessary to help stimulate an economic recovery and fight a global war on terrorism.

""We have an obligation to keep the government in operation.""

""Let me tell you what's involved if we don't lift the debt ceiling: financial collapse and calamity throughout the world. That's not lost upon me. But we've done this 93 times. And if we keep doing the same old thing, then that is insanity to the nth degree.""

As Speaker Hastert's spokesman John Feehery put it just before the House vote:In their rare moments of candor, Republican leaders acknowledge as much . Failure to raise the debt limit, Speaker John Boehner cautioned in January 2011, ""would be a financial disaster, not only for our country but for the worldwide economy."" Paul Ryan, whose 2012 House GOP budget would add $6 trillion in new red ink over the next decade, agreed that ""you can't not raise the debt ceiling."" Lindsey Graham, who has repeatedly demanded Obama ""man up"" on spending cuts, explained why:Apparently, that ""same old thing"" doesn't apply when a Republican is sitting in the Oval Office. It's not just that Ronald Reagan presided over 17 debt limit hikes and a tripling of the national debt during his eight years in the White House or that President George W. Bush nearly doubled it again. The end-of-decade $5.6 trillion surplus forecast by the Congressional Budget Office in 2000 was more than eviscerated by two unfunded wars, two rounds of Bush tax cuts, the unpaid-for Medicare prescription drug benefit and the TARP bank bailout. To accommodate those ""spend and not tax"" policies, Bush and his GOP allies in Congress voted seven times to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. (That vote tally included a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase in 2004, backed by 98 current House Republicans and 31 sitting GOP senators.) And as it turns out, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) voted for all of it.

During the GOP's first debt ceiling hostage-taking in the summer of 2011, U.S. consumer confidence plunged and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost while Uncle Sam racked up almost $2 billion in unnecessary interest payments. As for the uncertainty and credit rating downgrade the debt ceiling debacle produced, S&P pointed the finger at the GOP, the only party willing to countenance a default by the United States:



A Standard & Poor's director said for the first time Thursday that one reason the United States lost its triple-A credit rating was that several lawmakers expressed skepticism about the serious consequences of a credit default -- a position put forth by some Republicans. Without specifically mentioning Republicans, S&P senior director Joydeep Mukherji said the stability and effectiveness of American political institutions were undermined by the fact that ""people in the political arena were even talking about a potential default,"" Mukherji said. ""That a country even has such voices, albeit a minority, is something notable,"" he added. ""This kind of rhetoric is not common amongst AAA sovereigns.""

That's exactly right. That kind of rhetoric is not common amongst AAA sovereigns and unheard of among Democrats. But among Republican leaders, holding the American economy hostage is just another day at the office. After his first round of debt limit extortion, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell boasted in August 2011:



""I think some of our members may have thought the default issue was a hostage you might take a chance at shooting,"" he said. ""Most of us didn't think that. What we did learn is this -- it's a hostage that's worth ransoming. And it focuses the Congress on something that must be done.""

""What we have done, Larry, also is set a new template. In the future, any president, this one or another one, when they request us to raise the debt ceiling, it will not be clean anymore. This is just the first step. This, we anticipate, will take us into 2013. Whoever the new president is, is probably going to be asking us to raise the debt ceiling again. Then we will go through the process again and see what we can continue to achieve in connection with these debt ceiling requests of presidents to get our financial house in order.""

And as he later explained to CNBC's Larry Kudlow, McConnell's future hostage-taking isn't a threat, but a promise:A new template, indeed. Because while the minority party in Congress has often voted against debt ceiling increases, it never had the either the numbers or the intent to blackmail the president. Until, that is, Democrat Barack Obama entered the Oval Office."

They already caved in the last go around, and in so doing, showed that they aren’t really willing to let the country go into default — meaning it will be hard for them to convincingly suggest they’re willing to do that this time. And the business community will again go into hyper-drive against any such move. The question remains, though, whether conservatives will pressure the House GOP leadership to provoke another standoff around the debt ceiling and to demand more spending cuts — such as to entitlements, which are mostly exempt from the sequester — in exchange for any hike. And here, you have to hope that John Boehner will be able to tamp down any desire for further confrontation by pointing out that Republicans are already getting deep spending cuts with the sequester. But this is hardly assured."

Like all mysteries, this one has a cast of characters. They aren’t actors, but many of them are acting. That makes this such a morass.

The department’s Web site shows 40 percent of positions on the DHS’s leadership list are filled by “acting” officials or are vacant — including the top four slots.

“This means nearly half of the top positions at the third-largest department in the U.S. government are not filled,” House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) told a hearing. “[P]ut more simply, who is in charge?”

“While DHS has thousands of dedicated career employees, it is suffering from a void of leadership,” he added.

That should begin to change now that the Senate confirmed Jeh Johnson as DHS secretary Monday. The deputy secretary job probably will be filled soon, too. Johnson knows the mess he’s getting into. At his confirmation hearing, he said the DHS leadership vacancies are “of alarming proportions.”

“Acting” officials, some talented, can get the basic job done. But their temporary status puts them at an inherent disadvantage. If they are caretakers who don’t want or don’t expect to get the job they are temporarily filling, they are unlikely to provide the imaginative leadership agencies need. If they want the gig, they have to be careful about appearing too presumptuous, again leading to uninspired leadership. Either way, employee morale can suffer.

“And while Acting Secretary (Rand) Beers and other acting executives have worked diligently in recent months,” Tom Ridge, the first DHS secretary told the committee, “you simply cannot build nor can you sustain a mission-focused culture with a high number vacancies and leaders in non-permanent status.”

DHS lacks a “sense of urgency,” he said, and that “undermines mission and morale.”

The complex history of the department often is cited as a reason for its poor showing. When DHS, now with 240,000 employees, was organized in 2003 “we were working to create a unique and unified department culture out of 22 agencies . . . a daunting challenge,” Ridge said. “This has remained a challenge in the department’s first decade.”

Curiously, the acting DHS leaders were not invited to testify at the hearing. In a statement to The Washington Post, DHS said: “The Department’s employees are our greatest resource and we are committed to providing them with the resources and support they need to carry out our mission to protect the homeland. . . . We are focused on continuing to improve employee engagement through enhanced communication and training, employee recognition and strengthening the skills of employees at every level.”

Colleen M. Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, agrees DHS morale has been undermined, but she thinks leadership vacancies are not the main reason. In testimony to the committee, she said “a significant cause of low morale” at DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is “ongoing staffing shortages.”

While “management deficiencies . . . do contribute to low morale among federal workers,” Kelley said she “believes that government-wide morale problems can be traced directly to the three-year pay freeze, the continuing impact of sequestration and the furloughs it spawned, and the 16-day government shutdown.”

But those things hit feds across the board. They don’t explain the department’s repeated residency near or at the bottom in federal employee surveys. It ranked at the bottom of 19 large agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s 2012 Best Places to Work in the Federal Government.

In the Office of Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, DHS was 36 of 37 agencies in the leadership/knowledge management and job satisfaction categories, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Last year, GAO recommended that DHS “take action to better determine the root cause of low employee morale.” In a report to the committee, GAO said: “DHS has actions underway . . . but DHS has not fully implemented them.”

One such action, “directing component human capital officials to reevaluate their action plans to ensure that metrics of success are clear and measurable,” itself sounds like a bureaucratic morale buster.

There is at least one good sign — the vacancy rate for DHS senior executives has declined significantly since 2006, when it was 25 percent. It had dropped to 10 percent by the end of fiscal year 2011.

Yet, why DHS continues to be a bottom-feeder remains a mystery.

Said GAO: “We concluded that the gap between DHS and government-wide scores may be explained by factors unique to DHS, such as management practices and the nature of the agency’s work, or by differences among employees we could not analyze.”

As the clock ticks toward those mandatory budget cuts that could arrive on March 1, those listening to the news would think an asteroid is about to hit planet Earth.

Our Defense Department tells us our Defense Department can’t be cut or the world will end.

Our national parks were created to preserve nature, undisturbed by man. Now we are told that if we leave nature untouched, it will perish. When did the essential ingredients of biological existence become oxygen, water, sunlight and federal funding? Apparently, the Grand Canyon will cease to be a hole in the ground if the National Park Service loses a few cents of every dollar it has been given.

But let’s set aside the indispensability of man to nature, for a moment, to concentrate on a conflict of interest.

Why would we expect any public servant to tell us his or her work is suddenly less vital to our nation? Do we believe any government agency would confess that it could do with a single tax dollar less?

Opinion: Forced cuts a disaster for military

Even if the federal government tapped into Solomon’s Mines, awash with riches, would they say, “We were preparing to set our extra cash on fire but thank heavens you are here and have some use for it! Please cut our budget!” Even then, we know, Washington could not imagine itself less important or in need.

So why are we allowing ourselves to be blackmailed with our own money by those we’ve employed to serve us?

Washington is throwing a tantrum. It is threatening to hold its breath until it turns blue unless it gets what it wants. Washington is a study in juvenile petulance. If at any time it has demonstrated a childish need for discipline, this moment is it.

The American people have learned to do with less in the past six years. Less after they pay higher taxes. Less after they pay more for gas. Less after they lose their jobs or portion out smaller paychecks. Less after their homes shrink into debt. Less after their businesses fail.

But there is another economy, distant from theirs. And it is growing. Washington’s economy has learned to do with more.

Under Republican and Democratic presidents, the federal budget has grown by $1.7 trillion dollars over the past decade. Washington now has the third largest concentration of high-income households of any metropolitan area in America. A little over a year ago, Washington surpassed Silicon Valley for the highest average income in the country.

Opinion: Plenty to cut at Pentagon

Today, it is Washington’s elites, not just Wall Street’s, who make news flying to golf vacations in Florida and skiing trips in Aspen, enjoying haute cuisine at Washington’s tony Minibar. During his tenure at Citigroup from 2006 to 2008, our new treasury secretary, Jack Lew, took a nearly $1 million bonus a day before the company took a taxpayer-funded bailout. He also invested $56,000 in a fund, headquartered in a Cayman Islands building, that Obama once called “the largest tax scam in the world.”

Horace Greeley might urge, “Go east, young man.” There is gold in Washington’s hills.

What might a real leader, a president, do at this point?

He might say, “Under these difficult circumstances, let’s ask government to tighten its belt 2%, since Americans have had to tighten theirs. Let’s remember whom we are here to serve. Let’s lead by example, do our jobs more efficiently and make these cuts as painless as possible.”

We hear nothing like that from this White House.

Instead, Barack Obama directs his lieutenants to echo his threats against the people who pay their salaries. Unless Congress expands the instruments of redistribution he finds necessary to ensure his dream of equality, he promises that the sequester deal it agreed to in 2011 will rain down in “harsh, arbitrary cuts” that would “devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research … slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.”

These words come from our own president. As Bob Woodward reports, Obama originated this particular bit of Washington lunacy now known as the sequester but the blame for this mess can be laid at Republican and Democratic feet.

Both parties agreed to this contemptible game where Washington holds a gun to America’s head as they dare each other to pull the trigger. And we, the American people, permit it. What won’t we tolerate if we sheepishly allow this?

We should mark this moment, when tantrums became threats and our leaders surrendered the pretense they were serving us.

Then let’s sing, “Washington, the Beautiful” because whatever America once was, Washington is.

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']",Delay of employer mandate only latest snag in implementing ObamaCare,"The Obama administration delaying the start of the employer mandate part of ObamaCare this week is not the first snag in implementing the president’s signature health care law.

Other parts of the 2010 law have already been delayed or discarded, including a requirement that businesses fill out an IRS form for any purchases over a year exceeding $600. Congress repealed that in June 2011.

“It was extremely onerous (and) raised very little revenue,” says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and chief economic policy adviser to Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign.

Amanda Austin, a public policy director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, compared the IRS 1099 requirement to the employer mandate, which required many small and medium-sized businesses to provide employee health insurance or face paying penalties.

She argued both came with “tons” of “extremely complicated” paperwork and that the changes were in large part the result of business uproar.

“I think you heard a lot from businesses, really an outcry of why are we doing this,” she said about the IRS requirement. “And down the road obviously we got the provision repealed.”

The administration acknowledged as much in the surprise announcement Tuesday that the start of the employee mandate would be delayed from 2014, when much of the law is scheduled to take effect, to 2015.

“We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,” said Mark J. Mazur, a Treasury Department assistant secretary.

Holtz-Eakin and others also point out the administration also had to scrap the so-called CLASS Act section of ObamaCare that offered federally-subsidized insurance for long-term health care because the legislation stated the premiums had to cover the cost.

Holtz-Eakin called the plan “unworkable.”

Two other parts of the law, officially known as the Affordable Care Act, also have either been delayed or scuttled.

Earlier this year, the administration delayed until 2015 the start of a managed-care option inserted into ObamaCare by Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, who then accused officials of dragging their feet to avoid lower cost competition.

“Our read of the statute is that you're supposed to do it in 2014 and not spend your time luring people into the exchange,” Cantwell said in April on Capitol Hill. “Is there a bias somewhere in the administration against lower-cost, managed-care delivery systems?”

The administration has also delayed the start of an ObamaCare provision known as SHOP – an insurance exchange that gives small business a range of choices.

Now those businesses have only one plan, contrary to Obama’s vow that the law would provide a range of options.

“I think the bottom line is that the law is very convoluted, very complicated and is bad policy,” said Katie Mahoney, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s executive director of health care policy.

Neil Trauntwein, an employee-benefits lawyer for the National Retail Federation, says the delays have at least allowed business leaders to return to Capitol Hill to discuss such issues as whether the cutoff for the employer mandate should less than 50 full-time employees and if a 30-hour week is the best definition of a full-time worker."

Mrs. Clinton does not make her speechmaking schedule public, but the trade groups typically publicize the events. A spokesman for the former first lady declined to comment.

But her political rivals have already started to keep tabs on her speaking schedule, looking for any hint of a conflict of interest. (So far, Mrs. Clinton’s staff appears to have carefully chosen where she has given speeches, avoiding paid talks to potentially controversial groups.)

“We’re starting immediately to monitor both Hillary and the other Democratic rising stars and collect, tag and characterize their speeches so we can hold them accountable when the campaign begins in earnest,” said Tim Miller, the executive director of America Rising, a conservative political action committee.

Mr. Miller said that it was too early to send operatives to covertly buy tickets to Mrs. Clinton’s speeches, but that the group was watching from a distance “to monitor whether she’s hobnobbing with investment bankers in New York City that might seem like favoritism down the line.”

Since Mrs. Clinton stepped down as secretary of state, she has divided her time between writing a memoir and juggling a growing schedule of engagements, paid and unpaid. The unpaid appearances are typically focused on her advocacy work for women and girls as part of the Clinton Foundation, the charitable organization founded by her husband.

A recent study said the United States is the only advanced economy that does not require paid vacation days or holidays.

The report, released Friday by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, revisited a 2007 study that compared the U.S. with nearly two dozen other countries and also found it to be the only nation that does not require paid vacation or holidays.

The recession-battered U.S. has not closed the gap since 2007, the center’s researchers said, and few companies have boosted employee benefits even as the economy has recovered.

“Relying on businesses to voluntarily provide paid leave just hasn’t worked,” said John Schmitt, senior economist and co-author of the report.

The study’s authors reported that a number of European countries guarantee their workers at least 20 paid vacation days per year. Some countries, such as Norway and France, legally require as many as 30 paid vacation days.

Canada and Japan guarantee at least 10 paid vacation days per year.

The report also tallied the average number of paid vacation and holidays provided to American workers in the private sector. The total -- 16 -- would not meet the minimum required by law in 19 countries.

The lack of paid time off is most acute for low-wage workers and employees working for small businesses, according to the report, which found that 49% of low-wage workers have paid vacation, compared with 90% of higher-wage workers.

Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) has introduced a bill that would require employers to provide one week of paid vacation annually. The bill, which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act, has most recently been referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.

Pew/Stateline Staff Writer

Some states are already embracing deep cuts to the food stamp program similar to those passed by House Republicans in Washington, ending the food subsidy for tens of thousands of low-income Americans regardless of what Congress does.

Spurred by the ballooning cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the GOP-dominated House voted Thursday 217-210 to cut $39 billion in the food assistance program over 10 years. Among the changes: Ending waivers for states that during the recession allowed as many as 4 million people to collect food stamps who otherwise would not have qualified.

The fate of the congressional legislation is uncertain. The Senate approved much smaller reductions, and the White House threatened to veto any large cuts to food stamps.

But in six states—Delaware, Kansas, New Hampshire, Utah, Vermont and Wyoming—similar reductions are already in place, or soon will be. Two more states will join them once their waivers expire, potentially taking away food stamps from tens of thousands of current recipients.

Republicans blame the program's ever-increasing rolls and cost on lax enrollment criteria rather than real need. Since before the recession, the price tag for food stamps has more than doubled, topping $82.5 billion in fiscal year 2013. Enrollment hit record highs, with 15 percent of Americans now collecting benefits. Many states have more than 20 percent of their population enrolled.

Costs have continued to spike as well, as Washington pays for the benefits and states administer them. A new Congressional Research Service report released this month showed fiscal year 2012 was the 12th year in a row a new historical high was reached for federal food and nutrition programs, the vast majority of which is food stamps. Since fiscal year 2000, the report said, spending on federal food assistance has more than tripled.

Put in a different context, the U.S. Census Bureau said food stamps lifted 4 million Americans out of poverty last year if the benefits were counted as income.

What states are doing

Kansas is the latest to embrace the cuts, ending a federal waiver on Oct. 1 that allows unemployed, non-elderly and able-bodied adults without children to remain on food stamps despite failing to meet certain work requirements. The change is expected to affect 20,000 Kansans. Wisconsin will let its waiver expire in July 2014, and Oklahoma will also let its waiver at the end of this month; 71,000 and 47,000 people, respectively, received benefits through the waiver in 2011, the latest year for which data is available.

The waivers, part of the 1996 welfare reform, were designed to give states flexibility in times of high unemployment. It suspends a requirement that limits benefits to three months unless recipients work 20 hours a week or spend a certain amount of time on work-related activities, such as job training.

Until this year, 45 states took advantage of the waiver during the recession, and two that did not – Vermont and New Hampshire – weren't eligible for statewide coverage, which is based on unemployment and job market data. Delaware and Utah chose not to request a waiver, while Wyoming wasn't eligible.

Many Republican-led states are trimming safety nets as the recession wanes. In addition, food stamp benefits for all recipients are set to fall Nov. 1 when federal stimulus money ends. Some states have changed welfare enrollment criteria. Others enacted unprecedented cuts in unemployment insurance, as Stateline previously reported.

Against that backdrop, supporters of the cuts see the work requirement as a prime opportunity to trim the rolls. Those possibly affected by ending the waivers comprise less than 5 percent of Americans collecting food stamps.

Republicans see the improving economy as a sign enrollment should be dropping anyway, with cuts to benefits a good way to push some people back into the labor market. Kansas made its case clear, calling the policy ""an effort to encourage employment over welfare dependency.""

""Employment is the most effective way to escape poverty,"" Kansas Department of Children and Families Secretary Phyllis Gilmore said in a statement announcing the move.

Those who support ending the waivers also promise robust job placement and training programs to help those affected meet work requirements, which could allow them to keep their benefits. Wisconsin, for example, is spending an additional $33 million on those efforts as its waiver expires.

Are cuts premature?

Others say the cuts are premature in the face of a weak job market— 11 states and the District of Columbia have unemployment rates measurably higher than the national 7.3 percent jobless rate. The waivers are designed to end once employment improves. Ending them sooner could strip flexibility to deal with lingering joblessness, which is expected to remain above normal for years.

""It's hard to imagine any state would want to lose the flexibility to use waivers to tailor the policy to meet local conditions,"" said Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Rosenbaum added that the work-requirement policy can have ""harsh effects on very poor individuals.""

Underlying the debate is the question of whether policies enacted during the recession have increased enrollment levels beyond actual need. Critics cite the outsized growth of food stamps compared with other safety net programs during the recession.

Projections paint a bleak picture. The Congressional Budget Office estimates more than 43 million will collect food stamp benefits in 2017, just 4 million fewer than today. By 2022, the CBO estimates enrollment will be 9 million more than pre-recession levels and total spending will be nearly $73 billion—more than double than it was in 2007.

IRS targeted conservatives, despite spike in applications from labor groups","While IRS officials attributed the agency's heavy scrutiny on conservative groups to the spike in applications over the past few years, fresh reports and figures are raising questions about whether the agency knowingly applied a double standard.

A highly anticipated watchdog report, released late Tuesday by the inspector general's office, depicted an even bigger spike in applications for tax-exempt status from a type of group that includes labor organizations. Yet, according to the report, the conservative groups were the ones singled out for special treatment.

This special treatment included the agency creating a unique ""be on the lookout"" list. The list covered ""political-sounding"" names like Tea Party, Patriots, and 9/12. The criteria, labeled by the report as ""inappropriate,"" later expanded to include groups focused on government spending, government debt, taxes and other areas.

The IRS has explained that low-level staffers at an Ohio office were effectively scrambling to deal with an influx in applications from these groups, for tax-exempt status known in the IRS code as 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4).

But around the same time, there was another influx of cases under a classification known as 501(c)(5). This is the tax-exempt status that applies to labor organizations, as well as agricultural and horticultural groups.

More On This...

While the number of applications from these groups was not as high as the number from the other two categories, the increase in applications in both 2011 and 2012 was far more pronounced. The number increased by 41 percent in 2011, and then by a whopping 164 percent in 2012.

By comparison, the number of 501(c)(4) cases rose 30 percent, and then 48 percent in that time period. The IG report said the numbers could not be independently verified.

Conservatives have claimed since Friday, when Exempt Organizations Division chief Lois Lerner first admitted to the practice, that the selective scrutiny was politically motivated. Further, they've alleged that it may have gone well beyond the Ohio office.

""It's hard for me to imagine that this is just a bunch of low-ranking apparatchiks,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told Fox News on Wednesday, complaining about what he called ""selective"" treatment of these organizations by the IRS.

The IRS, in a statement released after the IG report was made public, acknowledged that its original approach for handling the ""influx"" of applications was ""inappropriate.""

However, the agency explained it is required to ensure tax-exempt groups are engaging in ""legally permissible political activity.""

""Centralizing these cases was necessary to achieve consistent treatment. After seeing issues with particular cases, inappropriate shortcuts were used to determine which cases may be engaging in political activities. It is important to note that the vast majority of these cases would still have been centralized based on the general criteria used for other cases,"" the IRS said.

But other news reports underscored the difference in the agency's treatment of various politically tinged groups. USA Today reported that during the two-year period when Tea Party applications were being held up, the IRS approved roughly a dozen applications from liberal and progressive groups.

The groups included those with words like ""progress"" or ""progressive"" in their names, and reportedly were engaged in the same types of activities as those organizations whose applications were held up.

The Daily Caller also reported that Lerner in 2011 approved an application for the charity run by Obama's half brother -- the Barack H. Obama Foundation.

While some Tea Party applications sat at the IRS office for years, the charity's application was approved within a month."

In a stunning admission, Obama reportedly told Boehner, “We don’t have a spending problem.”

Boehner added that President Obama continues to maintain that America’s federal deficit is caused not by governmental overspending but by “a health-care problem.” Said Boehner, “They blame all of the fiscal woes on our health-care system.” Boehner told Obama, “Clearly we have a health-care problem, which is about to get worse with Obamacare. But, Mr. President, we have a very serious spending problem.” Obama eventually replied, “I’m getting tired of hearing you say that.”

Obama may be tired of hearing Boehner talk about a spending problem, particularly when Obama has been re-elected on the basis of ignoring government spending. Nonetheless, America does have a spending problem, which Obama is steadfastly ignoring. “He’s so ideological himself,” Boehner explained, “and he’s unwilling to take on the left of his own party.” That’s why Obama refused to raise the retirement age for Medicare after agreeing to it. “He admitted in meetings that he couldn’t sell things to his own members,” said Boehner. “But he didn’t even want to try … We could never get him to step up.”

Boehner says that there will be no new tax increases over the debt ceiling. “The tax issue is resolved,” he said. And he said that more closed-door negotiations with Obama would be “futile.” It’s a bit too late to recognize that, but better late than never.

Obama need not negotiate on spending. He can just continue to bully Republicans by suggesting that they are the party of the rich – and his media lackeys can pretend that it’s fiscally irresponsible to ask the government to live within its means.

The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

Final passage of the $85-billion package, however, remains uncertain because of rising opposition from tea party lawmakers and influential conservative groups. A House vote, expected this week, will once again test the ability of Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to hold together enough Republicans to pass the compromise with support of the chamber’s Democratic minority.

The two-year deal, negotiated by the GOP’s budget point man, Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and his counterpart in the Senate, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, delivered a rare bipartisan budget agreement after two years of financial brinkmanship in Washington.

“Because of this deal, the budget process can now stop lurching from crisis to crisis,” said Murray, chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee.

Ryan, the former Republican vice presidential candidate whose political credibility may rest with his ability to sway his conservative colleagues, praised the agreement because it will further reduce the federal deficit by $23 billion and contains no new tax increases.

“I see this agreement as a step in the right direction,” Ryan said. “In divided government, you don’t always get what you want.”

The last budget standoff culminated in a 16-day shutdown in October, costing the government billions of dollars and driving Americans’ approval of Congress to record lows.

The agreement would undo $63 billion of the automatic “sequester” budget cuts that are set to take place over the next two years, slicing across government agencies and programs, including the Pentagon. Lawmakers from both parties, including defense hawks, are eager to avoid the arbitrary cuts.

But some tea party conservatives would prefer to live with those reductions, however painful, to keep down government spending.

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, like Ryan a potential GOP presidential contender in 2016, opposed the deal.

“This budget continues Washington’s irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in,” Rubio said, adding that the American people “deserve better.”

The deal sets 2014 spending at $1.012 trillion, higher than the $967 billion that would have taken effect under the sequester law on Jan. 15, but less than Democrats wanted. The increased spending is paid for with new fees and cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, including reductions in federal employee retirement benefits, cuts to the cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees who are younger than 62 and not injured or disabled, and new fees on airline travel.

The package does not include an extension of unemployment insurance, as President Obama had sought, for an estimated 1 million jobless Americans whose benefits expire after Christmas.

“This agreement doesn’t include everything I’d like — and I know many Republicans feel the same way,” the president said. “That’s the nature of compromise.… The American people should not have to endure the pain of another government shutdown for the next two years.”

But the accord did little to placate leading conservative groups, who attacked the deal even before its details were announced.

“We’re going to hold them accountable if they go back on sequester,” said Tim Phillips, president of the conservative Americans for Prosperity, backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. “The message is simple: Keep your word.”

“There’s a real concern about giving up the sequester,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), saying he would be disinclined to back such a deal. “Republicans know that the one major victory they had was the sequester.”

Ryan was expected to brief his House Republican colleagues Wednesday.

Boehner has faced a similar challenge in the past, when his right flank rejected previous budget deals. If the speaker lost the support of his House Republican majority, he would be forced to rely on Democrats for passage, something he has been reluctant to do because it dilutes his power.

Already, 30 House Republicans have signed a letter in support of the sequester cuts, and GOP aides expect as many as 100 Democratic votes would be needed to secure passage because of likely Republican defections.

But as details of the deal emerged, it was unclear whether Boehner could pick up enough Democratic support. Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the progressive caucus, said he opposed any deal that failed to close corporate tax loopholes.

Jim Dean, chairman of Democracy for America, said Democrats should reject the deal because it failed to include an unemployment insurance extension. “Negotiators have declared ‘War on Christmas,’ and potentially sentenced millions of struggling Americans to a very bleak New Year,” he said.

But another Democrat, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, whose northern Virginia district includes many federal employees, said the cuts to retirement benefits would be a “hold your nose and vote yes” compromise.

In the Senate, where Democrats have the majority, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) would need a handful of Republican votes to overcome an expected tea party-led filibuster. Democrats hold 53 seats, and two independents caucus with them, but 60 votes are required to overcome a filibuster. (The recent filibuster rules change pertained to most nominees, not to legislation.)

Pressure on Republican senators was coming not only from conservative groups, including Heritage Action and FreedomWorks, but from conservative candidates who are challenging incumbents in 2014 primary races.

Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader who is facing a primary attack from the right flank in Kentucky, said Tuesday that the sequester law had been a “success, and I hope we don’t revisit it.”

But Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, said the price of inaction would be higher. “Just doing it is important,’' he said. “If it doesn’t get done, it’s bad news.”

http://news.yahoo.com/irs-apologizes-targeting-conservative-groups-144349480.html,,[],IRS apologizes for targeting conservative groups,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service inappropriately flagged conservative political groups for additional reviews during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax-exempt status, a top IRS official said Friday.

Organizations were singled out because they included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status, said Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups.

In some cases, groups were asked for their list of donors, which violates IRS policy in most cases, she said.

""That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. That's not how we go about selecting cases for further review,"" Lerner said at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Association.

""The IRS would like to apologize for that,"" she added.

Lerner said the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias. After her talk, she told The AP that no high level IRS officials knew about the practice.

Agency officials found out about the practice last year and moved to correct it, the IRS said in a statement. The statement did not specify when officials found out.

About 75 groups were inappropriately targeted. None had their tax-exempt status revoked, Lerner said.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called on the White House to investigate.

""Today's acknowledgement by the Obama administration that the IRS did in fact target conservative groups in the heat of last year's national election is not enough,"" McConnell said. ""I call on the White House to conduct a transparent, government-wide review aimed at assuring the American people that these thuggish practices are not under way at the IRS or elsewhere in the administration against anyone, regardless of their political views.""

Many conservative groups complained during the election that they were being harassed by the IRS. They accused the agency of frustrating their attempts to become tax exempt by sending them lengthy, intrusive questionnaires.

Story continues

The forms, which the groups made available at the time, sought information about group members' political activities, including details of their postings on social networking websites and about family members.

Certain tax-exempt charitable groups can conduct political activities but it cannot be their primary activity.

IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman told Congress in March 2012 that the IRS was not targeting groups based on their political views.

""There's absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens to people"" who apply for tax-exempt status, Shulman told a House Ways and Means subcommittee.

Shulman was appointed by President George W. Bush. His 6-year term ended in November. President Barack Obama has yet to nominate a successor. The agency is now being run by acting Commissioner Steven Miller.

""The Ways and Means Committee has persistently pushed the IRS to explain why it appeared to be unfairly targeting some political groups over others — a charge they repeatedly denied,"" said Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., chairman of the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee.

""The IRS's 'too little too late' response is unacceptable, and I will continue to work to ensure there are protections in place so no American, regardless of political affiliation, has their right to free speech threatened by the IRS,"" Boustany said.

Tea Party groups were livid on Friday.

""I don't think there's any question we were unfairly targeted,"" said Tom Zawistowski, who until recently was president of the Ohio Liberty Coalition, an alliance of tea party groups in the state.

Zawistowski's group was among many conservative organizations that battled the IRS over what they saw as its discriminatory treatment of their effort to gain non-profit status. The group first applied for non-profit status in June 2009, and it was finally granted on Dec. 7, 2012, he said — one month after Election Day.

During the 2012 election, many tea party groups applied for tax-exempt status under section 501 (c) (4) of the federal tax code, which grants tax-exempt status to social welfare groups. Unlike other charitable groups, these organizations are allowed to participate in political activities but their primary activity must be social welfare.

That determination is up to the IRS.

Lerner said the number of groups filing for this tax-exempt status more than doubled from 2010 to 2012, to more than 3,400. To handle the influx, the IRS centralized its review of these applications in an office in Cincinnati.

Lerner said this was done to develop expertise among staffers and consistency in their reviews. As part of the review, staffers look for signs that groups are participating in political activity. If so, IRS agents take a closer look to make sure that politics isn't the group's primary activity, Lerner said.

As part of this process, agents in Cincinnati came up with a list of things to look for in an application. As part of the list, they included the words, ""tea party"" and ""patriot,"" Lerner said.

""It's the line people that did it without talking to managers,"" Lerner. ""They're IRS workers, they're revenue agents.""

In all, about 300 groups were singled out for additional review, Lerner said. Of those, about a quarter were singled out because they had ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" somewhere in their applications.

The IRS statement said that once applications were chosen for review, they all ""received the same, even-handed treatment.""

Lerner said 150 of the cases have been closed and no group had its tax-exempt status revoked, though some withdrew their applications.

""Mistakes were made initially, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan rationale,"" the IRS said in a statement. ""We fixed the situation last year and have made significant progress in moving the centralized cases through our system.""

Marcus S. Owens, who spent a decade leading the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt organizations, said Friday that it made sense that the problem arose among workers in Cincinnati because the agency ""really has delegated a lot of authority"" to local offices to make decisions about handling their workload.

But Tea Party groups weren't buying the idea that the decision to target them was solely the responsibility of low-level IRS workers.

""It is suspicious that the activity of these 'low-level workers' was unknown to IRS leadership at the time it occurred,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots, which describes itself as the nation's largest tea party organization. ""President Obama must also apologize for his administration ignoring repeated complaints by these broad grassroots organizations of harassment by the IRS in 2012, and make concrete and transparent steps today to ensure this never happens again.""

First, he did an end run around his state’s Legislature — controlled by his own party — to proceed with the federally funded expansion of Medicaid that is an important piece of Obamacare. Then, defending his action, he let loose on his political allies, declaring, “I’m concerned about the fact there seems to be a war on the poor. That, if you’re poor, somehow you’re shiftless and lazy.”

Obviously Mr. Kasich isn’t the first to make this observation. But the fact that it’s coming from a Republican in good standing (although maybe not anymore), indeed someone who used to be known as a conservative firebrand, is telling. Republican hostility toward the poor and unfortunate has now reached such a fever pitch that the party doesn’t really stand for anything else — and only willfully blind observers can fail to see that reality.

The big question is why. But, first, let’s talk a bit more about what’s eating the right.

I still sometimes see pundits claiming that the Tea Party movement is basically driven by concerns about budget deficits. That’s delusional. Read the founding rant by Rick Santelli of CNBC: There’s nary a mention of deficits. Instead, it’s a tirade against the possibility that the government might help “losers” avoid foreclosure. Or read transcripts from Rush Limbaugh or other right-wing talk radio hosts. There’s not much about fiscal responsibility, but there’s a lot about how the government is rewarding the lazy and undeserving.

Republicans in leadership positions try to modulate their language a bit, but it’s a matter more of tone than substance. They’re still clearly passionate about making sure that the poor and unlucky get as little help as possible, that — as Representative Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, put it — the safety net is becoming “a hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency and complacency.” And Mr. Ryan’s budget proposals involve savage cuts in safety-net programs such as food stamps and Medicaid."

http://news.yahoo.com/flying-without-a-safety-net--212833456.html,,[],Government shutdown leaves airlines in charge of the skies,"With the U.S. government in its third day of shutdown and an unprecedented number of Federal Aviation Administration inspectors on furlough, American skies now are more or less in the hands of the airline industry — a situation that could erode safety margins for air travel, industry experts and observers say.

More than 2,900 safety inspectors are not working, with no date set for their return, according to the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, a labor organization representing FAA employees. “All of this decreases the safety margin,” says Mike Perrone, national president of PASS. “People have good intentions, but at the end of the day it’s about money. For right now, the airlines are on their own.”

Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA, posted the 2014 Plan for Appropriation Lapse and the news was grim — it dictates 15,514 staff suspensions among 46,070 at the FAA, or 34 percent of the workforce, including 2,490 in the Office of Aviation Safety. Employees and union officials say the totals are even higher.

Airlines for America, the industry’s major trade organization, said in a statement: “At this point, we do not expect airline operations to be impacted.” But the air traffic controllers’ union notes that those on the job are “working without pay” and essential support staff has been furloughed, suggesting “this is akin to a surgeon performing an operation without any staff to prep the room, clean the equipment, or provide support during the surgery.”

Ever since U.S. airlines were deregulated in 1978 and the government ceased micromanaging routes and fares, industry experts have debated what the right amount of oversight should be. But Washington’s shutdown has created a scenario only Ayn Rand could have imagined — with airlines policing their own operations now.

Safety concerns have arisen not necessarily because safety advocates think the worst of the airlines, but because the lack of a regulatory body is unprecedented, even during the 1996 government shutdown. As Perrone says, “It’s like driving on the highway when you know there are no police out there. Right now the airline industry is like kids in a candy store.”

Story continues

Surveillance and spot inspections of airplanes, cockpits, tarmac operations, hangars and outsourced maintenance facilities are suspended, with only one manager answering phones at many of the FAA’s 105 key offices in the U.S. Dozens more overseas are shuttered. The FAA’s broad and critical responsibilities include not only maintaining air traffic control but certifying and inspecting airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, and tens of thousands of licensed pilots, mechanics and other personnel, as well as overseeing the world’s largest general aviation system.

The FAA’s public affairs office is closed, but a spokeswoman sent this statement: “Safety is our top priority. …The FAA has prepared a contingency plan in which air traffic controllers and other essential employees will continue working in order to maintain the safety of the national airspace system. If the furlough extends longer than a few days, we will incrementally begin to recall specific employees back to work to meet continuing safety needs. These personnel may include safety inspectors, engineers, and technical support staff.”

John Goglia, a licensed aircraft mechanic and former board member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said the aviation system is not easily subjected to rapid shifts and changes that could occur under the shutdown scenario: “For most of the major carriers, their size is too great for quick changes,"" he said. ""For two weeks without inspectors, there’s no change. But after that, it could deteriorate. Then there could be problems.”



The industry’s outsourced aircraft maintenance shops, which have become ubiquitous and are often located in countries where safety standards are lax to begin with, also create concerns, he said. On Wednesday, Goglia posted an opinion column asking if the U.S. is actually violating an international aviation treaty by removing inspectors.

Says Perrone: “God forbid there’s an accident. It will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.”

Experts note that residual effects will linger and are difficult to calculate, even after resolving the shutdown situation. After multiple ""sequesters,"" spending cuts from earlier in the year many mistakenly thought would be restored, inspectors report FAA morale is at an all-time low. And continuity is disrupted, since catching up with a backlog will defer new projects. As the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO noted, ""The air traffic management system will be suspended again, as it was during the partial FAA shutdown in 2011.”

For the FAA, perennially understaffed for years, the furloughs likely make a bad situation worse. For example, in June, the DOT’s inspector general reported: “For fiscal year 2013, FAA did not request any additional [safety inspector] positions, even though the staffing model projected a shortage of 389 positions.” And according to PASS, one-third of the FAA workforce will be eligible to retire in 2014.

For travelers: What to expect

Many passengers may not realize airline travel is dependent upon an alphabet soup of federal agencies, from the NTSB to the Agriculture Department. Here’s a brief rundown at press time:

• For now, Transportation Security Administration airport screening has been deemed essential, says a spokeswoman.

• Customs and Border Protection also is scheduled to continue.

• The Association of Corporate Travel Executives reports that U.S. passports will continue to be processed, but offices located inside federal buildings might be closed. The Global Business Travel Association said: “During the 1996 shutdown, hundreds of thousands of passports went unissued and tens of thousands of visa applications went unprocessed.”

One notable irony is some airline executives have long derided government subsidies for Amtrak. But yesterday the for-profit rail line stated it will “continue normal operation” despite the shutdown.

Obama's 2014 budget proposal calls for a strategic review of the TVA, the nation's largest public utility with 9 million customers in seven states from Virginia to Mississippi.

Selling the U.S-owned power company could reduce the federal deficit by at least $25 billion and ""help put the nation on a sustainable fiscal path,"" Obama says in a budget document.

Not so fast, say GOP lawmakers in the region.

""It's one more bad idea in a budget full of bad ideas,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a longtime TVA champion.

""There is no assurance that selling TVA to a profit-making entity would reduce electric bills in the Tennessee Valley, and it could lead to higher electricity rates"" for customers in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, Alexander said.

Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., vowed to ""carefully study any proposals to restructure TVA"" to ensure it continues to deliver affordable electricity throughout the region.

Privatizing TVA has been proposed before ""and been determined to be a very bad idea,"" added Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn.

Administration officials emphasized that privatization was just one option being considered. Sale of the agency has been discussed by prior administrations, but nothing has happened.

Indeed, proposals to sell TVA date back to soon after the agency was created in 1933 to reduce the risk of flooding in the region and bring electricity to rural communities in poor areas of Appalachia. It was a key part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, which used government spending to help the nation recover from the Great Depression.

President Dwight Eisenhower called TVA ""creeping socialism,"" while President Ronald Reagan criticized it as an example of big government. Republicans from Barry Goldwater to Newt Gingrich have pointed to the TVA as an example of where the private sector could provide services more cheaply and effectively than bureaucrats.

Republican antipathy for the TVA led many in the Southeast to assume that any proposal to sell TVA would come from the GOP -- not a Democratic president fresh off winning a second term.

The privatization proposal ""is making our heads spin here in Tennessee,"" said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit group that promotes alternative energy throughout the region.

""For the first time that I'm aware of, you've got a Democratic administration proposing the sale of TVA and simultaneously you've got significant, conservative federal representatives in the House and Senate defending their local socialist project,"" Smith said. ""There's a lot irony in it and little bit of humor actually.""

A White House spokesman referred questions to the budget office. A spokeswoman said the plan was part of an effort to modernize and reform the federal government, and to address the financing of energy infrastructure.

""TVA has significant capital financing constraints which are difficult to address in the current fiscal environment,"" she said.

Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., called sale of the TVA an ""extremely remote possibility"" and said the authority's large debts make it unattractive to potential buyers. The TVA also provides a range of services besides power generation, including flood control and recreation, that would shift to other agencies or be dropped if the TVA is sold.

TVA, which owns 29 hydropower plants, 11 coal plants and three nuclear plants, has been plagued by cost overruns in recent years, particularly for its nuclear fleet. The agency plans $25 billion in capital expenditures over the next 10 years, much of it to expand its nuclear capacity and modernize older, coal-fired plants, but faces a statutory debt cap of $30 billion.

John Thomas, the TVA's chief financial officer, said the agency receives no money from the federal government and its bonds are not a federal obligation. Even so, TVA debts are considered part of the federal deficit.

One possible solution is federal legislation to change how the TVA's debt is calculated for federal purposes, Thomas and others said.

The authority will cooperate with the strategic review, but will operate as usual in the meantime, Thomas said."

You can watch it here and we'll post live updates throughout.

As you probably already know, compared to previous years, the biggest new element of Obama's budget is that it would cut Social Security benefits through chained CPI. Somewhat bizarrely, the White House is saying the proposal is actually a Republican idea and that the president is just including it as a sign of good faith for ongoing fiscal negotiations. Republicans, however, didn't propose the cut in their budget and have already rejected the president's overall plan.

At the summary level, the president's budget is a dollar-for-dollar replica of his proposal earlier this year to replace the sequester. It even includes the same Social Security cut. So what's new here isn't the proposal, but the fact that it is being formally included in the budget. Republicans, obviously, repeatedly rejected the plan in its former life.

The plan calls for a total of $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction compared to the sequester's $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions. It includes $100 billion in defense spending cuts and $580 billion in revenue increases. It also includes $50 billion in stimulus spending and would fund pre-K education for lower- and middle-income families, paid for by raising tobacco taxes.

President Obama takes the podium.

By the way, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have already ""prejected"" the president's plan earlier this morning.

Deficits are already dropping, says the president, but ""we can do more."" Obama then pivots to criticizing the negative impacts of the sequester spending cuts. He wants ""smarter"" cuts instead.

""We can grow our economy and shrink our deficits ... nothing shrinks deficits faster than a growing economy."" He's right, but the budget doesn't fully reflect that sentiment.

The president pivots from his comments on deficits to talking about supporting investments in education, from pre-K to high school to college.

Calls out members of Congress who voted for spending cuts and are now complaining about them. ""My budget replaces these cuts with smarter ones.""

""Our deficits are already falling. Over the past two years I've signed legislation that will reduce our deficits by $2.5 trillion, more than two-thirds through spending cuts. [...] My budgets will reduce deficits by nearly another $2 trillion. [...] It does so in a balanced and responsible way.""

""If we want to keep Medicare working as well as it has, if we want to keep the ironclad guarantee, then we need to make some changes [...] The reforms I'm suggesting will strengthen Medicare ... by reducing the cost of health care, not by shifting costs to seniors or their families.""

""My budget does also contain the compromise I offered to Boehner"" (aka Chained CPI). The president basically tries to disclaim ownership of the proposal, saying it's a Republican idea, but that he's willing to accept it as part of a comprehensive deal, as long as there are ""protections"" for lower-income seniors. Definitely seemed defensive on that subject.

President Obama has concluded his remarks—nothing we didn't already know, but he did seem defensive on Social Security, which he talked about without explicitly calling it Social Security. He's got a nearly impossible task, trying to explain why he's proposing something that he says he doesn't really want to support but is nonetheless willing to accept."

Delivered on one of the year’s busiest online shopping days, the court’s decision is expected to accelerate the move by states to try to capture the taxes due on online purchases made by their residents.

The court’s refusal to take up the issue also increases pressure on Congress to settle the long-standing dispute between online and conventional bricks-and-mortar retailers and to enact legislation standardizing online sales tax collection.

“We have a patchwork of out-of-date laws,” said David C. Blum, a Chicago tax attorney uninvolved in the case but who has represented online retailers. “They may have made sense in the era before the Internet, but not now.”

The pioneering New York statute has become a model for efforts by California and other states to capture tax revenue. Today, 34 states by law or administrative process require at least major online retailers to collect sales taxes.

States said they lose more than $23 billion a year in revenue when people buy products online and fail to pay the required sales tax. Conventional retailers complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage because they must collect those taxes on each sale.

Some states have been passing laws that stretch their ability to force online retailers to collect sales taxes. The pressure of those laws helped California and Texas strike deals with major Internet retailers such as Amazon to collect sales taxes so they could locate distribution centers and other facilities there.

New York’s 2008 statute requires out-of-state Internet retailers to collect sales taxes if they used affiliates in the state to direct business to their websites, such as a museum website that directed people to Amazon to buy books.

The law treated these Web affiliates as though they were a sales force within the state. The U.S. Constitution always has allowed states to collect taxes from out-of-state companies if they have employees or offices — a nexus — physically located within a state.

Amazon and Overstock.com Inc. appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the New York law was unconstitutional.

The companies cited a 1992 Supreme Court decision involving mail-order catalogs. In that case, the court said states could collect sales taxes from retailers only when they have a physical presence in the state.

Lawyers for Amazon and Overstock had argued that their dealings with other Web affiliates in New York did not constitute having a physical presence there. Citing similar laws in California, Connecticut, Illinois and North Carolina, the companies also said the New York law has “provided a road map for other state legislatures to enact similarly burdensome legislation.”

In Monday’s brief order, the high court turned down the appeals of Amazon and Overstock without comment, a decision that has the effect of upholding New York’s law.

“Bricks-and-mortar [stores] won,” said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Assn. “The court has decided that states have the right to pass what New York passed.”

But even if the New York law had been overturned, California’s statute would have remained largely in force, experts said.

Like New York, California established nexus for making out-of-state retailers collect sales taxes. But California also created a basis for sales tax collection if a company had even a minor physical presence in the state.

Amazon, based in Seattle, not only has affiliates in California, but operates a research facility for its Kindle e-reader and has a subsidiary, the Independent Movie Database, located in the Golden State.

Since passage of California’s law in 2011, Amazon’s physical presence in California has ballooned as part of an agreement the company made with Gov. Jerry Brown. Amazon now operates three giant distribution centers — in San Bernardino, Tracy and Patterson — and probably will open more facilities as it moves toward same-day delivery service statewide.

California tax collectors recently reported that the new law generated $263.4 million in new revenue for the state treasury and local governments for the fiscal year ended June 30.

Retailers and state officials now are expected to ramp up efforts to get Congress to adopt a nationwide rule for online sales taxes. The National Conference of State Legislatures said it would send about 200 legislators, in town for an annual forum, to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to lobby for legislation.

Because it has the power to regulate interstate commerce, Congress can pass a law that allows states to force all retailers to collect sales taxes for purchases made by state residents.

“This decision further illustrates why a national solution is needed to level the playing field for local bricks-and-mortar retailers and help them compete more effectively against out-of-state Internet sellers,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).

Durbin is a leading sponsor of the Marketplace Fairness Act, which gives states the authority to require larger online retailers with no physical presence in those states to collect sales taxes on its residents’ purchases.

The Senate approved the bill on a bipartisan 69-27 vote in May. But the legislation has been stalled in the House, where Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) wants to make changes.

In September, Goodlatte issued seven principles for such legislation, including that compliance with sales tax laws should be simple and not favor one type of retailer over another.

Some anti-tax groups have opposed the Senate legislation, arguing it was a de facto tax increase because it would cause many people to pay more in taxes. Consumers are required to pay sales taxes to their state for all their online purchases, but only about 1% do so.

Brandon Arnold, vice president of government affairs at the National Taxpayers Union, called the Supreme Court decision “Cyber Monday’s Worst Deal.”

The National Retail Federation, which represents online and conventional retailers, said it was time for a more comprehensive solution.

“As we see the growth in Internet sales every year, there’s more of a need to figure out a way for these taxes to be collected by the retailer, but in a way that’s not too burdensome,” said Rachelle Bernstein, the trade group’s vice president and tax counsel. “I think that’s what Congress is working on and that’s what’s still needed.”

Amazon also supports a national approach and has backed the Senate bill because it “would protect states’ rights to make their own revenue policy choices while allowing them to collect more than a fraction of the revenue that’s already owed,” said Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman.

Congress went home for the holidays without approving a federally funded extension of jobless benefits for about 1.3 million Americans who have been out of work six months or longer. And Republicans, who control the House, are showing little inclination to take up the measure when lawmakers return Jan. 7.

For unemployed Californians, the cutoff caps a year made more difficult by the state’s Employment Development Department, which has been struggling since September with a botched upgrade of its aging computer systems. Payments to tens of thousands of unemployed workers have been delayed, sometimes for months. EDD workers are still processing many claims by hand, reducing the staff available to answer phone calls from frustrated clients.

As if those troubles weren’t enough, the state’s unemployment insurance fund is broke and there’s no solid plan to fund it. California owes the federal government $9 billion it borrowed to pay benefits during the recession. So far, politicians in Sacramento haven’t reached an agreement on how to repay those funds. Options include raising taxes on employers, cutting benefits to the unemployed or some combination of both.

“It’s been the most challenging year in decades,” said Maurice Emsellem, the co-policy director for the National Employment Law Project in Oakland, which advocates for the poor and working poor. “And the irony is that claims are down. Fewer workers are collecting benefits, but [EDD workers] are having a harder time processing claims. People are falling through the cracks and having a harder time than ever getting through to the system.”

Currently, about 712,000 Californians are receiving unemployment benefits, down from 1.5 million at the peak of the recession. The jobless rate, now at 8.5%, has been falling as the economy picks up steam and California companies add jobs.

But California has about 400,000 fewer jobs than it did before the downturn, and times are still tough for many of the state’s long-term unemployed.

Kaitlyn Smith, 24, of Twentynine Palms will lose her $450-a-week benefit when the federal extension expires this weekend. A Marine Corps veteran and the mother of two young children, Smith says she has been searching for work, but it’s hard to come by in the high desert. The family can’t move because her husband, a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, must remain near the combat center until he’s discharged from the Marines in July.

The loss of her benefits will cut deeply into the couple’s income. Smith said the family is already skimping on basics, including heat, because the EDD has been behind on her payments.

“I have to keep the house at 55 degrees even though I have two little girls, ages 21/2 and 11/2,” Smith said. She said she has placed hundreds of calls to the EDD in the last few months, reaching an agent only once.

Unemployment benefits differ from state to state. In California, the state provides 26 weeks of assistance paid from employer taxes. Maximum weekly benefits are $450 in California, and the average payment is $305 a week. To be eligible, recipients have to regularly show proof that they are seeking employment.

After that, the federal government kicks in for the long-term jobless, who recently have been eligible to receive 37 weeks of benefits on top of the initial state help. These are being cut off Saturday.

According to the EDD, 28% of the state’s unemployed have been out of work for one year or more. Many are older workers, who often have difficulty getting rehired.

Robert Rowe, 55, is hoping to buck the odds. The Westlake Village resident has been unemployed since October, when he lost his job as an aerospace welder. He has been looking for work in construction and as a substance abuse counselor, but he hasn’t turned up anything so far.

Rowe said many employers “consider age, healthcare costs and longevity” when deciding to hire, putting veteran workers such as himself at a disadvantage. Still, he’s looking to a strengthening economy to help him land something after the holidays.

“It’s a little bit rougher,” Rowe said. “It’s not fun, but I’m persevering.”

Since June 2008, Congress has approved 11 extensions of unemployment benefits. At one point, the combination of state and federal assistance reached a maximum of 99 weeks in California.

The federal cutoff could have dire consequences for California’s slowly healing economy, Gov. Jerry Brown said this month. It “will have a ripple effect on the broader economy,” he warned in a Dec. 12 letter to congressional leaders.

The Employment Law Project estimated that the elimination of federal unemployment assistance would remove $4 billion from California’s economy next year.

Despite pressure from President Obama and top congressional Democrats, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives refused to extend federally funded assistance when it passed a $1-trillion budget bill Dec. 12. The Senate approved the same legislation six days later.

Republicans have cited a variety of reasons for not renewing the federal unemployment benefits. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told NBC News this week that providing benefits to the long-term unemployed hurts their chances of getting rehired. He also said that Democrats should be willing to raise taxes to pay for continuing benefits instead of adding to the size of the federal budget deficit.

But supporters of additional long-term jobless benefits haven’t given up. Members in both houses have introduced measures that could be considered early next year to extend the federal unemployment program through the end of 2014.

In the meantime, the EDD has sent out letters to recipients of the federal aid, alerting them to Saturday’s cutoff and advising them to check the department’s website for updates at edd.ca.gov

The letters also highlighted a network of available job centers at americasjobcenter.ca.gov and a variety of other government and private social services.

The EDD, meanwhile, has been under attack for its failure to provide timely services to jobless Californians. Last month, the Assembly Insurance Committee took top agency officials to task during an oversight hearing. Unemployed workers testified that it was nearly impossible to reach an operator or caseworker, despite an expensive EDD upgrade of the telephone system.

EDD spokeswoman Loree Levy acknowledged that “we are not able to answer the phones the way we would like and our customers deserve.” She blamed the difficulty on federal budget cuts and staff reductions.

That’s little consolation to jobless Californians who are struggling to pay their bills.

Ted James LaDuca, an out-of-work graphic artist from San Francisco, said he qualified for unemployment benefits in early November. As of last week, he said he had received only two payments.

“Like so many others, I can’t seem to get in touch with anyone from EDD,” LaDuca said. “I feel so completely lost and hopeless over this.”

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-mounts-local-media-blitz-sequester-141156862--politics.html,,[],Obama mounts local media blitz on sequester,"President Barack Obama will pound away at Republicans on Wednesday over the automatic “sequester” spending cuts in a series of eight local interviews, the White House announced.

Obama will speak to reporters from Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco, Honolulu, Oklahoma City, Wichita, Kan., San Antonio, Texas, and Charleston, S.C.

“By speaking to anchors from stations around the country, the President will have an opportunity to focus on the harmful local impacts that will be felt if Congressional Republicans refuse to compromise,” an Obama aide said in an email sent to reporters.

The president has been arguing that the only thing holding up a compromise that would avert the cuts—which both sides have characterized as damaging to national security and the fragile recovery—is Republican opposition to closing tax loopholes that chiefly benefit wealthy Americans or rich corporations. Republicans say Obama already got all of the tax hikes he’s going to get in the deal on the fiscal cliff, and that it's time to focus on spending cuts.

The GOP has also hit the president for proposing fresh infrastructure spending. Obama, said the aide, was to defend that approach in the interviews as “smart investments we need to make to boost our economy even as we reduce the deficit.” Infrastructure spending—on roads, bridges and other structures—is tailor-made for interviews with local anchors. The president could list specific projects—and may well do just that.

“The president will announce a plan to cut federal review and permitting timelines for construction projects such as highways, bridges, railways, ports, waterways, pipelines, and renewable energy,” said the Obama aide, who requested anonymity.

“In talking with local anchors, he will also have the opportunity to discuss specific, important projects in their communities that stand to benefit from these initiatives,” the aide said."

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",McManus: D.C. doubles down on the sequester,"The sequester, those $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to hit the federal government on March 1, was designed to be stupid.

In 2011, when President Obama proposed the scheme and both parties in Congress embraced it, their thinking was: With a whole year to work on a deal, surely we can figure out a way to avoid a catastrophe.

What Washington did they think they were living in?

With no negotiations under way, it’s virtually certain that on March 1, a long list of federal programs will get slashed. But at this point, the only thing Democrats and Republicans agree on is that the mandatory cuts will hurt the economy, the nation’s security and the well-being of the American people.

Advertisement

So why has there been no serious negotiation to avoid the train wreck we all see coming? One reason is that both sides think the public will side with them and blame the other party.

Obama and the Democrats think they can win the public relations battle because Americans are already on their side. A Pew Research Center poll released last week, for example, found that a big majority of Americans, 76%, agree with Obama’s approach of combining spending cuts with tax increases; only 19% agree with the Republican position that tax increases should be off the table.

But Republicans think it won’t be hard to turn the public against Obama, since he was the one who proposed the sequester in the first place (never mind that they approved the plan). They’ll also insist that the administration is deliberately making the cuts more painful than they need to be. Some in the GOP have even proposed giving Obama more discretion over where to slash, so he can’t complain that his hands are tied.

Both sides have a point. Most Americans do want to cut federal spending in general. But when it comes to individual programs, they want to protect them. The Pew poll found that a majority favored cuts in only one area: foreign aid. Most respondents didn’t want cuts in education, healthcare, unemployment benefits or defense.

That’s why the administration has offered deliberately dramatic forecasts of what spending cuts could mean, from canceled military operations and reduced Border Patrol surveillance to fewer AIDS tests, fewer children in Head Start and even potential meat shortages (because of reduced meat inspections).

And seemingly minor cutbacks can have outsized political impact. When Republicans in Congress shut down the federal government in 1995, the public reacted harshly once vacationers discovered that Yosemite and other national parks were closed. This time, the most painful cut for many people may be at the nation’s airports: If the sequester continues past April 1, the Transportation Security Administration says it will have to cut the number of screeners on duty — meaning waits of an hour or more for passengers. That won’t be pretty.

Still, Republicans hope that by challenging Democrats to come up with spending cuts to match those mandated by the sequester, they can portray their opponents as big spenders unwilling to attack the federal deficit. “Most people agree [with Republicans] that the deficit is one of the reasons the economy can’t get back on track,” said David Winston, a GOP pollster who advises House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). “So let’s get to work cutting the deficit. And then we can ask a second question: Do you really want your taxes to go up?”

In short, Republicans think they can turn the sequester into a teachable moment that will draw public opinion to their side. But they face some obvious problems. Most of the public doesn’t agree with them yet.

The White House has been energetic in pressing its case, using a week when Congress was out of town to stage events, including one that surrounded the president with photogenic law enforcement officers. And while Obama is talking to the country, the GOP has so far been talking mostly to the party faithful, making small-bore arguments about who proposed the sequester in the first place.

In the end, there will be some kind of compromise, probably around March 27, when Congress has to pass a law to keep the government operating for the rest of the year. It will probably include spending cuts that approach what the sequester demands, but with more flexibility— and, if Democrats have their way, a longer delay before the cuts kick in.

Tax increases will be a sticking point, of course. Democrats want them; Republicans reject them. But the recent history of budget showdowns suggests the GOP will compromise at the last minute.

But even if we already know roughly how the standoff will end, it’s hard to see how we’ll get there from here. Neither side knows how to defuse the crisis before it happens; neither wants to be the first to offer concessions. “Every time I’ve gotten into one of these high-profile negotiations, you know, it’s my rear end that got burnt,” Boehner told the Associated Press this month. That’s about as perfect a description of political dysfunction as you could want.

Perry has launched a high-profile battle for California companies, running radio ads in California touting the Lone Star State's low taxes and favorable business climate. The ads will be heard in San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Diego and the Inland Empire area east of Los Angeles.

""Building a business is tough, but I hear building a business in California is next to impossible. This is Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and I have a message for California businesses: Come check out Texas,"" starts the 30-second spot.

Perry notes that his state has won the Best State for Business title from Chief Executive magazine for eight years running. He noted that the cost of doing business in California is 6.3% above the national average and Texas' is 4.6% below it.

This is not the first time Texas has looked to raid California for businesses. The governor has made several scouting trips and has written letters to California companies in the past. And, according to the governor's office, nearly three dozen California companies have relocated or expanded in Texas during California Gov. Jerry Brown's term.

Texas isn't the only one knocking on California companies' doors. Several states have courted Golden State businesses in recent years, particularly during California's budget turmoil.

California officials, however, aren't that concerned. Business relocations account for only .03% of annual job losses and the state is doing well economically, according to the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development.

""I can understand why Rick Perry is interested in California. We were the national jobs leader for most of the last year with 257,000 new private sector jobs,"" said Kish Rajan, the office's director. ""Real job creation comes from California's history as a national leader in start-ups and the expansion of homegrown businesses.""

But Perry sees a new opening with California's recent tax hikes, which he says ""increases California's already excessive income and sales tax."" He pointed out that Texas has no state income tax and a low business tax cut.

Perry even reminded golfer Phil Mickelson, who recently complained about taxes in California, about that fact. ""Hey Phil....Texas is home to liberty and low taxes...we would love to have you as well !!"" Perry tweeted last month."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/01/politics/dysfunctional-washington/index.html,2013-03-01 00:00:00,['Martina Stewart'],Shame and blame: Why Washington needs couples therapy,"Story highlights Washington faced yet another fiscal deadline -- this time with no real effort to negotiate Couples therapist: Democrats, Republicans lost sight of big picture, are just arguing to win Couples mediator: Disagreements should be used to find solutions

Just two months after the brinksmanship of the “fiscal cliff,” on Friday Washington faced yet another deadline to avoid yet another fiscal calamity of its own making.

But this time, something is different.

As congressional leaders met in the White House on Friday for what was little more than a photo-op on the day forced budget cuts went into effect, this time there are no 11th-hour negotiations to save the day. There is no last-minute effort to call in Vice President Joe Biden on behalf of Democrats or Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on behalf of Republicans to get things back on track.

Obama: ‘I am not a dictator, I’m the president’

Instead, for the past few weeks, all sides – the White House and Congress, Democrats and Republicans – have done nothing but squabble like a dysfunctional married couple about who is responsible for the bad policy that is the forced budget cuts, all while avoiding dealing with the real issues.

National leaders’ apparent lack of interest in working out an alternative to the cuts was symbolized by the meeting Friday morning at the White House. As if to check off the “we did everything we could” box, say couples counselors, President Obama and congressional leaders from both parties met to show that they met – even though earlier this week, Obama told Hill leaders they needed to be “ready to talk solutions.”

As expected, the meeting produced no breakthrough and Friday night President Obama formally began the process of implementing the forced budget cuts he and Congress have been criticizing for weeks.

If it feels like a child helplessly watching bickering parents repeat a dysfunctional cycle of disagreement, recrimination and contempt while not addressing the root cause of what’s wrong in their relationship, there’s good reason.

Spending cut politics: Déjà vu all over again

“They’ve lost sight of the big picture because they’re so determined to be right and to win the argument, and that’s what happens with couples,” said Sharon Rivkin, a California-based marriage counselor and author of “Breaking the Argument Cycle.”

The need to be right, shaming and blaming are the three major obstacles to a healthy relationship, Rivkin said. “And that’s exactly what they’re doing – the Democrats and the Republicans are doing with each other. They’re attacking and defending and really just want to be right. And are not looking at the impact that it’s going to have on children and the economy and the country.”

Spending cuts: When they’ll really bite

In addition to the contempt that seems to be building on both sides, Rivkin flagged misdirected disagreement as another sign that the relationship between Democrats and Republicans has become dysfunctional to the point of needing therapy.

“They’re arguing about the wrong things, and that’s what happens in couples: You’re not even arguing about what’s really going on. You’re just arguing to win,” Rivkin said.

“They should be talking about economic growth and how to reduce the budget deficit and how they can be fair,” the therapist observed. Instead, both sides are squabbling over who originally had the idea for the forced spending cuts. “You can’t win in an argument like that, because it’s he said, she said, and they’re not getting to the root of the issues.”

Teachers: How will you be affected?

Then there is Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, a couple that seems to have the most strained relationship in a dysfunctional Washington. Rivkin says that if the two men came to her for therapy, she’d first listen to their gripes about one another. “And then I’d try to make it more human” by getting away from their superficial disagreements and appealing to their shared concern for the well-being of the country.

“If I talked to them long enough, there’s got to be something that they agree on,” Rivkin said, adding that finding a point of agreement in a quarrelling couple is “very powerful.”

Obama signs order activating deep spending cuts

Rivkin also said that Boehner’s recent announcement that he will no longer negotiate directly with Obama is another sign that the relationship between the two men is in serious trouble.

“The healthiest relationships are the ones where you can negotiate,” the marriage counselor said, “where you feel safe to put everything out there.”

Laurie Puhn, a couples mediator and author of “Fight Less, Love More,” likens Friday’s meeting at the White House to a couple’s mediation session where both spouses come into the room but refuse to speak.

“OK,” Puhn said, “you got the image. You can check off your list (that) you did couples mediation, but clearly nothing could possibly be accomplished.”

Like a married couple desperately in need of outside help to understand and resolve their differences, Puhn noted, “each political party – the individuals within them – is all about what I want. Here’s what I want. Here’s what I need. Here’s what I won’t do. Here’s what I won’t give up. Everybody’s making demands, and they’re each just completely thinking about themselves.”

In mediation, Puhn tries to avoid the personal acrimony between a couple and instead focus on identifying a list of underlying issues or concerns in their relationship. Then she focuses on areas of agreement about those issues and sets those aside so the couple can focus on the areas of disagreement.

“You narrow it down … and what you’re left with are the sticking points,” Puhn said. Then the task becomes avoiding focusing on a single sticking point and, instead, finding some give-and-take amongst all the sticking points.

“Most of the time, people can’t identify their actual problems,” Puhn said of her work with distressed couples. “And I think that’s what we see between the president and the speaker.”

Obama and Boehner and both political parties seem to be suffering from another affliction Puhn sees in struggling couples. “If we’re going to fight, let’s have a good fight. … Let’s make our goal in a fight to reach a solution. The goal is not to win … not to persuade your mate.”

As a mediator, Puhn said, much of what she does is to control the environment where a couple is brainstorming tradeoffs between their sticking points on critical issues so that one spouse isn’t given the opportunity to see the other’s willingness to compromise as leverage or weakness. In so doing, Puhn often acts as a substitute for the trust between the couple that has broken down by the time they seek her help.

Puhn said Obama and Boehner and Democrats and Republicans in Washington “absolutely” need a mediator whom both sides trust who can get them refocused from their entrenched positions to their underlying interests and goals.

“As a politician, you should be able to understand and mediate through what your interests are,” Puhn said. “And if you really can’t move away from the words and the specific rules on the table and the (governmental) programs you’re discussing, what it means is that you’re truly just focused on what it’s going to look like – what the image is of whatever you agree to.”

http://news.yahoo.com/republicans-consider-short-term-u-debt-ceiling-increase-025328353--business.html,,[],Republicans offer plan to postpone any U.S. default,"By Richard Cowan and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the House of Representatives offered a plan on Thursday that would postpone a possible U.S. default, signaling new willingness to end a standoff that has shuttered large parts of the government and thrown America's future creditworthiness into question. Ahead of an afternoon meeting with President Barack Obama, House Republican leaders floated a measure to extend the government's borrowing authority for several weeks that appeared to be free of the restrictions on healthcare and spending that prompted the crisis. Their plan would not reopen the government, as Obama has insisted, but Republican leaders said they would seek a way to do so at the meeting, which is scheduled for 4:35 p.m. (2035 GMT). The White House said it would consider the offer. For the first time since the government shutdown began 10 days ago, senior lawmakers from both parties predicted they would be able to resolve their differences in a way that would allow both sides to claim victory. Outside conservative groups like Heritage Action and the Club for Growth, who have pressed Republicans to resist compromise, said they would not punish those who voted for the new plan. ""It's all going to work out,"" said Republican Representative John Mica of Florida. Investors seemed to be heartened by the developments. U.S. stocks indexes closed up 2 percent on Thursday. The dollar hit a 2-week high against major currencies and benchmark crude oil had its biggest gain in 6 weeks. The proposal is a significant shift for Republicans, who had hoped to use the disruption to undermine Obama's signature healthcare law and win further spending cuts. Those goals remain, but the Republican offer would at least push off the threat of default from October 17 until possibly the middle or end of November. One potential complication: the plan would prevent the Treasury Department from shifting funds around to postpone the day of reckoning further. The White House cautiously welcomed the offer, but reiterated that Congress must first reopen the government before budget talks can begin. ""The president is happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. Carney also cautioned that the White House has yet to see details of the Republican proposal. Many rank-and-file Republicans also appeared to be skeptical of Boehner's plan. Boehner's grip over his troops has been tenuous this year and many of the chamber's most conservative lawmakers have defied him repeatedly on other crucial votes. REBELLIOUS MEMBERS Boehner has taken pains to show his party's most rebellious members that he listens to their concerns. He took a different approach on Thursday, said those in the room. ""He put his best Coach Boehner voice and demeanor on and said, 'Guys, this is what we are going to do. The play has been called. I'm happy to answer questions,'"" said Republican Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. Other Republicans left the meeting grim-faced and refused to speak with reporters. The Obama administration says it will be unable to pay all of its bills if Congress does not raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling by October 17. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said he would be unable to prioritize some payments over others among the 30 million transactions his department handles each week. ""It would be chaos,"" Lew told the Senate Finance Committee. The Republican plan would postpone that day of reckoning by several weeks. That would give them more time to seek spending cuts, a repeal of a medical-device tax, or other measures they say are needed to keep the national debt at a manageable level. ""It's better to negotiate and try and reach a solution than try to just win an all-out victory. That's not the way this place should work,"" said Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona. Democrats have called for a debt-ceiling hike that would extend government borrowing authority for more than a year. Still, they did not entirely dismiss the plan. ""Let's see what they have offered,"" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said. The House could vote on the measure as early as Thursday, though the timing remained unclear. House leaders canceled a planned recess and said they would remain in Washington next week to keep working on the problem. Opinion polls indicate that Republicans appear to be getting more of the blame for the standoff. The Republican Party's approval rating now stands at a record low of 28 percent, according to Gallup, down 10 points from pre-shutdown levels. The Democratic Party's approval rating has dipped slightly to 43 percent. Business groups that have close ties to the Republican Party have also pressed for an end to the brinkmanship and some are laying plans to mount primary challenges next year to lawmakers who refuse to raise the debt ceiling. The Republican offer would do nothing to resolve conservative objections to Obama's healthcare reform law, the Affordable Care Act, which prompted the October 1 shutdown as Republicans pushed to delay or defund the law. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been out of work since then and individual businesses, from arms makers to motels, have begun to lay off workers as well. The Labor Department said on Thursday that 15,000 private-sector workers have filed for unemployment benefits due to the shutdown. House Republicans have passed bills that would reopen portions of the government and otherwise ease the pain of the shutdown, but they still hope to tie a full restoration of government funding to conditions that would undercut ""Obamacare,"" as it is popularly known. The latest offer could complicate efforts to reopen the government, as conservatives may feel emboldened to dig in their heels further in return for extending the debt ceiling. House Republicans offered their plan after Heritage Action, said it would not oppose a short-term increase in the debt limit. Heritage Action said, however, it wants House Republicans to return the focus of the fight over the government shutdown to demands for a rollback in Obamacare.

Washington (CNN) - The government shutdown showdown is getting ugly.

Republican Rep. Peter King said Friday that his Republican colleague in the Senate, Ted Cruz, ""is a fraud"" who will ""no longer have any influence in the Republican Party"" after the House votes on a measure that could potentially lead to a government shutdown.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

King made his comments while on his way to a Republican meeting, shortly before the House was set to begin debating, then voting on the bill. The legislation provides funds for the government to stay afloat past the end of the fiscal year on September 30, but only if money for Obamacare is cut out.

Ted Cruz: Obamacare fight 'just beginning'

The idea to tie the president's health care law to the government funding bill was aggressively pushed by Cruz and other Senate conservatives, including Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee, this summer.

The House is expected to pass the bill, which will then go to the Democratic-controlled Senate where the Obamacare amendment will likely be killed. The bill would then be sent back to the House, which would have to decide whether to pass it and keep the government running, or defeat it and possibly see a government shutdown.

King, who's been strongly opposed to the bill, has essentially compared the strategy to a suicide mission.

""I hope people will get the message this guy is bad for the party,"" King said Friday, talking about Cruz, a potential 2016 presidential candidate. King is also a potential White House contender, as he has said he's thinking about running for president.

Asked if the House vote was more of a message to conservatives than to Obama, King said the vote is a signal that the GOP has ""to take more realistic and practical approaches.""

The congressman has said before that he can start ignoring the senator from Texas after the vote. He reiterated Friday he hopes that's still the case.

""We can't be going off on these false missions that Ted Cruz wants us to go on. The issues are too important. They're too serious, they require real conservative solutions, not cheap headline-hunting schemes,"" he said.



Read: Cruz tries to make amends with angry conservatives

Cruz angered House conservatives earlier this week when he admitted in a statement that he doubts the Senate has enough votes to pass a government funding measure that also defunds Obamacare. He has nonetheless vowed to keep fighting in the Senate to generate support for the measure.

But with some Senate Republicans already saying they won't support Cruz in the effort, the chances of him succeeding so far appear unlikely.

Seriously?,"Story highlights Talk of a government shutdown is like a scene in the movie ""Groundhog Day"" If Congress doesn't reach an agreement over government funding, shutdown is October 1 2011 had three major debates that nearly shut down the government But the 2011 fiscal battles only tell half the story

(CNN) —

“We’ve seen the movie before,” Sen. John McCain said recently on CNN’s “New Day.”

Oh, how right you are, Senator.

When Bill Murray’s clock radio goes off at 6 a.m. and Sonny and Cher’s tune “I’ve got you Babe” plays in the ‘90s classic “Groundhog Day,” perhaps the radio should have been tuned into the latest news from Washington.

The Arizona senator was talking about the government shutdown that is being threatened on October 1.

Congress and the president are again at loggerheads on how to move forward as the government’s money runs out at the end of the fiscal year this month and federal agencies are once again warning employees and preparing contingency plans for a closed government.

All this because Republicans are making demands in exchange for government funding and Democrats are saying “no way.”

“We are committed to changing the status quo in Washington and restoring our fiscal stability,” a tea party-backed House freshman said.

“At a time when the economy is just beginning to grow, where we’re just starting to see a pickup in employment, the last thing we need is a disruption that’s caused by a government shutdown,” President Barack Obama argued.

While the above two statements could have been made today, the lines were drawn more than two years ago – in the weeks before the first major battle between newly empowered libertarian-oriented Republicans and Democrats that nearly led to a government shutdown.

House GOP: Defund Obama care or shut government down

Again? Seriously?

You aren’t dreaming. And you aren’t starring in “Groundhog Day II.” You have heard this before. A government shutdown is a possibility and the issues haven’t changed: the size and cost of government, the debt limit and health care.

Your guide to a government shutdown

Some House Republicans are threatening to prevent mandatory, annual government spending bills from moving forward if the health care law, also known as Obamacare, isn’t defunded. It’s a tactic that Democrats have flatly rejected and even many in the Republican Party, including House Speaker John Boehner, advise against.

Republican strategist and CNN contributor David Frum also offered words of caution. “[R]epeal-or-bust is much more likely to produce a bust than a repeal,” he wrote in an editorial on CNN.com on Monday. “More productive is the challenge of reforming Obamacare so that the nation can live with its costs,” he added.

Julian Zelizer, history professor at Princeton, entered the debate with an editorial. He said the Republican Party’s strategy to address the budget through “risky” showdowns “hurts its ability to persuade the public that the Republicans are interested in seriously pursuing fiscal restraint, as opposed to using this issue for purely partisan purposes.”

That’s McCain’s point. “Republicans ought to understand if we shut down the government, Congress always gets blamed – rightly or wrongly – Congress gets blamed,” McCain said Monday.

He’s right. According to a recent CNN/ ORC International Poll, 51% of respondents would blame Republicans in Congress if the government closes its doors in October.

Adding to the tension, in mid- to late-October, the debt ceiling is set to be reached. It’s a convoluted term that means the United States would have reached its borrowing limit and would be unable to pay bills already incurred – or default on its loans. Republicans have signaled they want to extract spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the debt limit.

Obama said he “will not negotiate” on the debt ceiling.

“Congress needs to get it done without triggering another crisis, without shutting down our government, or worse, threatening not to pay this country’s bill[s],” the president said in an economic speech Monday.

“I think we’re facing an extraordinary few weeks of potential turmoil at the least and crisis at the worst,” CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein said.

That could be the most oft-repeated political statement of the past few years.

Obamacare, spending showdown heats up in House

It goes way back – to April 2011

Just five months after Republicans won a huge majority in the House of Representatives, seizing control of half of one branch of government from Democrats, the first major fiscal fight came to a head.

“If the government shuts down, it will be the Republicans’ responsibility,” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said then.

“There’s no question that a shutdown is coming, whether we do it today or whether we do it in 20 years,” then-Republican Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina said at the time, drawing attention to an increase in government spending.

A last-minute deal – literally last-minute – was reached to keep the government open with a short-term spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, until September.

Q&A: The lowdown on the shutdown, or why you should care about the CR

Through the standoff, Republicans won a $38.5 billion reduction in government spending, restricted access to abortions and an extension of the school voucher program in Washington, D.C., and a vote in the Senate to delay the implementation of Obamacare. The deal effectively started the clock until the next crisis.

August 2011: Ditching on debt …

“Default would cause a financial crisis potentially more severe than the crisis from which we are only now starting to recover,” Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a letter to Congress in 2011, warning lawmakers of the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling.

During that battle, Republicans demanded spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the debt ceiling. Another 11th-hour deal averted default, but the U.S. credit rating was downgraded anyway.

The agreement only temporarily shelved the debt ceiling debate, however. And it set the stage for a much larger fight down the road. While it cut more than $900 billion from the budget over 10 years, it also put into place the framework for forced, across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester. Congress would have just more than a year to figure out a way to cut an additional $1 trillion from the federal budget over the next decade or the automatic spending cuts on both defense and domestic programs would go into place.

September 2011: Kicking the can …

Yep, just one month later, another battle over spending nearly led to a government shutdown – the third such battle of 2011.

Two years ago, White House spokesman Jay Carney said something eerily familiar: “The fever hasn’t broken,” he told reporters, referring to budget battles in Congress that threatened a government shutdown. This time the September 2011 threats revolved around the amount of disaster relief funding.

While Democrats said Republicans were “holding hostage” aid to Americans hit by natural disasters, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said Democrats have chosen “to engage in a political stare-down match that will bring us one step closer to a government shutdown.”

Mild by comparison to the previous two fights as it ended days before the deadline, Congress reached an agreement that reduced the amount of disaster relief for states.

December 2012: Walking the edge of the fiscal cliff

Crisis, debt limit, tax increases, budget cuts, default: common words written (again) and spoken (again) in Washington this past holiday season.

“Hopefully there is still time for an agreement of some kind that saves the taxpayers from a wholly preventable economic crisis,” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in the lead-up to that fiscal showdown.

There’s that word again. Crisis. Another pending economic crisis.

That fight was dubbed the “fiscal cliff.” It was the culmination of ad-hoc agreements from previous government shutdown debates since 2011. Lawmakers worked through New Year’s Eve to reach a deal on tax rates, the debt ceiling and government spending levels.

While Congress agreed to raise the debt limit and raise a series of taxes, including on the wealthiest Americans, an agreement on government spending levels was not reached and the forced spending cuts – the sequester – went into effect, trimming up to 10% off non-mandatory federal defense and domestic programs.

March 2013: Again?

“The full faith and credit of the United States of America is not a bargaining chip,” the president said in January as Washington geared up for another fight over the debt ceiling, spending and Obamacare.

This debate was an extension of the New Year’s Eve “fiscal cliff” battle. If Congress didn’t reach an agreement, the result: you guessed it, government shutdown. What resulted was a spending bill that kept the government open until September 30 and also kept deep, across-the-board budget cuts in place that cut $85 billion across the board for the remainder of the year - and $1 trillion over 10 years - from military and domestic programs.

And here we are

That leads us to today. A new day but same story: Congress and the president are drawing lines in the sand over the same issues with the same dramatic consequences if they fail to reach an agreement.

“This country has worked too hard for too long to dig out of a crisis just to see their elected representatives here in Washington purposely cause another crisis,” Obama said Monday on the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis.

“President Obama, Harry Reid, will scream and holler that the mean, nasty Republicans are threatening to shut down the government,” Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said on CNN in August. “And at that point, Republicans have to do something we haven’t done in a long time – stand up and win the argument.”

“We’re really seeing the same issues that have divided President Obama and the Republican House since January of 2011, coming back yet again, almost in this kind of circular loop that we’re stuck in of fiscal crises that we can’t get out of,” Brownstein said.

Now might be a whole new understanding of Bill Murray when his character, Phil Connors, punches Ned in the face after the umpteenth time of having the same, annoying interaction.

If that doesn’t happen quickly enough, then the sequestration fight will become tangled up in the need to renew funding for the federal government at the end of March. If Republicans don’t cave before then, they’ll precipitate a 1995-style government shutdown, public opinion will actually begin to control the outcome, and it’ll be game over.

So there are real dynamics at work here that can break the GOP’s resolve in this fight but that can’t easily be turned against Obama."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/06/news/economy/spending-cuts/index.html,2013-03-06 00:00:00,['Jeanne Sahadi'],Why spending cuts may be here to stay,"The threat of automatic budget cuts was supposed to light a fire under lawmakers and force them to do their jobs.

Now that the cuts are in effect, they may end up being a crutch to let Congress avoid making tough choices about where money should be spent and where it should be cut.

Sure, both parties continue to decry the across-the-board cuts, which primarily hit discretionary spending and do nothing to address the key causes of the country's long-term debt problem.

So while there may be attempts to replace the cuts over the coming weeks, don't be shocked if they fail and the cuts stay in place for the rest of the year.

Why? Agreeing on how to replace them may continue to prove too contentious and less of a priority than other fiscal issues.

Congress must pass a bill to keep the government funded past March 27, or the government will shut down all but essential services. Since a shutdown is anathema to both parties, priority No. 1 right now is to avoid one.

Related: Spending cuts: When they'll really bite

As if to stress that point, President Obama indicated on Friday that he would sign a new funding bill even if it doesn't replace the sequester, assuming the bill met other conditions.

And on Monday, House Republicans proposed a bill that would authorize continued funding but doesn't replace the spending cuts. Instead, it offers the Pentagon some flexibility in how defense cuts are executed.

Senate Democrats are also expected to propose a funding bill that doesn't replace the sequester.

So while the risk of a shutdown may be declining, ""the chance the sequester is here to stay is increasing,"" said Sean West, U.S. policy director for the Eurasia Group.

Technically, the House and Senate might try to replace the sequester in their proposed budgets for 2014, due in mid-April. But the chambers' proposals will be so far apart in size and substance that the chances of reconciling the two are very low.

There's another built-in opportunity to replace the sequester -- the upcoming debate over raising the debt ceiling.

But the drop-dead deadline for that may not come until August. At that point, the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will be almost over, and the overriding priority will be to avoid default.

So it may be that only political pressure would force a compromise on replacing the sequester, said budget expert Charles Konigsberg.

The public pitching a fit might work. So, too, might terrible economic numbers.

While everyone agrees the sequester is no way to run a budget, there seems to be growing resignation that maybe this is the best Congress can do."

Rosa DeLauro decrying it as a ""death knell of the food stamp program.""

After weeks of pitched battle on Capitol Hill and in the media, the U.S. House of Representatives finally passed a farm bill on Thursday. The latest incarnation of the bill, which narrowly passed with zero Democratic votes, includes no provisions related to funding for SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps).

Since 1977, every incarnation of the farm bill—which subsidizes and regulate various programs related to agriculture and food production—has included food stamp funding. House leadership decided to carve SNAP out of the 2013 farm bill and place it in a separate piece of legislation after Democrats blocked an earlier version of the law which would have cut about $20.5 billion out of SNAP over the next decade.

Now that Republicans have successfully passed a version of the farm bill without SNAP funding, they will likely introduce a separate food stamp bill which is expected to include even deeper cuts than the $20.5 billion originally proposed. Several Republicans defected on the original farm bill because they did not consider the cuts to food stamps deep enough; House leadership will likely design the separate food stamps bill with placating those members in mind.

The farm bill vote was preceded by a vicious floor debate. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said the revised farm bill would be “the death knell of the food stamp program.”

“A vote for this bill is a vote to end nutrition programs in America,” she said. She also accused the Republican House leadership of violating its own rules by bringing the new bill to a vote fewer than three days after it had been introduced.

“I would have said it’s one of the worst things you’ve done, but there’s such stiff competition for that honor,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

Republicans framed the debate in bloodless terms, saying that separating food stamps from agricultural policy was the logical thing to do. Rules committee chair Pete Session, R-Texas, said the new version of the bill “excludes some extraneous provisions,” a statement that drew outrage from his Democratic colleagues.

“These people are not extraneous,” said DeLauro of food stamp recipients.

The White House has threatened a veto of the House bill. It will now proceed to conference committee, where it will be merged with a Senate farm bill that includes some $4 billion in food stamp cuts."

They haven’t been unpacked since she was evicted from her last apartment.

You would think that in the shadow of a general election dubbed “Year of the Woman,” the last thing any Republican in Washington would want to do is tick off women.

And while the Violence Against Women Act passed in the Senate by a healthy bipartisan majority a few hours before President Obama’s State of the Union address, the fact that 22 senators – all Republicans, all men – voted against it should be troubling to GOP leaders.

And perhaps the most troubling aspect of that is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the so-called savior of the Republican Party, was one of those Republican men.

The two most memorable lines of President Barack Obama’s fourth State of the Union address were the ad-libbed: “Get it done” (which doesn’t appear in the remarks as prepared), and the emotional “They deserve a vote,” concerning victims of gun violence.

As exasperated appeals for an obstructionist Congress to get off its duff, the exhortations provided emotional catnip for Democrats. For the rest of us, however, they were sobering reminders of what governing liberalism has deteriorated into: content-free calls to take action for action’s sake.

Time and again, President Obama punctuated his proposals with the refrain: “We should be able to get that done.” After his call for “bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit,” he said: “We can get this done,” and later, “That’s what we can do together.”

The effort to take advantage of growing populism among voters in both parties is being coordinated by officials from the White House, labor unions and liberal advocacy groups.

In a series of strategy meetings and conference calls among them in recent weeks, they have focused on two levels: an effort to raise the federal minimum wage, which will be pushed by President Obama and congressional leaders, and a campaign to place state-level minimum wage proposals on the ballot in states with hotly contested congressional races.

With polls showing widespread support for an increase in the $7.25-per-hour federal minimum wage among both Republican and Democratic voters, top Democrats see not only a wedge issue that they hope will place Republican candidates in a difficult position, but also a tool with which to enlarge the electorate in a nonpresidential election, when turnout among minorities and youths typically drops off."

Detroit's Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr—a bankruptcy expert appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder earlier this year to oversee Detroit's finances—has said the federal bankruptcy filing is necessary to get the city out from under some $18 billion in liabilities.

But the city's employee unions argued the bankruptcy is an end-run around the state constitution, which protects their pension benefits. The unions backed a series of lawsuits filed in Michigan courts to block the bankruptcy. Last week, Ingham County Circuit Judge Rosemarie Aquilina ruled the bankruptcy filing unconstitutional, but a state appeals court put her ruling on hold, and Orr argued the federal court should make that stay indefinite.

The emergency manager said bankruptcy is a federal matter. A bankruptcy filing normally puts all other litigation on hold, but Orr's office asked the judge to extend that automatic stay to cover him and state officials, including the governor. Orr's attorneys acknowledged the request was unusual, but said ""recent events""—the lawsuits in state court—made it necessary.

""That kind of activity has got to stop,"" city attorney Heather Lennox said. Lennox is a partner at Jones Day—Orr's former law firm—which is collecting millions of dollars in legal fees from the city.

But attorney Sharon Levine, representing the local council of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, said the federal bankruptcy code ""is not there to enforce rights that do not exist.""

The unions said framers of the Michigan constitution decided to guard public employee pensions because public pensions have no insurance protection, unlike private pensions, which are insured by the federal Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.

""Here, there is no safety net,"" Levine said. She said nonuniformed employee pensions in Detroit are below $19,000 per year.



Attorney Robert Gordon, representing the police and fire pension funds, argued that because of the constitutional provision, the governor had no right to authorize the bankruptcy filing in the first place. As a result, Gordon said, the filing is ""void,"" and it was premature to even be discussing it in federal court.

""The motions assume facts not in evidence,"" Gordon said.

But the judge appeared unconvinced.

""How do you deal with the law that gives the bankruptcy court exclusive jurisdiction,"" Rhodes asked.

Gordon responded that there was no need to deal with the provision, because there was no valid bankruptcy filing to begin with.

Because of the intense interest in the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, the hearing was moved from Rhodes' normal courtroom to a much larger one across the street at the Theodore Levin Federal Courthouset. Many members of the public and the media were relegated to an overflow courtroom down the hall to view a video feed.

Outside the courthouse, a handful of protesters carried signs in support of the unions. One demonstrator played a recording of Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" speech through a megaphone.

City firefighter Mark Jackson.said he came to the courthouse because so much is at stake.

""I am scared. Scared that I will lose my retirement. I'm scared for all of us,"" Jackson told CNBC.

(Read more: Detroit bankruptcy could hit millions of retirees)

But Orr and Snyder have repeatedly insisted that city pensions will not be cut entirely under a bankruptcy. In an interview before the hearing, Orr said the majority of the pensions are funded, but there remains a $3.5 billion shortfall—and the city has no way to make it up.

""The money's not there,"" Orr said.

After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, the red ink is receding rapidly in Washington, easing pressure on policymakers but shattering hopes for a summertime budget deal.

Federal tax revenue is up and spending is down thanks to an improving economy, tax increases that took effect in January and the automatic budget cuts known as the sequester.

The sunnier outlook means that President Obama will be able to pay the nation’s bills for months without seeking additional borrowing authority from Congress — probably until Oct. 1, according to independent forecasts.

That might seem like good news, but it is unraveling Republican plans to force a budget deal before Congress takes its August break. Instead, the fiscal fight appears certain to bleed into the fall, when policymakers will face another multi-pronged crisis that pairs the need for a higher debt limit and the fresh risk of default with the threat of a full-scale government shutdown, which is also looming Oct. 1.

In the meantime, Republicans face a listless summer, with little appetite for compromise but no leverage to shape an agreement. Without that leverage, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Tuesday, there is no point in opening formal budget negotiations between the House and the Senate, because Democrats have no reason to consider the kind of far-reaching changes to Medicare and the U.S. tax code that Republicans see as fundamental building blocks of a deal.

View Graphic A new Goldman Sachs forecast predicts that the government will not reach its debt limit until early September or October. Part of the variable is whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac release tens of billions of dollars to taxpayers. The dotted lines show Goldman Sachs's three predicted debt limit scenarios.

“The debt limit is the backstop,” Ryan said before taking the stage at a debt summit organized by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation in Washington. “I’d like to go through regular order and get something done sooner rather than later. But we need to get a down payment on the debt. We need entitlement reform. We’re very serious about tax reform because we think that’s critical to economic growth and job creation. Those are the things we want to talk about.”

Democrats are urging Republicans to initiate talks well before the next deadline and at last resolve the long-standing dispute over whether to tame the debt solely by cutting spending, as Republicans demand, or also by raising taxes on the wealthy, as Obama insists.

“The American people — all of us — are tired of management by crisis,” Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said at the Peterson summit. “We need to start working now.”

But senior Senate Republicans, including several who recently dined with Obama and huddled with administration officials, conceded that it may be tough to bring their colleagues to the table too far ahead of the debt-ceiling deadline.

“I think there’s a better atmosphere for a solution than there’s been in the past, but I’m a little worried about people here in the Senate having fiscal fatigue. There isn’t any sense of urgency right now,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), one of three senators who joined Obama on Monday for a round of golf.

“We need to realize this debt ceiling is out there. It’s inevitable. It’s coming. And [the later deadline] should not relieve pressure,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. But “sometimes we don’t want to act until a gun is at our heads.”

Since 2011, when Republicans gained control of the House and made cutting spending their top priority, Washington has faced a series of economy-rattling showdowns that produced eleventh-hour deals to cut spending, raise taxes and extend the federal debt limit. The most recent came during the year-end “fiscal cliff” fight, when Republicans reluctantly approved more than $600 billion in new taxes on the wealthy over the next decade.

Demoralized by that defeat — it was the first time in more than two decades that congressional Republicans had approved a significant tax hike — House GOP leaders developed a strategy that promised greater success: They would goad Senate Democrats into adopting a budget plan and force them into negotiations, even as automatic spending cuts started to take effect March 1, slashing agency budgets.

Meanwhile, the House took the unprecedented step of suspending the federal debt limit, then set at $16.4 trillion, until May 19. When the debt ceiling goes back into effect next weekend, the limit will automatically be lifted to account for any new borrowing. But Republicans calculated that the Treasury would almost immediately be in trouble again and in need of an even higher debt limit before the August break.

Ryan laid out the strategy for rank-and-file lawmakers at a January retreat in Williamsburg and during listening sessions on Capitol Hill. “These pressure points would come together and force a bargain on the budget,” said a GOP aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings. “This was Ryan’s spiel.”

The strategy, however, failed to account for the improving budget outlook. In February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that this year’s deficit would fall to $845 billion, down from nearly $1.1 trillion in 2012. Goldman Sachs recently predicted that the deficit would fall even further, to $775 billion, and return to sustainable levels within two years.

As a result, the national debt is rising far more slowly than in the frantic days after the 2008 economic crisis: The Treasury Department actually expects to repay a tiny sliver of the $16.8 trillion national debt by the end of June.

Much of the improvement stems from recent budget deals. Over the past two years, Congress has capped agency spending and created the sequester, which is trimming outlays on domestic programs and the military. Lawmakers also agreed to raise taxes on virtually every American this year, letting a temporary reduction in the payroll tax expire and tax rates rise for households earning more than $450,000 a year.

But other factors are at work, too. Defense spending has been declining rapidly with the end of the war in Iraq and the ongoing drawdown of forces in Afghanistan. A surprising — and apparently durable — slowdown in health-care costs has sharply reduced projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid. And the falling jobless rate and improving economy have helped push federal tax collections up 16 percent over last year, according to figures out Tuesday.

As a result, forecasts of the date when the debt is expected to hit the new debt limit have been slipping, from midsummer to late summer to early fall. Forecasters at Goldman and the Bipartisan Policy Center who have been watching the government’s cash-flow situation closely say the Treasury is all but certain to make it to Oct. 1 if Fannie Mae, the taxpayer-owned mortgage giant, and its sibling Freddie Mac turn over tens of billions of dollars as a result of their stronger financial status amid a recovering housing market. A decision is expected this week.

Treasury officials have declined to provide much guidance, citing “forecasting uncertainty.” That could change as May 19 draws near. Meanwhile, the White House has called the date irrelevant, saying that Obama will not negotiate over the debt limit and urging Republicans to act now to broker a debt-reduction deal.

“No one should threaten the default of the United States,” White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said Tuesday at the Peterson summit. “Democrat or Republican, for any reason, no one should use the default of the United States as a budget path or negotiating tool.”"

Committee suggests stronger government presence in disability hearings

Sen. Levin says the problem is fraud%2C not the disability programs themselves

WASHINGTON – A judge, an attorney and a number of doctors pocketed more than $4.5 million by fraudulently ensuring that disability claimants would receive Social Security benefits, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported Monday.

The committee released a report detailing the findings of a two-year investigation into the Huntington, W.Va., Social Security Office of Disability Adjunction and Review.

The investigation found that Eric Conn of the Kentucky-based Conn Law Firm worked in cahoots with an administrative law judge, who had responsibility for ruling on disability claims. The firm received more than $4.5 million from the Social Security Administration in attorney fees for obtaining disability benefits for thousands of claimants whose claims were improperly granted. Conn also compensated doctors up to $650 per case for signing off on medical opinions supporting claimants' disability applications.

The firm declined to comment on the allegations.

The Social Security disability assistance program, which provides more than $200 billion in benefits to nearly 14 million Americans annually, is at risk of running out of funding by 2016, according to the trustees who oversee the program.

""With the clock ticking on the agency's trust fund, some in Congress refuse to acknowledge the disability programs are broken and are in dire need of significant oversight,"" Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, a doctor and the top Republican on the committee, said in prepared remarks. ""While lawyers, doctors were getting rich by exploiting a broken program, the real victims were the claimants and the American taxpayer.""

The committee recommended that a Social Security Administration professional should represent the government in all disability claims hearings before administrative law judges.

However, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the investigation did not prove the benefits awarded to the claimants were incorrect.

""The point of this hearing is not to attack our disability programs, which play a critical role in the lives of many Americans,"" Levin said, ""but to spotlight the abusive conduct of a group of legal, medical, and judicial professionals exploiting those programs, and recommend measures to prevent similar abuses in the future.""

In 2011, an investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations confirmed a previous review that disability decisions made by judges were insufficient 22% of the time nationwide. Judges' decisions were also found to be a result of poor hearing practices and insufficient medical evidence."

A look at the Obama administration’s efforts in trying to help homeowners and bring the nation out of its housing slump.

A look at the Obama administration’s efforts in trying to help homeowners and bring the nation out of its housing slump.

A look at the Obama administration’s efforts in trying to help homeowners and bring the nation out of its housing slump.

The Obama administration is engaged in a broad push to make more home loans available to people with weaker credit, an effort that officials say will help power the economic recovery but that skeptics say could open the door to the risky lending that caused the housing crash in the first place.

President Obama’s economic advisers and outside experts say the nation’s much-celebrated housing rebound is leaving too many people behind, including young people looking to buy their first homes and individuals with credit records weakened by the recession.

In response, administration officials say they are working to get banks to lend to a wider range of borrowers by taking advantage of taxpayer-backed programs — including those offered by the Federal Housing Administration — that insure home loans against default.

Housing officials are urging the Justice Department to provide assurances to banks, which have become increasingly cautious, that they will not face legal or financial recriminations if they make loans to riskier borrowers who meet government standards but later default.

Officials are also encouraging lenders to use more subjective judgment in determining whether to offer a loan and are seeking to make it easier for people who owe more than their properties are worth to refinance at today’s low interest rates, among other steps.

Obama pledged in his State of the Union address to do more to make sure more Americans can enjoy the benefits of the housing recovery, but critics say encouraging banks to lend as broadly as the administration hopes will sow the seeds of another housing disaster and endanger taxpayer dollars.

“If that were to come to pass, that would open the floodgates to highly excessive risk and would send us right back on the same path we were just trying to recover from,” said Ed Pinto, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former top executive at mortgage giant Fannie Mae.

Administration officials say they are looking only to allay unnecessary hesi­ta­tion among banks and encourage safe lending to borrowers who have the financial wherewithal to pay.

“There’s always a tension that you have to take seriously between providing clarity and rules of the road and not giving any opportunity to restart the kind of irresponsible lending that we saw in the mid-2000s,” said a senior administration official who was not authorized to speak on the record.

The administration’s efforts come in the midst of a housing market that has been surging for the past year but that has been delivering most of the benefits to established homeowners with high credit scores or to investors who have been behind a significant number of new purchases.

“If you were going to tell people in low-income and moderate-income communities and communities of color there was a housing recovery, they would look at you as if you had two heads,” said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit housing organization. “It is very difficult for people of low and moderate incomes to refinance or buy homes.”

Before the crisis, about 40 percent of home buyers were first-time purchasers. That’s down to 30 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors.

From 2007 through 2012, new-home purchases fell 30 percent for people with credit scores above 780 (out of 800), according to Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke. But they declined 90 percent for people with scores between 680 and 620 — historically a respectable range for a credit score.

“If the only people who can get a loan have near-perfect credit and are putting down 25 percent, you’re leaving out of the market an entire population of creditworthy folks, which constrains demand and slows the recovery,” said Jim Parrott, who until January was the senior adviser on housing for the White House’s National Economic Council.

One reason, according to policymakers, is that as young people move out of their parents’ homes and start their own households, they will be forced to rent rather than buy, meaning less construction and housing activity. Given housing’s role in building up a family’s wealth, that could have long-lasting consequences.

“I think the ability of newly formed households, which are more likely to have lower incomes or weaker credit scores, to access the mortgage market will make a big difference in the shape of the recovery,” Duke said last month. “Economic improvement will cause household formation to increase, but if credit is hard to get, these will be rental rather than owner-occupied households.”

Deciding which borrowers get loans might seem like something that should be left up to the private market. But since the financial crisis in 2008, the government has shaped most of the housing market, insuring between 80 percent and 90 percent of all new loans, according to the industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. It has done so primarily through the Federal Housing Administration, which is part of the executive branch, and taxpayer-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, run by an independent regulator.

The FHA historically has been dedicated to making homeownership affordable for people of moderate means. Under FHA terms, a borrower can get a home loan with a credit score as low as 500 or a down payment as small as 3.5 percent. If borrowers with FHA loans default on their payments, taxpayers are on the line — a guarantee that should provide confidence to banks to lend.

But banks are largely rejecting the lower end of the scale, and the average credit score on FHA loans has stood at about 700. After years of intensifying investigations into wrongdoing in mortgage lending, banks are concerned that they will be held responsible if borrowers cannot pay. Under some circumstances, the FHA can retract its insurance or take other legal action to penalize banks when loans default.

“The financial risk of just one mistake has just become so high that lenders are playing it very, very safe, and many qualified borrowers are paying the price,” said David Stevens, Obama’s former FHA commissioner and now the chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The FHA, in coordination with the White House, is working to develop new policies to make clear to banks that they will not lose their guarantees or face other legal action if loans that conform to the program’s standards later default. Officials hope the FHA’s actions will then spur Fannie and Freddie to do the same.

The effort requires sign-on by the Justice Department and the inspector general of Department of Housing and Urban Development, agencies that investigate wrongdoing in mortgage lending.

“We need to align as much as possible with IG and the DOJ moving forward,” FHA Commissioner Carol Galante said. The HUD inspector general and Justice Department declined to comment.

The effort to provide more certainty to banks is just one of several policies the administration is undertaking. The FHA is also urging lenders to take what officials call “compensating factors” into account and use more subjective judgment when deciding whether to make a loan — such as looking at a borrower’s overall savings.

“My view is that there are lots of creditworthy borrowers that are below 720 or 700 — all the way down the credit-score spectrum,” Galante said. “It’s important you look at the totality of that borrower’s ability to pay.”"

Maxine Waters Inflates Sequester to '170 Million' Jobs Lost,"Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) had a dire prediction for America about sequestration, claiming that 170 million jobs would be lost as a result of the across-the-board cuts. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only about 140 million jobs in the whole country.

During a press conference on February 28, Waters told reporters of a visit by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke who told members of congress that sequestration is not the optimal way to cut the federal budget.

Talking of Bernanke’s comments, Waters claimed that “if sequestration takes place, that’s going to be a great setback. We don’t need to be having something like sequestration that’s going to cause these jobs losses, over 170 million jobs that could be lost.”

However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Table A-9, Selected Employment Indicators, in January of 2013 there were 141,614 million jobs in the current American economy.

Using Waters’ math, the US would lose about 30 million more jobs than it had to start with."

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., scrambled late Monday to iron out the specifics of an emerging budget proposal after a string of prior plans fizzled.

Reid appeared on the chamber floor Monday night to announce, ""We've made tremendous progress -- we are not there yet -- but tremendous progress, and everyone just needs to be patient.""

McConnell added, ""We've had a good day...I think it's safe to say we've made substantial progress and we look forward to making more progress in the near future.""

The House GOP Conference is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. to discuss the tentative framework of the budget proposal with members, many of whom cast a skeptical eye toward the details of the negotiations that were dripping out Monday night. The Senate Republican Conference is scheduled to meet at 11 a.m. to receive an update on negotiations.

More On This...

Resistance in the House could scuttle, or at least stall, anything that emerges from the Senate.

The White House abruptly postponed a meeting with congressional leaders set for Monday afternoon, to give senators space to work.

""We're going to get this done,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., claimed.

It's unclear whether the optimism would be matched by results. After several prior plans fell apart over the weekend, lawmakers are working on a tight timeframe. Congress, aside from grappling with the partial government shutdown, faces an Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling. After that date, the Treasury Department warns, the U.S. government will not be able to pay all its bills.

Fox News has learned that the emerging framework would raise the debt ceiling through February, and include a spending bill meant to last through Jan. 15.

Importantly, a tentative provision to repeal or delay the medical device tax in ObamaCare has been taken out, a senior Democratic aide said. But the proposal could include other modest items pertaining to ObamaCare, including income verification for those getting subsidies and a one-year delay of at least one obscure fee which had been sought by unions.

House Republicans are watching the negotiations play out, and according to sources still want to see provisions to strip ObamaCare subsidies for congressional staff. It's unclear where they will ultimately fall, but conservative members predicted a ""huge fight"" if McConnell ""completely capitulates.""

Negotiators are still tinkering with the framework, and the details could change.

Asked earlier Monday if they were closer to a deal, Reid said: ""I hope so.""A McConnell spokesman said the two were ""engaged in good faith negotiations and those talks will continue.""

The new framework appears to be driven largely by Senate Democrats, but potentially with buy-in from McConnell.

Pressure is mounting from all sides to reach an agreement. There is fear that the financial markets could start to dive if traders lose confidence that a deal will ultimately emerge. And furloughed federal workers, now entering week three of the partial shutdown, are just now starting to see the hit to their paychecks.

But both sides of the debate were having a difficult time keeping track of what the other wants out of a deal. A standoff that began as a fight by Republicans to unravel ObamaCare is now largely a fight over spending levels -- which has emerged as a major sticking point.

After a string of budget proposals fell apart over the weekend, GOP lawmakers on Sunday pointedly accused Democrats of trying to squeeze Republicans to roll back across-the-board spending cuts known as sequester.

""I agree that Republicans started with the overreach, but now Democrats are one tick too cute,"" Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""They are now overreaching.""

He said ""both sides need to come to the middle of the road.""

A prior plan, fronted by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, would have funded the government for six months, raised the debt limit through Jan. 31, and delayed the health care law's medical device tax.

As Reid dismissed the plan on Saturday, the dispute over spending levels escalated.

Republicans want to continue current spending at $986.7 billion and leave untouched the new round of cuts on Jan. 15 that would reduce the amount to $967 billion.

Democrats, though, want to figure out a way to undo the reductions, plus enact a long-term extension of the debt limit increase and a short-term spending bill to reopen the government.

Republicans bristled at Democrats' demands. A House Republican leadership aide said Sunday that Reid ""moved the goalposts"" by trying to ""violate"" spending levels set in the 2011 Budget Control Act.

But Democrats denied they were trying to violate those levels.

A Senate Democratic leadership aide said ""the suggestion that Democrats insist on breaking the budget caps is false and belied by the facts.""

Essentially, Democrats argue that they would accept current spending levels for a short period -- just not as long as Collins proposed -- so they can have another go at the sequester cuts in the near future.

Congressional sources confirmed to Fox News that the talks between Reid and McConnell are focusing on the length of the spending bill versus the length of the debt-ceiling increase. Reid wants a longer extension on the debt ceiling, but a shorter-term spending bill.

Unclear was whether any Senate deal would pass the Republican-controlled House by Thursday, though Senate Democrats were hoping momentum and the debt-ceiling deadline would pressure House lawmakers.

The deal was reached during a Friday night phone call between AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief executive Tom Donohue, according to several news organizations and confirmed by Fox News.

The deal was brokered by New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who also was on the phone call and is one of eight senators working on bipartisan reform legislation.

""This issue has always been the dealbreaker on immigration reform, but not this time,"" Schumer said.

""The strength of the consensus across America for just reform has afforded us the momentum needed to forge an agreement in principle to develop a new type of employer visa system,"" Trumka said in a statement late Saturday. ""We expect that this new program, which benefits not just business, but everyone, will promote long overdue reforms by raising the bar for existing programs.""

Despite the breakthrough, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s office cautioned Saturday that Congress still has a long way to go before passing legislation in the Democrat-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House.

Rubio sent a letter Saturday to Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., calling for a deliberate hearing process on the new legislation and cautioning against a ""rush to legislate.""

“Senate negotiators are making good progress on immigration reform, but we're not done yet,” Rubio press secretary Alex Conant tweeted Saturday.

White House spokesman Clark Stevens said Obama continues to be encouraged by the progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators.

“We look forward to seeing language once it is introduced and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible,” he said.



A source told The Associated Press, on the condition of anonymity, the deal resolves disagreements over wages for new, low-income workers and which industries would be included.

All members of the so-called Gang of Eight are expected to sign off on the agreement.

The remaining big hurdles to passage are securing the U.S. borders, cracking down on employers who hire illegally and creating a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country.

The bipartisan group is expected to introduce the bill officially the week of April 8, after Congress returns from a two-week recess.

The AFL-CIO and the Chamber had been fighting over wages for tens of thousands of low-skilled workers who would be brought in under the new program to fill jobs in construction, hotels and resorts, nursing homes and restaurants and other industries.

On Friday, officials from both sides said there was basic agreement on the wage issue, and Schumer said a final deal on the worker dispute was very close.

""We're feeling very optimistic on immigration: Aspiring Americans will receive the road map to citizenship they deserve and we can modernize `future flow' without reducing wages for any local workers, regardless of what papers they carry,"" AFL-CIO spokesman Jeff Hauser said in a statement earlier this week. ""Future flow"" refers to future arrivals of legal immigrants.

Under the emerging agreement between business and labor, a new ""W"" visa program would bring tens of thousands of lower-skilled workers a year to the country. The program would be capped at 200,000 a year, but the number of visas would fluctuate, depending on unemployment rates, job openings, employer demand and data collected by a new federal bureau pushed by the labor movement as an objective monitor of the market.

The workers would be able to change jobs and could seek permanent residency. Under current temporary worker programs, personnel can't move from employer to employer and have no path to permanent U.S. residence and citizenship. And currently there's no good way for employers to bring many low-skilled workers to the U.S. An existing visa program for low-wage nonagricultural workers is capped at 66,000 per year and is supposed to apply only to seasonal or temporary jobs.

The Chamber of Commerce said workers would earn actual wages paid to American workers or the prevailing wages for the industry they're working in, whichever is higher. The Labor Department determines prevailing wage based on customary rates in specific localities, so that it varies from city to city.

The low-skilled worker issue had loomed for weeks as perhaps the toughest matter to settle in months-long, closed-door talks on immigration among the senators, including Republicans John McCain, Arizona, and Rubio.

The issue helped sink the last major attempt at immigration overhaul in 2007, when the legislation foundered on the Senate floor after an amendment was added to end a temporary worker program after five years, threatening a key priority of the business community.

The amendment passed by just one vote, 49-48. Obama, a senator at the time, joined in the narrow majority voting to end the program after five years.

The president, who won roughly 71 percent of the Hispanic vote during his November re-election, has made immigration reform a key part of his second term. And Republicans are attempting to improve their relationship with Hispanics, the fasting growing segment of the U.S. populations.

Citizen soldiers lose jobs; U.S. government biggest offender,"The jobs of the nation’s citizen soldiers are supposed to be safe while they are serving their country: Federal law does not allow employers to penalize service members because of their military duties.

Yet every year, thousands of National Guard and Reserve troops coming home from Afghanistan and elsewhere find they have been replaced, demoted, denied benefits or seniority.

Government agencies are among the most frequent offenders, accounting for about a third of the more than 15,000 complaints filed with federal authorities since the end of September 2001, records show. Others named in the cases include some of the biggest names in American business, such as Wal-Mart and United Parcel Service.

With good jobs still scarce in many states, the illegal actions have contributed to historically high joblessness among returning National Guard and Reserve members — as high as 50% in some California units — and created a potential obstacle to serving.

“The whole point of the National Guard and reserves, how they save the country money, is they get paid only when they are serving,” said Sam Wright, director of the Service Members Law Center at the Reserve Officers Assn. “It’s a great deal for the country, but if we don’t protect their civilian jobs … they aren’t going to volunteer and serve.”

Veterans’ advocates say that the heavy use of the nation’s citizen-soldiers to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan placed a burden on employers in a tough economy. Even as 11 years of war wind down, Guard and Reserve members are being called up for peacekeeping and other duties around the world.

The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, a 1994 law that strengthened job protections for returning troops first introduced during World War II, requires that service members are reemployed in the type of position they would have attained if they had not been called to active duty.

Just how many service members are being denied jobs illegally is impossible to know. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office estimated in 2005 that fewer than a third of service members with complaints seek help from the government. Many don’t file lawsuits, either.

Even so, the Labor Department and Office of Special Counsel, which investigate complaints for possible prosecution, have seen cases surge from 848 in fiscal 2001 to 1,577 in the 12 months ending in September 2011. Last year, the agencies handled 1,436 new cases, according to preliminary figures.

A Defense Department program that tries to mediate disputes handled 2,884 cases in fiscal 2011 alone, including 299 that went to the Labor Department when they could not be resolved informally.

Although the law says the federal government should be a “model employer,” federal agencies accounted for nearly 20% of the formal complaints in fiscal 2012, about twice the share recorded in 2007. The departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs lead the way with 105 and 47 complaints respectively.

President Obama instructed federal agencies last July to intensify efforts to ensure compliance. But officials say it has been a challenge to ensure that supervisors working at offices across the country are familiar with the requirements.

Obtaining redress can take months, if not years. For service members, the experience can be a maddening double-blow.

Lt. Col. Pierre Saint-Fleur, a former Fresno County mental health worker who deployed three times to Iraq as a military chaplain, said he was forced into early retirement because of his service in the California National Guard. He protested to the Labor Department’s Veterans’ Employment and Training Service but said he was told the case had no merit.

“I felt betrayed,” Saint-Fleur said. “This same government that called me to go into harm’s way, into a war zone, failed me when I got back and lost my job.”

Saint-Fleur said he had no problem getting rehired after he demobilized in 2008. But he said he quickly saw that he was no longer welcome at the Department of Children and Family Services, where he had worked as a counselor for 18 years.

Instead of getting his old office back, he was given a desk in what he described as a trailer, with no privacy for counseling patients — a situation he feared could cost him his license. He said his work was criticized, his authority was reduced to the level of a student intern and a fraud investigation was opened alleging that he had been overbilling patients — claims he said were baseless.

“I had no choice but to leave,” he said.

Only after hiring a private attorney did he win a $100,000 settlement, court and county records show. The county did not admit fault in the 2010 settlement. Fresno County officials did not return calls seeking comment.

Government agencies and Fortune 500 companies — especially defense contractors — are major employers of people who serve in the armed forces and might be expected to experience the most disputes. State and local governments accounted for more than 20% of the complaints last year and private companies nearly 60%.

Government officials note that many of these cases are the result of misunderstandings that may not amount to breaking the law.

“It’s not an intuitively obvious law,” said Lt. Col. Melissa Phillips, deputy director of the Defense Department’s Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. “We have individual supervisors who are continually changing, and so it’s a continual education process.”

That can also be an issue at large companies.

Home Depot has won awards for its support of current and former military members, who make up about 10% of its workforce. But Brian Bailey, an Iraq veteran and former California National Guard member, said his supervisors at a Home Depot store in Flagstaff, Ariz., complained about having to find a replacement when he was called up for training or to fight a brush fire.

“They think you have a weekend off,” he said.

In 2010, two years after Bailey was promoted to department supervisor, he was fired. At the recommendation of Labor officials, the Justice Department investigated and filed suit. Home Depot did not admit wrongdoing but agreed last year to pay Bailey $45,000 and to update its policies to provide explicit protection for workers needing to take military leave.

“We would never tolerate the termination of any of our employees for illegitimate reasons,” said Stephen Holmes, a company spokesman. At any time, about 1,500 Home Depot employees across the nation are on military leaves of absence, he said.

Bailey’s grievance took two years to resolve. Veterans complain that the process can take too long and that investigators are too inclined to take the word of employers.

A Labor official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said most disputes are resolved without recourse to the courts. He acknowledged past problems, but said the department has revamped its training for investigators. It now takes an average of 60 days to complete an investigation, he said.

But attorneys for aggrieved service members say some employers have grown sophisticated about trying to get around the law. Rather than wait to see if deploying troops will want their old jobs back, some hand out pink slips as soon as they are notified that their employees are expecting orders. Others refuse to hire people who serve in the Guard and Reserve, a form of discrimination that is illegal but difficult to prove.

Enrique Ostojic, an Air Force reservist, said he lost a job offer after he told a prospective employer about his military obligations. Ostojic said a San Diego-based security firm offered him a full-time position but changed the offer to part-time after learning he would need some weekends off for training.

When he complained to the Labor Department, he said he was told insufficient evidence existed to pursue a case against the company, which is now closed. “Apparently my word isn’t good enough,” he said.

Advertisement

Ostojic said he didn’t take the matter further because he couldn’t afford a lawyer on his Reserve pay. Last year, he showed up at a veterans’ job fair, where he collected a stack of brochures from such companies as UPS and Verizon.

“At least I feel confident that if they are here, I am not going to be discriminated against,” Ostojic said. Yet records show that these and other companies at the job fair have been the subject of repeated complaints.

Advertisement

The Labor Department investigated eight new claims against UPS last year and 11 in fiscal 2011. Verizon was the subject of six complaints in the last two years. Officials at the two companies declined to discuss specific cases but said they go out of their way to recruit and retain military members.

Wal-Mart was named in 29 cases, more than any other Fortune 500 company. Officials at the company did not respond to requests for comment. The Labor Department did not identify smaller employers, to protect the privacy of complainants.

Some veterans’ advocates would like to see the law strengthened to include punitive damages and mandatory attorney’s fees. For willful violations, courts can require employers to pay twice the amount of compensation a service member lost, but critics say the awards are often small.

Ramsey Sulayman, a legislative associate for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said he believes employers are “rolling the dice” and getting away with breaking the law.

“It’s a paper tiger,” Sulayman said. “There’s nothing that will prevent an employer from violating over and over and over.”

http://news.yahoo.com/budget-cuts-loom-government-shutdown-221551357.html,,[],"As budget cuts loom, is government shutdown next?","WASHINGTON (AP) -- With big, automatic budget cuts about to kick in, House Republicans are turning to mapping strategy for the next showdown just a month away, when a government shutdown instead of just a slowdown will be at stake.

Both topics are sure to come up at the White House meeting Friday between President Barack Obama and top congressional leaders, including Republican House Speaker John Boehner. A breakthrough on replacing or easing the imminent across-the-board spending cuts still seems unlikely at the first face-to-face discussion between Obama and Republican leaders this year.

To no one's surprise, even as a dysfunctional Washington appears incapable of averting a crisis over economy-rattling spending cuts, it may be lurching toward another over a possible shutdown.

Republicans are planning for a vote next week on a bill to fund the day-to-day operations of the government through the Sept. 30 end of the 2013 fiscal year — while keeping in place the new $85 billion in cuts of 5 percent to domestic agencies and 8 percent to the military.

The need to keep the government's doors open and lights on — or else suffer the first government shutdown since 1996 — requires the GOP-dominated House and the Democratic-controlled Senate to agree. Right now they hardly see eye to eye.

The House GOP plan, unveiled to the rank and file on Wednesday, would award the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs with their line-by-line budgets, for a more-targeted rather than indiscriminate batch of military cuts, but would deny domestic agencies the same treatment. And that has whipped up opposition from veteran Democratic senators on the Appropriations Committee. Domestic agencies would see their budgets frozen almost exactly as they are, which would mean no money for new initiatives such as cybersecurity or for routine increases for programs such as low-income housing.

""We're not going to do that,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ""Of course not.""

Story continues

Any agreement needs to pass through a gantlet of House tea party conservatives intent on preserving the across-the-board cuts and Senate Democrats pressing for action on domestic initiatives, even at the risk of creating a foot-tall catchall spending bill.

There's also this: GOP leaders have calculated that the automatic cuts arriving on Friday need to be in place in order for them to be able to muster support from conservatives for the catchall spending bill to keep the government running. That's because many staunch conservatives want to preserve the cuts even as defense hawks and others fret about the harm that might do to the military and the economy. If the automatic cuts are dealt with before the government-wide funding bill gets a vote, there could be a conservative revolt.

""The overall sequester levels must hold,"" said Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif.

Little to no progress has been made so far between House and Senate leaders and the White House, and given the hard feelings engulfing Washington, there's no guarantee that this problem can be solved, even though the stakes — a shutdown of non-essential government programs after March 27 — carry more risk than the across-the-board cuts looming on Friday.

The funding plan for the rest of the fiscal year will be a main topic at the White House meeting on Friday, the March 1 deadline day for averting the across-the-board cuts.

Obama, speaking to a group of business executives Wednesday night, said the cuts would be a ""tumble downward"" for the economy, though he acknowledged it could takes weeks before many Americans feel the full impact of the budget shrinking.

The warring sides in Washington have spent this week assigning blame rather than seeking a bipartisan way out. In a glimpse of the state of debate on Wednesday, Republicans and the White House bickered over whether the cuts would be under way by the time Friday's meeting started. A spokesman for Boehner said they would be in place; the White House countered that Obama would in fact have until midnight Friday to set them in motion.

The cumbersome annual ritual of passing annual agency spending bills collapsed entirely last year — not a single one of the 12 annual appropriations bills for the budget year that began back in October has passed Congress — and Congress has to act by March 27 to prevent a partial shutdown of the government.

By freezing budgets for domestic agencies, the Republican plan would deny an increase for a big cybersecurity initiative, additional money to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal and money to build new Coast Guard cutters. GOP initiatives such as more money for the Small Business Administration or fossil fuels research would be hurt as well, but there's little appetite for the alternative, which is to stack more than $1 trillion worth of spending bills together for a single up-or-down vote.

But the GOP move to add the line-by-line spending bills for the Pentagon and veterans' programs to the catchall spending bill would give the military much-sought increases for force readiness and the Veterans Administration additional funding for health care.

That approach has few fans in the White House, which is seeking money to implement Obama's signature efforts to overhaul financial regulation and the nation's health care system, or within the Democratic Senate, where members of the Appropriations Committee want to add a stack of bills covering domestic priorities such as homeland security, NASA and federal law enforcement agencies like the FBI.

""You need balance,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ""We feel as strongly about the domestic side as we do defense.""

The catchall spending measure, known as a continuing resolution or CR inside Washington, was originally seen as a potential must-pass measure to avert Friday's cuts or make them less severe. But no serious talks to avert the cuts have been under way.

On Thursday, Democrats will force a vote on a measure that would forestall the automatic cuts through the end of the year, replacing them with longer-term cuts to the Pentagon and cash payments to farmers and installing a minimum 30 percent tax rate on income exceeding $1 million. But that plan is virtually certain to be toppled by a GOP-led filibuster vote.

Republicans in turn are considering offering a measure that would give Obama authority to propose a rewrite to the 2013 budget to redistribute the cuts. Obama would be unable to cut defense by more than the $43 billion reduction that the Pentagon currently faces, and would also be unable to raise taxes to undo the cuts. The GOP plan would allow a resulting Obama proposal to go into effect unless Congress passed a resolution to overturn it.

The idea is that money could be transferred from lower-priority accounts to accounts funding air traffic control or meat inspection. But the White House says that such moves would offer only slight relief. At the same time, however, it could take pressure off of Congress to address the sequester.

In the House, where Republicans in the past Congress passed legislation to replace the cuts, Boehner has said it's now up to Obama and the Senate to figure a way out. The Senate never took up the House-passed bills, which expired when the new Congress was seated in January."

UPDATE: 4:14 p.m. ET-- In a Monday letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said latest estimates show the U.S. hitting the debt limit by the middle of October.

""Protecting the full faith and credit of the United States is the responsibility of Congress because only Congress can extend the nation's borrowing authority,"" Lew writes. ""Failure to meet that responsibility would cause irreparable harm to the American economy.""

Read Lew's letter to Boehner:

Previously:

The U.S. Treasury is on track to hit the debt limit by mid-October, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

The report provides a more specific timeline than previously cited by Treasury officials. Previously, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said he anticipated the U.S. would not hit the debt ceiling ""until Labor Day.""

""The uncertainty caused by putting this off is not good,"" Lew said in May. ""The anxiety caused to the U.S. and world economy by putting this off until the last minute is not good.""

The Wall Street Journal reports:

The mid-October timeframe is sooner than many on Capitol Hill had anticipated. The government hit the borrowing limit several months ago, but Treasury has used emergency measures—such as suspending certain pension contributions—to buy more time for Congress to act. Some believed that the government's improving fiscal condition—bolstered by rising tax revenue and money coming in from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—could give Treasury even more time, potentially until sometime in December.

Last week, Lew called on Congress to raise the debt ceiling, urging lawmakers to ""avoid another unnecessary self-inflicted wound"" ahead of the Treasury exceeding the limit.

""We cannot afford for Congress to wait until some unknowable last minute to resolve this matter on the eve of a deadline,"" Lew said.

As Reuters reported last week, House Republicans have floated using the debt limit as leverage to defund President Barack Obama's health care reform law.

""There are plenty of discussions ongoing but no decisions at this point,"" one GOP leadership aide said."

While a growing chorus in Washington, including President Barack Obama, House Speaker John Boehner, multiple Cabinet secretaries, and some political pundits, criticize deep, automatic spending cuts set to take effect on March 1, the White House and Congress have yet to come up with an alternative to avoid them.

2 - Provisions in the Budget Act of 2011 that can result in automatic spending cuts: Appropriating funds over newly established spending caps for years 2012-2021, where the extra amount is automatically cut, and failure of Congress to enact specific deficit-reduction legislation, which has happened.

$1.2 trillion - Total amount of the potential sequestration cuts, over 10 years. This is based on the amount not cut from the deficit by the congressional “super committee” created by the Budget Control Act of 2011.

(CNN) —

Two steps forward, one step back.

A surge of optimism on Monday for a possible compromise to end the partial government shutdown and avoid a U.S. default as soon as this week got jolted by the sudden postponement of a White House meeting between President Barack Obama and congressional leaders.

In a brief statement, the White House said the meeting announced earlier in the day was put on hold “to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress” toward a solution.

It was unclear if the development signaled a problem or was needed to give more time for talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, to finish an agreement that could win approval in the Senate and the House.

7 crazy side effects from the shutdown

Negotiations heated up with the Democratic and Republican leaders signaling progress. Both Reid and McConnell took to the Senate floor to express optimism for a compromise on the twin priorities that they expected to be reasonable and acceptable to both sides.

Reid’s tone remained positive as night fell over the Capitol.

“We’ve made tremendous progress,” he said, saying that “everyone just needs to be patient” and that “perhaps tomorrow will be a bright day.”

Key negotiators also maintained an upbeat posture and financial markets, which Washington is watching very closely considering their volatility over the political impasse, also ended the day higher with Wall Street heartened by news of a possible deal, especially on the debt limit.

At the same time, both sides noted that nothing had been finalized and the postponement of the meeting between congressional leaders and Obama and Vice President Joe Biden raised a new question mark in the process.

Supporters stand by representatives and government shutdown

During a visit Monday to a local food pantry, Obama cited progress in the Senate negotiations but also warned of what he called continued partisan brinkmanship by House Republicans who “continue to think that somehow they can extract concessions by keeping the government shut down or by threatening default.”

“My hope is a spirit of cooperation will move us forward over the next few hours,” Obama said.

Shutdown drags on

The failure of Congress to authorize spending for the new fiscal year triggered the shutdown on October 1.

Another deadline looms on Thursday, when the Treasury says it will need Congress to raise the debt ceiling so it can borrow more money to pay all the government’s bills.

During his visit to Martha’s Table in Washington, Obama said the congressional leaders could “solve this problem today.”

The crisis with an on/off switch

He warned that a default, in which the government would lack enough cash on hand to pay down its debt obligations as well as other daily bills such as Social Security checks, “could have a potentially devastating effect on our economy.”

“We’ve already had a damaging effect on our economy because of the shutdown,” he said. “That damage would be greatly magnified if we don’t make sure that government’s paying its bills, and that has to be decided this week.”

The Treasury Department said it will be unable to pay the government’s bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday.

As reported by CNN’s Dana Bash and CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta, the main sticking point involves how long an agreement would fund the government to end the shutdown and increase the debt limit.

Democrats want the debt ceiling increase to extend as long as possible to avoid similar showdowns in coming months.

Conservatives defiant in the face of GOP troubles

At the same time, they seek a temporary spending plan to reopen the government while formal budget negotiations work out a longer-term agreement that can negate the impacts of the forced sequestration cuts.

Republicans, however, want a longer spending proposal that would lock in the planned sequestration cuts in coming months, with a shorter debt ceiling extension in order to negotiate further deficit-reduction measures.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine have spearheaded the bipartisan talks. Separately, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee also cited progress.

“We’ll get this done. We’re gonna get this done. I feel real confident,” Manchin said.

Manchin said the goal was to get at least 65 Senate votes – which would mean 10 or more from Republicans – to help Speaker John Boehner generate GOP backing in the House despite certain opposition from the tea party conservative wing.

Manchin said Reid and McConnell must work out specifics.

The two party leaders met twice in the morning and early afternoon, and they offered their optimistic assessments after their second face-to-face discussion. Boehner also dropped by McConnell’s office to get an update on the talks, his aide confirmed.

Details of proposal fluid

Democratic sources told Bash and CNN’s Deirdre Walsh that the proposal under consideration by Reid and McConnell would fund the government through January 15, allowing it to reopen for at least three months or so.

At the same time, negotiations on a budget for the full fiscal year would have a deadline of some time in December, the sources said.

Meanwhile, the debt ceiling would be increased through February 7 to put off the threat of default for almost four months, according to sources in both parties.

The budget negotiations were expected to address deficit reduction measures and therefore could impact when the debt limit would need to be increased again.

Paul Ryan steps into budget fight

In addition, provisions involving Obama’s signature health care reforms could be included, such as strengthening verification measures for people seeking federal subsidies to help them purchase health insurance required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the sources said.

Another possible change to the health care reforms would delay a fee on employers, unions and other plan sponsors that raise money to compensate insurance companies for taking on high-risk customers in the early years of Obamacare.

CNN political analyst John Avlon said Monday that Democrats wanted to press what they perceive as an advantage over Republicans on how the public is perceiving the latest round of Washington budget and deficit brinkmanship.

“What’s behind it (are) poll numbers that saw Republicans getting their butt kicked because of this whole gamesmanship,” Avlon said.

Mindful that the Thursday debt deadline is days away, House Republican leaders are considering all their options even as Republican and Democratic Senate leaders try to craft a deal on the debt ceiling, said a GOP leadership aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/22/americas-richest-states_n_3972653.html,2013-09-22 00:00:00,['Wall St.'],The 10 Richest States In America: 24/7 Wall St.,"Last year, household income remained effectively unchanged, according to data released this week by the U.S. Census Bureau. This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012.

“The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year” said Economic Policy Institute’s Elise Gould. “We’re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.”

While the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 — nearly half that of Maryland’s.

Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. “We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don’t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.”

States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did.

Employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state’s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.

Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state’s household income. “When we’re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it’s about jobs.” Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.

Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.

The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.

At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed.

“There’s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,” Danziger said. “Even when manufacturers haven’t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.”

To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2012, as well as 2012 ACS data on health insurance coverage, employment and poverty.

Davidson Previously Was An Assistant City Editor At The Washington Post', 'A Washington', 'Foreign Correspondent With The Wall Street Journal', 'Where He Covered Federal Agencies', 'Political Campaigns.']",Shutdown could boost perception of federal employees,"In a weird way, this stupid government shutdown could improve the perception of federal employees.

Also strange: The Republican-led House, which has often targeted the federal payroll, has unanimously approved a bill that would allow federal workers, too often unjustly criticized as overpaid do-nothings, to get paid for doing nothing.

While nothing about this shutdown makes sense, it is good that the public is getting a better appreciation for the federal workforce. And if Congress is going to pay federal workers, it should let them go back to work.

Shut down the shutdown.

The longer it goes, the more taxpayers will miss the services government and its workers provide. In recent days, a few things have shown how much the government, and therefore its employees, mean to people:

●A Capitol Police officer was injured trying to protect the legislative grounds against a potential attack. An apparently mentally disturbed woman wildly drove her car to Capitol Hill after crashing a barricade at the White House and injuring a uniformed Secret Service officer. Members of the House gave Capitol Police a standing ovation. (As heroic as some officers were, that should not detract from a vigorous and thorough investigation into the fatal shooting by police of the woman while she was in the car with her infant daughter.)

●Rep. Randy Neugebauer’s ridiculous outburst against a National Park Service employee who was merely following orders, which might be overly restrictive, to close monuments. She was defended by another federal employee who confronted the congressman, a Republican from Texas.

●The vote to pay furloughed employees.

“I was surprised that we got a unanimous vote,” said Rep. James P. Moran (D-Va.), a co-sponsor of the legislation. Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), who has a long history of supporting federal employees, also was a co-sponsor.

Wolf “was really instrumental” in securing votes from his caucus, according to Moran. Some Republicans, Moran said, were skeptical about paying people who are not working, but eventually they agreed. “I’d love to think this portends something for the future,” he said. “I’m not sure. I’m not that optimistic.”

But if only for the moment, the news of 407 members of the House — including Neugebauer — agreeing to pay federal employees on furlough is worth savoring. It shows respect for workers who want to work but cannot, through no fault of their own. By the way, the 24 members who did not vote were a bipartisan group: 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats. The bill is expected to pass the Senate.

The vote gives Republicans “some cover for some of the insidious things they’ve passed,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) — evidence that they are “not rabidly anti-government.”

Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said, “There’s a wide recognition that it’s not the individual federal employee’s fault. Each of our offices employs federal workers.”

Republicans think “too many federal workers earn too much money,” he added, “but we’re not spiteful enough to take that out on some worker at the Interior Department.”

If the bill becomes law, it weakens the argument for keeping the government closed.

“Our argument will be, we’re paying these folks, they need to be able to work and earn their pay,” Moran said. “I think it is a compelling argument.”

But Republicans aren’t buying the argument that federal employees should get back to work through passage of a “clean CR.” They have insisted on junking up a temporary government funding measure, called a continuing resolution, with attacks on the Affordable Care Act. Although the have tried and failed many times to derail the health-care law, House Republicans decided to make another attempt by tying implementation of the law to the funding measure, effectively derailing the government.

Speaker John A. Boehner’s (R-Ohio) says that there are not enough votes to pass a clean CR, but various independent tallies, including one by The Washington Post, indicate he is wrong. Allow the vote, and let the tally show who is right. If Boehner is, he has nothing to lose.

The public apparently understands there is no good reason not to vote on a clean bill and allow it to rise or fall on its own merits. A new Washington Post/ABC poll indicates that 70 percent of those surveyed disapprove of the way Republicans are handling the budget situation. Although neither the congressional Democrats nor President Obama fare well in the poll, they look good by comparison, and their numbers are moving, albeit slightly, toward greater public approval.

Meanwhile, as GOP fortunes sink, the shutdown resulting from their budget strategy is boosting compassion for federal employees.

“For your rank-and-file federal worker, there is a lot of sympathy for them getting caught up in the pigsty that is Washington, D.C.,” Chaffetz said. “Everybody is very sympathetic to that.”

Despite the bill sailing out of the House last week on a strong bipartisan vote, Senate Republicans say the plan unfairly forces veterans to pick up the cost of new spending. The provision generating heated opposition from Veterans of Foreign Wars and allied lawmakers would cut retirement benefits for military retirees by $6 billion over 10 years.

""It's unacceptable to single out our men and women in uniform in this way,"" said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., who on Monday is joining New Hampshire veterans groups to protest the bill.

The turbulence comes ahead of a key test vote on Tuesday. In sharp contrast to the confident statements issued by House leaders ahead of their vote last week, Senate leaders indicate they're still corralling support.

""The struggle is still on in the United States Senate,"" Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in an interview on Sunday.

Democrats need to hold most their caucus of 55 senators together and pick up a handful of GOP senators in order to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance the bill.

But the Republican ""no"" votes were piling up over the weekend. Unlike in the House side, where Speaker John Boehner aggressively battled conservative groups trying to kill the bill, GOP leaders in the Senate are signaling opposition, or at least resistance, to the package. One member of the leadership team, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, announced Friday that he opposes the deal because it breaches spending caps put in place by a 2011 budget deal ""and doesn't include meaningful spending reforms that address our debt and deficit.""

Meanwhile, Ayotte and other senators are rallying opposition against the military retiree provision.

The bill includes a 1 percent reduction in cost-of-living benefits for many retirees under 62 years old. It also requires most federal civilian employees to pay more toward their pensions -- however, that provision affects only new hires, while the change for military retirees could affect those currently serving.

""Unfortunately, our current and future military retirees were not provided with similar protections that current civilian federal employees are receiving under this act,"" Ayotte, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., wrote in a letter to colleagues.

They called the provision ""unacceptable."" They estimated that a 42-year-old sergeant first class retiree would lose roughly $72,000 under this change.

The three senators indicated they could support the bill if the military retiree provision is changed. It's unclear whether Senate leaders would consider making such changes -- as that likely would require another vote in the House.

Durbin, speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" predicted Senate leaders will need ""about eight Republicans"" to support the bill on Tuesday -- indicating he expects about three Democratic defections.

""I feel we'll have a good, strong showing from the Democratic side. But we need bipartisan support to pass it,"" he said.

On the other side of the Hill, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan was defending his compromise budget deal, and suggesting congressional Republicans will be more demanding of Democrats during the upcoming debit-limit talks.

""We as a caucus -- along with our Senate counterparts -- are going to meet and discuss what it is we're going to want out of the debt limit,"" the Wisconsin Republican told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We don't want nothing out of this debt limit. We're going to decide what it is we're going to accomplish out of this debt-limit fight.""

Congress faces a Jan. 15 deadline to pass a budget bill or risk another partial government shutdown. The debt-ceiling deadline is expected to hit sometime in February."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-challenges-gop-accept-corporate-tax-deal-180909359.html,,[],Obama challenges GOP to accept corporate tax deal,"CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) — President Barack Obama on Tuesday offered congressional Republicans a new corporate tax cut and jobs spending package he said might ""help break through some of the political logjam in Washington,"" only to have GOP lawmakers immediately throw cold water on the idea.

The announcement and quick rejection underscored how elusive common ground is between the Democratic White House and Republicans in Congress on fiscal issues. The divide was particularly stark on the corporate tax proposal given that both parties generally have supported overhauling the code for businesses, though the White House and Republicans have differed on specifics.

Obama outlined his proposal in a speech at a massive Amazon.com plant in Chattanooga, his latest stop on a summertime campaign to refocus his agenda on the economy. He said ""serious people"" in both parties should accept his offer.

""I'm willing to work with Republicans on reforming our corporate tax code, as long as we use the money from transitioning to a simpler tax system for a significant investment in creating middle-class jobs,"" Obama said. ""That's the deal.""

But the office of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, complained that Obama's plan was simply a repackaging of proposals the White House has always supported.

""It's the opposite of a concession,"" said spokesman Brendan Buck, noting that Republicans want to link a corporate tax overhaul with changes in the individual tax code.

In another sign of their sour relationship, Boehner and the White House also dueled over the proposal's rollout, with the speaker's office saying officials there first learned about the plan from media reports. An Obama spokesman said the White House tried to tell Boehner's staff about the plan a day in advance but the call was not returned.

Like Republicans, the president previously has called for corporate tax reform to be coupled with an individual tax overhaul. But his new offer drops that demand and calls only for lowering the corporate rate from 35 percent to 28 percent, with an even lower effective tax rate of 25 percent for manufacturers.

Story continues

The White House also said the president will continue to seek changes to the individual tax rate as part of a larger ""grand bargain"" he wants with the GOP. But with the prospects of such a deal growing increasingly slim, Obama advisers say they've opted to isolate an area on taxes where they believe they have more agreement with Republicans.

Obama also wants lawmakers to pour one-time revenue generated from the tax overhaul into jobs programs, including infrastructure, manufacturing and community colleges.

""If we're going to give businesses a better deal, we're going to give workers a better deal too,"" the president said.

Republicans have opposed using tax revenue to support more spending. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Tuesday that ""everything should be negotiated, but certainly I'm not in support of it.""

Administration officials said the jobs programs would be paid for with a one-time revenue boost from measures such as changing depreciation rules or having a one-time fee on earnings held overseas. But they wouldn't put a price tag on the revenue total or the corporate tax overhaul at large.

When Obama first unveiled his corporate tax plan last year, congressional Republicans called for even deeper cuts for the business world. His campaign rival, Mitt Romney, wanted a 25 percent corporate tax rate.

The U.S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, but many businesses avoid the full cost by taking advantage of deductions, credits and exemptions that Obama wants to eliminate.

Obama wants to do away with corporate tax benefits like oil and natural gas industry subsidies, special breaks for the purchase of private jets and certain corporate tax shelters. He also wants to impose a minimum tax on foreign earnings, a move opposed by multinational corporations and perhaps the most contentious provision in the president's plan.

John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable, welcomed Obama's call for lowering the corporate tax rate. But like many Republican lawmakers, he called for addressing individual tax rates at the same time and said he opposed using corporate tax overhaul revenue for ""unrelated spending.""

""Corporate tax reform should be part of a comprehensive fix for the individual and business tax codes, and corporate reform should be achieved in a revenue-neutral manner,"" said Engler, who heads the association of business leaders.

The backdrop for Obama's remarks Tuesday was an Amazon fulfillment center, a massive, 1 million-square-foot warehouse. During a tour of the facility, Obama was shown how the company gets packages ready for delivery, from the employees who pull orders from three stories of floor-to-ceiling shelves, to loading into boxes sealed with water-activated tape and quality control

Amazon announced Monday that it would add 7,000 new jobs, including 5,000 more at U.S. distribution centers that currently employ about 20,000 workers who pack and ship customer orders.

Mr. Obama’s offensive will begin on Wednesday in Galesburg, Ill., with what his aides are saying will be a major address on economic policy at Knox College. Officials declined to provide details of the president’s message, but said he would set his terms for what they expect will be another bruising battle with a Republican-controlled House over the nation’s fiscal policies.

September will be the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis that underscored that recession, and White House officials said Mr. Obama wanted to take stock of the economy’s recovery and chart a path forward."

In a wide-ranging conversation, Steve Schwarzman, Blackstone Group chairman & CEO, discusses his company's pledge to support innovation and weighs in on Dell's LBO, the private equity space, and the outlook on the market. ""Blackstone is now the largest owner of individual houses in the United States,"" Schwarzman told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" Monday, pointing to his company's $3 billion portfolio of residential real estate.

Fix the Debt financier Peter G. Peterson knows a thing or two about debt: he’s an expert at creating it. Peterson founded the private equity firm Blackstone Group in 1985 with Stephen Schwarzman (who compared raising taxes to “when Hitler invaded Poland”). Private equity firms don’t contribute much to the economy; they don’t make cars or milk the cows. Too frequently, they buy firms to loot them.

90% of his business!Where does that leave the typical homebuyer? With a 10% chance - cause these investment companies have an advantage in the market that typical homebuyers do not have.""ordinary buyers are feeling squeezed out"".$100 million - per week""the nation's largest owner of single-family homes.""Residential property - not owned by owner occupants - but controlled by Wall Street.The very Wall Streeters who don't care about anyone except themselves.And now they are buying up America's residential market.

The phenomena seems to be evolving into something that is really nasty for the typical home buyer and is a god send to the large investment companies - a kinda robo-d ponzi scheme type real estate market - controlled by the bankers and Wall Street.

What has morphed is a collusion between foreclosure bankers and real estate investment companies (and real estate agents) that leaves the typical home buyer - without the purchase they want - having been screwed by big business and the banks.

The bankers and the investment firms screwed the US during the housing bubble - that ended in a lot of people losing their homes.

Now the bankers and the investment firms are in collusion again to stop people from even being able to buy a home (more on that in a minute).

Flopping

In 'flopping,' a home is purchased by insiders at a steep discount, then immediately sold for a big profit.

"" at a steep discount""But the resale doesn't necessarily happen right away - they can and will buy the home and rent it out first and then boot the renters out when the market price of the house increases.

A realtor referred to this practice as

""It's just robbery,"" she says. ""And I don't know how to stop the robbery.""

When she asked the listing agent why, she was told to ""leave it alone.""

This after clients of hers made an offer higher than the asking price and lost the purchase - BUT the house sold for WAY less to an investor - $40,000 less than her clients had offered.""leave it alone.""We can't afford to do that!

This is literally stealing - but they very seldom get caught or prosecuted.

Which is becoming the norm for big banks and Wall Street.

Let's look at it again from another perspective:

flopping involves selling an asset at less than market price (to a friendly party, of course) and then reselling it to market

Now, of course, we have to pay the price. A study released this spring by CoreLogic, a market research firm, estimates the cost of flopping will exceed $375 million this year, up 20 percent from 2010.

""less than market price (to a friendly party, of course)""Of courseBoth of those articles focused on short sales - but as I said earlier - this type of dealing may have evolved into something much more expansive.

And it's no longer limited to just a few cities - or depressed properties.

And it's not just about resale.

From an article in the Charlotte Observer - Charlotte’s Wall Street landlords move quickly to evict renters

Combined, their purchases have made Charlotte the second-busiest market in the country among single-family home investors. Over the summer, one in every five Charlotte-area homes sold was bought by an investment group.

""It's abuse what these companies are doing around Charlotte,"" she said. ""They only want the money, and that's it.""

""They have investors who want to see a rate of return,"" Gosser said.

One in five!It is all about corporate greed.Wall Street - buying up the residential market at bargain prices to turn it around and sell it at a higher price - either right away - or after they have rented it out.

Some might call this just plain old capitalism.

But when the market is rigged so that Wall Street and the Big Banks are the winners - it's not capitalism - it's cronyism.

This wall street/big bank practice does affect people who are the typical homebuyer - trying to buy a home in today's market.

Now the typical homebuyer not only has to compete with other typical homebuyers for a property, but they have to deal with an insider collusion of bankers and investment firms that have now turned residential properties for corporate profit - again.

Lets look at what this looks like based on the true experience of a typical homebuyer I know:

This was the third time that this is happened to me - but, it is the first time that I have pushed my realtor to take it to what is now the final, predictable conclusion. Every day, repeat every day - I keep 3 realty webpages open - I check them >>every 15 minutes<< for new listings or new price changes. I have been doing this now for three months. I am currently renting a room from a friend, as I have not been able to purchase a new home yet. I would venture that no one in the Metro area is following the real estate market as closely as I am - except investors. The problem I have encountered is:

A property listing will post with a dramatic change in the asking price.

I will immediately contact my realtor and tell him I want to see the property.

The first two times this happened - my realtor called me back and told me he had spoke to the listing realtor and they already had multiple offers (usually less than 1/2 hr after the price change posted on the web page, less than 1/2 hour). The first two times I let it go and did not pursue it. Yesterday - the same thing happened. A property posted with a >50% reduction in price< . I immediately contacted my realtor and told him I wanted to see the property. Fifteen minutes later he sent me this email ""I spoke with the agent and the price is correct. He has already received an offer."" Fifteen minutes - to an OFFER! This time - I pushed back, telling my realtor that the listing agent can entertain more than one offer, and I want to see the property as soon as possible. We inspected the property 3 hours later, I made a FULL PRICE OFFER-CASH, and told my realtor that I was willing to increase my offering price. Within hours, I received a call from my realtor telling me that the listing agent had received multiple offers and I would not be getting the house. I was not given the option to counter any offer the listing agent had - I was just told I wouldn't be getting the house. I am convinced that the property was already committed to another buyer >at a 50% discount< before I even set foot on the property. They had no intention of selling this home to anyone but an investment company. Someone got a hell of a deal, 50% off - and I'll bet it wasn't a citizen, it was a corporation.

""It's just robbery,"" she says. ""And I don't know how to stop the robbery.""

""It's abuse what these companies are doing around Charlotte,"" she said. ""They only want the money, and that's it.""

""They have investors who want to see a rate of return,"" Gosser said.

""They have investors who want to see a rate of return,"" Gosser said.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/03/news/economy/april-jobs-report/index.html,2013-05-03 00:00:00,['Annalyn Kurtz'],April jobs report: Hiring picks up,"The U.S. economy seemed to be headed for a spring slowdown this year. Then the April jobs report was released Friday morning, and now some economists are doing a double-take.

The economy added 165,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That was more than the 140,000 jobs economists expected, and it marked an improvement over March.

The even bigger story, though, came from large revisions to earlier numbers. It's a common practice for the Labor Department to revise its data for the two prior months, and this time, those revisions showed an additional 114,000 jobs were added in the U.S. economy over February and March alone.

Previously, March hiring had looked particularly weak, with only 88,000 jobs added that month. Now, the Labor Department says 138,000 jobs were added in March.

February job growth, which had already looked solid, now looks even stronger. About 332,000 jobs were added in February, making it the strongest month for hiring since the Census hired temporary workers in 2010.

The report goes a long way ""toward soothing fears of another spring slowdown,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics.

Economists had been warning of a spring swoon for the third year in a row, this time driven largely by government spending cuts and global economic weakness. Retail sales slumped unexpectedly in March, the manufacturing sector stalled in April, and signs abroad point to a global deceleration. China's rapid economic growth has lost some steam and Europe is still mired in a recession.

But those fears eased following the report. Stocks jumped. For the first time ever, the Dow topped 15,000 and the S&P 500 climbed above 1,600.

Service jobs boom: The strongest job growth in April came from restaurants and bars, which added 38,000 jobs; temporary services, which added 31,000 jobs; and retailers, which added 29,000 jobs. On the flip side, the government is now the biggest drag on the job market. Overall, federal, state and local governments cut 11,000 jobs in April.

The bigger picture, however, remains static. About 11.7 million people remain unemployed, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.5% in April, but that's still high compared to historical levels. Before the recession hit, the unemployment rate was 4.5%.

""This is a classic 'hold-steady' report -- enough job growth to keep the unemployment rate stable but not much more,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. ""In good times, this would be fine, but at a time like this, it represents an ongoing disaster.""

A big question still hangs in the air about how many jobless Americans are simply not being counted in the unemployment figures. The unemployment rate only includes people who have looked for work in the prior four weeks. Workers who have given up on the job market are not counted.

Only 63.3% of the civilian population, over age 16, is either working or looking for a job. That's the lowest labor force participation rate since May 1979.

Blue-collar jobs take a hit: Over the last six years, the labor force has declined most dramatically in auto manufacturing states like Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. While some veteran workers may simply be retiring, the trend could also reflect former blue-collar jobs transforming into fewer high-skill, technical positions.

""These jobs pay more, but there aren't as many of them either,"" said Mark Vitner, senior economist for Wells Fargo. ""In order to fill those jobs, workers may need to be retrained.""

Nationwide, manufacturing hiring came to a halt in April.

Construction firms also cut 6,000 jobs. The sector had been adding jobs for the prior 10 months, fueled mainly by the housing recovery. But, as of April, job cuts by commercial firms were large enough to offset jobs added by homebuilders. Those job cuts are most likely tied to recent declines in government-funded construction projects, for example on infrastructure and schools.

Health care remained a strong sector, adding 19,000 jobs in April. Hospitals and doctors' offices hired more workers, and demand for more health care for the elderly is driving a surge in home health care services. That industry added 6,000 jobs in April. The Labor Department expects home health aide to be the fastest growing occupation in the country this decade.

How far we've come: Overall, the U.S. economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the financial crisis, and since then has added back about 6.2 million jobs.

Once you factor population growth into the mix, Shierholz estimates there is still a gap of 8.6 million jobs ""missing"" from the U.S. economy. If hiring keeps up at its current pace, it will take about five more years to get back to a pre-recession job market."

A group of unions and anti-poverty organizations accuses real estate giant Brookfield Office Properties Inc. of trying to skate on potentially millions of dollars in new property taxes on downtown Los Angeles skyscrapers the company is buying by taking less than a 50% stake in a new entity that will take title to the properties and others now held by Brookfield.

Brookfield agreed in April to pay about $430 million for four prominent buildings, including Gas Co. Tower and Wells Fargo Tower on Bunker Hill. Selling the towers is Los Angeles landlord MPG Office Trust Inc., which is winding down its business after taking steep losses during the economic downturn.

The transaction, which is expected to close in the next few weeks, would make Brookfield the dominant operator of prime space in the city’s financial district and give it a major role in setting office rents downtown.

A group called ReFund LA Coalition says Brookfield has structured the deal in a way that will enable the company to avoid having the properties reassessed at fair market value as required by Proposition 13 when a change of ownership occurs.

If the properties are not reassessed, they will be taxed according to their older — and presumably lower — assessed value.

“We believe that wealthy corporations shouldn’t be allowed to engage in schemes that result in less funding for vital public services,” said group spokesman Ian Thompson of the Service Employees International Union. “If Brookfield makes this deal, it will literally be stealing services away from the most vulnerable people our members serve.”

The union is one of several members of the ReFund LA Coalition. Other members include the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, the California Federation of Teachers and People Organized for Westside Renewal.

A representative of Brookfield declined to comment, saying the company does not publicly discuss pending transactions.

ReFund LA’s objections to the Brookfield office purchase are intended to prompt changes in California tax laws, said Keenan Sheedy, who works at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center and is a member of SEIU.

“We want the county supervisors to support legislation in Sacramento,” Sheedy said. “We want them to go on record supporting a change in state law that would close the loophole.”

Funding shortages at the tax-supported hospital are hurting patients, he said.

“I see every day the impact,” he said. “Long waits in emergency room, long waits to get appointments.”

The structure of Brookfield’s deal did not come as a surprise to real estate financial analysts.

“Brookfield’s duty is to its shareholders, including people with mutual funds in the stock market,” said analyst Craig Silvers, president of Bricks & Mortar Capital. “Their shareholders could be SEIU members.”

The Proposition 13 law allows businesses to avoid reassessment if no one acquires a majority stake in a firm that owns the property.

Under terms of the Brookfield deal, the buyer of record will be a new fund called DTLA Holdings. Brookfield will own about 47% of DTLA Holdings, with institutional financial partners holding the rest.

DTLA Holdings will own the former MPG properties and Brookfield’s current assets downtown that include other office buildings and a shopping mall in the financial district. The activist group says Brookfield would underpay taxes by about $10 million a year based on the total value of the transaction, which the group estimated at $2.1 billion.

“Brookfield is a savvy real estate player. Do they know the ins and outs of Proposition 13, including the 50% threshold? Assuredly,” said analyst Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.

“However, raising and deploying other investors’ capital into real estate investments is a prominent part of their business model,” Knott said. “So the way they structured the MPG deal is consistent with that, including places outside California where there isn’t this thing called Proposition 13.”

Proposition 13’s arcane rules on reassessment have stoked other controversies. In 2006, computer magnate Michael Dell agreed to pay $200 million for the Fairmont Hotel in Santa Monica and then tore up the contract a few month later.

He brought in his wife and two of his investment advisors as partners — with no one taking more than 49% control of the hotel company. By restructuring the deal to avoid taking full ownership he escaped paying more than $1 million in taxes.

Los Angeles County assessors called Dell’s move a tax dodge, but a Superior Court judge disagreed, finding in December that the deal met the letter of the law.

Last month, Refund LA accused mall giant Westfield Group of underpaying taxes by taking advantage of Proposition 13 provisions. Westfield said it pays its taxes in accordance with the law.

prev Image 2 of 2

Americans are in a panic. Crowds throng gun shows and shops. Blue-chip companies fast-forward 2013’s dividends to 2012. Investors cash out profits, estate planners report a rush of people trying to beat higher inheritance taxes and lobbyists line up for favors.

What these people share is the goal of avoiding or benefitting from government actions. More than ever, the “invisible hand” of free markets is being replaced by the visible hand of bureaucrats. The political class is the new master of the universe.

If this were being staged in a theater, the national epidemic of expectation would be called “Waiting for Government.” It would be as absurd as “Waiting for Godot,” but not at all meaningless.

[pullquote]

That’s because the tax-and-spending drama in Washington, as pathetic and infuriating as it is, threatens real-world consequences for every American. How could it be otherwise when Big Government is getting bigger?

Much, much bigger.

The frantic run-up to the fiscal cliff, including wild swings in the stock market, provided an ominous snapshot of the new reality. Barack Obama’s reelection was the big story of 2012, but the real impact of his statist policies will be felt in the new year and for many years to come.

Obama’s victory secures first-term government expansions, such as ObamaCare, which carries expensive mandates and who knows how many unintended consequences. No matter how the fiscal talks are resolved, the IRS will be taking a fatter share of the fruits of national labor. At stake is how much fatter, whose ox gets gored and whose gets spared.

Some statistics, such as housing prices, say the economy is growing, but it’s all relative. The unemployment rate is falling largely because millions have stopped looking for work. Ordinary wages are stagnant or falling.

But it is boom time for the government. Spending continues to rise, hiring is up and the Federal Reserve’s printing presses are running overtime.

The Obama administration is happy to keep borrowing 40 cents of every dollar it spends, or nearly $4 billion a day, seven days a week. Each day brings plans for added regulations and new ways to rob Peter to pay Paul.

The combination creates a huge cloud hanging over every family and business. Debts and inflation exact penalties, perhaps for generations, and already are stifling innovation and job creation. Ours has become the world’s largest debtor nation and still needs more lenders.

The certain result will be an economic pie that doesn’t grow fast enough, which will lead to new demands for more redistribution under the guise of “fairness.” Always, the government redistributes by taking the first bite for itself.

The most disheartening aspect of this gloomy vision is that Americans voted for it. Obama was upfront about wanting to raise taxes and expand government and the debt. The reach and cost of Washington grew dramatically in the last four years, and he was rewarded with four more.

It is naive to think he will change course. His rejection of any serious reforms of entitlements shows that he is emboldened. Woe to the man who dares declare that the government already is too big and powerful. He will be denounced as cruel and caricatured as wanting no government at all.

This being the season for predictions, mine is that millions upon millions of Americans who voted for Obama will be disappointed in 2013. But most will not blame him. They will agree with him that the solution is to double the dose of Washington power.

Never mind that the patient is dying. The Obama operation is a great success. Just ask him.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/14/obama-debt-ceiling_n_2471594.html,2013-01-14 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Obama On Debt Ceiling: 'We Are Not A Deadbeat Nation',"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama issued a strong warning to Republicans on Monday that he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling or allow Republicans to use it as a bargaining chip.

""To even entertain the idea of the United States of America not paying our bills is irresponsible. It's absurd,"" Obama said in a press conference.

The president also responded directly to Republicans who continue to argue that increasing the nation's borrowing limit only contributes to Washington's spending problem. He repeatedly emphasized that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize any new spending but simply allows the government to continue to pay for obligations to which Congress has already agreed.

House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Saturday said a failure to raise the debt ceiling would result in ""financial disaster,"" but reiterated demands that the president agree to spending cuts before a vote.

On Monday, Obama maintained that increasing the debt limit would not represent a concession by Republicans to Democrats, and said he simply would not give in to any demands in exchange for an extension.

""They will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the economy,"" Obama said. ""The full faith and credit of the United States economy is not a bargaining chip. And they better choose quickly because time is running short. The last time Republicans in Congress even flirted with this idea, our AAA credit rating was down for the first time in our history.""

The president highlighted some of the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling: a delay in Social Security checks and veterans' benefits and the inability to pay U.S. troops or honor contracts for small business owners, air traffic controllers and food inspectors. If the country failed to meet these obligations, Obama argued, investors around the world would question the credibility of the United States.

""We are not a deadbeat nation,"" Obama said. ""So there's a very simple solution to this: Congress authorizes us to pay our bills.""

Republican leaders responded immediately to the president's press conference, signaling they will not relent on demands for spending cuts as part of debt ceiling talks.

""The President and his allies need to get serious about spending, and the debt-limit debate is the perfect time for it,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in a statement. ""I do know that the most important issue confronting the future of our country is our deficit and debt. So we are hoping for a new seriousness on the part of the President with regard to the single biggest issue confronting the country and we look forward to working with him to do something about this huge, huge problem.""

Boehner issued a similar statement, calling on Obama to reduce government spending.

""The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation’s obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same,"" Boehner said.

Last week, Senate Democratic leaders urged Obama to bypass Congress on raising the debt ceiling in the event of political gridlock. But the White House has been reluctant to consider a unilateral action, maintaining that the 14th Amendment -- one such proposed option -- does not give the president the authority to ignore the debt ceiling."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/us/politics/house-bill-would-split-farm-and-food-stamp-programs.html,2013-07-12 00:00:00,"['Jonathan Weisman', 'Ron Nixon']","House Republicans Push Through Farm Bill, Without Food Stamps","Democrats denounced the bill as a naked attempt to make draconian cuts in the food stamp program.

“A vote for this bill is a vote to end nutrition in America,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.

Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, called the House measure “an insult to rural America.”

Anti-hunger groups called passage of the farm bill without the food stamp program a disgrace.

“Today’s vote is the latest smoking gun that the House majority isn’t truly interested in deficit reduction,” said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. “They’re interested in supporting special interest groups over hungry Americans.”

The 608-page bill keeps the changes that were in the version that failed last month, and amendments were not allowed. The bill would save about $20 billion by consolidating or cutting numerous farm subsidy programs, including $5 billion paid annually to farmers and landowners whether they plant crops or not.

The money saved from eliminating those payments would be directed into the $9 billion crop insurance program, and new subsidies would be created for peanut, cotton and rice farmers. The bill adds money to support fruit and vegetable growers, and it restores insurance programs for livestock producers, which expired in 2011, leaving thousands of operations without disaster coverage during last year’s drought. The bill also made changes to a dairy program that sets limits to the amount of milk produced and sold in the United States.

One new proposal from last month would also repeal a provision in the current farm bill, called “permanent law,” that causes farm programs to revert to 1949 price levels if a new farm bill is not passed. Congress has traditionally maintained the provision to prod lawmakers into passing a farm bill or face large increases in farm program expenditures. Without the provision, many lawmakers and farm groups fear there would be no incentive for Congress to pass a farm bill on time.

One overlooked provision in the bill came from Representative Dan Benishek, Republican of Michigan, a surgeon, and would require additional economic and scientific analyses before a 2010 law to improve the food safety system goes into effect."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/22/Paul-Ryan-doubles-down-on-move-to-cut-pensions-for-veterans,2013-12-22 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Paul Ryan Doubles Down on Cutting Veteran Pensions,"House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) has doubled down on his move to cut pensions for military veterans in a USA Today op-ed published Sunday.

In the op-ed, Ryan opens up by highlighting the CBO estimate that the deal he cut with Senate Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) would result in at least $20 billion in deficit reduction. “The Bipartisan Budget Act that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and I drafted will soon become law,” Ryan wrote. “We think it’s a small step toward fiscal discipline in Washington. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will reduce the deficit over the next ten years by over $20 billion. And unlike current law, it will provide much-needed relief to our already strained defense budget.”

As Breitbart News has reported, Ryan’s and Murray’s budget deal does not reduce the deficit. In fact, the deal raises the deficit by at least $15.5 billion because of a series of gimmicks that Ryan and Murray employed in the accounting of the deal — namely, double counting of savings like the tactic which was employed in Obamacare, and the failure to include an estimate of the interest on the borrowed money for the first couple of years of increased spending. These are only a few among a series of other misleading statements Ryan has made about the deal.

The rest of Ryan’s op-ed is devoted to defending his decision to cut $6 billion worth of military pensions. “One part of the bill has become particularly controversial: the reduction in cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for working-age military retirees,” Ryan wrote. “The federal government has no greater obligation than to keep the American people safe and we must take care of the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line. For that reason, Congress is understandably hesitant to make changes to military compensation. But even hesitance has a cost.” Citing the rising cost per service member since 2001, he then claimed that the need for reform is “undeniable.”

Ryan cited and praised President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel for his stance on the issue as well. Ryan wrote, “Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a combat vet himself, has said ‘that we can no longer put off military compensation reform. DOD’s leadership, Chairman Dempsey, the service chiefs, the service secretaries, and myself, we all know that we need to slow cost growth in military compensation. Otherwise, we’ll have to make disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization.'”

Ryan then detailed what he says the changes to military veterans’ pensions would specifically do to veterans:

Here’s what the new law will do. We make no changes for those currently at or above age 62. This reform affects only younger military retirees. Right now, any person who has served 20 years can retire–regardless of age. That means a serviceman who enlists at 18 becomes eligible for retirement at 38. The late 30s and early 40s are prime working years, and most of these younger retirees go on to second careers.

Ryan characterized the change as a “small adjustment” in the next paragraph, even though he admitted it could affect veterans by as much as $100,000 or more over their lifetimes, depending on when they retire.

“All this reform does is make a small adjustment for those younger retirees,” Ryan wrote. “If they retire before age 62, the annual increase in their retired pay will be 1% less than the inflation rate. In other words, their benefits will grow every year–just at a slower rate. And when the retiree hits 62, DOD will recalculate the retired pay so that it will be where it would have been if he or she had received the full inflation adjustment every year since he or she retired.” Ryan then calculated that, for a hypothetical serviceman who enlisted at 18 and retired at 38, his benefits would change under the deal from about $1.8 million to $1.7 million.

“This is a far more modest reform than other bipartisan proposals, some of which would have fully eliminated the adjustments for inflation for working-age retirees,” Ryan wrote.

Despite Ryan’s claims these cuts are a “small adjustment” for veterans, that approximately $100,000, in some parts of the country, could be a significant percentage of the entire size of a mortgage for a house. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, in October the average size of a home loan in America was $289,650. Ryan’s “small adjustment” cuts to veterans would be more than a third, then, of the average mortgage — and in many cases, more than half of these veterans’ lifetime expenses for homeownership.

The Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) estimates that the cuts could mean as much as $124,000 in lost retirement income for veterans, which would be even more significant losses of opportunity in the future for veterans.

Ryan argued that the approximately $6 billion in savings that cutting the pensions for America’s military veterans would garner for the federal treasury would “go right back to the military.”

“In 2012, Congress established the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to examine the entire military-compensation system from top to bottom,” Ryan wrote. “The commission’s recommendations are due in May, and the leaders of the armed-services committees in Congress have agreed to consider their recommendations and look for other ways to reform the system. That’s why this reform does not take effect until the end of 2015 — it gives Congress ample time to consider alternatives.”

Ryan said that for America to be able to afford the best equipment on the battlefield for active duty military, these pension cuts are necessary.

“For me, there’s simply no choice between responsible reforms of military compensation and making what our military leadership has called ‘disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization,'” Ryan wrote. “Every time we kick the can down the road, we put our troops’ combat readiness at risk. This agreement put forward one reform option, and I invite others to do the same. Our troops have been willing to sacrifice everything for this country. We owe it to them to give them the best equipment on the battlefield and a secure retirement when they come home.”

In his op-ed, Ryan did not address the proposal in the House of Representatives gaining significant attention already from Reps. Martha Roby (R-AL) and Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA). Roby’s and Fitzpatrick’s plan would restore pensions for all military veterans and offset the savings those cuts create with savings from closing a loophole allowing illegal aliens access to the Refundable Child Tax Credit. Closing that loophole would save $7 billion — more than enough to ensure that the Pentagon gets the money it needs to buy top-notch military equipment.

Since Ryan and Murray’s budget deal increases spending and increases the federal deficit, many conservatives and even mainstream Republicans wonder why veterans’ pensions should be cut when there is wasteful spending like leaving that tax credit loophole open, or many of the new details that Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) detailed in his “Wastebook,” among other examples of wasteful spending.

Last week, Ryan avoided discussing the proposal when asked by Breitbart News about it. Instead, his spokesman Kevin Seifert said Ryan supports closing that illegal alien tax credit loophole but also supports cutting military pensions. Seifert would not answer when pressed on whether Ryan would back the Roby-Fitzpatrick plan, which is a House version of a Senate amendment Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, attempted to attach to the deal but could not due to the procedural blocking of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Now that he is backing up his decision to cut veterans’ pensions, Ryan has taken a stance that is directly averse to the the Roby-Fitzpatrick plan — something that could put Ryan at odds with a majority of the House GOP conference. Including Roby and Fitzpatrick, a total of 46 House Republicans have signed on to their bill as cosponsors. Powerful committee chairmen like House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and House Rules Committee chairman Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) have also cosponsored the Roby-Fitzpatrick deal. This could foreshadow a battle between House GOP power players for the future direction of the conference."

The budget is slated to be released on April 10, the same day Obama is having yet another charm offensive dinner with Senate Republicans. Because this strategy has been working so well for him.

According to the WSJ,



Such a proposal could include steps that make many Democrats queasy, such as reductions in future Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security payments, but also items resisted by Republicans, such as higher taxes through limits on tax breaks, people close to the White House said. [...] Including entitlement curbs would be notable, as Republicans often have criticized the White House for offering such steps in private negotiations but never fully embracing them as part of an official budget plan.

Well, since Republicans are criticizing him for not fully and officially embracing his desire to cut benefits to the poor and elderly, by all means he has to make the offer. Included in that, reportedly, is the chained CPI for Social Security and an idea from Eric Cantor for restructuring Medicare that would combine Medicare’s coverage for hospitals and doctor services, creating a single deductible that could increase out-of-pocket costs.

But here's just one rub in the plan:



But several liberal allies, some of whom advise White House officials, said Republicans could seize on the White House-endorsed spending cuts and try to implement them into law without any of the tax increases. That would put the White House in the uncomfortable position of opposing spending cuts it formally endorsed in its own budget.

That should be considered a certainty, rather than a possibility. That goes along with the certainty that Republicans are going to use an official White House proposal to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits in 2014 to run against Democrats. Republicans aren't engaging in any of the budget negotiations in good faith. They didn't do so in Obama's first term, and they have no intention to do so now, regardless of the 2012 election.

The Senate has rejected a chained CPI for Social Security, but that vote was non-binding. All those Democratic senators who voted against it need to take their opposition to the White House and tell President Obama that he will not have their votes.

Send an email to President Obama and congressional leadership telling them to strengthen Social Security instead of cutting it.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/24/fox-news-poll-summer-discontent-with-obama-congress-continues/,2013-07-24 00:00:00,['Dana Blanton'],"Fox News poll: Summer of discontent with Obama, Congress continues","Most voters are unhappy with the way things are going in the country, and over half say they don’t see signs the economy has turned the corner, according to a Fox News poll released Wednesday. Those are two of the reasons why President Obama’s job approval remains below 50 percent -- and hits a new low among independents.

Just 25 percent of independents approve of the job the president is doing, down from 31 percent last month.

Independents were essential to Obama’s 2008 victory when 52 percent backed him. That support dropped to 45 percent in the 2012 election (Fox News exit poll). In fact, Republican Mitt Romney topped Obama by garnering 50 percent among independents.

Overall, 46 percent of voters approve of Obama’s job performance, while 47 percent disapprove. That’s a slight improvement from last month when headlines trumpeted the IRS targeting of conservative groups, the NSA spying on Americans and the Justice Department monitoring journalists. At that time 43 percent approved and 51 percent disapproved (June 22-24).

The new poll also finds most voters -- 63 percent -- are dissatisfied with how things are going in the country, while about one-third are satisfied (35 percent). These views are mostly unchanged since January. However, dissatisfaction has gone up 10 percentage points since just before the presidential election. In January of 2009, in the final days of the George W. Bush administration, 79 percent felt dissatisfied.

It continues to be a summer of discontent with Congress: 18 percent of voters approve of the job lawmakers are doing, while 74 percent disapprove. Last month 15 percent approved and 77 percent disapproved (June 22-24). Approval of Congress hit a record-low 10 percent in August 2011.

Voters split over whether Obama and his team have helped the economy: 43 percent think the administration has made it better, while 44 percent say it’s made it worse. That’s an improvement from a year ago when 37 percent said the White House had made the economy better and 49 percent said worse (July 2012).

A 57-percent majority says they don’t see any signs the economy has started to turn the corner, while 38 percent say they feel the worst is over. Those views are little changed from a year ago.

The poll does find patches of optimism: By a two-to-one margin voters are more likely to say the housing market is getting better than worse (56 percent vs. 28 percent). And by a five percentage-point margin, more voters think the nation’s job situation is getting better than getting worse (44-39 percent).

Democrats are three times as likely as Republicans to be happy with the way things are going in the country, twice as likely to think the economy has turned the corner, and more than twice as likely to think the job situation has improved. Majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans agree the housing market is getting better.

Poll Pourri

Though Barack Obama’s job rating remains underwater, his personal favorability rating stands at 50 percent, up from a record low 47 percent last month. That means the president has a few more fans than Pope Francis, who has a 46 percent favorable rating. That said, nearly six times as many people have an unfavorable view of Obama (46 percent) as the pope (8 percent). Nearly half of voters have no opinion of Pope Francis (19 percent “can’t say” and 26 percent say they’ve never heard of him).

Recently CBS’s Bob Schieffer said in his weekly commentary that while he still thinks the United States is the greatest country in the world, he’s concerned the country doesn’t have the reputation it once had. Voters agree: 79 percent say the U.S. is the greatest country in the world, and 82 percent think the country is losing some of its standing. Most Republicans (83 percent) and Democrats (78 percent) feel the United States is the greatest country in the world. On the other hand, by a 19 percentage-point margin, Republicans (91 percent) are more likely than Democrats (72 percent) to think America isn’t the model that it once was.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,017 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from July 21 to July 23. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points."

Thiessen', 'Columnist Focusing On Foreign', 'Domestic Policy', 'October', 'Marc Thiessen Writes A Twice-Weekly Column For The Post On Foreign', 'Domestic Policy. He Is A Fellow At The American Enterprise Institute', 'The Former Chief Speechwriter For President George W. Bush.']",Marc Thiessen: The tea party needs a General Washington,"Amid the smoldering wreckage of the government shutdown and the failed effort to defund Obamacare, it is time for conservatives to figure out why they lost — and how they can win the next time.

Since the tea party takes its inspiration from the American Revolution, it might want look to that period for answers. It can learn a lot from the contrasting strategies of two revolutionary war generals: Horatio Gates and George Washington. One led the patriots into disaster, while the other led them to victory.

Gates commanded American forces at the Battle of Camden, the British victory depicted in Mel Gibson’s classic movie ‘The Patriot.’ Gates thought he had the British cornered but played right into their hands, positioning inexperienced militia fighters opposite the best troops the crown had. When the more capable redcoat forces advanced with bayonets, Gates’s forces (who did not have bayonets) were compelled to flee. The continentals were routed. It is considered to this day one of the most catastrophic defeats in U.S. military history.

By contrast, George Washington knew better than to go muzzle-to-muzzle with superior British forces in an open field. He followed what was known as the “Fabian Strategy” (named for the Roman leader Quintus Fabius Maximus), avoiding large, unwinnable battles in favor of smaller strategic engagements. As historian James Scythes explains it, “unless his army enjoyed a distinct advantage, Washington believed he must avoid direct battle” and “instead resorted to swift raids against detachments of the enemy’s army.” In the Battle of Princeton, for example, Washington knew he could not defeat Cornwallis’s 8,000-man force in direct combat. So he left his campfires burning as a diversionary tactic, snuck around the British camp, and took on the British in a series of smaller rear-guard engagements.

For taking this cautious approach, Washington was accused by some at the time of being a RINO (“Revolutionary in Name Only”). Scythes writes, “Critics of his strategy would grow impatient with Washington’s lack of victories, which would lead to frustration amongst patriots.” They wanted him to fight! But despite his aggressive nature, Washington refused to send his troops on suicide missions. His Fabian Strategy worked because he picked smaller, winnable fights and defeated the British in a war of attrition.

This is precisely the approach today’s patriots should have taken in the fight against Obamacare. Shutting down the government had zero chance of succeeding, and it played right into Democratic hands.

Today, some on the right are rationalizing defeat, claiming they won in a lot of ways. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) boasted: “Oh my gosh, we’ve lit up Obamacare for the whole nation.” No, you didn’t. You distracted the nation from Obamacare’s disastrous rollout, pushing the Obamacare implosion off the front pages and giving the media an excuse to focus on the disarray in the Republican Party instead of the disarray in the Obama administration. You ruined the chance to delay implementation of at least parts of Obamacare. And you alienated independent voters who agree that Obamacare is a disaster but opposed a government shutdown.

Tea party patriots need to understand: There is no silver lining in the shutdown cloud. It was an unmitigated disaster. Remember the tea party’s successful fight to ban earmarks? The continuing resolution passed to reopen the government contains earmarks for things like the Olmstead Locks and Dam in Kentucky and Colorado highway funds. The Obamacare income verification provision was watered down to be meaningless. The final legislation was worse than what Sen. Harry Reid put forward before the shutdown.

Amazingly, even some leaders of the defund debacle are now admitting the fight was unwinnable from the start. Last week, Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham told Fox News, “Everybody understands that we’ll not be able to repeal this law until 2017. And we have to win the Senate and win the White House.” Now he tell us? Then what on earth was the point of the government shutdown?

If conservatives had instead followed the Fabian approach of Gen. Washington — avoiding a battle they knew could not be won in favor of smaller engagements — they might have succeeded in delaying parts of Obamacare and rallying the American people for its eventual repeal. Instead, they were completely routed.

Those responsible for this disaster ought to be held to account. After leading his forces into an unwinnable fight with a disastrous strategy, Gen. Gates was fired by the Continental Congress. No one questioned his patriotism, but they questioned his competence. His reputation never recovered.

Those who led the tea party into an unwinnable fight with a disastrous strategy should be equally discredited today. Yet many on the right are hailing Sen. Ted Cruz and the rest of the defund caucus as heroes. At least they stood and fought, they say. No, they led us into a trap. Make no mistake: The shutdown was the tea party’s Battle of Camden. Those who botched it are the modern equivalent of Gen. Gates.

The tea party needs a Gen. Washington.

Hess', 'Brian Zajac']",Maryland is the richest state; Mississippi is the poorest,"Median household income in the United States declined for the second straight year, according to data released from the U.S. Census Bureau today. Income was $50,502 in 2011, more than 8 percent below the 2007 pre-recession peak.

While the trend is generally down, some states fared far better than others. Median income ranged from $36,919 in Mississippi to $70,004 in Maryland, positions both states have held since before the recession. Based on the 2011 Census Bureau American Community Survey, 24/7 Wall St. identified the states with the highest and lowest median household income.

24/7 Wall St.: The World's Best (And Worst) Economies

Between 2010 and 2011, Vermont was the only state where median income increased. Income fell in 18 states and remained statistically unchanged in 31. In Hawaii, which remained one of the wealthiest states in the country, median income decreased by more than $3,000 between 2010 and 2011 alone.

Not surprisingly, poverty rates continued to be high. The percentage of Americans living below the poverty line increased in 17 states between 2010 and 2011, the third consecutive increase for 10 of these states. Of the states with the lowest income, eight had among the 10-highest poverty rates. Mississippi had the highest poverty rate in the country, at 22.6 percent of residents, compared with the national rate of 15.9 percent.

The poorest states in the country are almost entirely found in the South, with the exception of New Mexico. The wealthiest states can be found all across the country, including three in New England, four in the Mid-Atlantic, and two outside the contiguous 48 states.

Of course, not all residents of the wealthiest states earn as much as the median. According to the Census Bureau’s Gini Coefficient, which measures income inequality, there was a significant increase in the divide between the rich and poor in 20 states. The measure remained unchanged in the rest.

Though income inequality affects rich and poor states alike, the poorest states struggle with it most. Inequality was high in only three rich states: California, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Meanwhile, with the exception of West Virginia, all of the poorest states had among the highest income inequality scores, with six in the top 15.

In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Brookings Institution fellow Elizabeth Kneebone explained that income inequality at a state level is often influenced by differences between the state’s high- and low-income cities and between urban and rural areas. “These are metropolitan economies that drive a lot of these [state] trends.” This was especially the case in California, where the Bay Area’s wealthy suburbs have incomes fueled by the tech industry and the low-income areas in other parts of the states are agricultural-based economies.

At least one positive development involves health insurance coverage, which increased in 37 states. While the poorest states improved, coverage remained relatively low. Three of the poorest states were among the 10 with the lowest coverage. In New Mexico, nearly 20 percent were not insured in 2011, much higher than the 15.1 percent national average. In the wealthiest states, coverage was among the highest, with four states having greater than 90 percent insured.

24/7 Wall St.: Brands That Will Disappear in 2013

While most of the states with the lowest incomes suffer from weak economies, unemployment was not a significant problem. Only two states were among the worst 10 for unemployment in 2011. In fact, five of the worst-off states had unemployment rates lower than the national rate of 8.9 percent last year. In Oklahoma, one of the poorest states, unemployment was 6.2 percent. In the states with the highest median incomes, the results were similarly varied.

According to Kneebone, it is not a surprise that unemployment and income appear unrelated. ""Earnings for middle and lower-wage workers have fallen or stagnated over time,"" Kneebone explained. ""So you can have a situation where jobs are being created ... but the types of jobs matter. If those are jobs that pay low wages, even if you’re working full time, that might not be enough to lift you above the poverty line.”

To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income, poverty, and health insurance from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2011 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and additional 2011 ACS data on individual cities. Because the cost of living has a direct bearing income, 24/7 Wall St. considered cost of living data for Q4 2011 from the Council for Community and Economic Research.

The Richest States

1. Maryland

Median household income: $70,004

$70,004 Population: 5,828,289 (19th highest)

5,828,289 (19th highest) Unemployment rate: 7 percent (15th lowest)

7 percent (15th lowest) Percent below poverty line: 10.1 percent (2nd lowest)

Maryland, which has had the highest median income of all states since 2006, was the only state in the country to have a median income above $70,000 in 2011. The state’s 10.1 percent was well below the national rate of 15.9 percent. Furthermore, a sizable portion of the population is earning well above the median income. Maryland is one of three states, along with New Jersey and Connecticut, where more than 10 percent of families earned more than $200,000 in 2011. Across the U.S., only 5.6 percent of families made more than $200,000 in 2011.

2. Alaska

Median household income: $67,825

$67,825 Population: 722,718 (4th lowest)

722,718 (4th lowest) Unemployment rate: 7.6 percent (22nd lowest)

7.6 percent (22nd lowest) Percent below poverty line: 10.5 percent (4th lowest)

In 2011, Alaska moved ahead of New Jersey to take the spot of the state with the second-highest median household income in the country. The state benefits from its vast natural resources, particularly oil, natural gas, and timber. Since 1957, the state has collected nearly $100 billion in taxes from oil and gas companies, and Alaska oil production has accounted for more than 13 percent of total U.S. production. Most residents reap the benefits from these payments. Income inequality in the state is the second-lowest in the country. Just 3 percent of Alaskan families earned less than $10,000 per year compared to the 5.1 percent nationwide. Meanwhile, despite the state’s high median income, just 5 percent of families earned more than $200,000 per year.

3. New Jersey

Median household income: $ 67,458

67,458 Population: 8,821,155 (11th highest)

8,821,155 (11th highest) Unemployment rate: 9.3 percent (14th highest)

9.3 percent (14th highest) Percent below poverty line: 10.4 percent (3rd lowest)

In New Jersey, 10.9 percent of families earned more than $200,000 last year and just 10.4 percent of residents lived below the poverty line, fewer than all states except for New Hampshire. Still, there were areas in the state where poverty was more widespread. In Newark, 31.6 percent of residents lived below the poverty line, while Paterson’s poverty rate was 28.9 percent. In contrast to the state as a whole, families in Newark were more than 16 times more likely to earn less than $10,000 than over $200,000 a year. Similarly, in Paterson, 16.2 percent of families earned under $10,000 per year, while just 1.4 percent earned more than $200,000 annually.

The Poorest States

1. Mississippi

Median household income: $36,919

$36,919 Population: 2,978,512 (20th lowest)

2,978,512 (20th lowest) Unemployment rate: 10.7 percent (4th highest)

10.7 percent (4th highest) Percent below poverty line: 22.6 percent (the highest)

The median income of the poorest state in the country, Mississippi, was just slightly less than 53 percent of the median income of Maryland, the richest state. Mississippi’s median income--like many states-- fell each year between 2008 and 2011, dropping $2,677 during that time. Not only did Mississippi have the highest poverty rate in the country, but 7.8 percent of Mississippi families made less than $10,000 in 2011, which was also the lowest rate in the country. While unemployment declined in most states between 2010 and 2011, Mississippi’s actually rose 0.2 percentage points, one of only two states to see an increase in unemployment.

2. West Virginia

Median household income: $38,482

$38,482 Population: 1,855,364 (14th lowest)

1,855,364 (14th lowest) Unemployment rate: 8 percent (tied-25th lowest)

8 percent (tied-25th lowest) Percent below poverty line: 18.6 percent (10th highest)

West Virginia’s median income of $38,482 was well off the median income of $40,093 in 2007. The state’s unemployment rate of 8 percent was well below the 8.9 percent nationwide. But, like Kentucky, a softening mining sector in 2012 could weaken West Virginia’s economy. The proportion of West Virginia residents without health insurance grew 4.9 percent, the third-largest increase in the U.S. Fortunately for cash-strapped residents, although the state’s overall cost of living is in the middle of the pack compared to all other states, the cost of groceries is the third lowest in the country.

3. Arkansas

Median household income: $38,758

$38,758 Population: 2,937,979 (19th lowest)

2,937,979 (19th lowest) Unemployment rate: 8 percent (tied-25th lowest)

8 percent (tied-25th lowest) Percent below poverty line: 19.5 percent (4th highest)

While the national median household income fell to $50,502 in 2011, Arkansas was just one of three states where median income remained below $40,000 for the year. Despite an unemployment rate of 8 percent in 2011, nearly one percentage point below the national rate, the 19.5 percent of families lived below the poverty line, one of the nation’s highest rates. Poverty was slightly less of a problem in Little Rock, the state’s largest city, which had a 16.4 percent poverty rate and a median income of $40,976. Despite having the third-lowest cost of health care nationwide at the end of 2011, 17.1 percent of residents lived without health insurance last year--well above the national figure of 15.1 percent.

Perry signs sweeping abortion restrictions,"Supporters credited God's will and prayer as the governor signed the legislation, with protesters' chants of ""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" echoing into the Capitol auditorium from the hallway. Opponents have vowed to fight the law, though no court challenges were immediately filed.

""Today, we celebrate the further cementing of the foundation on which the culture of life in Texas is built upon,"" Perry told an auditorium full of supportive Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion activists. ""It is our responsibility and duty to give voice to the unborn individuals.""

The law restricts abortions to surgical centers and requires doctors who work at abortion clinics to have hospital admitting privileges. Only five of the 42 abortion clinics in Texas — the nation's second-largest state — currently meet those new requirements.

STORY: Providers fear major shutdowns

The law also bans abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, based on the disputed notion that fetuses can feel pain at that point of development, and dictates when abortion-inducing drugs can be taken.

Clinics will have a year to either upgrade their facilities or shut down after the law takes effect in October.

Supporters argue the new law will ensure high-quality health care for women, but opponents view it as over-regulation intended to make abortions harder to obtain.

Similar measures in other states have been blocked by federal judges, and opponents in Texas said they would pursue a similar course.

""The fight over this law will move to the courts, while the bigger fight for women's access to health care in Texas gains steam,"" Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement.

Perry and other top Republican leaders made passing the law a top priority, in part to please the most conservative wing of the party before the primary election in March. But it touched off weeks of protests that saw thousands of activists on both sides of the issue descend on the Texas Capitol in an outpouring of activism unseen in at least 20 years.

After the regular legislative session ended May 27, Perry added passing the abortion measure to lawmakers' agenda for a 30-day special session. But on the last day to pass bills, Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis staged a more than 12-hour, one-woman filibuster hoping to talk past a midnight deadline and kill the legislation.

Republicans used parliamentary objections to silence Davis, but just before midnight hundreds of bill opponents in the Senate gallery screamed and cheered so loudly that all work stopped on the Senate floor below until it was too late. It launched Davis into an overnight political sensation.

But Perry called lawmakers back for a second special session — setting up the bill's final approval last week.

Thursday's signing ceremony was moved from Perry's office on the second floor of the Capitol to a basement auditorium, surrounded by dozens of state troopers who tightly controlled who entered and braced for potentially hundreds of activists. Instead, only about two dozen showed up, clutching coat-hangers and signs that read ""My Body, My Choice"" and ""Shame!""

As Perry and other lawmakers spoke, protesters repeatedly chanted ""shame!"" loud enough to be heard. Once the bill was signed, they hooted and then sang Twisted Sister's ""We're Not Gonna Take It!""

Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who oversees the state Senate, blamed ""intentional chaos created by the radical left"" for the bill not passing sooner. He credited prayer and ""the hand of God"" in making Thursday's event happen.

That was a common sentiment among supporters. The Catholic Association said in a statement: ""Rick Perry is a brave man for standing up to the mob tactics of the abortion lobby and has earned the respect of pro-life women and men across the country.""

Republican Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, who sponsored the bill in the Texas House and mistakenly suggested during debate that emergency room rape kits could be used to terminate pregnancies, said: ""It really was the hand of God"" and prayer that helped make the signing possible. Laubenberg told Perry, who announced last week that he wouldn't seek a fourth full term as governor next year, that ""your eternal legacy will be as a defender of life.""

Sen. Glenn Hegar, a Katy Republican who sponsored the bill in the Senate, called it ""a very proud day in Texas history.""

""This will literally change the lives of millions of Texans,"" Hegar said. ""Not just today in 2013, but for eternity."""

The good news about HealthCare.gov, the portal to Obamacare’s health exchange, is that the administration is no longer minimizing its problems. That’s the first step toward fixing the mess—and it will get fixed, although it’s anyone’s guess whether the new promise of a smoothly functioning system by the end of November will be met. We know, after all, that Obamacare is workable, since many states that chose to run their own exchanges are doing quite well. But while we wait for the geeks to do their stuff, let’s ask a related question: Why did this thing have to be so complicated in the first place?

Of all the official reactions to changing mores on marijuana, decriminalization is the best.

I did not say that my decision, and the Supreme Court’s decision affirming it (written, be it noted, by the notably liberal Justice Stevens), were wrong, only that, in common with many other judges, I could not be confident that it was right, since I am one of the judges who doesn’t understand the electoral process sufficiently well to be able to gauge the consequences of decisions dealing with that process. I may well have been wrong in Crawford, because laws similar (I do not say identical) to Indiana’s represent a “type of law now widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention” (emphasis added)—“now” referring to the fact there has been a flurry of such laws since 2007, when my opinion in the Crawford case was issued, and they have been sharply criticized.

Lou Reed, who has died at age 71, will be rightly remembered for creating a canon that was groundbreaking in the scope of its sociological and literary achievement. There was nothing unreasonable about Reed’s 1987 suggestion to Rolling Stone that “all through this, I’ve always thought that if you thought of all of it as a book then you have the Great American Novel, every record as a chapter. They’re all in chronological order. You take the whole thing, stack it and listen to it in order, there’s my Great American Novel.” Yet, Reed was, as well, an artist who understood and engaged in the political struggles of his times. No one who followed the remarkable career of the Velvet Underground co-founder and iconic solo artist over the better part of five decades failed to recognize his determination to speak up—and to show up.

I haven't heard such enthusiastic, downright raucous applause since Texas Gov. ""Oops"" Perry suggested in 2009 that his state just might withdraw from the union. Unfortunately for him, the applauders were not Texans, but the people of the other 49 states. This year, though, Idaho is the recipient of hip-hip-hoorays from across the country. Why? Because it has been selected as the site of an extraordinary new town to be named ""III Citadel."" This will be a walled, heavily-fortified, one-square-mile settlement of some 7,000 armed & angry, ideologically-pure, anti-government extremists drawn from cities, towns and gopher holes all across America. Lucky you, Idaho!

Here’s the mistake made by President Obama and the Democrats that nobody is talking about: They have been too fearful of confronting our country’s three-year obsession with the wrong problem. And here is the tea party’s greatest victory: It has made the wrong problem the center of policymaking. The wrong problem is the deficit. The right problem is sluggish growth and persistent unemployment."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/02/Obama-debt-ceiling,2013-01-02 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Who Will Stop Bully Obama on Debt Ceiling?,"With President Obama set to precipitate a constitutional crisis over the upcoming debt ceiling, Republicans in Congress must now stand up to the bullying commander in chief.

Yesterday, after the fiscal cliff had been passed through Congress, President Obama claimed victory. “Just recently,” he told supporters, “Republicans in Congress said they’d never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. We’ve now raised those rates, permanently, making our tax code more progressive than it’s been in decades.”

But more important than Obama’s triumphalism was his insistence that he will not – repeat, will not – negotiate over the debt ceiling. At all. “While I will negotiate over many things,” Obama said, “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed.” Of course, Obama has racked up those bills, and it is he who refuses to pay the freight with any cuts whatsoever. But now he’s declaring the unilateral authority to avoid discussing the debt ceiling. “What the president was saying was, ‘I’m not going to play chicken with the debt limit,'” said Jen Psaki, Obama’s spokeswoman.

Under the Constitution of the United States, the House of Representatives has the power of the purse strings. It is Congress that decides whether or not to incur more debt, not the president. And yet Obama has essentially stated that he will not stand for any negotiation surrounding that Congressional power.

That’s tyrannical. But unlike in the past, the Democrats in Congress are willing to go along with such systemic perversion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has shown himself quite willing to give Obama unlimited power to raise the debt ceiling.

So the question now is whether Republicans will stand strong against this unconstitutional aggression from President Obama. In 2011, Republicans in Congress caved, and ended up with the pathetic fiscal cliff proposal that set up massive tax increases and an across-the-board cut. Then they made that cave complete in order to avoid those default tax increases.

Now, however, they have a second chance to stand tall. But they will have to stand together, and they will have to hold Obama’s feet to the fire. The issue of the debt ceiling is about more than spending. It is about whether we have a Constitutional system worth preserving, or whether the President should be allowed to run roughshod over it. Speaker of the House John Boehner has been re-elected — and in achieving re-election, he has given himself a second bite at an apple he missed in 2011, during that disastrous debt ceiling debate. The time for compromise is finished. Our thug president ended it. Republicans must realize that, and act accordingly.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-to-host-top-lawmakers-as-default-looms-160042194.html,,[],Chaos but optimism as Washington gropes toward a deal,"A postponed high-stakes meeting at the White House. A rescheduled closed-door gathering of Republican senators. Leaders of the bitterly divided Congress ducking into each others' offices. President Barack Obama, behind a table of bologna sandwiches, pressing lawmakers to forge an 11th-hour deal to spare the fragile economy from a potentially catastrophic debt default.

And from the chaos, growing optimism about a possible deal — even though it may just set the weary country up for another confrontation in only a few short months.

With the partial government shutdown entering its third week and the United States due to slam into the congressionally set debt ceiling in just days, top lawmakers and Obama sounded uncharacteristically hopeful Monday about an agreement to get back to business and avert a default.

Two Democratic Senate aides cautiously described the emerging deal as including a debt-ceiling hike that would last until Feb. 7 or 15, 2014, providing enough money to keep the government open until mid-January, and securing a commitment from all sides to launch comprehensive negotiations on the nation's finances.

Those broader budget discussions would not take the form of a supercommittee. (That ship has sailed — and sank.) Instead, negotiators from the Senate and House would meet to hash out differences on the budget — a “conference,” as called for under regular congressional procedure when the two chambers disagree. The conference would target an agreement by mid-December.

Democrats hoped those broader discussions would lead to some sort of compromise that would avert the next round of automatic, across-the-board “sequestration” spending cuts due to take effect in January.

Amid the frantic negotiations, the White House scheduled a 3 p.m. ET Oval Office meeting between Obama and the top GOP and Democratic leaders in Congress — then postponed it indefinitely, saying the president hoped to give lawmakers more time to reach a deal.

Story continues

Senate Republicans encountered their own scheduling snafu, first calling a 5:45 p.m. ET closed-door conference to discuss the possible agreement, and then putting it off until Tuesday to accommodate lawmakers not yet returned from their district.

Obama staged a photo-op visit to a local food bank, posing in a green apron with kids and furloughed government employees — and facing a symbolic struggle of his own, as polarized Washington leaders struggled to seal the deal.

“The Ziplock’s not zipping,” the president said, wrestling a sandwich into a plastic bag.

Obama told reporters that he hoped to use the White House talks to gauge “whether this progress is real.”

“And you know, my hope is that a spirit of cooperation will move us forward over the next few hours,” he said. The meeting was postponed not long afterward.

The postponed meeting would have included Republican House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Vice President Joe Biden was also due to attend.

The U.S. Treasury says the government will hit its debt ceiling Thursday, running out of the authority to borrow money to pay for existing programs and risking a debt default that experts warn will send shock waves through the fragile global economy.

“Not only is it untenable for us to continue this shutdown — this week if we don't start making some real progress both in the House and the Senate, and if Republicans aren't willing to set aside some of their partisan concerns in order to do what's right for the country, we stand a good chance of defaulting,” Obama warned. “And defaulting would have a potentially devastating effect on our economy, sending interest rates shooting up, [and] people — whether Social Security recipients or people with disabilities or small-business people who are vendors to government — not getting paid on time.”

“We've already had a damaging effect on our economy because of the shutdown,” the president added. “That damage would be greatly magnified if we don't make sure that the government's paying its bills, and that has to be decided this week.”

Reid and McConnell have been working behind the scenes to cobble together a deal, and a bipartisan group of 12 senators has been doing the same. Ultimately, though, the question is: How will the House GOP respond, with time already running short?



""We're getting closer,"" Reid told reporters after he met privately with McConnell.

The Republican leader agreed: ""We’ve had an opportunity to have some constructive exchanges of views on how to move forward. I share his optimism — we will get a result that will be acceptable to both sides.""

Several other lawmakers have sounded optimistic notes about getting a deal done quickly.

“I think we'll solve this problem over the next few days. I think today may be a very good day,” Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe.""

But Obama said he would keep pushing Congress “until the details are done.”

And the president appeared to refer to public opinion polls that have shown Republicans bearing the brunt of the blame for a shutdown that their tea party-affiliated rank and file triggered by demanding that the president accept some rolling back of his signature health care law, Obamacare.

“There's been some progress on the Senate side, with Republicans recognizing it's not tenable, it's not smart, it's not good for the American people to let America default,” he said."

Paul Ryan thinks the second-highest child poverty in the developed world and sequestration are a great start, but there's more to be done.

But the picture looks even worse when you examine just how far below the relative poverty line these children tend to fall. The UNICEF report looks at something it calls the “child poverty gap,” which measures how far the average poor child falls below the relative poverty line. It does this by measuring the gap between the relative poverty line and the average income of poor families. Alarmingly, the United States also scores second-to-last on this measurement, with the average poor child living in a home that makes 36 percent less than the relative poverty line.

The United States ranks 34 out of 35 on a UNICEF measure of relative child poverty in developed nations. To be clear, that's 34 out of 35 in the bad way—second highest level, doing better than only Romania with more than 20 percent of children living in a household with an income below half the median.This is the context before the start of sequestration, as Bryce Covert points out. With the full effects of sequestration yet to come, we've already seen kids cut from Head Start programs , less housing assistance available to families struggling to stay off the street, and homeless shelters losing funding among the sequester's effects that will hit poor kids directly.

Of course all of this is just a tiny taste of what Republicans would like to deal out to poor and struggling families through Paul Ryan's Republican budget. That's why Republicans wanted the sequester to happen to begin with, their whining about airports and White House tours notwithstanding."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/27/13-million-lose-unemployment-benefits-Saturday,2013-12-27 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],1.3 Million Lose Unemployment Benefits Saturday,"On Saturday, an estimated 1.3 million long-term unemployed Americans will lose their unemployment insurance benefits. For the first time since 2008, Congress failed to extend the benefits went it passed a budget just before Christmas. The Obama Administration has warned that more than 4 million unemployed could lose benefits next year unless Congress passes another extension.

In the past, states provided unemployed workers with up to 26 weeks of benefits. At the start of the recession, the federal government provided extra weeks of assistance. During the depths of the recession, federal and state governments provided 99 weeks of cash payments. For those keeping score at home, that is almost 2 years of financial assistance. The average benefit is around $1,100 a month.

The expiration of benefits for the long-term unemployed has already sparked a round of finger-pointing in Washington. On Friday, the left-wing Huffington Post put much of the blame on Democrats. “The record indicates that Democrats were late to show up, distracted in part by other concerns,” HuffPo reported. “A month and a half before the deadline, few members of Congress or administration officials were even talking about unemployment insurance.”

Extending the benefits for another year would cost the government $25 billion. The left argues that this assistance helps the economy, by giving the unemployed cash to purchase consumer goods. The Congressional Budget Office has even estimated that extending benefits for the unemployed creates around 200,000 jobs.

This argument is absurd. It is the fiscal policy version of the “broken windows” economic fallacy. If all my windows were broken, I would have to spend a lot of money replacing them. This would theoretically boost the economy by providing work for glaziers and other workers. This does not factor, however, what else I could have done with my money. It is likely that it could have been spent or invested far more productively than simply replacing what I already had.

If the government wants to extend unemployment benefits for another year, it will have to borrow $25 billion. The cost of this will actually increase over time, as the government pays interest on this debt. These are resources that can’t be used for anything else, whether its infrastructure improvements or tax reform.

A bigger problem than the duration of unemployment benefits, is the number of the long-term unemployed. More than 4 million Americans looking for work have been unemployed for more than 27 weeks, beyond the time-frame of traditional unemployment insurance. The recession officially ended more than 4 years ago. Such a large number of long-term unemployed suggests deeper problems with the economy than can be fixed by simply adding additional benefits.

Absurdly, at the same time the left is pushing for an extension of unemployment benefits, it is also pushing to hike the minimum wage. If someone has been unemployed for 99 weeks, mandating higher wages is unlikely to be of much help. Minimum wage hikes, at least at the margin, have a negative impact on job creation.

Extending unemployment benefits may itself be counter-productive for job creation. A landmark study from Sweden found that more generous unemployment benefits increased the rates of unemployment. The relationship was very robust. Every 1% point increase in benefits increased unemployment by 5%.

In 2007, Sweden reformed its unemployment insurance system. The government provides 60 weeks of benefits, but on a sliding scale. The longer someone is unemployed, the less they receive in assistance. This system provides a powerful incentive to find work.

It is perhaps telling that, in 2013, we are in such a state that American lawmakers should look to Sweden for economic reforms."
http://news.yahoo.com/world-welcomes-us-budget-deal-fears-remain-184819023--finance.html,,[],World welcomes US budget deal but fears remain,"LONDON (AP) — The world's disbelief at the political impasse in the U.S. turned to cautious relief Thursday as the country stepped back from the brink of default. But fears remain about another possible shutdown — and, even worse, a possible default — early next year.

At the same time, experts and foreign officials warned that Washington's credibility had been damaged — a point President Barack Obama echoed.

The deal may assure only a few months of financial order, and the prospect of another possible crisis early in January when the agreement lapses leaves many wondering about U.S. government stability. The short-term nature of the deal makes many uneasy.

""It's a huge threat to the leadership of an indispensable power,"" Klaus Scharioth, Germany's ambassador to Washington from 2006 until 2011, told The Associated Press. ""That's bad news for all of us. It's bad news for Europeans because we're the closest partners of the U.S., but it's bad news for the rest of the world too if they don't exercise the power that they have.""

He expressed the hope that American democracy can right itself in time to prevent another disaster once the current deal expires in January.

""The answer has to come from within,"" he said. ""I hope the current situation is bad enough that people realize it cannot continue.""

International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde said the shaky American economy needs more stable long-term solutions.

""It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner,"" she said in a statement.

The stopgap nature of the solution that avoided a default left some experts warning that repeated dramas could sap confidence in the U.S., causing market problems with global implications.

Standard Chartered economist Samiran Chakraborty in Mumbai said American financial markets may over time lose faith.

""In three months' time, this could be back again,"" said Chakraborty. ""If this kind of pushing it back happens several times, then this comfort that the markets had over the last 20 days that a deal will be reached, that comfort may now be dead.""

Story continues

Also, the congressional cliffhanger might dent longer-term confidence in American government debt, a cornerstone of global credit markets, prompting creditors to demand higher interest.

Xenia Dormandy, director of the Americas program at London's Chatham House, said the U.S. image had suffered a double blow, with both its economic and political credentials called into question

""There is a sense that the U.S. as a reliable ally is not necessarily the case anymore,"" she said, warning that both American allies and adversaries have reached this conclusion. But she, like others, said the damage is most likely short term.

Dormandy and other experts warned that the crisis isn't over and that it is too early to feel relief. Instead, those outside the U.S. must accept that confusion is an integral part of the American democratic system, she said.

Even if the current debate is resolved something else would likely come up and divide the country again, Dormandy added.

""If it's not the debt ceiling, it'd be something else,"" she said.

There are signs that the world is becoming weary of the repeated threats and counter threats that have become a regular feature of U.S. politics. The budget crisis has made many outside the U.S. question the way the world's leading power conducts its business at home even as it seeks to exert influence overseas.

Peter Trubowitz, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, said the U.S. system is so dysfunctional that it is sending confusing signals abroad.

""It's just gotten to the point now that it's having lots of negative side effects,"" he said. ""The effect is especially felt in Asia, where countries were already concerned about America's commitment to the region.""

Many in Europe enjoyed poking fun at the apparently broken U.S. political system, but the pleasure of laughing at America's troubles seemed to fade as default neared.

The Tea Party movement got short shrift in many quarters, with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in Munich, Germany suggesting that Obama was lucky to have such feeble adversaries. But the paper said Obama had also fallen short of expectations.

""It is easy to remain the reasonable, serene statesman if you are dealing with concrete-headed , self-righteous nihilists like the Tea Party lawmakers,"" the influential newspaper said in a commentary. ""It is easy to reject all negotiations if the other side acts like a crazy extortionist gang. Obama played the PR -game of guilt and innocence very cleverly. According to the polls, he wins hands down. But that is not the primary task of the president.""

The newspaper said Obama had not handled his responsibility as president well despite his apparent victory over the Tea Party.

In Israel, a key American ally in the Middle East, commentators said the fight hurt America's overall image even though a deal had been reached before it was too late.

""There is no doubt that damage was done here to the image of American economic stability,"" Israel's economic envoy to Washington, Eli Groner, told Israel's Army Radio. ""It's not good for the financial markets, not in the United States and not around the world.""

In Brazil, a large holder of U.S. debt, there was certainly relief, but also concerns that it's just a temporary fix and more turbulence is ahead. Finance Minister Guido Mantega said the U.S. must come to a lasting answer to the ""temporary solution"" that was found. He added that as long as the threat of another shutdown exists, there will be ""a sensation of insecurity, distrust and therefore damage to business in general.""

Brazil's biggest newspapers carried headlines like O Globo's ""Temporary Relief"" and leading economic columnist Miriam Leitao summed up the mood in the daily.

""Nobody won. Everybody lost. The Obama government was held prisoner by blackmail. The Republican party allowed itself to be controlled by a radical minority and no longer represents the average American's way of thinking,"" Leitao wrote. ""The government as a whole lost credibility and today there is more uncertainty surrounding the world economy.""

I present this image because it is the perfect metaphor for the heartless, billionaire-funded hostage situation orchestrated by our country's Republican leadership.

For not only does this cute, costume-wearing kid imagistically represent those innocent Americans who are being hurt by the shutdown.

According to a report in the National Journal, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA), and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) think the “tactical play” will “boost” the reform’s changes.

Breitbart News reporter Matthew Boyle reported ten days ago that House Republicans were planning to pass various piecemeal bills and hope to conference with the Senate to get a more comprehensive bill enacted. Conservatives expressed to Boyle their concerns that conferencing with senators–and potentially the White House–would transform whatever is passed in the House into something resembling the Senate’s bill, which Numbers USA Executive Director Roy Beck said, on Breitbart News Sunday, was an “end of America” bill.

Last Friday, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) essentially made the strategy public at a town hall event in his district, confirming Boyle’s reporting.

National Journal noted that House Republican leaders wanted to keep immigration “on the back-burner” to lessen the type of “backlash” that coalesced against Obamacare in August 2009.

As Politico reported, five “a la carte” immigration bills have already passed two key committees in the House while the Senate was debating its immigration bill.

Bills passed in either the Homeland Security or Judiciary Committees include a border security bill that has weaker provisions than the Senate’s, a plan to award 500,000 visas to agricultural workers, which “can be adjusted according to market needs,” a bill to lift the current cap on high-skilled visas, a bill to give states more power to enforce federal immigration laws, and an E-Verify trigger that will make newly-legalized immigrants “undocumented” again if E-Verify is not in place by five years."

Economists were expecting a gain of 180,000 jobs in July, according to a survey by CNNMoney. And the unemployment rate, which stood at 7.6% in June, fell more than expected.

U.S. stock futures edged lower as investors digested the news, including revisions to data from prior months.

The Federal Reserve has said that improvement in the job market could be a trigger for the central bank to begin removing the liquidity it has been pumping into the market.

The federal budget expires Sept. 30 without a new act of Congress

Federal agencies have to determine which workers are essential to health%2C safety and compliance

Workers are not allowed to volunteer to come to work

WASHINGTON — If Congress doesn't pass a new spending bill in the next week, the federal government will shut down on Oct. 1.

That is, 41% of it will.

An estimated 59% of non-defense federal employees would be exempt from the shutdown and would go to work as usual, according to a USA TODAY analysis of 119 shutdown contingency plans filed with the Office of Management and Budget.

Among them: political appointees, law enforcement, most overseas foreign service officers and anyone else deemed necessary for health or safety of people or property.

That last category can account for a broad cross-section of federal employees, because positions that support a key function — such as information technology, security or even legal help — are also protected. Even a receptionist responsible for picking up sensitive mail deliveries could be considered essential and exempted from furlough.

Maintaining an agency website usually isn't a necessary function, although the Office of Management and Budget said this month that the IRS website may be necessary ""to allow for tax filings and tax collection."" That's one key difference from the last government shutdown in 1996, when agencies were less reliant on the Web.

""Where those lines are drawn can change from time to time,"" said Ray Natter, a former deputy chief counsel of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. And the two government agencies responsible for interpreting the law on who's essential and who's not — the Office of Legal Counsel and the Comptroller General — often give inconsistent advice, he said.

Agencies that don't operate on an annual appropriation from Congress also will continue to operate normally. That would include the Postal Service, the Patent and Trademark Office and the Federal Highway Administration. A Census Bureau statistician working on a project in Bangladesh is paid outside of the annual budget and could continue to work.

Meteorologists at the National Weather Service would continue to issue weather forecasts because they're necessary for aviation safety. But ocean and atmospheric scientists who don't produce daily forecasts would also continue to work in order to maintain ""crucial long-term historical climate records,"" according to the Department of Commerce's plan.

At the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the commissioners would continue to work because they're appointed by the president. But the commission's contingency plan also calls for some of the agency's lawyers to go to work, so they can provide ""timely and accurate legal advice"" to the commissioners about what they can and can't do during a shutdown.

About 65% of Washington-based State Department employees — and 10% of overseas-based employees — would be furloughed. Passport offices would be closed, but any State Department official deemed necessary for the president to carry out his treaty-making responsibilities under the Constitution would come to work. And foreign nationals employed by the State Department may be subject to their country's labor laws, which may not allow an unpaid furlough.

For most federal agencies, almost all employees would work at least a half-day after a shutdown to lock their filing cabinets, update their voicemail and fill out time cards. When the shutdown is over, agencies might take a half-day to ramp back up before opening their doors to the public.

USA TODAY looked at the most recent contingency plans for 339 federal departments, agencies and offices, all filed in 2011 when the government last faced the possibility of a shutdown. The analysis does not include the District of Columbia and many smaller agencies that did not submit a report or those that did not provide personnel figures in their reports.

Also not included: the Department of Defense. ""While military personnel would continue in a normal duty status, a large number of our civilian employees would be temporarily furloughed,"" Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said in a memo to employees Monday. Just how many would be furloughed is unclear; Carter said the department is still updating its contingency plan.

At the White House, 365 staffers would report to work and 1,166 would be furloughed during a shutdown.

Natter noted that the Anti-Deficiency Act, the 129-year-old law that forces the government to shut down without an appropriation from Congress, also makes it illegal for furloughed workers to volunteer — even though many end up getting paid whether they work for not. ""It really ought to be rewritten to be more relevant for the 21st century,"" he said.

Roy Meyers, a professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore who teaches federal budgeting, said he's not surprised to see agencies use as much flexibility as they can get away with.

""To the extent that agencies are taking advantage of the vague guidance OMB has given them, it doesn't bother me a bit,"" he said. ""What the agencies are being told to do (is) an asinine thing.""

In a meeting Wednesday with the House Republican conference, Boehner said that a bill offered by Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) to allow individuals to keep their health care plans fits in with that strategy. ""Remember the strategy for stopping Obamacare we laid out to you back in July. It had two components: Aggressive, coordinated oversight, and targeted legislative strikes aimed at shattering the legislative coalition the president has used to force his law on the nation,” Boehner said, closely following his earlier comments. ""That plan is being executed as we speak.""

The statements signal how much of a reversal of fortune Republicans have enjoyed since the Obamacare exchange glitches and cancellations of individual health insurance plans. The shutdown failed to make any changes to Obamacare, while the cancellations have caused even Senate Democrats -- including liberals such as Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) -- to sign onto a bill to allow individuals to keep their health insurance plans.

The White House opposes the Upton bill. However, Roll Call reported Monday that the White House is exploring an ""administrative fix"" to cancellations. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday morning that there may be a presidential announcement on Obamacare by midday.

A Boehner spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: A new strategy for the GOP,"It has become conventional wisdom that Republicans are suffering an internal split that President Obama is successfully exploiting to neuter the Republican House. It is not true, however, that the Republican split is philosophical and fundamental. And that a hopelessly divided GOP is therefore headed for decline, perhaps irrelevance.

In fact, the split is tactical, not philosophical; short-term, not fundamental. And therefore quite solvable.

How do we know? Simple thought experiment: Imagine that we had a Republican president. Would the party be deeply divided over policy, at war with itself in Congress? Not at all. It would be rallying around something like the Paul Ryan budget that twice passed the House with near 100 percent GOP unanimity.

In reality, Republicans have a broad consensus on what they believe, where they want to go and the program to get them there. But they don’t have the power. What divides Republicans today is a straightforward tactical question: Can you govern from one house of Congress? Should you even try?

Can you shrink government, restrain spending, bring a modicum of fiscal sanity to the country when the president and a blocking Senate have no intention of doing so?

One faction feels committed to try. It wishes to carry out its small-government electoral promises and will cast no vote inconsistent with that philosophy. These are the House Republicans who voted no on the “fiscal cliff” deal because it raised taxes without touching spending. Indeed, it increased spending with its crazy-quilt crony-capitalist tax ”credits” — for wind power and other indulgences.

They were willing to risk the fiscal cliff. Today they are willing to risk a breach of the debt ceiling and even a government shutdown rather than collaborate with Obama’s tax-and-spend second-term agenda.

The other view is that you cannot govern from the House. The reason Ryan and John Boehner finally voted yes on the lousy fiscal-cliff deal is that by then there was nowhere else to go. Republicans could not afford to bear the blame (however unfair) for a $4.5 trillion across-the-board tax hike and a Pentagon hollowed out by sequester.

The party establishment is coming around to the view that if you try to govern from one house — e.g., force spending cuts with cliffhanging brinkmanship — you lose. You not only don’t get the cuts. You get the blame for rattled markets and economic uncertainty. You get humiliated by having to cave in the end. And you get opinion polls ranking you below head lice and colonoscopies in popularity.

There is history here. The Gingrich Revolution ran aground when it tried to govern from Congress, losing badly to President Clinton over government shutdowns. Nor did the modern insurgents do any better in the 2011 debt-ceiling and 2012 fiscal-cliff showdowns with Obama.

Obama’s postelection arrogance and intransigence can put you in a fighting mood. I sympathize. But I’m tending toward the realist view: Don’t force the issue when you don’t have the power.

The debt-ceiling deadline is coming up. You can demand commensurate spending cuts, the usual, reasonable Republican offer. But you won’t get them. Obama will hold out. And, at the eleventh hour, you will have to give in as you get universally blamed for market gyrations and threatened credit downgrades.

The more prudent course would be to find some offer that cannot be refused, a short-term trade-off utterly unassailable and straightforward. For example, offer to extend the debt ceiling through, say, May 1, in exchange for the Senate delivering a budget by that date — after four years of lawlessly refusing to produce one.

Not much. But it would (a) highlight the Democrats’ fiscal recklessness, (b) force Senate Democrats to make public their fiscal choices and (c) keep the debt ceiling alive as an ongoing pressure point for future incremental demands.

Republicans should develop a list of such conditions — some symbolic, some substantive — in return for sequential, short-term raising of the debt ceiling. But the key is: Go small and simple. Forget about forcing tax reform or entitlement cuts or anything major. If Obama wants to recklessly expand government, well, as he says, he won the election.

Republicans should simply block what they can. Further tax hikes, for example. The general rule is: From a single house of Congress you can resist but you cannot impose.

Aren’t you failing the country, say the insurgents? Answer: The country chose Obama. He gets four years.

Want to save the Republic? Win the next election. Don’t immolate yourself trying to save liberalism from itself. If your conservative philosophy is indeed right, winning will come. As Margaret Thatcher said serenely of the Labor Party socialists she later overthrew: “They always run out of other people’s money.”

An increasingly outspoken minority of Fed officials are concerned that monthly purchases of about $85 billion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities are doing more harm than good. They argue the effort may need to end even before the nation’s unemployment rate drops, because it is encouraging excessive risk-taking and could make it harder to control inflation.

But the Federal Open Market Committee reiterated its determination in January to hold course until there was “substantial improvement” in the outlook for job growth, and several officials cautioned at the meeting that the greater risk to the economy was in stopping too soon, according to the account, which was published after a standard three-week delay.

Those officials “noted examples of past instances in which policy makers had prematurely removed accommodation, with adverse effects on economic growth, employment and price stability,” it said. “They also stressed the importance of communicating the committee’s commitment to maintaining a highly accommodative stance of policy as long as warranted by economic conditions.”"

AFP PHOTO/Brendan SMIALOWSKI (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)

UPDATE: 4:14 p.m. ET-- In a Monday letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said latest estimates show the U.S. hitting the debt limit by the middle of October.

""Protecting the full faith and credit of the United States is the responsibility of Congress because only Congress can extend the nation's borrowing authority,"" Lew writes. ""Failure to meet that responsibility would cause irreparable harm to the American economy.""

Read Lew's letter to Boehner:

Previously:

The U.S. Treasury is on track to hit the debt limit by mid-October, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

The report provides a more specific timeline than previously cited by Treasury officials. Previously, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said he anticipated the U.S. would not hit the debt ceiling ""until Labor Day.""

""The uncertainty caused by putting this off is not good,"" Lew said in May. ""The anxiety caused to the U.S. and world economy by putting this off until the last minute is not good.""

The Wall Street Journal reports:

The mid-October timeframe is sooner than many on Capitol Hill had anticipated. The government hit the borrowing limit several months ago, but Treasury has used emergency measures—such as suspending certain pension contributions—to buy more time for Congress to act. Some believed that the government's improving fiscal condition—bolstered by rising tax revenue and money coming in from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—could give Treasury even more time, potentially until sometime in December.

Last week, Lew called on Congress to raise the debt ceiling, urging lawmakers to ""avoid another unnecessary self-inflicted wound"" ahead of the Treasury exceeding the limit.

""We cannot afford for Congress to wait until some unknowable last minute to resolve this matter on the eve of a deadline,"" Lew said.

As Reuters reported last week, House Republicans have floated using the debt limit as leverage to defund President Barack Obama's health care reform law.

""There are plenty of discussions ongoing but no decisions at this point,"" one GOP leadership aide said."

Plans to Close Offices for 10 Days to Cut Costs,"WASHINGTON — After months of agonizing about how to deal with the effects of government spending cuts, senior F.B.I. officials in Washington have decided how they will reduce the bureau’s spending: they will shut down its headquarters and offices across the country for roughly 10 weekdays over the next year.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s plans mean that on those days, the bureau will have only a skeleton crew on hand, which raises questions about how effectively it can respond to crime.

While the shutdown conjures images of the recent movie “The Purge,” in which the government allows people to commit crimes like murder and rape for 12 hours once a year, F.B.I. officials said they would have plans for agents to return to work if there was a terrorist attack or a crime like a kidnapping.

Senior agency officials in Washington decided the closings were the easiest way to furlough employees, whose compensation accounts for roughly 60 percent of the bureau’s budget, according to people briefed on the plan. It costs the F.B.I. about $16 million a day to pay its employees, and it is far more cost effective to have the entire work force stay home at the same time than to allow employees to choose the days they want off, the people said. Other federal law enforcement agencies are expected to adopt similar furlough plans as cost-cutting measures."

WASHINGTON — Facing a divided political system, economic troubles at home and continued unrest overseas, President Obama urged Americans to work together to ""face the realities of our time.""

""This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. America's possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention. My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it — so long as we seize it together.""

Obama's 18-minute inaugural speech touched on the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., education, gay rights, climate change, jobs and the swelling federal budget deficit, but it acknowledged polarizing politics that have divided much of the nation and thwarted problem-solving.

""Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness. Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time — but it does require us to act in our time,'' Obama said.

""For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.""

After watching the Inaugural Parade as night fell, Obama addressed cheering crowds at the Commander in Chief Ball and spoke by video to troops in southern Afghanistan. He then introduced his ""date,"" Michelle Obama, who danced with her husband in a ruby chiffon and velvet gown while Jennifer Hudson sang Let's Stay Together.

Earlier, Obama declared in tweets that ""our work begins today"" and vowed to ""finish what we started"" before arriving at the Capitol.

Obama adviser David Axelrod told CBS' This Morning that the speech was designed to focus on ""values and principles, not so much about programs and prescriptions.""

There was a minor blip when Obama was sworn in by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. In 2009, Roberts flubbed Obama's official swearing-in — prompting Roberts and Obama to repeat the presidential oath in a private ceremony to ensure there were no constitutional issues

On the steps of the Capitol, Roberts got it right Monday, but Obama appeared to stumble over the word ""states"" as he repeated back the words ""the office of president of the United States.""

Obama had officially been sworn in for a second term Sunday, in accordance with the Constitution, which requires presidential terms to begin Jan. 20.

Thousands began gathering in the dark, chilly predawn hours to see Monday's event, with up to 700,000 expected to flood into the city for his address, parade and other festivities.

They filled street corners and stood in long snaking lines all around the Capitol and surrounding neighborhoods. Blocks from where Obama would be inaugurated, people shuffled down streets, snapping photos before sunrise. Many wore long coats, hats, scarfs, earmuffs and sequined Obama hats.

Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were in attendance, but former president George H. W. Bush, released Monday from a Houston hospital and recuperating from bronchitis, did not attend. Neither did his son, former president George W. Bush.

The Obamas attended a service at 8:45 a.m. at St. John's Church. It included prayers from pastors Joel Hunter and Luis Leon, followed by a blessing by Bishop Vacti McKenzie. ""Bless this administration with both favor and grace,"" McKenzie said. ""Give them the resources and people necessary to get the job done.""

First daughter Malia was in a playful mood as the family returned to the White House. As the president's limo pulled up, Malia sneaked up to surprise her dad, shouting ""Boo!"" as he got out. ""You scared me!"" he told her.

Around town, police and military authorities were part of a ubiquitous security presence, stretching from downtown to Metro train platforms in suburban Virginia and Maryland.

Coast Guard patrol boats were the only vessels plying the Potomac River. A large stretch of the river, from the Francis Scott Key Bridge to south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, was closed to commercial and recreational users as part of an elaborate inaugural security plan.

Federal and local law enforcement officials reported no arrests throughout the morning. Crowd numbers continued to run well behind the record numbers at the inauguration in 2009.

D.C. Metropolitan Police, FBI and Secret Service officials said security operations had encountered no serious problems through Monday afternoon.

""Things have run pretty smoothly so far,'' Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said.

U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Shennell Antrobus said there had been some ""medical emergencies'' but did not elaborate.

Transit officials said four stations were temporarily closed Monday afternoon because of crowding, causing major delays for people leaving the inauguration. At the L'Enfant Plaza station south of the National Mall, hundreds waited outside in massive bottlenecks as police temporarily barred entry. The line to get into the Judiciary Square station stretched a block, then wrapped around a corner.

Dionne Davis, 36, of Columbus, Ohio, woke at 4 a.m. determined to get as close as she could to the festivities without an official ticket. She watched the last inauguration at home, but decided this time she had to be here.

Davis traveled from a family member's home in Capitol Heights, Md., parked at the Metro and took a long train ride into the city. ""I just want to be part of history,"" Davis said. ""I want this to be something I can tell my kids and grandkids.""

Briskly walking down 3rd Street at 6:30 a.m., Davis said she was happy to brush shoulders with other people. She's ready for a long day and has supplies to prove it.

""We ate before we left, I took my vitamins, and I got my bottle of water,"" she said. ""I'm just excited. These are experiences that last forever.""

""What the inauguration reminds us of is the role we have as fellow citizens in promoting a common good even as we carry out our individual responsibilities,"" Obama told supporters during a reception Sunday. ""The sense that there's something larger than ourselves that gives shape and meaning to our lives.""

Obama begins his second term four years after inheriting an economic crisis and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The first Obama administration saw a national health care plan, a major stimulus bill, new financial regulations and an end to combat operations in Iraq, the winding down of the war in Afghanistan and the Navy SEAL raid that killed 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Obama tangled with congressional Republicans who protested a record-setting rise of the federal debt, a slow-growing economy and a stubbornly high unemployment rate. Republicans still control the U.S. House.

As the president started a new term, throngs of well-wishers were in town.

Before 7 a.m., the Metro station closest to the Capitol building looked and sounded like a baseball stadium. Crowds flocked from trains and up the escalators, where they were greeted by vendors selling pins and posters while volunteers carrying ""ask me"" signs offered directions and greetings.

Vendors set up folding tables for several blocks along Pennsylvania Avenue behind the Capitol, selling trinkets ranging from Obama pins and T-shirts to knit caps embroidered ""Obama: Back 2 Back.""

""Good morning, welcome to the inauguration!"" a pair of volunteers sang out to the crowd.

DuWanna Thomas, a lawyer and consultant from Atlanta, was on an Orange Line Metro train headed to inauguration festivities by 6:15 a.m. She came to Obama's inauguration four years ago.

""This is very rewarding for me,"" said Thomas, armed with an Obama blanket and a small backpack with food. ""It's just excellent. He's the best president.""

Pam Johnson of Floyd, Iowa, was also on a Metro train by 6:15. She voted for President Obama twice and managed to snag a ticket to his second inauguration. ""This is an experience of a lifetime for me to be right here, right now,"" said Johnson, president of the National Corn Growers Association. ""When I found out the opportunity to go, I didn't want to miss it.""

Thomas Kannam, 8, came with his mom, dad and older sister. It's Kannam's first inauguration. ""I want to see the president,"" Thomas said, holding tightly to a blanket wrapped around his shoulders for warmth.

The New York African American Chamber of Commerce sent two buses with 56 people on each, according to Raquel Sanchez, 41, of New York. They arrived at around 5:45 a.m. Some were unable to put partisan politics aside.

""I hate the divide in the House and in Congress,"" said Stephanie Simmons, 59. Obama has struggled because Republicans won't work with him, Simmons said, which she said may be ""a black-white thing"" beyond regular partisan differences.

Senate Democrats%2C acting in concert with President Obama%2C have rejected four different proposals.

The president says that in divided government%2C no one gets 100%25 of what they want.

The president isn't telling the whole story when it comes to the government shutdown. The fact is that Washington Democrats have slammed the door on reopening the government by refusing to engage in bipartisan talks. And, as stories across the country highlight the devastating impact of Obamacare on families and small businesses, they continue to reject our calls for fairness for all Americans.

This is part of a larger pattern: the president's scorched-Earth policy of refusing to negotiate in bipartisan way on his health care law, current government funding, or the debt limit.

As of this morning, Senate Democrats, acting in concert with President Obama, have rejected four different proposals from the House of Representatives to keep the government running and fund basic services.

On Friday, September 20, 2013, the House of Representatives passed legislation to keep the government running – funding Medicare, Social Security, veterans benefits, and more – while removing funding for the president's health care law, which is driving up costs and hurting our economy.

The Democratic-controlled Senate rejected this measure.

On Saturday, September 28, 2013, the House passed another measure to keep the government running, delay the president's health care law for one year, and permanently repeal Obamacare's tax on pacemakers and children's hearing aids.

Senate Democrats rejected the measure on a party-line vote.

(The House also passed the Pay Our Military Act, which ensures our troops are paid during a government shutdown. Thankfully, that measure was adopted by the Senate and signed by President Obama.)

On Monday, September 30, 2013, the House passed yet another measure to keep the government running and ensure fairness for all Americans under the president's health care law. President Obama delayed the law's mandates on big businesses and insurance companies; this bill would delay the law for everyone.

The Senate rejected this measure too.

The House then passed another bill late on Monday requesting a formal conference committee with the Senate to come to an agreement on legislation that provides funding for the federal government and delays the president's health care law for all Americans. That is the system the Founding Fathers gave us to resolve differences between the House and Senate.

The Senate then opposed that measure as well, so Senate Democrats and President Obama got their government shutdown.

In the meantime, in just a few weeks, Congress must act to raise the debt limit to pay the tab for President Obama and Washington's out-of-control spending. There is no way Congress can or should pass such a bill without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit and help get our economy moving again. But President Obama refuses to even talk about negotiating such a bipartisan agreement.

For years, the president has said that in a divided government, no one gets 100% of what they want. But when will his words match his actions?

As for House Republicans, we will continue our efforts to keep the government running and deal honestly with the problems we face. We hope that Senate Democrats – and President Obama – change course and start working with us on behalf of the American people.

Stewart'],"In Rural Iowa, Spending, Not the Shutdown, Raises Worry","The Republican Party has long claimed to be the champion of business, large and small, and an advocate for fiscal responsibility. Yet now Republicans in Congress have precipitated a shutdown of the federal government and are threatening to let the nation default on its once Triple-A-rated debt.

How could this be?

Since no one in Washington seems to be listening to anyone on the other side of the standoff, I spent much of the week on the phone with voters and business people in Iowa’s Fourth Congressional District, a sprawling, mostly agricultural region that runs from Sioux City, on the Nebraska border, to Mason City, close to Minnesota in the northwest quadrant of the state. I picked the district because its representative in Congress, the Republican Steve King, has been one of the most outspoken advocates for blocking Obamacare, even if that means shutting down the government or defaulting on the national debt.

In this bedrock conservative district, I found that people were fed up with the gridlock in Washington. But while they are beginning to question Mr. King’s tactics, they continue to support his core commitment to cutting the size of government.

Mr. King has certainly staked out some controversial positions, even by conservative standards, and is a frequent target on both the Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert shows. He claimed that “radical Islamicists” would be “dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on Sept. 11” if Obama was elected. He warned that Iowa was in danger of becoming a “gay marriage mecca” and led a successful effort to recall three State Supreme Court judges who ruled in favor of gay marriage. He was one of only 11 members of Congress to oppose aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina, has defended racial profiling and has brushed off concerns about global warming as being “more religion than science.” He has drawn the ire of animal rights activists with his support for dog and cock fighting while opposing food safety measures. House Speaker John Boehner described some of his comments on illegal immigrants as “hateful” and “ignorant.”"

A file picture dated 01 March 2013 shows a longtime exposure image of clouds moving above the US Capitol in Washington, DC, USA. EPA/JIM LO SCALZO

The federal government officially shut down for the first time in 17 years at midnight on Monday, after House Republicans refused to drop demands that parts of the Affordable Care Act be delayed in return for approval of a mandatory government funding bill.



Federal employees who are considered essential to public safety will be expected to work this week. But most federal offices will be closed until Congress reaches a deal. The shutdown is the first one of its kind since 1996, when the government closed for 26 days under President Bill Clinton.

Despite missing the deadline, debate persisted in the House and Senate early into the morning. The House is still planning to request to establish a conference committee with the Senate, but Senate Democratic leaders preemptively rejected the offer Monday night, saying they would not negotiate until the House had passed a bill to fund the government for six weeks without any extra provisions.



The Senate will likely respond by tabling the offer, which will take the federal government into a partial shutdown scenario beginning Tuesday morning.



House Republican leaders intend to request a conference committee from Senate Democrats to resolve differences on a bill to fund the government. But earlier Monday, Senate Democrats announced they would reject a House request for a conference committee to find a solution to budget woes.

""Republicans are still playing games,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat of Nevada said on the House floor.

Appointing a conference committee would not have averted a government shutdown before the Monday night deadline when government funding levels expire, but it could have put the battling parties in a position to reach an agreement to fund the government faster than the game of legislative ping pong House Republicans played with Senate Democrats on the final day before the shutdown deadline.



Over the past week, the Senate rejected the third proposal from the House to keep the government open while also attacking Obamacare — most recently by delaying the individual mandate to buy health insurance and by prohibiting congressional staff members from federal insurance subsidies under the controversial health care program.

Story continues

As time grew short, President Barack Obama signed last-minute legislation to ensure that members of the military and personnel at the Department of Homeland Security get paid even in the event of a shutdown. And aides scoffed at the conference request as a desperate gambit ensuring that government will turn out the lights at midnight.



Obama, after stepping before cameras to urge an end to the standoff, reached out by telephone to Republican House Speaker John Boehner, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ― but there was no breakthrough, a White House official said.

As a result of Republicans refusing to hold a budget conference to set spending levels for the year, Congress is funding the government with short-term, stop-gap ""continuing resolutions"" that must be approved when old ones expire. The deadline for approving a new one is midnight Monday.

Earlier this month, House Republicans passed their first version of a spending bill but added a controversial amendment that would defund Obamacare. After a lengthy debate over the bill in the Democrat-controlled Senate, which included a 21-hour protest speech from Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, the upper chamber rejected the House bill and returned its version with the Obamacare funding reinserted.

Senate Democratic leaders warned that they would accept nothing short of a “clean” continuation of funding — one without riders such as defunding Obamacare — a move that practically dared Republicans to blink.

House Republicans only dug in their heels deeper. Over the weekend, they approved another bill, one that would delay Obamacare for a year and permanently abolish a tax on medical devices, and the Senate rejected it Monday.

Boehner, Republican of Ohio, chided Senate Democrats Monday for waiting until the day before a shutdown to act and reiterated the House’s intention to use the shutdown battle as a vessel to cripple the health care law.

""This law is not ready for prime time. The House has done its work,” Boehner said on the House floor. “It's time for the Senate to listen to the American people just like the House has listened to the American people and pass a one-year delay of Obamacare.""

Obama, who has vowed to veto any spending bill that tampers with the Affordable Care Act, said Monday that he was not ""resigned"" to a shutdown.



“I suspect I will be speaking to the leaders today, tomorrow and the next day,"" Obama said.

Before the House chose to attack Obamacare using the mandatory spending bill, House Republicans had planned instead to use an upcoming vote to raise the federal government’s debt limit as the vehicle for delaying the law. However, with support from Cruz and his allies in the Senate, House conservatives demanded action immediately. Boehner relented, Democrats refused to budge and the federal government shut down.

He was Treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010.

Imagine a library where many books have been borrowed and are long overdue. There is a case for an amnesty to get the books back and move on. There is a case for saying that rules are rules and fines must be paid. But the worst strategy is to keep indicating that an amnesty may come soon without ever introducing it. And this is roughly where we are in our corporate tax debate.

No one is satisfied with the U.S. corporate tax system. Some argue the main problem is that, while corporate profits are extraordinarily high relative to gross domestic product, tax collections are relatively low. Many very successful companies pay little or nothing in taxes at a time when the budget deficit is a major concern, hundreds of thousands of defense workers are being furloughed and lotteries are being held to determine which children Head Start can no longer afford to help.

But others say the main problem is that the United States has a higher corporate tax rate than any other major country and, unlike other countries, imposes severe taxes on income earned outside its borders. This, they argue, unfairly burdens companies engaged in international competition and discourages the repatriation of profits earned abroad. The resulting patterns of investment are also said to benefit foreign workers at the expense of their U.S. counterparts.

With respect to tax reform, these perspectives seem to argue in opposite directions. The former points toward the desirability of raising revenue by closing loopholes; the latter seems to call for a reduction in corporate tax burdens. But while many can get behind the idea of “broadening the base and lowering the rate,” consensus tends to collapse over the means to broaden the base. A principal objective of many business-oriented reformers seems to be narrowing the corporate tax base by reducing the taxation of foreign earnings through movement to a territorial system.

Despite the tension between perspectives, the debate has landed us in so perverse a place that win-win reform would be easy to achieve. The central issue is the taxation of global companies. Under current law, U.S. companies are taxed on their foreign profits — with a credit for taxes paid to other governments — only when they repatriate these profits. Right now, U.S. companies are holding nearly $2 trillion in cash abroad. Businesses argue, with some validity, that current rules make it expensive to bring money home while not raising much revenue for the government. Tax relief, they assert, would help them bring money home, at a minimum benefiting their shareholders but also possibly leading to an increase in investment.

Critics counter that companies that have used what might politely be called aggressive accounting practices to locate income in low-tax jurisdictions should not be given further relief.

In the meantime, what’s a corporate treasurer to do? With the possibility of some kind of relief looming, there is every reason to delay repatriating earnings to the United States even if the company has no good use for the cash abroad. And so the debate encourages exactly what all sides can agree is desirable to avoid: corporate cash kept abroad to the detriment of companies and to no benefit for the U.S. fiscal situation.

A clear and unambiguous commitment that there will be no rate reduction or repatriation relief for the next decade would be an improvement over the current situation because companies would know that they will have to pay taxes on their foreign profits if they wish to make them available to shareholders and would no longer have an incentive to delay.

But this would not be the best outcome. As a very general rule, improvement is possible anytime tax rules are experienced by taxpayers as a substantial burden without generating substantial revenue for the government. Having taxpayers be burdened less and pay more can make them better off and help the fiscal situation. The United States should eliminate the distinction between repatriated and unrepatriated foreign corporate profits for U.S. companies and tax all foreign income (after allowances for taxes paid to other governments) at a fixed rate well below its current corporate rate, perhaps in the range of 15 percent.

A similar tax should be imposed on past accumulated profits held abroad.

Such a proposal could easily be designed to raise revenue relative to the current baseline, encourage the repatriation of funds and reduce the competitive disadvantage faced by U.S. multinationals operating abroad. It is about as close to a free lunch as tax reformers will ever get."

They are proposing a blatant violation of the 14th Amendment, which states that “the validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law” is sacrosanct and “shall not be questioned.”

Yet the Obama administration has repeatedly suppressed any talk of invoking the Constitution in this emergency. Last Thursday Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said, “We do not believe that the 14th Amendment provides that authority to the president” to end the crisis. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew reiterated the point on Sunday and added that the president would have “no option” to prevent a default on his own.

In defense of the administration’s position, the legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, who taught President Obama at Harvard Law School, has insisted, as he put it two years ago, that “only political courage and compromise” can avert disaster.

These assertions, however, have no basis in the history of the 14th Amendment; indeed, they distort that history, and in doing so shackle the president. In fact, that record clearly shows that Congress intended the amendment to prevent precisely the abuses that the current House Republicans blithely condone."

And the business community will again go into hyper-drive against any such move. The question remains, though, whether conservatives will pressure the House GOP leadership to provoke another standoff around the debt ceiling and to demand more spending cuts — such as to entitlements, which are mostly exempt from the sequester — in exchange for any hike. And here, you have to hope that John Boehner will be able to tamp down any desire for further confrontation by pointing out that Republicans are already getting deep spending cuts with the sequester.

By Thomas Ferraro

WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is getting an earful about the big spending cuts beginning to hit government services from worried and irate constituents, including one senator's own spouse.

Democratic Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware said his wife, ""my most important constituent,"" asked him, ""Why can't you guys get your act together? Do you know what people think of you guys?""

""I told her that Washington needs to work more like Delaware,"" said Carper, a former governor of the state. ""In Delaware, Democrats and Republicans work together.""

They have not worked together in Washington. And so the across-the-board cuts of the so-called ""sequester"" - which both Republicans and Democrats have said they oppose - took effect Friday night after President Barack Obama and Republican leaders failed to agree on a way to replace them with targeted spending reductions.

Up until the final few days before Friday, when the reductions began because of a law enacted in 2011, constituents urged, some begged, lawmakers to avert them.

The cuts threaten the U.S. economic recovery, could disrupt federal services from airports to national parks, and may force furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and employees of federal contractors, the administration says.

""They want to kill us all,"" Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said of his constituents.

Laura Zayner, a senior officer with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, was among 400 federal workers facing possible furloughs who came to Washington last week to lobby Congress.

""We consider the furlough a slap in the face. We take it personally,"" Zayner said. ""We are not picking sides, Democrats or Republicans. But we want them to do their jobs and stop the cuts.""

John Kelshaw, who works with the Internal Revenue Service, came to town from New Jersey. He and a few other federal workers met with Republican Representative John Runyan.

""We told him that a lot of our people live paycheck to paycheck. We said, 'Give us a break,'"" Kelshaw said. He said Runyan, of New Jersey, listened but made no commitments.

WHO'S TO BLAME?

Polls so far show most Americans blame Republicans rather than Obama and his Democrats for the standoff. But that could change.

Republicans insist that any deficit-reduction replacement deal include only spending cuts. Democrats want a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.

According to a February 28 Gallup survey, 56 percent of those polled thought the cuts will damage the economy. The feeling crossed party lines, Gallup reported, with 64 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of Democrats agreeing they would inflict economic pain.

Democratic Senator Mark Pryor said his constituents in Arkansas routinely ask him, ""'Why can't you guys work it out?'""

Pryor said he tells them, ""Nobody has clean hands on this.""

Both sides seem to size up any issue on a basis of who gets the political advantage, he said. ""If someone suddenly came up with a cure to cancer, the question in Washington would be, 'Is this good or bad for Obama?'""

The president on Friday said of the cuts, ""This is not a win for anybody. This is a loss for the American people.""

Hatch, of Utah, said he recently told his state legislature that he expected the federal government to impose the sweeping cuts. ""A number of them stood up and said maybe that's the only way we are going get any real reduction in spending,"" he said.

On the other side, Representative Luis Gutierrez, a Chicago Democrat who won an 11th term last year with more than 80 percent of the vote, said his constituents ""tell me 'Keep on fighting, Luis, keep on fighting.'""

Representative Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican whose district includes the shipbuilding yards in Newport News that are likely to be hit hard by cuts in military spending, was dismayed by the untargeted reductions.

Rigell got a letter from a constituent last month that read in part, ""My husband, a project manager for the defense industry, went to work this morning to lay off half of his workforce because of sequestration.""

In an interview, Rigell said, ""When I think they (shipyard workers) could lose their jobs because of the dysfunction in Washington ... this is not acceptable to me.""

""I've been at that shipyard. Some of hardest working folks I know. They're coming in at 5:30 a.m. with a lunch bucket and making $35,000 a year and wondering if they'll have a job."""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/01/California-Tax-Hike-Sparks-Millionaire-Migration,2013-02-01 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],California Tax Hike Sparks Millionaire Migration,"In a desperate attempt to get California’s budgetary nightmares under control, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown pushed for a tax hike plan last November to increase the state’s overall tax rate on millionaires to the highest in the nation at 13.3%. But now, experts say Brown’s actions may be sparking a tax migration for the high income earners whom the state relies on to pay its bills.

“You’d be a fool not to leave California,” says Ed Botowsky of Chapwood Investments who manages the finances of several professional athletes and high income Californians. Botowsky says some of his clients have already made the decision to flee the state to avoid the tax crunch.

Seven states including Florida, Texas, and Nevada do not have a state income tax. That can mean big savings for millionaires willing to make the move. Tiger Woods’s move from California to Florida will save him an estimated $7.5 million in taxes this year alone. His golf rival, Phil Mickelson, who recently expressed concern over California’s tax squeeze, could save $8 million this year by following Tiger’s lead.

An estimated 62.7% of California’s general revenue fund comes from personal income taxes. With roughly 41% of the state’s entire revenue coming from the top 1% of California income earners, the state is especially vulnerable to even modest fluctuations in the migration of its millionaires.

“The higher reliance on personal income tax is a double-edged sword,” said Fitch Ratings Senior Director Douglas Offerman.

Michael Genest, who formerly ran California’s state finance department, says he worries what will happen if the millionaire migration dries up the revenues Gov. Jerry Brown is banking on.

“What happens if revenues fall through the floor? He’s going to be right back where we were in 2008,” Genest said.

The recent 5% federal tax increase on high earners, coupled with California’s 13.3% state income tax, may prove more than millionaires are willing to take, especially since they have options and can move easily.

“They’re going to have an exodus of people,” said John Karaffa, president of ProSport CPA, a Virginia-based firm that represents nearly 300 professional athletes, primarily in basketball and football. “I think they’ll see some [leave California] for sure. They were already a very high tax state and it’s getting to a point where folks have to make a business decision as well as a lifestyle decision.”"

The spot by House Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC, features a close-up of a baby crying, with a narrator saying, ""Speaker John Boehner didn't get his way on shutting down health care reform. So, he's shut down the government and hurt the economy.""

The ad will be airing in Boehner's district, which includes rural and suburban areas around Cincinnati.

""Speaker Boehner didn’t get his way and so, like a child, he threw a Tea Party-inspired temper tantrum and shut down the federal government,” said Andy Stone, communications director of House Majority PAC. ""The American people are sick and tired of the intransigence and manufactured crises that have become all too common from Speaker Boehner and the House Republicans. Speaker Boehner should stop playing politics, end the nonsense and finally focus on the real-life consequences his government shutdown has caused Americans.""

The group has launched a six-figure ad campaign in the districts of the nine Republican members it's targeting in the 2014 elections: Gary Miller (Calif.), Mike Coffman (Colo.), Rodney Davis (Ill.), Mike Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Michael Grimm (N.Y.), Joe Heck (Nev.), Dave Joyce (Ohio), John Kline (Minn.) and Steve Southerland (Fla.).

Meanwhile, the Revive America PAC, a conservative group, has been running an ad on cable news attempting to spark a grassroots campaign to ""fire"" Boehner. But more established conservative groups, such as the Senate Conservatives Fund, Club for Growth and Heritage Action Fund, are standing by Boehner and his strategy."

As Washington continues to wrangle over the cuts, Wyrick is one of 414 workers in Texarkana, Texas, who are preparing to join the unemployment rolls.

The Red River Army Depot, where Wyrick and his fellow workers refurbish military vehicles, stands to lose $600 million from its budget starting this Friday.

A Humvee mechanic, 38-year-old Wyrick has worked at the depot for five years and makes about $47,000 a year. He worries about what it will mean for his family of three.

""I don't know how we're going to make it,"" said Wyrick, whose last day at work is March 9.

The depot is cutting 10% of its workforce of 4,000. The layoffs started on Feb 23. The rest of the employees will face furloughs, according to Cebron O'Bier, president of the union at the depot.

""Right now, the morale is way down. People are going into a panic, they don't know what they're going to do,"" Wyrick said.

He is on the front line of the forced spending cuts that will slash budgets of federal agencies. Most of the 2.1 million federal workers face furloughs.

CNN.com: Spending cut countdown

Roughly half of the cuts will come at the Pentagon -- most of its 800,000 civilian workers would start furloughs in late April.

Employees like Wyrick are among some 46,000 temporary or contract workers losing jobs nationwide, the Pentagon has said. And, like Wyrick, many of them work full-time with benefits, even though they're employed for a specific period of time and purpose. Since their jobs depend upon contracts being renewed, they're particularly vulnerable to budget cuts.

Pentagon spokeswoman Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins said agency officials regret the layoffs and are ""deeply concerned about the effects of these actions on our military readiness, as well as the immediate effects on our civilian colleagues and their families.""

The Red River Army Depot workers are puzzled over the cutbacks, because they say they save money for the Pentagon. By refurbishing older, war-torn vehicles they lead to fewer purchases of new cars and trucks for the Army.

""We overhaul various military vehicles, take them down to the smallest possible piece of material, refurbish them, and put them back together as good as a brand new vehicle,"" union president O'Bier said.

The depot is also a major economic force for the West Arkansas and East Texas area, where it is located. Employment gains at the depot helped the area rebound faster than other metropolitan areas in the region, said Kathy Deck, an economist and director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at University of Arkansas.

The unemployment rate in Texarkana was 5.7% in December, compared with the 7.8% unemployment rate nationwide, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics. Cuts at the Red River Army Depot will resonate throughout area restaurants, shops and other businesses, Deck said.

The loss will upend Wyrick's life. He's unsure if unemployment benefits will be enough to cover his home mortgage and insurance payments, not to mention basics like food and gas.

Wyrick found out that a local tire manufacturer he was hoping to ask for a job isn't hiring either. The company is cutting back because it's losing orders from the depot.

Now, Wyrick says he's looking into federal contractors who hire mechanics to work overseas.

""I grew up here and and have lived here my whole life, so a move overseas would be pretty drastic, you know, pretty drastic,"" Wyrick said."

Boehner, the man who spent significant portions of the last Congress shuttling to and from the White House for fiscal talks with President Obama that ultimately failed twice to produce a grand bargain, has come around to the idea that the best negotiations are no negotiations.

As the president and Congressional Democrats have tried to force Mr. Boehner back to the table for talks to head off the automatic budget cuts set to take effect on Friday, Mr. Boehner has instead dug in deeper, refusing to even discuss an increase in revenue and insisting in his typical colorful language that it was time for the Senate to produce a measure aimed at the cuts.

“The revenue issue is now closed,” Mr. Boehner said Thursday, before the House left town for the weekend without acting on the cuts and a Senate attempt to avert them died. Mr. Boehner said the dispute with Democrats amounted to a question of “how much more money do we want to steal from the American people to fund more government.”

“I’m for no more,” he said.

While the frustrations of Congressional Democrats and Mr. Obama with Mr. Boehner are reaching a fever pitch, House Republicans could not be more pleased with their leader."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/06/retirement/best-states/,2013-05-06 00:00:00,['Melanie Hicken'],The best states for retirement aren't what you think,"Despite its overwhelming popularity with retirees, Florida may not be the best place to spend your golden years, according to a report released by Bankrate Monday.

Instead, Tennessee and Louisiana topped Bankrate's list of the 10 most retiree-friendly states, which equally weighted cost of living, taxes, access to healthcare, crime rates and climate.

Some chillier spots, including Nebraska and North and South Dakota also made the list. They may not be dream retirement destinations, but these states are actually ideal for retirees because of their lower taxes and cost of living and lack of crime, according to Bankrate, a financial information website.

""If you can bear [South Dakota's] temperatures, it's a pretty good place to live on a fixed income,"" said Chris Kahn, an analyst at Bankrate.

Florida, meanwhile, is notably absent from the top 10. While it boasts warm weather and reasonable state and local tax rates, a relatively high cost of living and crime rate sunk the ""Sunshine State"" to nineteenth place, Kahn said.

Related: 25 best places to retire

These 10 states, however, offer a better balance between affordability and quality of life in retirement, according to Bankrate.

1. Tennessee: Not only does it have a Florida-like climate, but Tennessee also boasts the second lowest cost of living in the country. Combined with a low tax burden and great access to medical care, Tennessee is ideal for retirees living on fixed incomes, Kahn said. The only downside: the state has one of the country's highest crime rates.

One of the state's oldest towns, Sevierville, Tenn., provides close access to a national park where retirees can picnic, hike and fish, and it's an easy drive to Knoxville.

2. Louisiana: Another balmy locale, the state has an average temperature of 66.7 degrees -- behind only Hawaii and Florida for warmest average climate. Louisiana residents also enjoy low taxes, above-average access to medical care and a relatively cheap cost of living. Like Tennessee, though, it suffers from a crime rate that is among the nation's highest.

3. South Dakota: It may not be a retirement hot spot, but Bankrate says it should be. The state has the country's lowest crime rate, and an estimated state and local tax burden of just 7.6% -- lower than every state but Alaska. The downside: with an average temperature of 46 degrees over the past 30 years, it's pretty darn cold there.

For small town lovers, Aberdeen, S.D. holds a renowned film festival and has a historic downtown that plays host to farmers markets, haunted walking tours and holiday parades.

4. Kentucky: The Bluegrass State is one of many Appalachian states to dominate Bankrate's top 10. While it may not have Florida's sunny beaches, it does boast an extremely low cost of living, warmer-than-average temperatures and a below-average crime rate.

In Louisville, retirees can stay active by walking or biking on the Louisville Loop, a pedestrian path set to eventually cover more than 100 miles. The smaller town of Danville, Ky. meanwhile, is ideal for horse lovers.

5. Mississippi: Beyond its warm weather, Mississippi also provides cheap living costs and a lower tax burden. But retirees may want to choose where they live carefully: the state has a high crime rate and subpar access to medical care. It has only 178 doctors per every 100,000 residents -- almost 100 less than the national average.

6. Virginia: This coastal state came in above average for most factors that Bankrate analyzed, including climate, access to healthcare and cost of living. Its crime rate is one of the lowest in the country, with only 2,446 property and violent crimes per 100,000 people.

An affordable college town, Lynchburg, Va. offers the beauty of the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, as well as historic Civil War sites.

7. West Virginia: Another Appalachian state, West Virginia is boosted onto the list by low crime, a cheaper cost of living and above-average access to medical care. Still, it has a colder climate than some of the other states.

Quiz: Where's your dream retirement?

8. Alabama: Warm temperatures, low state and local taxes and a relatively low cost of living all pushed Alabama into the top 10. Yet it suffers from below-average access to medical care and a relatively high crime rate, with 4,026 crimes per 100,000 people -- almost double that of Virginia.

Home to a campus of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, Ala. offers botanical gardens and nature preserves and 19th century architecture. Near the Georgia border, Fort Payne, Ala. is a quintessential small town with activities that include an annual fiddling convention and a stop at the ""world's largest yard sale.""

9. Nebraska: Beyond its cornfields, Nebraska offers excellent access to hospital care, a below-average crime rate and living costs among the country's cheapest. But with a lower than average temperature, it's another state for retirees who don't mind the cold.

10. North Dakota: Like neighboring South Dakota, this state is not for retirees looking for warm weather. But it does have the second lowest crime rate in the nation, a mild estimated tax burden of 8.9% and 5 hospital beds available for every 1,000 residents.

Money 101: Planning for retirement

To compile the list, Bankrate analysts ranked climate using average temperatures over 30 years (1981-2010) and valued cost of living with statistics from the Council for Community and Economic Research. Taxes were ranked using the Tax Foundation's analysis of state and local tax burdens. Access to healthcare was based on hospital beds per 1,000 residents and doctors per 100,000 residents from the Kaiser Family Foundation and U.S. Census Bureau, while crime rates were ranked using violent and property crimes per 100,000 people from the 2011 FBI Uniform Crime Report."
http://ph.news.yahoo.com/us-shutdown-likely-house-republicans-amend-budget-bill-212424371.html,,[],US on brink of government shutdown,"The United States stumbled to within hours of a government shutdown, as a budget duel between President Barack Obama and Republicans threatened America with a self-inflicted economic wound. As a mood of crisis enveloped Washington, three hours before a midnight deadline (0400 GMT), there were no signs of compromise to head off the first such disaster in 17 years. Instead, the Democratic-led Senate and Republican House of Representatives played a futile game, sending funding bills between them that were doomed to fail. The US Senate late Monday swiftly killed the latest House measure to delay Obama's health care law. Obama accused Republicans of holding America to ransom with their ""extreme"" political demands, while his opponents struck back at his party's supposed arrogance. Around 800,000 government workers faced being sent home, government services were to be slashed and monuments such as the Statue of Liberty and national parks were to be closed. The crisis is rooted in an attempt by ""Tea Party"" Republicans in the House of Representative to make passage of a new government budget conditional on thwarting Obama's signature health reform law. The Democratic-led Senate and the president have repeatedly rejected this strategy and are urging Republicans to pass an extension to government funding to temporarily stave off the shutdown. In a deeper sense, the shutdown is the most serious crisis yet in a series of rolling ideological skirmishes between Democrat Obama and House Republicans over the size of the US government and its role in national life. ""One faction of one party in one house of Congress in one branch of government doesn't get to shut down the entire government just to re-fight the results of an election,"" Obama said, referring to his own re-election. ""Time is running out. My hope and expectation is that in the eleventh hour once again, that Congress will choose to do the right thing and that the House of Representatives in particular will choose the right thing. ""You don't get to extract a ransom for doing your job, for doing what you're supposed to be doing anyway,"" he said, in a stern televised statement at the White House. But on a day of accelerating brinkmanship, Republicans doubled down on their bid to gut Obamacare, as the health care law, the most sweeping social legislation in decades, is known. With just three hours to go, House lawmakers passed a bill that would delay the individual mandate, which forces all Americans to buy health insurance under the new law, for a year. ""It's a matter of fairness for all Americans,"" said Republican House speaker John Boehner, who has struggled to control the riotous anti-government Tea Party faction of his caucus. But the Senate, which must also sign off on budget measures, immediately rejected the bill. That left House leaders with perhaps a final decision on whether to pass the ""clean"" budget resolution stripped of all political riders that Democrats are demanding, before the government closes down. Democratic congressman Alan Grayson accused Republicans of ""playing charades"" and trying to deprive 40 million uninsured Americans of health care. But one Republican, congressman Lou Barletta believed that a last minute compromise could emerge. ""At the end of the day we'll vote for a clean (budget) ... to keep the government running."" Obama warned that a government shutdown could badly damage an economy which has endured a sluggish recovery from the worst recession in decades. ""A shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people, right away. Past shutdowns have disrupted the economy significantly,"" Obama said. Consultants Macroeconomic Advisors said the shutdown would slow growth, recorded at a 2.5 percent annual pace in the second quarter. A two-week shutdown would cut 0.3 percentage point off of gross domestic production. A shutdown would also have a painful personal impact on workers affected -- leaving them to dip into savings or delay mortgage payments, monthly car loan bills and other spending. Stocks on Monday retreated as traders braced for the shutdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 128.57 points (0.84 percent) to 15,129.67. Markets are likely to be even more traumatized if there is no quick solution to the next fast approaching crisis. Republicans are also demanding Obama make concessions in the health care law to secure a lifting of the current $16.7 trillion debt ceiling, without which the United States would begin to default on its debts for the first time in history by the middle of October. ""Congress needs to keep our government open, needs to pay our bills on time, and never, ever threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America,"" Obama said. But Boehner hit back, saying the health law, large tranches of which come into force on Tuesday, was ""not ready for prime time."" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer meanwhile likened Boehner to a priest in a Mayan ceremony, making ""a sacrificial offering to the right-wing gods."" The dispute is threatening Obama's plans to head to Asia for a week-long trip on Saturday to pursue his rebalancing of foreign policy towards the dynamic region. Polls show more Americans would blame Republicans for the shutdown than Democrats, leaving Boehner torn between his party's wider political interests and a vocal section of his own party."

http://news.yahoo.com/congress-letting-55-tax-breaks-expire-end-171342891--finance.html,,[],Congress letting 55 tax breaks expire at year end,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In an almost annual ritual, Congress is letting a package of 55 popular tax breaks expire at the end of the year, creating uncertainty — once again — for millions of individuals and businesses.

Lawmakers let these tax breaks lapse almost every year, even though they save businesses and individuals billions of dollars. And almost every year, Congress eventually renews them, retroactively, so taxpayers can claim them by the time they file their tax returns.

No harm, no foul, right? After all, taxpayers filing returns in the spring won't be hurt because the tax breaks were in effect for 2013. Taxpayers won't be hit until 2015, when they file tax returns for next year.

Not so far. Trade groups and tax experts complain that Congress is making it impossible for businesses and individuals to plan for the future. What if lawmakers don't renew the tax break you depend on? Or what if they change it and you're no longer eligible?

""It's a totally ridiculous way to run our tax system,"" said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel for the National Retail Federation. ""It's impossible to plan when every year this happens, but yet business has gotten used to that.""

Some of the tax breaks are big, including billions in credits for companies that invest in research and development, generous exemptions for financial institutions doing business overseas, and several breaks that let businesses write off capital investments faster.

Others are more obscure, the benefits targeted to film producers, race track owners, makers of electric motorcycles and teachers who buy classroom supplies with their own money.

There are tax rebates to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from a tax on rum imported into the United States, and a credit for expenses related to railroad track maintenance.

A deduction for state and local sales taxes benefits people who live in the nine states without state income taxes. Smaller tax breaks benefit college students and commuters who use public transportation.

Story continues

A series of tax breaks promote renewable energy, including a credit for power companies that produce electricity with windmills.

The annual practice of letting these tax breaks expire is a symptom a divided, dysfunctional Congress that struggles to pass routine legislation, said Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.

""It's not fair, it's very hard, it's very difficult for a business person, a company, to plan, not just for the short term but to do long-term planning,"" Lewis said. ""It's shameful.""

With Congress on vacation until January, there is no chance the tax breaks will be renewed before they expire. And there is plenty of precedent for Congress to let them expire for months without addressing them. Most recently, they expired at the end of 2011, and Congress didn't renew them for the entire year, waiting until New Year's Day 2013 — just in time for taxpayers to claim them on their 2012 returns.

But Congress only renewed the package though the end of 2013.

Why such a short extension? Washington accounting is partly to blame. The two-year extension Congress passed in January cost $76 billion in reduced revenue for the government, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Making those tax breaks permanent could add $400 billion or more to the deficit over the next decade.

With budget deficits already high, many in Congress are reluctant to vote for a bill that would add so much red ink. So, they do it slowly, one or two years at time.

""More cynically, some people say, if you just put it in for a year or two, then that keeps the lobbyists having to come back and wine-and-dine the congressmen to get it extended again, and maybe make some campaign contributions,"" said Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst for CCH, a consulting firm based in Riverwoods, Ill.

This year, the package of tax breaks has been caught up in a debate about overhauling the entire tax code. The two top tax writers in Congress — House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont. — have been pushing to simplify the tax code by reducing tax breaks and using the additional revenue to lower overall tax rates.

But their efforts have yet to bear fruit, leaving both tax reform and the package of temporary breaks in limbo. When asked how businesses should prepare, given the uncertainty, Camp said, ""They need to get on board with tax reform, that's what they need to do.""

Further complicating the issue, President Barack Obama has nominated Baucus to become U.S. ambassador to China, meaning he will soon leave the Senate, if he is confirmed by his colleagues.

As the Senate wound down its 2013 session, Democratic leaders made a late push to extend many of the tax breaks by asking Republican colleagues to pass a package on the floor of the Senate without debate or amendments. Republicans objected, saying it wasn't a serious offer, and the effort failed.

So should taxpayers count on these breaks as they plan their budgets for 2014?

""The best thing I would say is, budget accordingly,"" said Jackie Perlman, principle tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. ""As the saying goes, hope for the best but plan for the worst. Then if you get it, great, that's a nice perk. But don't count on it.""

USA TODAY





A deadly shooting near the U.S. Capitol on Thursday jolted lawmakers in Congress and temporarily diverted their attention away from the federal government shutdown. What you need to know as the shutdown enters Day 4 on Friday, Oct. 4.

Both sides grope for solutions to budget, debt ceiling

The fight between President Obama, Democrats and Republicans is now a two-pronged fiscal confrontation to avoid a potential default after Oct. 17 on the nation's $16.7 trillion debt. What began for congressional Republicans as an effort to gut the health care law is now bigger. House Republicans are pursuing a broader strategy that would go beyond reopening the government and putting 800,000 furloughed workers back on the job. They'd also like to remove the prospect of default and achieve even bigger changes to reduce the debt.

Battered Dow Jones average tumbles below 15,000

It's a sign that investors are getting increasingly worried about the budget impasse in Washington. Stocks tumbled Thursday sending the Dow Jones Industrial average back below 15,000. Wall Street fears that lawmakers are so far apart that they won't agree to raise the nation's borrowing limit later this month, which would raise the risk of the nation defaulting on its debts for the first time in history. Stocks have now fallen eight of the last 10 days, as investors anticipated a budget deal would not be reached by Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year.

Sex assault investigations halted on college campuses

The shutdown's impact has reached college campuses. Investigations of universities suspected of mishandling sexual violence cases are being put on hold by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, according to a Huffington Post report. These include ongoing cases at the University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. The office won't be conducting a follow-up visit at Yale, which agreed in 2012 to change the way it handles sexual misconduct cases.

Rebels refuse to heed federal shutdown call

The World War II veterans who are ignoring barricades around shuttered monuments aren't the only rebels in the government shutdown. District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray, with his City Council's blessing, declared each of the city's 32,000 employees essential so they could continue to pick up trash and perform other services. The nation's capital city is affected because Congress has the last word on how the District spends its money. In Wisconsin, where some state parks are partially funded by the National Park Service, the state's Department of Natural Resources rejected a federal demand that those parks be closed.

Shutdown provides a civics lesson for students

The government shutdown has become a teachable moment for youngsters, from moms who teach their kids that actions have consequences to civics classes that drive home a point about democracy at work. At Niles North High School in Skokie, Ill., some students there blamed Republicans who are allies of the Tea Party for the shutdown. Others placed blame on President Obama and both houses of Congress. Karen Carey in Lyndonville, Vt., wishes Congress understood the lesson that she's teaching her children. ""I want them to understand that if you take the last juice box, and there is a kid behind you allergic to milk, there is a consequence to what you did,"" she said.

Bonus: President Obama canceled the rest of his Asia trip because of the shutdown, the White House announced late Thursday. He was scheduled to go to Indonesia for the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference (APEC) and then to Brunei for the East Asia summit. Earlier in the week, Obama canceled visits to Malaysia and the Philippines that were to take place after the two meetings.

When exactly? Much has been made of Oct. 17 as the drop-dead date. But that's not quite right.

And here's why.

The country reached the debt ceiling in May. Since then the Treasury Department has been using special accounting measures to keep borrowing just under the limit.

But Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said those will run out no later than Oct. 17.

That means the ""extraordinary measures"" could dry up on Oct. 12 or Oct. 15, or some other date. Just no later than Oct. 17.

When they do, Treasury won't be able to borrow and will have only two sources of money to pay bills: The estimated $30 billion cash that Lew expects to have on hand, plus whatever daily revenue that comes in.

The big question: When will that money fall below what Treasury needs to pay on any given day?

The Congressional Budget Office estimates between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31.

Because money owed and revenue coming in varies from day to day, it's hard to pinpoint the precise day when the country could default on some legal obligations -- which include interest on the debt, Social Security payments, and payments to federal contractors.

Related: Debt ceiling: 8 things you need to know but wish you didn't

What economists and budget experts are very clear about, however, is that the closer we get to mid-October the more markets are likely to buck. And refusing to raise the debt ceiling for too long could cripple the economy and investments.

Here's why.

Cash crunch could leave millions high 'n dry: If Treasury doesn't have enough cash on hand to pay what's owed, it will have to make decisions that are legally and ethically questionable, to say nothing of practically difficult.

Some Republicans say that Treasury should prioritize who gets paid first.

Treasury says that would not only be near impossible because of how its payment systems work, it would be wrong. ""Any plan to prioritize some payments over others is simply default by another name,"" Lew wrote in a letter to lawmakers.

Most experts assume that Treasury would do all it could to pay interest owed to bondholders first since failure to do so could unhinge world markets.

But beyond that, who deserves to be next on the list? Seniors, disabled veterans, federal contractors, active-duty military personnel? The federal government has incurred legal obligations to all of them. They and the U.S. economy depend on their being paid on schedule.

Treasury would have two main options, both awful: It could pay some bills in full and delay others; or it could delay all payments due on a given day until it has enough money on hand to pay them all.

Senior Treasury officials indicated in an inspector general's report that the second option would be the most likely and least harmful of the two. But it's hardly painless.

Backlog of payments would grow: Depending on how long the debt ceiling standoff lasts, delays could quickly grow from a day or two to several weeks.

That would starve the economy and create doubt in the minds of investors and ordinary Americans that the United States is good for the money.

""If the confidence in the reliability of payments were cast into doubt, the consequences for the budget, the U.S. economy, the U.S. and global financial systems could be large and lasting and very damaging,"" Douglas Elmendorf, the current CBO director, told Congress recently.

U.S. standing in the world would be hurt. It will be very hard to justify to anyone why the world's largest economy and richest country is willfully choosing not to pay what it owes.

Markets and the economy would tumble: Economist Mark Zandi worries that the stock market could start falling by hundreds of points a day as the calendar moves closer to Oct. 17 if Congress shows no signs it will raise the debt ceiling. And it really won't help confidence if the government shutdown is still going on.

Should it get to the point that Treasury can't pay all bills in full and on time? ""We're going back into recession. It's an economic Pandora's box,"" Zandi told CNN."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/06/news/economy/november-jobs-report/,2013-12-06 00:00:00,['Annalyn Kurtz'],November jobs report: Unemployment falls to 7%,"Has the job market finally hit its stride? Hiring continued at a solid pace in November, and the unemployment rate fell to a five-year low ... for the right reasons.

The U.S. economy added 203,000 jobs in November. Economists surveyed by CNNMoney had predicted payroll gains of 183,000 jobs.

The unemployment rate fell to 7.0% -- the lowest level since November 2008, as more people said they got jobs and joined the labor force.

This is encouraging news for the 11 million Americans who remain unemployed. The job market has been improving for three years now, but at a frustratingly slow pace.

Related: White House wants to extend unemployment benefits

The hiring was broad based, with big gains for sectors that tend to pay low wages as well as those that offer higher salaries. While retailers, restaurants and bars all hired more workers, traditionally higher wage sectors boasted even stronger job growth.

For example, professional and business services added 35,000 jobs.

""This was a strong, good quality report, showing continuing momentum,"" said Deloitte's Chief Financial Officer Frank Friedman. Deloitte alone is planning to hire about 18,000 people this year in its tax auditing and consulting businesses.

""We're optimistic about 2014, and we continue to hire at a pretty robust pace.""

The transportation and warehousing sector added 30,500 jobs, and health care added 28,000 jobs.

Meanwhile, manufacturers hired 27,000 workers and construction companies hired 17,000.

""This year started off lopsided -- low quality jobs were growing, but only in the last few months, the high quality jobs are coming back too,"" said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.

The federal government continued to cut jobs, but state and local governments more than made up for those losses, hiring 14,000 workers.

Infographic: Economy still split between the 'haves' and 'have-nots'

2013 is on track to be the best year for job creation since 2005, but the job market still has a long way to go until it's entirely healed from the recession.

Only about 63% of Americans over the age of 16 participate in the job market -- meaning they either have a job or are looking for one. That's nearly the lowest level since 1978, driven partly by Baby Boomers retiring, but also by workers who had simply given up hope after long and fruitless job searches.

When Wal-Mart (WMT)recently opened two stores in Washington, D.C., more than 23,000 people submitted applications for the 600 job openings.

That means each applicant stood a mere 2.6% chance of being hired. Harvard has a higher acceptance rate.

""It's not uncommon for us to get this number of applications in urban areas when there is such a need for jobs,"" Wal-Mart spokesman David Tovar said.

But perhaps 2014 will be the year the job market finally breaks out of its funk. The consistently stronger hiring growth could help convince some of the job market dropouts to look for work once again, economists say.

""The economy is poised for takeoff but suffers from headwinds,"" Dhawan said. ""If we can survive January and there's no shutdown, we can take off.""

The United States lost 8.7 million jobs in the aftermath of the financial crisis. As of November, it had gained about 7.4 million of those jobs back."

Washington (CNN) - Amid new Republican offers to reopen the government and raise the debt limit in exchange for discussing cutting entitlements like Medicare and Social Security, President Barack Obama thanked the House Democratic caucus in a meeting at the White House, praising his legislative backers for holding firm against GOP demands to piecemeal funding for the government.

Obama signals more ‘give’ on idea of short-term debt deal

In a statement characterizing the meeting, the White House said Obama and House Democrats ""reaffirmed their shared belief that we cannot let one faction of the Republicans in the House demand a ransom for doing its job and paying the bills we have already incurred.""

The White House read out of the meeting portrayed a president solely focused on ""fighting for working families"" and gave no indication that Obama intends to cave to Republican demands, which have now evolved from ""defunding"" the president's signature health care law to slashing, in their minds, the true drivers of America's swelling debt.

Up to speed

Obamacare out, entitlements in: Republicans seem to be shifting the shutdown/debt ceiling battle line from an argument over Obamacare to one over entitlements.

After spending the first week of the shutdown trying to tie anything that would fund the government and end the impasse to President Barack Obama's signature health care law, the word ""Obamacare"" hasn't come up as much in recent days.



GOP dropping Obamacare in shutdown debate?

Republicans are saying they would be willing to talk about raising the nation’s borrowing authority so long as it includes a discussion on cutting entitlements, which they say are at the core of the country's debt problem.

At a news conference on Monday, Obama indicated Republicans could essentially set the agenda for budget negotiations, but only if Congress agrees first to a short-term spending plan to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling.

Four ways for Obama to lead U.S. out of crisis

Meanwhile, both the Senate and the House are moving forward without regard to the other. The House will vote to create a negotiating committee and on a bill to ensure “essential” federal workers don’t miss a paycheck. The Senate is expected to reject that and will instead debate a proposal to raise the debt ceiling, which is expected to go nowhere in the House.

Meet the new face of the House gym

In an interview on the Bill Press Show (and gleefully pointed out by a conservative group), Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, defends keeping the House gym open because it is where members can actually speak to each other. The House gym, he argues, could solve this crisis.

(He might have a point here. Remember what Eric Massa said Rahm Emanuel did in the House gym showers?) (refresher)

But things are getting pretty rough. Braley, who's running for the Senate in 2014, complains there’s no towel service (which we pointed out on Tuesday), but then he says, “We’re doin’ our own laundry down there.”

Finally, he says members pay $260 per year to belong to the gym. Quick back of-the-envelope math suggests members of Congress pay something less than $22 per month to belong to the gym that usually includes towel service and has a heated pool and whatnot.

Find a YMCA or church gym that’s that cheap.

Paul Ryan emerges

Remember Rep. Paul Ryan? The Republican budget guru who was on the losing ticket in the 2012 election? Right, him. Well, he’s still a member of Congress and still sits at the top of the Budget Committee. The budget wonk at the center of budget and spending battles in previous years broke his months-long silence Wednesday morning. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, he took a measured tone, saying “both sides should agree to common-sense reforms of the country’s entitlement programs.”

Missing from his piece? The word ""Obamacare.""

Any Cruz is good news for Democrats

That’s a different tact than what many of his tea party-aligned colleagues want, which is the dismantling of the health care law. And Sen. Ted Cruz’s speechwriter noticed the omission.

There is one big word missing from this op-ed. It's start with an O and ends with BAMACARE http://t.co/r1cYgjWEL5 — Amanda Carpenter (@amandacarpenter) October 9, 2013

Biden sidelined

Remember Vice President Joe Biden? The 2012 Democratic vice presidential candidate who sat on the winning ticket? The guy who negotiated the last fiscal stalemates? Well, he’s still the vice president. But his silence is deafening.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is making sure Biden remains silent, CNN’s Gloria Borger reported. He’s made that point very clear, both inside and outside of the White House. As one administration official put it, “Reid is convinced he needs to stand his ground.”

Time of Need

On Tuesday, we reported that the $100,000 government benefit to assist each family with burial and reclaiming the body is going unpaid because of the shutdown. Obama promised prompt action to pay benefits to survivors of military men and women killed in action.

On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president was ""disturbed"" to find out that it was not being paid and has directed the Pentagon and other officials to figure out a way to address the problem. Obama expects it ""to be fixed today,"" Carney said.

Recipients in North Carolina who have not yet picked up their food stamps for October are out of luck. The state announced that it doesn’t have the money to provide the 20% of benefactors of the Women, Infants and Children food program who have yet to collect this month’s supplement, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.

Time of do-with-what-you-have

CIA agents responsible for undercover work, counterintelligence and intelligence gathering are being called back to work because of the “threat to the safety of human life.” Director John Brennan wrote in a memo to CIA employees: “This does not mean that we can recall all of our employees. We only have the ability to recall workers involved directly in our core missions.”

A small business that fights wildfires in the western United States has laid off a dozen workers since the shutdown. With 80% of its business coming from government contracts, Mark Masters, owner of Chloeta Fire, said he lost tens of thousands of dollars in the last week.

Pat McCrory delivers the State of the State address at the Legislative Building in Raleigh, N.C., Monday, Feb. 18, 2013. (AP Photo/Ted Richardson)

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Feb 19 (Reuters) - North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory on Tuesday signed into law a measure that will cut benefits for jobless workers by about one-third and reduce how long they can collect any aid in a state with the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country.

The Republican governor said the legislation, the second bill he has signed since taking office at the start of the year, marked an important step toward fixing the state's unemployment insurance system.

The overhaul will allow North Carolina to repay $2.5 billion borrowed from the federal government for unemployment benefits at a quicker pace.

The law, which takes effect on July 1, cuts maximum weekly benefits to $350 from $535 and caps benefits at 12 to 20 weeks, depending on the unemployment rate, instead of the current 26 weeks.

McCrory said the measure ""will protect our small businesses from continued over-taxation, ensure our citizens' unemployment safety net is secure and financially sound for future generations, and help provide an economic climate that allows job creators to start hiring again.""

Critics said the harsh nature of the cuts would harm some of the state's most vulnerable residents. North Carolina has more than 400,000 jobless workers, making its 9.2 percent unemployment rate higher than the national average of 7.9 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""Hundreds of thousands of jobless workers thrown out of work through no fault of their own will face deepening poverty as a result of this decision,"" the North Carolina Justice Center, a social justice advocacy group, said in a statement after the bill signing on Tuesday.

""North Carolina's legislature and governor chose to permanently cut benefits, reduce employers' contributions over time, and reject $700 million in federal extended benefits,"" the center said.

About 170,000 long-term unemployed workers in North Carolina will lose out on extra federal funds under the new law, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

Bergo, director of contracting at Joint Base Andrews, speaks about the importance of using the Federal Acquisition Regulation manual. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)

This past week, the Department of Veterans Affairs bought $562,000 worth of artwork.

In a single day, the Agriculture Department spent $144,000 on toner cartridges.

And, in a single purchase, the Coast Guard spent $178,000 on “Cubicle Furniture Rehab.”

This string of big-ticket purchases was an unmistakable sign: It was “use it or lose it” season again in Washington.

All week, while Congress fought over next year’s budget, federal workers were immersed in a separate frantic drama. They were trying to spend the rest of this year’s budget before it is too late.

The reason for their haste is a system set up by Congress that, in many cases, requires agencies to spend all their allotted funds by Sept. 30.

If they don’t, the money becomes worthless to them on Oct. 1. And — even worse — if they fail to spend the money now, Congress could dock their funding in future years. The incentive, as always, is to spend.

So they spent. It was the return of one of Washington’s oldest bad habits: a blitz of expensive decisions, made by agencies with little incentive to save.

Private contractors — worried that sequestration would result in a smaller spending rush this year — brought in food to keep salespeople at their desks. Federal workers quizzed harried colleagues in the hallways, asking if they had spent it all yet.

“The way we budget [money] sets it up,” said Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.). “Because instead of being praised for not spending all your money, you get cut for not spending all your money. And so we’ve got a perverse incentive in there.” But, Coburn said, “nobody’s talking about it but me and you.”

View Graphic Agencies are rushing to spend their remaining budget before Sept. 30.

Coburn said he had meant to mention it in his floor speech Wednesday. Then, when he got to the podium, he forgot.

“Use it or lose it” season is not marked on any official government calendars. But in Washington, it is as real as Christmas. And as lucrative.

And — it appears — about as permanent.

“We cannot expect our employees to believe that cost reduction efforts are serious if they see evidence of opportunistic spending in the last days of the Fiscal Year,” President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote to underlings in May 1965. Even then, Johnson said an end-of-year binge was “an ancient practice — but that does not justify it or excuse it.”

Today, government spending on contracts still spikes at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

In 2012, for instance, the government spent $45 billion on contracts in the last week of September, according to calculations by the fiscal-conservative group Public Notice. That was more than any other week — 9 percent of the year’s contract spending money, spent in 2 percent of the year.

Much of it is spent smartly, on projects that had already gone through an extensive review.

But not all of it.

In 2010, for instance, the Internal Revenue Service had millions left over in an account to hire new personnel. The money would expire at year’s end. Its solution was not a smart one.

The IRS spent the money on a lavish conference. Which included a “Star Trek” parody video starring IRS managers. Which was filmed on a “Star Trek” set that the IRS paid to build. (Sample dialogue: “We’ve received a distress call from the planet NoTax.”)

“That is a major problem,” acting IRS commissioner Daniel I. Werfel told Congress in June, explaining the role of “use it or lose it” in that debacle.

Other end-of-year mistakes are less spectacular — but they still cause problems. One recent study, for instance, found that information technology contracts signed at year’s end often produced noticeably worse results than those signed in calmer times.

And late-September waste also weighs on its witnesses, federal workers. After President Obama set up an online suggestion box for federal workers, many asked to get rid of the “use it or lose it” system. They suggested “rolling over” money for use in the next year. And they listed dumb things they had seen bought: three years’ worth of staples. Portable generators that never got used. One said the National Guard bought so much ammunition that firing it all became a chore.

“When you get BORED from shooting MACHINE GUNS, there is a problem,” an anonymous employee wrote.

“People want to do the right thing,” said Dean Sinclair, a former State Department employee who is crusading to change the system. “It’s not that the federal workforce is filled with bad people. The system sort of forces them to make bad decisions.”

He suggests giving bonuses to managers who return leftover money to the Treasury at year’s end. “It takes time and effort to waste money,” Sinclair said. “Remember that.”

Obama, like presidents before him, has exhorted agencies to plan better and avoid rushed decisions at year’s end. But the White House says Congress is making that job harder.

Instead of approving full-year spending bills, the gridlocked legislature has been handing out money with “continuing resolutions” that last only a few weeks or months. So nobody’s certain about their funding until later in the year. So the rush gets more rushed.

This year, finally, September came.

For contractors around Washington — battered by sequestration, budget cuts and the end of wars — this was the month they had been waiting for. “The flush,” one analyst called it. A flood of money had been backed up inside agencies hampered by furloughs.

“Twenty-five percent of my business, right, will happen in this month. Twenty-five percent of my year,” said Art Richer, the president of ImmixGroup, a contractor in Tysons Corner that helps software and computing companies seeking government business.

September in Washington used to be a time for selling face to face. Contractors visited the Pentagon. Small-town mayors queued up in the hallways at the Commerce Department, waiting to make a late-night pitch for grants.

But those buildings are off-limits now. So you sell from your desk. You sell with your voice. You sell with empathy, for the poor harried bureaucrat on the other end of the line. “Answer the phone smiling,” Richer tells his people.

Of course, the feds were stressed.

“We see them in the hallway, and you go, ‘How much money are we going to lose?’ ” one Army officer said this past week. That officer was involved in setting budgets for future years, and the meaning was clear: How much money are you not going to spend? Whatever that number was, it would be taken out of budgets for fiscal 2015, too.

This is not normal math. But this was not a normal time in Washington: You didn’t save money to spend it later. You spent now, to spend later. “They know they’re under the gun,” the officer said, who spoke anonymously to talk about internal budgeting discussions.

On Monday, Immix began bringing its sales team three catered meals a day. If workers walked to Subway, they might lose a sale. On that day, Immix handled $16 million in business. A normal Monday is about $2 million.

Across the government, agencies were making big-ticket purchases — buying things with this year’s money that could be used next year.

On Monday, VA paid $27,000 for an order of photographs showing sunsets, mountain peaks and country roads. They would go into a new center serving homeless veterans in Los Angeles; a spokeswoman described the art as “motivational and calming, professionally designed to enhance clinical operations.”

On Tuesday, the USDA bought $127,000 worth of toner cartridges (“end of year,” the order explained). VA spent another $220,000 on artwork for its hospitals.

On Wednesday, the Coast Guard paid $178,000 for cubicle furniture, replacing high-walled cubes with low-walled ones to improve the air flow in a large office area.

“Other higher-priority projects were not able to be executed, so they moved [money] to this lower-priority project” before the year’s end, said Coast Guard spokesman Carlos Diaz. “The money was going to be spent anyway.”

On Thursday, VA was buying art again. It spent $216,000 on artwork for a facility in Florida. In all, preliminary data showed that the agency made at least 18 percent of all its art purchases for the year in this one week. One-sixth of the buying in one-52nd of the year.

On Friday, the end was in sight.

“I feel good. Four days, right?” said Corey Forshee, a contracting officer at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Forshee was part of a team at Andrews that had done its best to beat the September rush.

The commander, trying to avoid a last-week rush, set his own deadline of Sept. 20. The pizza came early. The chaplain’s office visited early (“use it or lose it” season is traditionally stressful enough to get the chaplain involved). The buying was nearly done.

Now, they had to wait for the last act of the last act: the “fall-out money.”

This was cash that other parts of the Air Force had not been able to spend. It would be redistributed to this office at the last minute.

“We’re waiting for money for that,” Forshee said, going down a list of unfunded projects. A roof for the workout area. A bathroom renovation. “Just waiting for money,” he repeated.

Across Washington, everybody had to wait.

“It’s going to come down to Monday,” said Richer, at ImmixGroup. On Friday, he said his sales had been about equal to last year’s, despite worries about sequestration.

On Monday, Richer’s people will sell until midnight. Then they will keep selling. “Money rolls across the continent,” the feds say. Cash not spent in Washington might be spent by federal offices in California in the three hours before it is midnight there.

When it is midnight in California — 3 a.m. in Washington — they will keep on. There are federal offices in Hawaii, after all. And it will still be three hours until midnight there."

Monday morning began with the top spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) accusing House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) of having a “credibility problem” for denying that a “clean” spending bill — one without any proposals to alter the healthcare law — could win a bipartisan majority in the House.

Boehner’s office countered that it was “time for Senate Democrats to stow their faux outrage and deal with the problems at hand.”

The tête-à-tête between leadership aides comes as lawmakers return from their one day off this weekend with only a light schedule. While the Senate holds votes on a pair of lower-court nominations, the House will vote on another in a series of targeted spending bills they’ve offered to resume certain high-profile government functions, this time the Food and Drug Administration.

The House voted unanimously Saturday to provide back pay for hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers. They’ve also voted to resume veterans benefits and a supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children (known as WIC), pay National Guard members and reservists, reopen national parks and museums, and fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Despite the “rifle-shot” approach to extend funding in certain areas, Boehner said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that “there are not the votes in the House to pass a clean CR” — or continuing resolution, a broader government funding bill.

“We’re interested in having a conversation about how we open the government and how we begin to pay our bills. But it begins with a simple conversation,” Boehner said, criticizing what he called President Obama’s “my way or the highway” approach.

“That’s what he’s saying. Complete surrender and then we’ll talk to you,” the speaker said.

Adam Jentleson, the Reid spokesman, pointed to reports indicating as many as two dozen Republicans could join a near-unanimous Democratic minority to pass a clean spending bill.

“There is now a consistent pattern of Speaker Boehner saying things that fly in the face of the facts or stand at odds with his past actions,” Jentleson said. “Today, Speaker Boehner should stop the games and let the House vote on the Senate’s clean CR so that the entire federal government can reopen within 24 hours.”

Michael Steel, Boehner’s spokesman, said the shutdown was caused by Democrats’ refusal to negotiate. “It’s time for some Washington Democrat to step up, act like an adult, and start talking about how we reopen the government, provide fairness for the American people under Obamacare and deal with the drivers of our debt and deficits.”

North Carolina lawmakers are considering a bill that would slash unemployment benefits and cause the state to lose roughly $600 million worth of extended jobless compensation paid entirely by the federal government.

The measure would reduce the maximum weekly benefit from $530 to $350 per person. If it passes, North Carolina workers will no longer receive long-term compensation starting in July, since states cannot remain eligible for federal unemployment insurance if local lawmakers cut weekly benefit amounts. An estimated 80,000 people would miss out on federal extended benefits, according to the North Carolina Justice Center, a worker advocacy nonprofit. At $25 million per week, the total loss over time amounts to more than $600 million.

Policy experts said the move would be unprecedented. ""It is pretty amazing,"" the center's Alexandra Sirota said in an interview. ""As far as we know, no other state has rejected federal dollars to push that level of benefit cuts.""

Sirota stressed that the benefits not only help the workers who receive them, but they also contribute to the state's economy, since recipients spend the money on things like food, rent and groceries.

The Republicans pushing the unemployment cuts, however, say unemployment taxes hurt the state's economy more than anything else. North Carolina businesses are paying higher federal taxes because the state has been slow to repay $2.5 billion it borrowed from Washington to pay benefits in recent years. The legislation will increase state business taxes and reduce state spending on benefits in order to repay the loan more quickly. The sooner the federal government gets its money back, the sooner federal taxes will come down.

“It will cause North Carolina to repay the debt to the federal government back in about six years less time,"" State Rep. Harry Warren (R-Rowan County) told the Salisbury Post.

The bill's supporters, including Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, don't seem to mind that the state would lose federal unemployment insurance as a result of the legislation. The extended federal benefits are set to expire at the end of the year anyway, but the bill would kill them six months early.

""I will not support the extension of unemployment beyond July of this year,"" McCrory said last week, according to WRAL.com. ""I think we need to now draw the line.""

The bill's opponents, however, see it differently. ""Reducing benefits in a way that causes us to disqualify for those federal funds is extraordinarily shortsighted and philosophically driven,"" State Sen. Floyd McKissick (D-Durham) told HuffPost. ""I think it's really horrendous.""

The bill passed the state House of Representatives on Tuesday and a state Senate committee on Wednesday. Republicans rebuffed Democratic efforts to delay the measure's implementation and prevent the loss of federal benefits. McKissick said he expected the bill to land on McCrory's desk soon.

States typically pay 26 weeks of unemployment insurance to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, and during recessions Congress routinely gives workers additional weeks of benefits. The North Carolina proposal, in addition to cutting the amount of state benefits, would also reduce their maximum duration to 20 weeks. The benefits could last for as few as 12 weeks when the state's unemployment rate declines. Florida and Georgia have recently adopted similar policies.

North Carolina's jobless rate stands tall at 9.2 percent, well above the national average of 7.9 percent.

George Wentworth, a staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project, said the bill would launch North Carolina into the upper tier of cheapskate states.

""With one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, North Carolina will offer its jobless workers 20 weeks of unemployment insurance or less while unemployed workers in other states will qualify for anywhere from 40 to 73 weeks of benefits,"" Wentworth said.



Wentworth also said the loss of federal benefits would undermine the state's economy.

""This will be an economic catastrophe that could easily be averted by simply delaying the state benefit cuts until January,"" he said.

Lois Lerner, director of the IRS’ exempt organizations unit, spoke deliberately and crisply in her opening remarks to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the first time she has appeared before Congress since she revealed earlier this month that the division she oversaw inappropriately screened and questioned tea party and other groups seeking nonprofit status.

“I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws,” Lerner said. “I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided any false information to this or any other congressional committee.”

DOCUMENT: Inspector General’s IRS report

The fireworks started from the hearing’s outset, the third congressional showdown on the IRS controversy in less than a week. Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Vista), in his opening remarks, had harsh words not only for IRS and administration officials, but for the Treasury inspector general as well, whose audit was initiated at Issa’s request. Issa said J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, did not inform him soon enough about the results of his review.

George is one of four witnesses appearing before the committee Wednesday, along with former IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman, deputy Treasury secretary Neal Wolin and Lerner. It was Lerner’s refusal to answer questions that prompted a combative early exchange.

“While I would very much like to answer the committee’s questions today, I’ve been advised by my counsel to assert my constitutional right not to testify or answer questions related to the subject matter of this hearing,” Lerner said. “After very careful consideration, I’ve decided to follow my counsel’s advice and not testify or answer any of the questions today.

“Because I’m asserting my right not to testify, I know that some people will assume that I’ve done something wrong. I have not. One of the basic functions of the 5th Amendment is to protect innocent individuals, and that is the protection I’m invoking today.”

Issa asked Lerner to reconsider.

“I will not answer any questions or testify about the subject matter of this committee’s meeting,” she responded.

Issa then dismissed Lerner and her attorney, criminal defense lawyer William W. Taylor III, from the hearing room, prompting an objection from his Republican colleague, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.

“You don’t get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination. That’s not the way it works,” said Gowdy, a former prosecutor. “She waived her right to 5th Amendment privilege by issuing an opening statement. She ought to stand here and answer our questions.”

Some in the audience applauded.

The committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, interjected. “Unfortunately, this is not a federal court, and she does have the right, and we have to adhere to that,” he said.

Issa consulted with his staff, asked Lerner again to reconsider or answer a narrower range of questions. Again she declined, and Issa excused Lerner and her attorney from the hearing room.

Lerner’s refusal to testify was known in advance to the committee. Taylor, in a letter sent to Issa on Monday, asserted Lerner “has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course.”

According to an inspector general’s report, Lerner found out in June 2011 that some staff in the IRS Cincinnati field office had used such terms as “tea party” and “patriots” to select applications for additional scrutiny. The report stated Lerner ordered changes to the inappropriate criteria.

But neither Lerner nor anyone else at the IRS told Congress, even after repeated queries from several committees, including House Oversight, about whether some groups had been singled out unfairly.

The attack campaigns, which have come in the form of online ads and robocalls in battleground states, also shine a light on how political gamesmanship can drive policy decisions in Washington.

For example, since the government shut down Oct. 1, House Republicans have held a series of votes to fund a handful of popular government programs with full knowledge that Democrats would reject them. While refusing to hold a vote on a “clean” funding bill to reopen the entire government, Republicans have voted to fund programs such as the National Park System and National Institutes of Health. Many House Democrats crossed party lines to vote for them, but the Democrat-led Senate has rejected the piecemeal approach.

It was a legislative strategy made perfect for a sound-bite world. By passing those minifunding bills, Republicans went on to accuse Democrats of voting to close national treasures like the Grand Canyon and opposing government funding for medical research and U.S. military veterans.

The Republican National Committee has launched a series of robocalls against red state Democratic lawmakers facing re-election in 2014. The calls, which went to constituents of Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, emphasized the delayed benefits of U.S. military veterans under the government shutdown and accused Democrats of “playing politics by cutting off our veterans and their benefits.”

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), the top party group responsible for electing Republicans to the Senate, is also considering ways to use the shutdown battle against potentially vulnerable Democrats, all of whom voted against delaying the federal health care law as part of a House package to fund the government.

Story continues

“They're in a Catch-22. Vulnerable Democrats like Mary Landrieu, Mark Pryor and Kay Hagan are terrified of losing their liberal base, but their campaigns bleed independent voters each second that they embrace Obamacare and refuse to negotiate and compromise,” NRSC spokesperson Brad Dayspring told Yahoo News. “They're tying themselves to an anchor.”

While Republicans are focusing pressure on 2014 House and Senate candidates, the Democratic National Committee is sponsoring an offensive that aggressively goes after GOP congressional leaders and possible presidential candidates.

Democrats last week launched a three-wave strike, with paid online ads against Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. (Rubio, Paul and Cruz aren’t up for re-election in 2014, but all have shown some interest in seeking the party nomination for the White House in 2016.)

The first wave came on Oct. 8, when the DNC sponsored online ads and robocalls that targeted each lawmaker in their home state.

On Oct. 9, they released a series of robocalls against Rubio, Paul and Cruz in Iowa, a strategic move because Iowa traditionally holds the first Republican presidential caucuses.

“Republicans in Congress like Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul shut down the government over a week ago trying to gut Obamacare,” the voice on the DNC-sponsored robocall said. “Because of their shutdown, new USDA farm loans in Iowa have been halted, and Iowa farmers aren’t receiving payments for programs they’re enrolled in.”

Then, on Oct. 10, the DNC rolled out yet another series of Spanish-language calls to Hispanic voters against Cruz and Rubio in Florida, Texas, Nevada and Arizona that accused them of “hurting the Latino community.”

While not surprising, these campaigns shine a light on the parallel messaging battle being waged alongside the squabble on Capitol Hill, and how both parties are working hard to ensure the other team takes the fall for the blame. Depending on what works, expect to hear more of this — a lot more — in 2014 and beyond."

Six Big Fibs in Walmart's New Ad Campaign","Walmart is good: good for its employees, its customers, its suppliers, and even for the environment, says the company's new ad campaign and website, dubbed ""The Real Walmart"" as a retort to the company's critics.

But alas, the facts say otherwise. On inspection, each of the major claims in the campaign turns out to be ""The Fake Walmart."" Let's examine each of these glowing pronouncements, along with the murky reality that lies behind it.



1. The Claim: ""Opportunity: That's the Real Walmart!"" exults one of the ads. ""Over 75 percent of store management started as hourly associates.""

The Reality: An internal Walmart document just leaked to the press this week reveals that:

Hourly ""associates"" at Walmart start at or near the minimum wage. Performance-based pay increases can result in ""promotions"" in pay and title. But even the very highest level of performance will net you an annual raise of just $.60 per hour, capped for each job title. Last year, only 18 percent of hourly workers received any pay raise at all. If an employee is so industrious as to rise to the management level of, say, ""check out supervisor,"" her pay will be $1.70 more than that of the lowest paid employee.

And getting from the hourly wage ghetto to a salaried position is, as the Magic 8 Ball likes to say, ""Not likely."" In a typical Walmart store, there may be 200 employees and only a handful of salaried managers. Getting one of those few positions is ""more like a lottery than a reliable path.""

""When our store does well, I earn quarterly bonuses!""

The Reality: Those bonuses of $100 to $300, intended to make employees work harder, don't make for a living wage. If Walmart really wanted to improve workers' lives, it would allow more of them to work full time, and thus have access to health insurance and other benefits. Instead, the company keeps a tight lid on full-time work, thus denying benefits to about 70 percent of its store employees.



3. The Claim: ""Walmart helps customers save on prescription drugs!""

The Reality: But at what cost to those same customers as taxpayers? Walmart's wages and benefits are so low that many of its workers have to rely on Medicaid and other social services to support their families, costing taxpayers between $900,000 and $1.75 million annually per store in the state of Wisconsin, where these costs were calculated. That's a taxpayer tab of at least $67.5 million each year for the state of Wisconsin alone.



4. The Claim: ""President Clinton praised which company for putting solar panels on its stores?"" asks a cheerful young spokesmodel of passersby in another ad. They are surprised to learn that it's Walmart.

The Reality: The passerby's initial assumption -- that it wouldn't be Walmart -- is well taken. In fact, despite announcing in 2005 that the company would move to having 100 percent of its power supplied by renewable sources, Walmart today receives only four percent of its energy from solar and wind power.

Why would Bill Clinton say such a thing? Call me cynical, but it may have something to do with the fact that Walmart has been a major supporter of the Clintons since Bill's days as governor of Arkansas. In fact, Hillary was a member of Walmart's Board of Directors for the six years leading up to her husband's first presidential campaign in 1992. By 1993, tax returns showed the Clintons owned more than $100,000 worth of Walmart stock. In 2008, the company made substantial contributions to Hillary's presidential campaign, while Bill has maintained a close personal relationship with Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott. If Hillary runs in 2016, it will be in the post-Citizens United era of the SuperPac. These are made by billionaire contributors, and there are few billionaires as billiony as the scions of Walmart -- the six Walton heirs together own as much wealth as 40 percent of the U.S. population. The candidate who has them has the atom bomb of the SuperPac wars.



5. The Claim: ""Meet real Walmart shoppers!"" Here we meet a businessman, a teacher, a carpenter, a mechanical engineer, a firefighter and an accountant, all of them redolent with middle class status, who proudly shop at Walmart. ""Living better,"" the tag line says, ""that's the real Walmart.""

The Reality: Walmart's customers are disproportionately poor, Southern and elderly. The fact that none of these demo's made it into Walmart's ad about ""Our Customers"" means not only that Walmart is a fibber, but also that Walmart is a disser of its own ""real"" customers.



6. The Claim: ""We work directly with manufacturers, eliminating costly markups.""

The Reality: If by ""work with,"" the ad means ""dictate to,"" then this claim is accurate. But again, as Charles Fishman, the business reporter who wrote The Walmart Effect asks, what is ""the high cost of these low prices?"" Walmart's market power is such that many of its suppliers face a stark choice: take dictation from Walmart, or lose half or more of their business. ""To survive in the face of [Walmart's] pricing demands, makers of everything from bras to bicycles to blue jeans have had to lay off employees and close U.S. plants in favor of outsourcing products from overseas.""

Just ask Steve Dobbins, CEO of 75-year old Carolina Mills, a company that supplies thread and yarn to textile manufacturers -- half of whom supply Walmart. His company grew steadily until 2000. Then his customers, with Walmart's gun to their heads -- began a hemhorrage of offshoring in order to find the dirt cheap labor necessary to meet Walmart's low price demands. Carolina Mills shrank from 17 factories to 7 within three years. The way Walmart ""works with"" its suppliers has been disastrous for American workers.

In the end, what can we learn from ""The Real Walmart""?

When large corporations are criticized, they squirt PR like a cuttlefish. After all, it's a lot cheaper to fix the image than to fix the problem. This summer, reports have emerged showing that Walmart's pay and promotion policies are miserly, and that as a result, taxpayers get stuck with a big tab. If ""greenwashing"" is hiding your environmental sins with PR, and red is the color of labor, ""The Real Walmart"" has, in response to its critics, given us ""redwashing.""

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/19/food-stamp-cuts_n_3780362.html,2013-08-19 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],Food Stamp Cuts Would Deny Benefits To At Least 4 Million: CBPP,"WASHINGTON -- A Republican proposal to cut food stamp spending by 5 percent would eliminate benefits for as many as 6 million Americans, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal D.C. think tank.

Republicans have said the forthcoming measure, which will combine stricter eligibility standards with new work requirements, will reduce Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program spending by $40 billion over 10 years.

""House Republican leaders haven’t formally released the language of their plan, but the information they have made available makes clear that the proposal will be very harsh, denying SNAP to at least four million to six million low-income people, including some of the nation’s poorest adults, as well as many low-income children, seniors, and families that work for low wages,"" the CBPP's Dottie Rosenbaum, Stacy Dean, and Robert Greenstein said in a report published Monday.

A key part of the new legislation would stop states from waiving SNAP's work requirements for able-bodied childless adults, something more than 45 states currently do because of high unemployment. Working-age Americans without kids would have to either work 20 hours a week or engage in ""work activities"" that could include training or volunteering.

""The House will consider common-sense measures, such as work requirements and job training requirements for able-bodied adults without children receiving assistance, that enjoy broad public support,"" Doug Heye, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), said in an email on Monday.

The Center on Budget claims it's inaccurate to say the forthcoming proposal includes work requirements. ""In reality, they would terminate basic food assistance to people who would take any job or job training opportunity offered but cannot find one; the proposal doesn’t require states to provide jobs or job training and includes no added funds for these activities,"" the report's authors said.

The percentage of SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without children has risen from 6.6 percent in 2007 to 9.7 percent in 2010, or nearly 4 million people. Altogether 47 million Americans, most of them either children, elderly or disabled, receive SNAP benefits each month.

A recent Fox News poll found 94 percent of respondents were okay with food stamps going to a ""laid-off worker who wants a job and doesn’t have the money to feed his family"" but 91 percent opposed food stamps for an ""unemployed musician who doesn’t want to take a regular job which will pay him enough to live on."" A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in June found 40 percent of Americans favored cutting food stamps.

The House voted down a bill in June that would have reduced SNAP spending by $20 billion, denying benefits to nearly 2 million people. House Republican leaders are coming back with deeper cuts in a bid to get the bill through the lower chamber with a majority of Republican votes. Any SNAP cuts approved by the House would have to be merged with Senate legislation that has much more modest reductions.

Automatic benefits cuts for all SNAP recipients are scheduled to take effect in November, regardless of whether Congress passes new cuts, thanks to the expiration of a benefit increase from the 2009 stimulus bill."

Because compared to what?,” Pelosi said during a press briefing in the Capitol. “Compared to Republicans saying Medicare should wither on the vine? Social Security has no place in a free society?” Citing a Kaiser Foundation analysis indicating that raising Medicare's eligibility age would cost the government money, Pelosi said such a move is simply ""trophy-taking."" “It's just a scalp,” she said. “It doesn't save money.”

“Why are we doing this?” Dem Rep. Keith Ellison, a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said to me in an interview today. Asked which is worse, continued sequestration or a grand bargain that cuts entitlement benefits, Ellison said: “It’s like saying, `Which of your kids do you want to sacrifice to the monster?’ Neither one.” [...] “Once we do that we’re already in the territory of bargaining away Chained CPI,” Ellison said. “We’re already saying we’re open to negotiating on Chained CPI. And we’re not.” [...] Ellison pointed out that Republicans aren’t as quick as Dems to signal a willingness to trade away core priorities at the outset. “Republicans don’t do that,” he said.

President Obama told Republicans he means it when he says he wants to cut Medicare and Social Security, and now he's got Nancy Pelosi backing him up, at least on cutting Social Security benefits through the chained CPI.We've been through this ""protect the most vulnerable"" business before on the issue of the chained CPI, and the question remains, how do you define that ? By the time you exempt all of the people who should be kept safe from this cut, the savings would be trivial to the pain caused. Which sounds an awful lot like a meaningless trophy for the Republicans. Pelosi could just be showing that Democrats are reasonable compared to Republicans, blah, blah, blah, blah. But she's also undercutting what has been key rhetoric for Democrats in all of these budget fights: we won't reduce the deficit on the backs of poor/elderly/middle class/working Americans. So why even go near breaking that promise? That's what liberals in the House are asking, too. Here's Rep. Keith Ellison talking to Greg Sargent Ellison has got more than 100 House Democrats with him, who have signed pledge to President Obama to oppose any of these cuts. They need to cc Pelosi on that letter, and perhaps to remind her that her path to regaining the speakership lies in not pissing away the core Democratic base.

Send an email to the White House telling President Obama to immediately stop proposing any cuts to Social Security."

Michele Bachmann, with her toothy grin and startling wide-eyed stare, is especially adept at this.

The other day, the queen of the House tea party was standing before the TV cameras at the World War II Memorial with her arm around a frail-looking veteran of that war. A group of ancient vets had come to the capital for an event at the memorial only to find they couldn’t get in because of the government shutdown. Bachmann fawned over the elderly man while telling reporters how utterly shameful it was for President Obama to lock out these venerable old soldiers. The shutdown was the president’s fault, she said; he was to blame for inflicting so much unnecessary inconvenience and pain.

This is the same woman who has been absolutely giddy in other interviews talking about how “very excited” she and her colleagues are, as if the shutdown is the best thing since Jesus turned water into wine. “It’s exactly what we wanted, and we got it,” Bachmann said to the Washington Post.

On Sunday, House Speaker John A. Boehner was acting like a jilted girlfriend in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC. Boehner insisted Obama’s refusal to give him a phone call is the reason government offices remain shuttered. Boehner, of course, could end the impasse all by himself simply by allowing a vote on the Senate-passed continuing resolution to fund the government. It would easily get thumbs-up from Democrats and a significant share of Republican House members, but letting that happen would earn Boehner major grief, not only from the radicals in his caucus, but from the rich conservative money men who spearheaded the drive for this showdown.

And that is the highly pertinent fact that Boehner, Bachmann and the rest of the Republicans conveniently fail to mention. As detailed in a Sunday New York Times story, a well-financed cohort of conservative activists have been planning for months to use a government shutdown as a cudgel to cripple the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Among those behind the effort are, predictably, the Koch brothers, the right-wing billionaire industrialists who, the newspaper reports, gave out $200 million last year to anti-Obamacare groups. Another key leader is a figure from the dark past, Ronald Reagan’s former attorney general, Edwin Meese III.

Also pushing the Obamacare battle is Michael A. Needham, who runs the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Unlike Bachmann and her buddies, Needham did not play coy when asked about what is going on, telling the New York Times, “We felt very strongly from the start that this was a fight that we were going to pick.”

And it’s the fight they got. Republicans should stop feigning innocence and be brave enough to own it.

[For the record, 2:51 p.m. Oct. 8: An earlier version of this post referred to Edwin Meese III as Richard Nixon’s former attorney general. He was attorney general under Ronald Reagan.]"

He Began His Column With The Post In', 'He Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In His Latest Book', 'The Conservative Sensibility', 'Was Released In June']",George Will: Break up the big banks,"With his chronically gravelly voice and relentlessly liberal agenda, Sherrod Brown seems to have stepped out of “Les Miserables,” hoarse from singing revolutionary anthems at the barricades. Today, Ohio’s senior senator has a project worthy of Victor Hugo — and of conservatives’ support. He wants to break up the biggest banks.

He would advocate this even if he thought such banks would never have a crisis sufficient to threaten the financial system. He believes they are unhealthy for the financial system even when they are healthy. This is because there is a silent subsidy — an unfair competitive advantage relative to community banks — inherent in being deemed by the government, implicitly but clearly, too big to fail.

The Senate has unanimously passed a bill offered by Brown and Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, directing the Government Accountability Office to study whether banks with more than $500 billion in assets acquire an “economic benefit” because of their dangerous scale. Is their debt priced favorably because, being TBTF, they are considered especially creditworthy? Brown believes the 20 largest banks pay less when borrowing — 50 to 80 basis points less — than community banks must pay.

In a sense, TBTF began under Ronald Reagan with the 1984 rescue of Continental Illinois, then the seventh-largest bank. In 2011, the four biggest U.S. banks (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo) had 40 percent of all federally insured deposits. Today, the 5,500 community banks have 12 percent of the banking industry’s assets. The 12 banks with $250 billion to $2.3 trillion in assets total 69 percent. The 20 largest banks’ assets total 84.5 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product.

Such banks have become bigger, relative to the economy, since the financial crisis began, and they are not the only economic entities to do so. Last year, the Economist reported that in the past 15 years the combined assets of the 50 largest U.S. companies had risen from around 70 percent of GDP to around 130 percent. And banks are not the only entities designated TBTF because they are “systemically important.” General Motors supposedly required a bailout because a chain of parts suppliers might have failed with it.

But this just means that the pernicious practice of socializing losses while keeping profits private is not quarantined in the financial sector.

To see why TBTF also can mean TBTM — too big to manage — read “What’s Inside America’s Banks?” in the January/February issue of the Atlantic. Frank Partnoy and Jesse Eisinger argue that banks are not only bigger but also “more opaque than ever.” And regulations partake of the opacity: The landmark Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, separating commercial banking from investment banking, was 37 pages long; the 848 pages of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law may eventually be supplemented by 30 times that many pages of rules. The “Volcker rule” banning banks from speculating with federally insured deposits is 298 pages long.

There is no convincing consensus about a correlation between a bank’s size and supposed efficiencies of scale, and any efficiencies must be weighed against management inefficiencies associated with complexity and opacity. Thirty or so years ago, Brown says, seven of the world’s 10 largest banks were Japanese, which was not an advantage sufficient to prevent Japan’s descent into prolonged stagnation. And he says that when Standard Oil was broken up in 1911, the parts of it became, cumulatively, more valuable than the unified corporation had been.

Brown is fond of the maxim that “banking should be boring.” He suspects that within the organizational sprawl of the biggest banks, there is too much excitement. Clever people with the high spirits and adrenaline addictions of fighter pilots continue to develop exotic financial instruments and transactions unknown even in other parts of the sprawl. He is undecided about whether the proper metric for identifying a bank as “too big” should be if its assets are a certain percentage of GDP — he suggests 2 percent to 4 percent — or simply the size of its assets (Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, has suggested $100 billion).

By breaking up the biggest banks, conservatives will not be putting asunder what the free market has joined together. Government nurtured these behemoths by weaving an improvident safety net and by practicing crony capitalism. Dismantling them would be a blow against government that has become too big not to fail. Aux barricades!

S%26P 500 gains more in Obama%27s first term than his last four predecessors

President%27s tenure coincided with end of bear market and Great Recession%2C creating fuel for rebound

History shows that presidential second terms are not as bullish for stocks

NEW YORK — Despite critics that brand him as anti-business and anti-Wall Street, President Obama's first term in the White House has been bullish for stocks.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen 85% since Obama was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009, says S&P Capital IQ. That stellar return tops first-term gains of Obama's past four predecessors: George. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.

Using the Dow Jones industrial average, Obama ranks third in first-term stock performance of all presidents; Franklin D. Roosevelt is No. 1, says Bespoke Investment Group.

On March 3, 2009, six days before the end of the worst bear market since the Great Depression, Obama urged skittish investors to buy beaten-down U.S. stocks.

At a time when fear was high and it seemed like stocks would never stop falling, says Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory firm Yardeni Research, valuations ""are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.""

""You have to give him credit for that market call,"" Yardeni added.

Obama's prognostication was spot on. Despite the criticism he has received since the Great Recession for backing massive taxpayer-funded bailouts of banks and automakers, and using borrowed money to stimulate the economy, stocks have responded positively.

The current bull market, which turns four years old March 9, is up 120% and ranks eighth best of all time, Bespoke says.

Does the president deserve the credit? Probably not, Yardeni says. ""There is a tendency to correlate investment cycles to political cycles,"" he says.

""But it is not the sole determining factor, nor the most significant factor.""

J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, says while Obama deserves some credit, he also benefited from a ""little bit of luck,"" the knowledge that big stimulus packages were in the pipeline, as well as being in ""the right place at the right time.""

The Obama bounce was driven by the following factors:

• Oversold market was due for a rebound. The stock market cratered 57% in the bear market that ended two months after Obama took office. And the 18-month-long Great Recession, was over five months after Inauguration Day.

Stocks tend to rise when the economy emerges from recession. In FDR's first term beginning in 1933 after the Great Depression, stocks rallied 149%, says S&P Capital IQ.

• Help from the Fed. The Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policies to jump-start the economy, including 0% short-term interest rates and the purchase of government and mortgage-backed bonds to keep borrowing costs low, have been a major driver of stock prices during Obama's term, Yardeni says.

""I would say that the great performance of the stock market has a lot more to do with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke than Obama,"" Yardeni says.

History says stock returns are more muted in a president's final term in office. Since 1900, stocks have risen just 10.2%, on average in term two, vs. a gain of 67% in first terms, says Bespoke."

“When you look at life expectancy, there are problems in the black race: sickle-cell anemia is something that comes up, diabetes is something that’s prevalent in the genetic makeup and you just can’t help it,” Marble said. “Although I’ve got to say, I’ve never had better BBQ and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down south and you — I love it.” Marble went on to mention how Mexicans eat vegetables in Mexico but stop eating healthily when they immigrate to the United States. “These things aren’t good for you,” she continued. “There’s so many attributing factors as to why these graphs look the way they do.”

Saying black people like fried chicken is an old stereotype. Saying black people and Latinos are poorthey like fried chicken is a new twist . But presented with statistics on racial disparities in the poverty rate, that was Colorado state Sen. Vicki Marble's explanation:Also in there somewhere, she mentioned a restaurant called ""Type II Chicken,"" which she had always wanted to eat at, and also that ""an idle mind is the devil's workshop."" She was rambling, is what I'm saying. Free-associating about the causes of poverty. And her free-associating led her to—actually kind of kicked off with—the idea that black people are genetically flawed and like fried chicken.

Marble's epic four minutes-plus ramble on poverty (which she began wrapping up only when she was cut off by the task force chair saying ""it seems like there's a repetition there and I think the point is made"") ended with a ""question"" aimed at suggesting that the War on Poverty had made things worse. So while she mentioned a whole lot of things along the way, her basic points were to blame either people of color or policies to combat poverty or both for high infant mortality and low life expectancy among poor black and Latino people. Which kind of contradicts her statement that she's ""saddened"" her comments were taken as disparaging and that ""I hope our work on this committee will offer real solutions to the health and financial challenges of our vulnerable populations,"" unless of course you think ""black people shouldn't eat so much fried chicken and the War on Poverty made things worse"" are real solutions."

As Congress considers legislation that would boost the federal minimum wage, at least 13 states will be raising the wage floor on their own next week. They're led once again by Washington state, which will continue to have the highest state minimum wage in the nation, at $9.32 per hour.

A few cities and counties around the country will be raising their minimum wages as well, including San Francisco, which will set its at $10.74. San Francisco's base will no longer be the highest municipal minimum wage in the country, however, after voters in SeaTac, Wash., approved a ballot measure setting a $15 wage floor for an estimated 6,000 airport workers. The SeaTac minimum wage is set to go into effect Jan. 1, although it's currently being challenged in court.

Most of next week's increases will come courtesy of an inflation index. Ten states have tied their minimum wages to the index, guaranteeing that they rise with the cost of living each year. Other states, such as New Jersey and Connecticut, passed legislation in 2013 that will nominally raise their minimum wages. (California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the state's minimum wage to $10 by 2016, but the first increase, to $9, won't come until July.)

The federal minimum wage prevails in the 31 states that don't currently mandate a higher one. The federal rate hasn't been raised since 2009, after the last of a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush took effect.

The federal minimum wage is not tied to an index, but Democrats in Congress, as well as President Barack Obama, have said that it should be. The minimum wage bill put forth by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 and peg it to inflation. Obama, who previously suggested raising the wage floor to $9 and indexing it, has since gotten on board with the $10.10 proposal from Harkin and Miller.

The annual minimum wage raises in states and cities are routinely praised by low-wage worker advocates and panned by business-friendly groups. The Employment Policies Institute, a vocal critic of higher minimum wages, argued in a press release Monday that raises like the ones that will go into effect next week have ""disastrous results for the most vulnerable jobseekers."" Republicans on Capitol Hill have shown party-line opposition to the Harkin-Miller proposal, with leadership declaring a minimum wage increase a job-killer.

Most voters, however, don't seem persuaded by the critics' economic arguments, as they continue to approve higher minimum wages on the local level. The idea of raising the minimum wage tends to poll extremely well, including among Republicans who are not members of Congress. Most polls show that around two-thirds of respondents support raising the federal minimum wage. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, half of Republicans who responded said it should be raised.

Here are the state and local increases that will go into effect next week, as compiled by the Employment Policies Institute:

Arizona: $7.80 to $7.90

Colorado: $7.78 to $8.00

Connecticut: $8.25 to $8.70

Florida: $7.79 to $7.93

The 16-day government shutdown took a $24 billion chunk out of the U.S. economy, according to an initial analysis from Standard & Poor's.

As a result, the rating agency projects that the U.S. economy will grow 2.4% in the fourth quarter -- as opposed to the roughly 3% growth rate predicted prior to the shutdown.

""Because it's happening all at once, so quick, so fast, unplanned; it's going to hurt,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&P. ""We can absorb it, but it still hurts.""

Related: Congress votes to do its job, but the fights aren't over

Hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed during the shutdown, but that was just one of the widespread effects of the first shutdown in nearly two decades.

Federal contractors also furloughed thousands of employees.

Small businesses reeled from frozen government contracts and stalled business loans.

Closed national parks hit the tourism industry.

Military families saw childcare and other services shuttered.

Consumers, also scared by the debate over raising the debt ceiling, started to cut back.

While federal workers will ultimately receive back pay under the deal, contractors will likely not get their lost wages, Bovino said. And with the deal only guaranteeing government funding through Jan. 15, many federal workers and contractors may continue to hold back on spending into the holiday shopping season.

""That's going to keep people a little more cautious, particularly government workers and certainly contractors,"" she said ""It certainly suggests a ho-hum holiday.""

The debt fix is also only temporary, which could continue to fuel economic uncertainty, hurting consumer confidence and slowing hiring, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics.

Zandi blamed continued government brinksmanship as a major factor holding back the U.S. economic recovery.

""This is a real corrosion on the economy,"" Zandi said. ""If we have to go down a similar road in the near future, the costs are going to continue to add up."""
http://news.yahoo.com/u-scrambles-boost-obamacare-enrollment-deadlines-loom-000836887--sector.html,,[],U.S. scrambles to boost Obamacare enrollment as deadlines loom,"By Roberta Rampton and Sharon Begley (Reuters) - The Obama administration announced a flurry of fixes to its troubled HealthCare.gov website on Friday that officials said would soon double its current capacity, a crucial step toward getting the system working by a November 30 deadline. It also pushed back a deadline for people to enroll in insurance plans for 2014 under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act in a nod to millions of applicants who have been unable to sign up because of technical glitches for nearly two months. The healthcare reform, popularly known as Obamacare, aims to provide health benefits to millions of uninsured Americans. Obama's biggest domestic policy achievement, however, has now become one of the biggest political crises of his presidency as polls show Americans increasingly souring on the reform. As a result, the administration is in a race against time to fix the website, an online insurance exchange, that is central to Obamacare. People need to make decisions on healthcare plans in December if they want insurance in place by January. People needing health insurance by January 1, 2014 will have eight extra days to sign up, officials said. The original deadline for year-end coverage was December 15, but now will be moved to December 23. Jeffrey Zients, the troubleshooter named by Obama to oversee fixes to HealthCare.gov told reporters on Friday that the website will soon be able to handle 50,000 simultaneous users - twice its current capacity, and up from fewer than 1,000 in the days after its botched launch on Oct 1. The website will be able to handle 800,000 people per day by the end of November, Zients said, largely because of more than 300 software and other fixes made to the site in the past seven weeks, and because of a doubling in the system's hardware capacity, which will happen this weekend. DIRECT ENROLLMENT Some of the technical fixes will allow insurance companies to more easily directly enroll consumers in health plans, a senior administration official said. The administration will run a pilot program for direct enrollment in three states with large numbers of uninsured people - Texas, Florida and Ohio - and use the results to expand the availability of the ""direct enrollment"" option. ""We do believe that it's substantial. We're looking at hundreds of thousands of people who we believe may well opt to do this,"" the official told Reuters. Insurance companies worked with the administration to address the technical challenges in the direct enrollment option, said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a lobby group. ""Getting direct enrollment working will enable health plans to do what they do best, and that's enroll people in coverage,"" Zirkelbach said. Greg Thompson, a spokesman for Health Care Service Corporation, which operates health plans including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, said he did not immediately know whether the Texas plan would participate in the pilot project. ""We are looking at a variety of ways that people can have access to enrollment,"" Thompson said. ""We want to make sure it can happen both on and off the exchanges."" DELAY FOR YEAR TWO Officials were adamant that they have no plans to extend the ultimate deadline of March 31, 2014, the date when people without insurance must enroll in a plan or face a tax penalty. But with the first enrollment period barely off the ground, the Obama administration also has decided to delay enrollment for the second year of the program to give insurance companies more time to calculate rates, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. The delay will mean consumers will start shopping for insurance for Year Two of Obamacare on November 15, 2014 - more than a week after voters go to the polls for midterm elections, when congressional Democrats are expected to face tough questions about the policy they supported. ""That means that if premiums go through the roof in the first year of Obamacare, no one will know about it until after the election,"" said Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa. But Carney rejected any assertion that politics was behind the extension. ""The fact is, we're doing it because it make sense for insurers to have as clear a sense of the pool of consumers they gain in the market this year, before setting rates for next year,"" Carney said.

The looming reduction has received little attention since lawmakers set it in motion years ago. The average household's monthly benefit from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will drop by $20 or $25, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington think tank.

""The general public doesn't realize it,"" Celia Cole, CEO of the Texas Food Bank Network, told The Huffington Post on Monday. ""We certainly know the low income people on SNAP don't know the cut is coming.""

Cole's organization is publicizing the cut with a countdown clock. On Monday the clock indicated there are 94 days ""until every SNAP (food stamps) household in America gets a little hungrier.""

But Congress has little appetite for intervention, as the consensus among lawmakers is not whether food stamps should be reduced, but by how much.

The November reduction is happening separately from the debate over cutting food stamps as part of a broader farm bill. The cut is set to kick in because a 13 percent benefit boost from the 2009 stimulus bill is expiring. Initially, the plan was to let inflation catch up with the increase so that SNAP recipients would never see a month-to-month dollar decline.

But in 2010, Senate Democrats and the Obama administration needed money to offset the cost of a series of spending bills. They said at the time they would replace the money later, but they never did. Congressional attitudes toward food stamp recipients have only gotten less generous since then.

The $668 maximum monthly benefit for a family of four will fall to $643, according to the Center on Budget's Stacy Dean and Dottie Rosenbaum. (The average household's monthly benefit is $287.)

""This cut will be the equivalent of taking away 14 meals per month for a family of four, or 11 meals for a family of three,"" Dean and Rosenbaum wrote in a May report. The pair said that states should make sure recipients know when the cut is around the corner.

First and foremost, Cole said her mission is to get the word out in Texas. Her organization represents 21 food banks serving all parts of the state. Cole also wants members of Congress to feel some pressure.

""I want them to not be able to do it without feeling the shame that they're doing something wrong,"" she said.

Pat Quinn launched Illinois’ epic attempt to bail itself out of a $100 billion public employee pension debt Thursday, signing into law an ambitious financial, legal and political effort to restore the state’s tumbling credit ratings and unstable economy.

Despite the historic nature of the law, which takes effect June 1, the Democratic governor signed the measure behind closed doors, joined by top lawmakers. The quietness of the event symbolized the controversial nature of a package that has split longtime political allegiances and quickly become fodder for the 2014 campaign season.

The private bill signing stood in sharp contrast to the public pep rally that master of ceremonies Quinn held when he put his signature on Illinois’ gay marriage law little more than two weeks earlier, a move that reaffirmed support among progressives.

On Thursday, Quinn offered a simple signing statement on the pension measure saying “Illinois is moving forward” and calling the law “a serious solution to the most dire fiscal challenge of our time.”

Whether the law represents a solution to the state’s pension liability will likely be up to the courts to decide. As expected, public employee unions said they had directed their lawyers to prepare a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the law and seek a stay to prevent it from taking effect.

The We Are One coalition of unions, headed by the state AFL-CIO, called the new law “attempted pension theft and it’s illegal.”

“Leading politicians and their followers chose to violate their oaths of office, trample on the Illinois Constitution, and willfully ignore the plain letter of the law,” the coalition said in a statement. “Once overturned, its purported savings will evaporate and the state’s finances and pension systems will be left in worse shape.”

At issue is a clause in the 1970 state constitution which defines public pensions as an “enforceable contract” with benefits that cannot be diminished or impaired. But supporters of the measure, including House Speaker Michael Madigan, have maintained the law will be upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court.

Once again Thursday, Madigan claimed full credit for the legislature’s narrow passage of the measure, an unusual posture for the state Democratic chairman to take on legislation that was fought by unions, a traditional Democratic ally.

“The bill would not have passed without me,” Madigan said in the statement Quinn’s office released, a rare claim of self congratulations from a veteran politician who prefers to work behind the scenes.

Madigan’s boast may be a way for him to push back against the idea that he helped create the financial instability that surrounds state government as someone who has served as House speaker for all but two of the last 30 years.

The new law counts on saving $160 billion over the next 30 years, largely by sharply curbing cost-of-living increases to retirees and requiring many current workers to skip up to five annual cost of living bumps when they retire. It also would boost the retirement age for current workers by up to five years, depending on how old they are.

In an effort to get the law deemed constitutional, employees would have to contribute 1 percentage point less to their salaries, pension systems would be allowed to sue to force the state to pay its required employer share to retirement, and a limited number of workers could join a 401-(k) style defined contribution plan.

Earlier Thursday, state Treasurer Dan Rutherford, one of four Republican candidates for governor, took the side of the unions in saying he did not believe the givebacks to workers and retirees were sufficient enough to be found constitutional.

A rival for the GOP governor nomination, Winnetka equity investor Bruce Rauner told supporters on Twitter he was not surprised “that a flawed, insider deal crafted behind closed doors is signed behind closed doors too.”

Rauner, who has been sharply critical of government unions, had advocated a more stringent plan to shift workers into 401-(k) plans — a move viewed politically impossible in a Democratic controlled legislature and a proposal difficult for a workforce in which about 80 percent do not receive a safety net of Social Security.

Of the other two Republicans in the race, state Sen. Bill Brady of Bloomington, the 2010 GOP nominee, served on a special pension panel and supported it while state Sen. Kirk Dillard of Hinsdale opposed it for a litany of reasons after previously supporting similar legislation.

This message was sent to the Senate community on behalf of Terrance W. Gainer, Senate Sergeant at Arms.

Door Closures/Long Lines

Senate Community:

Many of you have contacted me about the long lines and trouble getting into our Senate buildings over the past three days. I regret the inconvenience and continue to explore ways to mitigate the delays. However, given the budget constraints all of us are experiencing, I do not expect substantial relief.

The United States Capitol Police (USCP) continues to explore ways to relieve congestion and limit the wait time. However, the police staffing impact and concomitant costs are significant. Remember, if we are able to relieve the pressure in the morning by opening additional doors it requires police officer overtime, and the costs still must be recovered from some USCP service. Figuring out where to relieve the pressure is the hard part. Something has to give.

I respectfully request your assistance: you can make a difference. As you make appointments with visitors or otherwise communicate with the public, please emphasize that the process of entering the building has changed. Remind visitors that there are fewer entrances available, and perhaps recommend to them the appropriate door to use. Most important, and much like our shared experience at airports after 9-11, more time is needed to get into the buildings. The sociologist in me hopes visitors and staff, armed with current information, will adjust patterns and past practices.

We will continue to adjust signs, add signs, and use way finders to help. Your personal communication with expected visitors is critical. Notifying us or the USCP about particular needs, early meetings, large gatherings, committee hearings, and social functions might also ease the pain.

Please be assured that we understand the issue and will work with you as we adjust to a few new realities.

Respectfully, Terry"

Obama talks to nearly 150 business leaders, 25 governors

Obama would sign a debt ceiling hike ""as a bare minimum,"" spokesman says

Possible changes to Obamacare were discussed, GOP senators say

President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner both want talks to continue on ending the partial government shutdown and avoiding a possible debt default -- a welcome development after weeks of acrimony, if not proof a breakthrough is near.

Spokesman for both leaders, who were trading pointed barbs until a few days ago, issued statements after a Friday afternoon phone call, that ""we should all keep talking."" Conversations on Friday did yield some points of agreement among lawmakers, including on altering Obama's signature health care reforms and raising revenue to prevent forced cuts in government spending.

But overall, there has been little indication that there is any legislation yet that all the key players -- the President, the GOP-led House and the Democratic-led Senate -- will rally behind.

Much of the discussion of late revolves around a proposal from House Republicans to increase the federal borrowing limit for about six weeks to avoid a potentially harmful default as soon as October 17, when the Obama administration says the government will run out of money to pay its bills.

Republicans like Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois say a temporary debt ceiling hike will allow all parties to ""concentrate on the continuing resolution."" His chamber could vote on the measure as soon as this weekend.

But the lack of a mechanism to immediately reopen the government -- which has been partially shut down since October 1, prompting the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers, the closing of national parks and an increase in public anger -- could turn off some Democrats.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney repeated Obama's position that the partial shutdown must end before budget talks aimed to address the debt begin.

However, he didn't close the door completely on the House GOP plan, saying Obama would sign a temporary debt ceiling increase ""as a bare minimum"" as long as Republicans didn't attach partisan policy issues to it.

Sources: GOP senators losing patience with House

Meanwhile, Obama continued his outreach on Friday, including conversations with nearly 150 business leaders and 25 governors. He also reached across the aisle to Senate Republicans in a meeting Carney characterized as constructive, without offering details.

Some GOP members in the Senate have floated a plan discussed on Friday afternoon by a bipartisan group of about 10 senators, led by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, according to sources familiar with the meeting.

The proposal, which has yet to be introduced, would raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government with some qualifications. Among them: A Republican priority, backed by many Democrats, to end a tax on medical devices created by the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

While much of their fire has been aimed at Democrats, some Senate Republicans also see their House colleagues as part of the problem.

There is growing concern being expressed in private meetings that the House GOP plan extending the debt ceiling for six weeks would come back to haunt the party, because it would expire close to the holidays, hurting retailers.

There also are worries about the impact of the partial shutdown dragging on, especially with polls showing the Republican Party getting the brunt of the blame.

Several GOP senators told CNN they will give House Speaker John Boehner a bit more time -- about 24 to 48 hours -- to reach a deal with the White House to raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government. But after that, they'll push the plan backed by moderate Senate Republicans more aggressively.

After Friday's meeting at the White House, Collins said Obama ""listened carefully"" and ""said that some of the elements were issues we could work on. But he certainly did not endorse"" the proposal.

Conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said Obama called the medical device tax a ""legitimate concern"" that can be addressed because it wasn't part of the core Obamacare program.

According to other senators in the meeting, another Obamacare alteration under discussion would change the definition of a part-time worker in order to protect employees having their hours cut so businesses can avoid a requirement to provide health coverage.

Some conservatives -- like tea party favorite Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- left the meeting upset at Obama for continuing to insist the government must reopen and the debt ceiling must be increased before he would take part in full-fledged negotiations on deficit reduction.

""There was an awful lot of talking but the president still says he won't negotiate,"" said Cruz, who spearheaded the attempt last month to add anti-Obamacare amendments to a spending plan needed to prevent the government shutdown.

Source: Obama, Ryan exchange shifts tone

Even as he has continued to firmly repeat his positions, President Obama has been reaching across the aisle this week.

One potentially pivotal meeting came Thursday evening, when House GOP leaders went to the White House.

The two sides went around and around for an hour, getting nowhere. Then -- as first reported by CNN's Deirdre Walsh and Dana Bash, citing multiple attendees -- an exchange between GOP Rep. Paul Ryan and Obama seemed to clear the air.

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King told CNN's ""New Day"" that Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, ""said something to the effect of, 'Look, we know you don't like our position, we know you probably don't respect our position, but we're the Republican majority.' ""

Those comments changed the tone of the meeting, King said. Obama reiterated his opposition to negotiations before the government reopens, then urged GOP leaders to go ask their colleagues what they want done to make that happen.

Republican Rep. Steve Southerland of Florida said the interaction between the two men -- who squared off in the 2012 election, when Ryan ran as his party's vice presidential nominee -- ""was an important part of the conversation.""

""Paul and the President certainly have a past through the last election, and I think there's a great respect between them. And you can't make that up."" Southerland said.

The new atmosphere was reflected in both sides' comments after the meeting. The White House called it good and said the parties discussed ""potential paths forward."" GOP Rep. Hal Rogers of Kentucky said they were talking ""in good faith"" about both the debt and reopening the government.

""We're all working together now,"" said Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican.

In a video message to a right-wing political summit on Friday, Ryan noted conservatives can't get everything they want with Democrats holding the White House and a majority of the Senate.

""This President won't agree to everything we need to do,"" said the message from Ryan, according to excerpts provided by one of his aides. ""A budget agreement with this President and this Senate won't solve our problems. But I hope it's a start."""

The law raises minimum pay in the most populous state from its current rate of $8 per hour to $9 by July 2014 and $10 by January 2016. The state with the highest minimum wage currently is Washington, where employers must pay at least $9.19 per hour.

The measure won support from Democrats, passing the state Senate by a vote of 26-11 and the Assembly by 51-25. But it was opposed by many Republicans, who said it would hurt small businesses and ultimately cost some low-wage workers their jobs.

Brown, protective of California's tenuous economic recovery, had initially opposed the bill but agreed to support it after leaders of both houses of the Democratic-led state legislature agreed to postpone the effective date of the raise until 2016.

State Assemblyman Luis Alejo, who authored the wage hike bill, said the increase would help working people pay for necessities in a state where rising costs have long outpaced wage increases for the poor and working class.

""We have created a system where we pay workers less but need them to spend more,"" Alejo said in a statement. ""That causes middle-class families to fall down the economic ladder. It's the reason our middle class is shrinking and the reason we are facing the largest gap between upper- and lower-income Californians in at least 30 years.""

The minimum hourly wage in the state had stagnated after rising to $8 in 2008, but remains higher than the federal minimum of $7.25.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/27/america-oil-surge-is-leaving-alaska-in-dust/,2013-10-27 00:00:00,"['Dan Springer', 'Dan Springer Joined Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'In August As A Seattle-Based Correspondent.']",America's oil surge leaving Alaska in the dust,"America's oil boom has the Texas tea flowing, whole new towns being built in North Dakota and, for the first time in decades, the U.S. producing more crude than it imports. But Alaska, a state known for its vast oil resources and pro-drilling politics, is being left in the dust of this new oil surge.

The state, with its 800-mile pipeline running from the North Slope to Valdez, has fallen to fourth among oil-producing states, now trailing Texas, North Dakota and California. It's not sitting well with many there.

""There's definitely a hit to the state pride,"" said Alaska Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Joe Balash. ""There's a certain amount of embarrassment that a place as over-regulated and over-taxed as California is eclipsing Alaska.""

Production in Alaska peaked in 1988 when companies sent 2.1 million barrels of oil per day down the pipeline. Declining ever since, last year production hit a low of 526,000 barrels per day.

Everyone agrees that part of the decline is due to the natural cycle of oil field drilling. Prudhoe Bay, on Alaska's North Slope, is still the largest oil field ever discovered in the U.S. But nearly 40 years of drilling has diminished the supply of easy-to-get oil.

To date, 16 billion barrels of oil have been squeezed out of the North Slope. But officials believe the end is far from over. It's estimated there's still 10 billion barrels of oil in the ground.

So why aren't the oil giants Conoco Phillips, BP and others going after it? Here's where the great Alaska debate begins.

Republicans blame a progressive production tax which has been a windfall for the state's general fund in recent years, but which some argue chased away new development.

""The state of Alaska put together a very unfavorable tax structure,"" said Sarah Erkmann, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Oil and Gas Association. ""For many years, Alaska was not an attractive place to do business.""

In 2008, when the price of Alaskan crude shot up $35, to $96 per barrel, oil companies paid a record $6.8 billion in production taxes. The revenue has allowed the state to go on a spending spree and put $5 billion in a reserve fund. It's also built the state's Permanent Fund to $45 billion. This year, the fund paid every Alaskan $900.

The state, though, is almost totally dependent on oil taxes. There is no income or sales tax. Oil revenue accounts for 85 percent of the state's general fund.

The Republican-controlled Legislature passed a massive tax cut that will cost the state about $500 million a year. GOP Gov. Sean Parnell says the revenue hit will be temporary and should turn around the oil production decline.

""This tax change will drive billions more in investment, create more opportunities for our citizens and for America too,"" said Parnell.

But opponents call it an expensive giveaway to oil companies. They point out that oil jobs were added, even during the high-tax years, and the companies are still making huge profits in Alaska.

""Keeping a fair oil tax on the books was part of building a strong Alaska,"" said Democratic State Sen. Hollis French. ""Our concern with [the bill] is that it was not tied to more oil company investment in the state.""

A citizens group gathered enough signatures to put a referendum on the ballot next year. Alaskans will be able to decide for themselves if the tax cut is a good gamble for the state or just accelerating the drop in oil revenue."

Will you notice an immediate effect? Not likely.

For the most part, the ramifications would kick in over months, not several days or weeks.

""By [April], government agencies will execute reduced work schedules and the budget crunch will become more acute,"" Sean West, U.S. policy director for the Eurasia Group, explained in a research note. ""The pain will pick up speed from there.""

Of course, anyone directly affected will feel the cuts right away. But the general public's awareness may be delayed and uneven. Different cuts will create different domino effects, according to longtime budget expert Stan Collender.

For instance, a government worker facing a furlough may think twice about buying a new car, whereas a federal contractor getting less business from Uncle Sam may not make new hires. Summer travelers may be surprised to face reduced hours at national parks or increased delays at airports.

The exact timeline of how the so-called sequester will unfold is still unclear. And lawmakers may eventually agree to replace the cuts. But here's what we know now.

(Related: Obama order triggers cuts)

Friday, March 1 - Sequester goes into effect: The White House budget office will issue an official sequestration order that cancels $85 billion in spending authority for the seven months remaining in the fiscal year. It will also submit a report to Congress detailing the level of cuts each agency must make to its programs, projects and activities.

March 1 and beyond - Federal workers put on notice; grants and contracts curtailed: So far at least one federal agency -- the National Labor Relations Board -- has already issued a formal 30-day furlough notice to employees. The Department of Justice says it plans to do so by Friday.

And the bulk of federal agencies planning furloughs will follow suit sometime thereafter.

Agencies will also cut back on issuing new contracts and reduce federal grants to everything from schools to airports to states.

March 26 and on - Furloughs take effect: Federal workers subject to furloughs will start working fewer days. That may be when the public first notices delays in federal services -- from making decisions about disability benefits to processing visas to providing airport security -- as well cutbacks in the hours of national parks.

When furloughed, employees are prohibited from working for a set number of days for which they will not be paid. The furloughs will vary from agency to agency.

The Pentagon, for instance, has said workers would be furloughed for one day a week up to 22 weeks starting in April. But the Department of Housing and Urban Development is planning on furloughs of just seven days: May 10, May 24, June 14, July 5, July 22, Aug. 16 and Aug. 30, according to a document obtained by CNNMoney. HUD offices nationwide would be closed on those seven days. And the IRS won't start furloughs until summer.

March 27 - Funding for the government expires: Congress must pass a new bill setting funding levels for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends Sept. 30. If they don't, the government would shut down all but essential services. This is one legislative vehicle that could contain a sequester fix.

April 1 - Medicare docs take a hit: Medicare payments to health care providers, health care plans and drug plans will be reduced by 2%.

April and May - Budget negotiations: If lawmakers haven't agreed to a sequester fix by this point, they may try to do so during their annual budget negotiations for the next fiscal year.

Mid-May to August - Debt ceiling negotiations: Congress will need to raise the country's debt limit. This could provide another legislative vehicle for a sequester fix, if one hasn't been put in place already.

August and September - Back to school, but not for some: Teachers and school staff affected by education-related cuts may be laid off for the 2013-14 school year.

Still unknown - Smaller unemployment checks: Everyone collecting federal extended unemployment benefits will see their checks cut by 9.4% retroactive to March 1. Just when they would start seeing smaller checks depends on how quickly their state unemployment office makes the change, which will vary from state to state. But chances are good many collecting benefits would see smaller checks sometime in March.

By Dec. 31 - Fewer jobs created: The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the economy would produce 750,000 fewer full-time jobs as a result of the forced spending cuts if they remain in effect for the whole calendar year.

In the Senate, Democrats were putting the finishing touches on a budget they plan to introduce on Wednesday, their first in four years, while House Republicans were preparing to introduce a spending plan of their own on Tuesday morning.

The two proposals, which would set spending targets for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, will be miles apart ideologically and difficult to merge. Democrats plan to rely heavily on closing tax loopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthy to produce new revenue, while Republicans will focus on slashing spending to balance the budget in 10 years.

But the fact that both houses of Congress are working on their budgets simultaneously after years of impasse raised some measure of hope — albeit slight — that Democrats and Republicans might be able to work out some sort of compromise."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/28/congress-austerity_n_4509179.html,2013-12-28 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Here Are All The Times Congress Screwed Americans This Year In The Name Of Austerity,"WASHINGTON -- As the year winds to a close, Congress is cautiously celebrating passing a year-end budget that relieves just about a third of the sequestration cuts. But those cuts, along with a slew of other fiscal measures enacted by Congress, amounted to a year of fiscal austerity that took money out of the economy, slowed GDP growth and cut the number of jobs that could have been created.

The tightening began on the first of the year, when the ""fiscal cliff"" deal passed both houses of Congress and was signed by President Barack Obama. While the deal did stop some sharp tax increases that would have put a real drag on economic growth, it allowed the payroll tax holiday to expire, meaning all workers got less money in their paychecks. Predictions made around the time the deal was crafted estimated it would shave between 0.4 and 0.6 percent off of GDP growth in 2013.

That deal delayed sequestration cuts for two months, and they began on March 1. The plan mandated $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts until Oct. 1. The cuts damaged the public defender system, stalled cancer research and cut scientific research. The cuts also hit programs for the most vulnerable, including Head Start and Meals on Wheels.

The economic effects of these policies are tangible. According to the most recent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, made in early 2013, sequestration was expected to cost around 750,000 jobs that would have been created or retained if not for the cuts. CBO also estimated that sequestration along with fiscal tightening would cost about 1 ¼ percentage points in growth from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013. The CBO also estimated that without sequestration, the economy would have been expected to grow faster in 2013 by about 0.6 of a percentage point.

Independent research firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimated in October that budget tightening had reduced annual GDP growth by 0.7 of a percentage point since 2010 and raised the unemployment rate by 0.8 percent.

Repealing the sequester would create economic dividends. Canceling sequestration would increase third quarter GDP in 2014 by 0.7 percent and increase payrolls by 0.9 million, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate from July. The budget deal signed by President Barack Obama this week replaces about a third of these draconian cuts that were scheduled -- eliminating $63 billion out of an estimated $180 billion in cuts in 2014 and 2015.

On Oct. 1, Congress did not pass an appropriations bill, and the government shut down for 17 days. During that time, more than 800,000 federal workers were furloughed without pay, and nonessential federal offices were closed.

Congress passed an appropriations bill funding the government at current levels on Oct. 17. Federal workers received back pay, and the government reopened. However, the shutdown had economic costs. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, it shaved off an estimated 0.25 percent of annualized GDP growth in the fourth quarter, or about $10 billion.

On Nov. 1, food stamp benefits were cut by $5 billion when legislation from 2010 that reallocated funding went into effect. The cut affected 47 million Americans, and reduced the maximum benefit from 11 to 36 dollars, depending on family size. With the cut came a jump in the need at soup kitchens and food banks.

The costs to the economy could be more than $5 billion -- Moody's Analytics has estimated that every additional dollar spent on food stamps generates about $1.74 in economic activity. JPMorgan Chase Chief Economist Michael Feroli estimated that the cuts could shave 0.1 of a percentage point off the annual growth rate of the nation's GDP in 2013.

Despite the cuts, the economy grew at a relatively fast pace of 4.1 percent in the third quarter of 2013, up from 1.1 and 2.5 percent in the quarters before. However, the growth rate may not reflect true economic activity. As Slate's Matt Yglesias points out, real gross domestic income -- an alternative measure for GDP measuring all incomes of an economy -- grew by a much lower 1.8 percent. Plus, with all of the cuts enacted by Congress, many Americans hardly feel like the economy is getting better. Moreover, the economy remained about 3.1 percent below its potential output in 2013, according to OECD, and about 5 million jobs short of full employment, according to CBO.

The cuts will continue into 2014. On Saturday, 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits, as Congress failed to extend the benefits before adjourning for the year. Federal benefits tend to kick in after state ones expire, which in most places is 26 weeks. Congress could reinstate the benefits retroactively once it returns at the beginning of next year, but recipients will at least face a lapse. The White House Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that not extending the benefits would cost 240,000 jobs in 2014. Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and JP Morgan have pegged the cost to GDP growth at 0.2 to 0.4 percent."
http://news.yahoo.com/senate-democrats-back-automatic-debt-limit-hikes-145832075--finance.html,,[],Senate Democrats back automatic debt limit hikes,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted along party lines Tuesday to reject a GOP effort that would have blocked the approved increase in the national debt limit.

The chamber voted 54-45 against the GOP move to try to use a special ""disapproval"" process to block that increase.

The move came as Senate Democrats proposed to avoid future showdowns over the so-called debt ceiling by giving the president authority to authorize additional federal borrowing unless Congress can muster veto-proof margins to block him.

The move by Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, is aimed at heading off future Washington confrontations over increasing the government's borrowing cap. Debt limit battles this fall and in 2011 spooked financial markets and took the government precariously close to a default on its obligations.

""It's time for us to put in place a straightforward process to avoid a catastrophic default on our nation's debt,"" Boxer said, adding that the legislation ""sends a strong message of certainty to the markets, to our families and to the world.""

The Democratic legislation is based on a proposal first unveiled by GOP Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky during the 2011 debt limit battle. But McConnell weighed in against the Democratic plan even before it was unveiled, saying debt increases must be paired with spending cuts or other reforms.

The recently-passed debt limit measure included the mechanism under which the president proposes a debt increase that takes effect automatically unless Congress approves legislation to overturn the move. He could veto that legislation, however.

""Increases in the debt ceiling should be accompanied by reforms,"" McConnell said. ""That's just what we did in 2011, when Congress raised the debt ceiling in return for enacting $2 trillion in bipartisan spending control.""

McConnell is positioned to filibuster the measure if Democrats try to force a vote and the measure is a non-starter with the GOP-controlled House."

""And then I told the president, 'Okay, we'll give you everything you want.' And he accepted our demand.""

With the passage of this bill today, it’s pretty clear that we’re sending a message to the Democrat-controlled Senate that it’s time to do your job. … The principal [note: in a statement this dumb, you'd think they'd at least spell ""principle"" correctly] I think is pretty simple: no budget, no pay. Listen, American families have to do a budget. They understand you can’t continue to spend money that you don’t have. We’re committed to doing a budget on the House side – a budget that will balance over the next 10 years. It’s time for the Senate and the president to show the American people how they’re willing to balance the budget over the next 10 years.

So House Republicans suspend the debt limit through May 19, giving President Obama authority to effectively raise the debt ceiling on his own, they do it with basically no meaningful strings attached, and they do it after having repeatedly pledged to never, ever raise the debt limit without cutting at least one dollar in spending for each dollar of debt limit increase. But despite having utterly capitulated, House Speaker John Boehner declared victory (although he apparently did so while trying to dodge the press ):Hold on, what? House Republicans just passed legislation raising the debt limit in essentially unlimited fashion ... and their post-vote messaging doesn't even mention the fact that they just raised the debt limit? Instead, they're talking about how they sent a message to the Senate about passing a budget resolution that is already mandated by the 1974 Budget Impoundment and Control Act.

It's not that I was expecting them to come out and hail the demise of the Boehner rule, but do they really think this nonsense is convincing spin? Apparently so:





@GOPLeader via web Interesting. For years, the economy struggled & the Senate never acted. It took one week with Senate pay on the line, for them to step up.

Hahaha, talk about living in a fantasy land. The idea that any single senator, let alone a majority of them, give a damn about the possibility of their paychecks getting delayed by a few months is hilarious. I mean, in 2010 the average net worth in the Senate was more than $13 million dollars, and yet House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is seriously trying to sell this idiotic talking point. What a joke.

You'd think House Republicans would be trying to repair the brand damage that their hostage taking bluff caused, but instead they pushing stupid rightwing Twitter derp. The explanation is obvious: they are scared to death of their own political base. They know their base is wrong, and they know if they did what their base wanted they would have no chance of winning a general election. If that wasn't the case, they wouldn't have caved on the debt limit. But they are nonetheless trembling in fear.

As a result, instead of taking part in a declaration of victory for common sense, they continue to spew nonsense. And it won't end anytime soon: to win over conservative House members, GOP leadership promised to deliver a balanced budget. This budget is going to make the Ryan budget look like a Christmas tree. As Greg Sargent reports, it will literally shred government to ribbons. There's no other way to balance the budget. Of course, the budget will be dead on arrival because Democrats will never support it. That's probably the one bit of good news here for Republicans: the one thing they don't have to fear is their ideas getting implemented into law."

The Office of Management and Budget issued orders shortly before the midnight deadline that “agencies should now execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations” because Congress had failed to act to keep the federal government financed.

After a series of rapid-fire back and forth legislative maneuvers, the House and Senate ended the day with no resolution, and the Senate halted business until later Tuesday while the House took steps to open talks.

In February Texas republican Governor Rick Perry made a trip to California. His supposed intent was to lure California businesses to Texas. The premise is that Texas is more business friendly than California. To be sure, Texas is a state that gives away over $19 Billion in taxpayer dollars even as it cuts basic and higher education. Instead of reinvesting its surplus in human capital, it is attempting to change the Texas constitution to return surplus dollars.

California has been seen as a basket case with regards to its exploding budget deficits. Interesting enough this was occurring during the administration of Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. He attributed the deficits to reduced tax revenues and overspending. He cut programs in draconian fashion but could never escape the reality that he was making the problem worse. Ultimately he did what both Reagan and Bush did, leave exploding deficits to their successors.

California now has a budget surplus. Depending on whose numbers one uses, it is anywhere from $1.2 billion according to the Governor or $4.4 billion according to the Legislature’s independent financial analyst. How did California do it and what should they do about the surplus?

Democrats President Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, and Governor Jerry Brown did not attempt an ideological game with blinders to the actual results. They tried basic arithmetic. They raised taxes. Interesting enough, the results were the same.

Bill Clinton got a balance budget with a surplus. Barrack Obama is seeing a budget deficit that is shrinking much faster than anyone expected and much faster than advised by economist for proven Keynesian economic reasons. Suffice it to say that the budget deficit hole left by two wars, two massive tax cuts, and a massive drug program on the credit card by the previous administration along with an irresponsible & intransigent Congress cannot be solved in two terms.

Jerry Brown remembered basic arithmetic as well as he brought California to a budget surplus. He raised taxes on the wealthy and cut programs (some more than he should). Does this sound familiar, the balanced approach? Time and time again the evidence is out there that it works and it improves the economy for all.

While Texas has a low unemployment rate comparatively, low regulations comparatively (effects?), low taxes comparatively, and tax dollar giveaways that are great for businesses in the short term, California must not attempt to remake its new found surpluses in Texas’ image. After all, rain in the desert makes for some of the most beautiful flora for a few weeks. We know exactly what happens after that. They dry up and die. The Texas flora may be flourishing as all the nutrients are being sucked out of the middle class. Twenty five percent of its people are without healthcare even as Governor Perry refuses to accept expanded Medicaid from Obamacare. Teachers’ wages are stagnant. Quality of public schools as measured by national tests is substandard and falling. Yet, the Texas governor wants to return surpluses.

The director of external affairs for the California Department of Finance, H. D. Palmer believes that a good deal of the surge in revenues are from a one time realization of capital games by wealthy individuals at the end of 2012 that is unlikely to reoccur. The Governor and many Democrats thus do not support significant increases in spending.

Some believe the governor simply want to leave a legacy of a budget solver and that inasmuch as the office of the independent legislative analyst believes there is a much bigger budget surplus, he is willing to err on the backs of the poor. Others believe because of the volatility of revenue gyration, much caution is needed. Speaker of the Assembly John A. Perez seem to have the most pragmatic solution. Put some of the revenues in a contingency fund and increase spending on scholarships to middle class students.

Maybe the reason back in February California companies did not bite on Governor Perry’s “sell Texas” tour is that inasmuch as they may love that the Governor of Texas is willing to pilfer the middle class to bring them to Texas, they know a pilfered middle class does not make the best workforce. California spending its surplus not on tax cuts, or abusive business incentives but instead on human capital in the form of education and improved healthcare is a sustainable long term solution.

California has a lot more work to do. A budget surplus is not enough. Policy that taxes appropriately and the wise investment of those dollars is of utmost importance. The governor must be commended for a job well done and the necessary caution in the use of his good fortune.

Before Becoming An Editor', 'She Was A Reporter Covering U.S. Economic Policy']",Obama ‘will not oppose’ House GOP plan to suspend debt limit until May,"Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the day on which the White House and Club for Growth issued their statements.

House Republicans are advancing a novel plan to suspend enforcement of the federal debt limit through May 18, a move that would lift the threat of a government default and relieve the air of crisis that has surrounded their budget battle with President Obama.

The measure — set for a vote Wednesday in the House — would not resolve the dispute over how to control the national debt. But after the traumatic “fiscal cliff” episode at the end of last year, it would buy policymakers a little breathing room to continue the argument without another economy-rattling deadline just around the corner.

The White House tacitly endorsed the proposal Tuesday, issuing a statement that said Obama “would not oppose” the temporary respite. The president has called for a long-term extension of the Treasury Department’s borrowing authority, which he argues would “increase certainty and economic stability.”

But, White House press secretary Jay Carney said, “clearly, we support extension of the debt ceiling without drama or delay.”

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) also welcomed the proposal. “I’m glad,” he told reporters, “we’re not facing crisis here in the matter of a few days.”

President Obama said on Jan. 14 in a White House press conference that he won’t negotiate with Republicans on the federal debt ceiling. Post economic policy reporter Zachary Goldfarb explains which bills the government will and will not pay if the debt ceiling isn’t raised. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Under the proposal, the legal limit on government borrowing — now set at $16.4 trillion — would remain intact, but its enforcement would be suspended until May 18. In the meantime, the Treasury could continue borrowing to cover the cost of Social Security checks, the military payroll, interest payments to the nation’s creditors, and other obligations.

The approach — unprecedented since World War II — would let Republicans avoid a debt-ceiling fight, which could be politically and economically damaging, without endorsing a higher limit.

On May 19, the debt limit would automatically be reset at a higher level that reflected the additional borrowing. Treasury officials could then begin taking what they call “extraordinary measures” to continue paying the nation’s bills, probably pushing the new default deadline into late July or early August, independent analysts said.

Without congressional action, the Treasury predicts that it would run out of money to pay the nation’s bills by early March. That would lead to the U.S. government’s first default, which, economists say, would invite a new recession, damage American credibility abroad and potentially destabilize world financial markets.

If Congress approves the GOP measure, lawmakers would still face other painful deadlines, including the imposition of sharp automatic cuts in government spending on March 1 and a potential government shutdown on March 27.

Missing either of those deadlines would hurt U.S. economic growth, but neither would have the calamitous effects of a government default, said Joel Prakken, chairman of the independent forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers.

“The world’s a little safer with that debt ceiling pushed off for six months or so,” he said.

The government came perilously close to default in the summer of 2011, when Republicans gained control of the House and used the debt limit to force Obama to approve more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. Burned by the president’s successful campaign to raise taxes on the wealthy during the recent fiscal-cliff negotiations, some Republicans were threatening to once again use the debt limit to extract new concessions on spending.

But last week, under pressure from business leaders and some prominent Republicans, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) announced that he was developing a plan to postpone a new debt-limit clash. In exchange, he demanded that Senate Democrats revive the traditional budget process, which they have neglected for nearly four years.

The GOP proposal calls for the Democratic-controlled Senate to adopt a budget by April 15 or have senators’ paychecks held in escrow until this session of Congress ends in early 2015.

Late Tuesday, House leaders sought to build support for the measure in a closed-door meeting with their rank and file, repeatedly offering the rallying cry, “No budget, no pay.”

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), the conference chairman, played a series of television news clips about GOP pressure on the Senate, telling the often fractious caucus that the new strategy already shifted attention to the Senate’s inability to perform one of its most fundamental duties.

Boehner told reporters after the meeting: “We’ve done our budgets, but it’s been nearly four years since the Senate has done a budget. Most Americans believe you don’t do your job, you shouldn’t get paid.”

Meanwhile, he assured wary conservative Republicans that he would hold firm against any attempt to undo the automatic spending cuts without “cuts and reforms to replace it,” according to a source in the room.

And he vowed that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Wis.), the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, would draft a new budget blueprint that would wipe out deficits “within a decade.” The austere budgets Ryan offered in years past took nearly 30 years to balance.

“It’s time for us to come to a plan that will in fact balance the budget over the next 10 years,” Boehner told reporters afterward. “It’s our commitment to the American people.”

After the meeting, lawmakers offered broad enthusiasm for the new strategy. A smattering expressed opposition, suggesting that the measure’s passage may not be assured.

But even Rep. Raul R. Labrador (R-Idaho), a hard-line conservative who often bucks House leaders, said the promise of a balanced budget allayed his concerns about agreeing to extend the debt limit for a few months.

Now, Republican leaders “actually have an agenda,” Labrador said. “The agenda is to get to balance in 10 years, to have a balanced budget.”

Balancing the budget over the next decade, however, is likely to require extraordinarily deep cuts in spending that go even further than reductions in previous House budgets. In the past, Ryan has targeted spending on health care for the poor and other social safety net programs, such as food stamps and aid for college tuition.

On Monday, Obama vowed in his Inauguration Day speech to defend those programs.

Instead, senior Democrats say they want to revive the budget process to clear a path for raising additional tax revenue from corporations and the wealthy. Although Congress agreed earlier this month to raise tax rates on income over $450,000 a year, that measure will generate only about $600 billion over the next decade, just over a third of Obama’s $1.6 trillion target for new tax revenue.

Even as they moved toward an agreement to temporarily resolve the problem of the debt limit, lawmakers have offered no new ideas for bridging the vast ideological chasm on taxes and spending.

Associated Press

Regulators on Tuesday approved a temporary price hike of 3 cents for a first-class stamp

The higher rate will last no more than two years

Forever stamps can be purchased at the lower price until the new rate is effective Jan. 26

WASHINGTON (AP) — Mailing a letter is about to get a little more expensive.

Regulators on Tuesday approved a temporary price hike of 3 cents for a first-class stamp, bringing the charge to 49 cents a letter in an effort to help the Postal Service recover from severe mail decreases brought on by the 2008 economic downturn.

Many consumers won't feel the price increase immediately. Forever stamps, good for first-class postage whatever the future rate, can be purchased at the lower price until the new rate is effective Jan. 26.

The higher rate will last no more than two years, allowing the Postal Service to recoup $2.8 billion in losses. By a 2-1 vote, the independent Postal Regulatory Commission rejected a request to make the price hike permanent, though inflation over the next 24 months may make it so.

The surcharge ""will last just long enough to recover the loss,"" Commission Chairman Ruth Y. Goldway said.

Bulk mail, periodicals and package service rates will rise 6 percent, a decision that drew immediate consternation from the mail industry. Its groups have opposed any price increase beyond the current 1.7 percent rate of inflation, saying charities using mass mailings and bookstores competing with online retailer Amazon would be among those who suffer. Greeting card companies also have criticized the plans.

""This is a counterproductive decision,"" said Mary G. Berner, president of the Association of Magazine Media. ""It will drive more customers away from using the Postal Service and will have ripple effects through our economy — hurting consumers, forcing layoffs and impacting businesses.""

Berner said her organization will consider appealing the decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals.

For consumers who have cut back on their use of mail for correspondence, the rate increase may have little impact on their pocketbooks.

""I don't know a whole lot of people who truly, with the exception of packages, really use snail mail anymore,"" said Kristin Johnson, a Green Bay, Wis., resident who was shopping in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, while visiting relatives and friends. ""It's just so rare that I actually mail anything at this point.""

The Postal Service is an independent agency that does not depend on tax money for its operations but is subject to congressional control. Under federal law, it can't raise prices more than the rate of inflation without approval from the commission.

The service says it lost $5 billion in the last fiscal year and has been trying to get Congress to pass legislation to help with its financial woes, including an end to Saturday mail delivery and reduced payments on retiree health benefits.

The figures through Sept. 30 were actually an improvement for the agency from a $15.9 billion loss in 2012.

The post office has struggled for years with declining mail volume as a result of growing Internet use and a 2006 congressional requirement that it make annual $5.6 billion payments to cover expected health care costs for future retirees. It has defaulted on three of those payments.

The regulators Tuesday stopped short of making the price increases permanent, saying the Postal Service had conflated losses it suffered as a result of Internet competition with business lost because of the Great Recession. They ordered the agency to develop a plan to phase out the higher rates once the lost revenue is recouped.

It's unclear where that would take rates for first-class postage in 2016. The regular, inflation-adjusted price would have been 47 cents next year. If inflation rates average 2 percent over the next two years, regulators could deem 49 cents an acceptable price going forward.

The Postal Service has only twice lowered the price of a stamp: in the mid-19th century from 3 cents to 2 cents, and again after the end of World War I. In neither case was the higher price the result of a temporary authorization.

The new price of a postcard stamp, raised by a penny to 34 cents in November, also is effective next month.

The last price increase for stamps was in January, when the cost of sending a letter rose by a penny to 46 cents. A post card also increased by one cent to 33 cents."

As chief executive of a small Michigan military contractor, Nanocerox, he had already cut his work force by one-third. But it was not enough. And if the government spending cuts mandated by Congress continue, he said, more people will go in the coming months.

The squeeze Mr. Kelly is facing is one reason markets are jittery about what the Labor Department’s latest report on unemployment and job creation will reveal about the economy on Friday. After a strong start to the year, several economic indicators beginning in March have pointed to much slower growth, largely because of the fiscal headwinds from Washington, economists say.

Job cuts like the kind at Nanocerox remain the exception, rather than the rule. On Thursday, the government said weekly unemployment claims were at a five-year low.

The problem is that companies have not been hiring. This week, a survey of private sector hiring in April came in well below expectations, while indications for everything from retail sales to manufacturing have also been soft recently."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/24/lawmaker-unemployment-hearing_n_3148362.html,2013-04-24 00:00:00,"['Former Washington Bureau Chief', 'Senior Politics Editor', 'Senior Reporter', 'Reporter']",Lawmaker Unemployment Hearing Attended By Single Member of Congress At Opening,"WASHINGTON -- More than five years since the start of the Great Recession, unemployment remains a major economic problem in the United States, with long-term unemployment among its most stubborn aspects.

Nobody told Congress.

A hearing Thursday on long-term unemployment held before the 19-member Joint Economic Committee began with just a single lawmaker in attendance. Panelists testifying on the problem and its potential solutions spoke only to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the committee's vice-chair, for the beginning of the roughly 90-minute session.

The all-but-complete absence of congressional interest was first documented by National Journal reporter Niraj Chokshi, who tweeted a photo of the hearing. Shortly after the photo was posted, several other lawmakers did trickle in to participate. Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.) arrived eight minutes into the hearing. Once the hearing had been under way for 35 minutes, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) was also in attendance, according to Chokshi. Eventually Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) also joined, bringing the crowd to four.

More than 4.6 million Americans have been jobless for at least 27 weeks, according to the latest job figures, a rate of 3.0 percent. That's higher than at any point since World War II, including the 2.6-percent peak during the recession of the early 1980s. The official unemployment rate currently stands at 7.6 percent, down from 10.0 percent at the recession's darkest moments, although much of the reduction has been due to people leaving the workforce -- simply giving up hope of finding a job.

Jobs advocates have continually chastised Congress for focusing on the federal budget deficit instead of the shortage of employment in the U.S., which still features more than four job seekers for every open position in the country.

Senators who did not attend the hearing included Sens. Robert Casey (D-Pa.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Reps. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), John Campbell (R-Calif.), Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.), Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) also did not attend.

The Joint Economic Committee is one of only a handful of congressional panels that features members of both the House and Senate. Its hearings are thinly attended at times, but the contrast between Thursday's hearing and a March 14 hearing on ""Solving The Federal Debt Crisis"" is revealing. That hearing on debt opened with five members of Congress in attendance, including three Democrats and two Republicans. Over the course of the nearly two-hour session, several other members of the committee filed in.

Kevin Hassett, the author of Dow 36,000, which predicted a fantastic rise in equities before two subsequent crashes, said he wasn't surprised. ""There are often moments like that at hearings. Very few are ever heavily attended. People came in late, after the picture, I suppose,"" he told HuffPost.

At the hearing, Klobuchar presented a study indicating that long-term unemployment is disproportionately affecting young workers, black and Hispanic workers, and workers with lower levels of education. The study is in keeping with other work that shows the economic recovery has been far better for some groups than others. The wealthiest 1 percent of households have received 106 percent of the gains since the recession bottomed out.

Dr. Harry J. Holzer, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, said by the time he testified at about 11 a.m., two senators -- Klobuchar and Murphy -- were in the room. ""There were people in the audience,"" he said, noting that Klobuchar sounded motivated on the subject. ""That can make it worth it,"" he added. ""If one senator sponsors a bill with some of your information, that's a pretty big reward for your effort.""

Holzer testified about the various hardships that the long-term unemployed faced and the differences between older unemployed citizens and younger unemployed citizens. He proposed wage insurance for people who transition from manufacturing jobs to jobs with lesser pay, having the federal government pitch in to make up the difference. Holzer said he has testified before Congress 15 times over the years, and there is always a risk of a low turnout.

Keith Hall, a senior research scholar at the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center, is a former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner who testified at the hearing. ""It's disappointing, I have to say,"" he told HuffPost about the attendance. ""It is a little bit disappointing, because you'd really like to see a more engaged discussion, and it would be nice to see that both sides were there and both sides were talking.""

Hall said that attendance was low probably because Congress isn't doing anything about long-term unemployment. With no bills to choose from, there's little value in becoming educated on the issue. The lack of interest may also be a consequence of the slow start to the year for the House of Representatives, which held just one markup session legislation on any topic in the first eight weeks of 2013.

""They're talking about the problem and they're looking for solutions, but there's really no hard proposal on the table,"" said Hall, ""so while this is informative and helpful, they're not dealing with some proposal where they're close to working on something.""

Congress is a long way off, Hall said. ""I think it's good this is hitting their radar screen, but there's a lot of work to go to get the economy back in shape and get the long-term unemployed back in shape, and they need more than just a hearing a two,"" he said.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this article indicated that Sen. Klobuchar had been alone for the first half hour of the session. She was joined by Sen. Murphy after 8 minutes alone."

A marathon session Saturday failed to produce an agreement, with some of those involved saying the two sides were far apart on some issues.

According to KCBS radio, neither side has provided any media updates Sunday, with just hours to go before the planned walkout.

The unions insist they don’t want to strike.

“Our team is giving it our best shot. We really do not want to disrupt service Monday,” president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555 told the Associated Press. “We want a deal. We will do whatever it takes.”

Unions representing the majority of Bay Area Rapid Transit workers issued a 72-hour notice of intent to strike late Thursday.

BART trains carry an estimated 400,000 passengers each day, and emergency measures such as additional bus and ferry service and increased reliance on casual carpooling did little to cut the sting of a 4 1/2-day strike that severely hampered the region in early July.

With a line of local and regional officials behind him, California Labor Secretary Marty Morgenstern joined San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee in his City Hall office Friday morning to call for an end to the uncertainty.

Lee said that over the last month he had spoken to numerous workers at hotels, coffee shops and restaurants, as well as to owners of small businesses, all of whom conveyed the suffering another strike would cause them.

“I couldn’t even get a burrito without confronting someone who asked that we take our stand on behalf of the public,” Lee told reporters. “We need an agreement and not a strike in our public transit system. The public ridership … need a voice at this table.”

Lee said a strike would hit lower-income families hardest — those trying to get to more than one job who cannot afford the cost of high-priced parking garages. He wanted, he said, “to put a face on the ridership … we need an agreement.”

Mediators from the state and federal government have been at the table, but the past month has produced little more than acrimony between the two largest worker unions and BART management.

After making a series of concessions in a down economy in recent years, Service Employees International Union Local 1021 and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555 have pressed for raises that exceed 20% over three years.

BART management has countered with a proposed 8% raise over four years. But the agency also has asked workers, who earn a median salary of about $80,000, to contribute to their pensions. BART employees currently pay nothing into the pension system. Workers also are being asked to increase their healthcare contribution from the current flat rate of $92 per month.

Union leaders have lambasted management for being at the table for only about half of the last four weeks because of vacations.

Postal Service proposed delivering only packages on Saturday%2C starting Aug. 5

Congress barred the service from changing its delivery schedule

Postal Service says limiting Saturday delivery is a critical part of a 5-year-plan to make the service solvent

The nation will continue to get its Saturday mail through at least Sept. 30, the U.S. Postal Service said Wednesday.

The Postal Service backed down from its plan to cut mail delivery starting this summer from six days a week to five, saying Congress had prohibited such a move.

A measure passed by Congress last month to fund government operations while the budget remains in limbo included language that barred changing the delivery schedule, the Postal Service board of governors said in a written statement Wednesday.

The Postal Service had proposed delivering only packages on Saturdays. The new schedule was to begin Aug. 5.

The board said it was ""disappointed"" with the move by Congress but would follow the law. The board directed the Postal Service to delay the start of its new delivery schedule while it seeks authority from Congress to make the change.

""The board believes that Congress has left it with no choice but to delay,"" the statement said.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which oversees the Postal Service, called the decision a disappointing setback. Polls show Americans support a pared-down schedule, he said.

""This reversal significantly undercuts the credibility of postal officials who have told Congress that they were prepared to defy political pressure and make difficult but necessary cuts,"" Issa said in a written statement. ""It's quite clear that special-interest lobbying and intense political pressure played a much greater role in the Postal Service's change of heart than any real or perceived barrier to implementing what had been announced.""

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the Postal Service must abide by the law, but Congress should pass legislation to allow it to revamp services and become profitable. Cummings introduced a bill last year that would give the Postal Service more flexibility to change its business model, but the House did not take up the measure.

Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe had said eliminating Saturday mail delivery would save the Postal Service $2 billion a year and is a critical part of a five-year-plan to make the service solvent. He has said he would buck any Capitol Hill efforts to dismantle the plan.

The agency said it lost almost $16 billion last year, due in part to a 2006 congressional mandate requiring it to prepay 75 years worth of retiree benefits within a decade.

Last month, however, a resolution passed by Congress to fund the government through September required six-day Postal Service delivery for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30."

We’re open with each other. We’re honest with each other,” said Boehner.

“Do you trust President Obama?” Raddatz asked.

“Absolutely,” Boehner replied.

“Absolutely?” Raddatz emphasized.

“Absolutely,” Boehner repeated.

Framing Republicans as out-of-touch radicals, Raddatz then asked, “President Obama says these meetings are intended to find members of the common-sense caucus who he can make a deal with …. Are you not a member of the common-sense caucus?”

Boehner, falling for the trap, shot back, “I’m part of the common-sense caucus. We appreciate the outreach. We appreciate the engagement from the president. But it’s gonna take more than this if we’re serious about solving our problems.”

Then Boehner dropped the bombshell. Raddatz, after quoting President Obama saying we don’t have “an immediate crisis in terms of debt,” asked Boehner for his thoughts. And Boehner eagerly agreed: “We do not have an immediate debt crisis. But we all know that we have one looming …. It could be a year or two years, three years, four years. It’s not an immediate problem.” And then Boehner said he agreed with Obama on the immediacy of the problem.

With Republicans fighting tooth and nail to implement solutions necessary to reducing the national debt, Boehner’s language certainly undermines the public relations narrative set by conservatives. A House GOP aide angrily told Breitbart News today, “This undercuts the fight House conservatives have waged since 2010. Our efforts to prevent a debt crisis we will certainly face should never be minimized.”

For Representative Austin Scott, an ardent conservative Republican from Georgia, it’s Ken’s Trading Company, where the profit margin on a Leupold rifle scope is lower than the sales tax too many Georgians are avoiding by shopping for the same scope on their computers.

“We respect their opinion. I’m glad they’re there as conservatives,” Mr. Scott said of the antitax groups. “But the fact of matter is, in the end we have a job to do.”

For opponents of the bill, the impotence of the antitax arguments has been a revelation.

“I don’t think any one group drives an issue. It’s the issue itself,” said Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, whose state is one of five with no sales taxes. “What does surprise me, put aside the groups for a minute, is that there are people who describe themselves as conservatives who are going to support this act, when regardless of how you look at it, whether your state has a sales tax or not, it’s going to put some fairly rigorous and onerous requirements on online businesses to collect taxes for other states. That’s counter to conservative principles.”

The Internet sales tax is not the first battle such groups have lost, but it might be one of the clearest. In 2010, just before all of the Bush-era tax cuts were first set to expire, President Obama and Senate Republican negotiators reached agreement to extend all of the tax cuts for two years, except one.

The estate tax had actually expired. Rather than have it reborn at the relatively high top rate of Bill Clinton’s era, negotiators allowed it to come back at a considerably lower rate. It was still a tax increase from zero, but not as big as it could have been. Mr. Norquist blessed it.

He took his argument even further this year when all those tax cuts expired again. This time, Mr. Obama insisted that tax rates rise considerably on upper-income families’ wages, estates, capital gains and dividends. Almost all Republicans saw that as a tax increase, and a big one, but Mr. Norquist — seeing that passage was inevitable — again declared that the deal did not violate his group’s no-new-taxes pledge since letting all the tax cuts expire would be worse."

Christie says National Flood Insurance Program has been too slow in resolving claims from Sandy

New Jersey lost 346%2C000 housing units to the storm

The state and charities are waiting for federal settlements to know how much to award in grants

UNION BEACH, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday the National Flood Insurance Program's handling of claims in New Jersey has been ""a disgrace,"" complaining that the program has been far too slow to resolve claims from Superstorm Sandy, with 70% of cases unresolved three months after the disaster.

The Republican governor said excessive paperwork, inadequate staffing, cumbersome audits and the threat of financial penalties to carriers and adjusters is interfering with the issuance of payments and prolonging the suffering of the thousands of New Jerseyans hurt by Sandy.

""I've been as patient as I'm going to be with the National Flood Insurance Program,"" Christie said. ""They need to get more people into New Jersey. They need to get to work. They need to get to processing these things. People need to know how much money they're going to have.""

Sandy damaged or destroyed about 346,000 housing units in New Jersey, resulting in estimated damage and storm-mitigation costs of $37 billion.

The state and charities are waiting for the federal settlements so they can know how much to award in grants to help people rebuild, Christie said during a briefing in the heavily damaged Jersey Shore community of Union Beach.

Christie said he is asking New Jersey's congressional delegation to pressure the Federal Emergency Management Agency to improve the performance of the flood insurance program. A FEMA spokesman said he had no immediate comment.

The governor complained that only about 30% of flood claims have been settled, or closed, compared with nearly 80% of the more than 430,000 other insurance claims filed by residents and businesses.

He said ""it is imperative that insurance claims be brought to final resolution so that residents can make critical decisions on if and how to rebuild.""

Christie also announced that the state Department of Banking and Insurance will start requiring private insurers to respond within five days to Sandy-related complaints filed with state. Insurance companies currently have 15 business days to respond to the department."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-signs-order-federal-worker-pay-raises-2014-004135276.html,,[],Obama signs order for federal worker pay raises in 2014,"By Ros Krasny HONOLULU (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, as signaled earlier in the year, signed an executive order on Monday setting federal civilian and military pay rates for 2014, and including the first raise for civilian workers in four years. Military and civilian employees will get a 1 percent raise in the new year, consistent with the level laid out in Obama's earlier budget proposal. The order had to be signed before January 1 to allow federal agencies to update their pay systems for the new year. Congress could have declined to authorize the increases on at least two occasions in recent months, including when lawmakers passed a two-year budget agreement earlier this month, but chose not to intervene. Federal civilian workers have had their pay frozen for three years. Military employees have received a salary increase each year that Obama has been in office, the White House said. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic Whip in the House of Representatives, praised the move as a ""modest but important step"" against the background of an improving economy. Revised figures last week showed economic growth in the United States was an annualized 4.1 percent in the third quarter, the strongest since the final three months of 2011. ""In the case of federal civilian employees ... given that these hardworking public servants have already contributed nearly $114 billion toward deficit reduction and some were furloughed as a result of the shutdown and the sequester, it is long overdue,"" Hoyer said. Employee unions have praised the increase as a small first step toward relief for the mostly middle-class workers on the federal payroll. Still, those workers continue to lose ground in real terms. The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 1.2 percent for the 12 months ended November 2013. For calendar 2012 the rate was 2.1 percent.

ABC News White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl questioned Press Secretary Jay Carney on Obama’s sequester predictions:

KARL: Jay, even before we heard from Secretary LaHood, we’ve heard some dire warnings coming from the administration. Just to tick through a few, we’ve heard about more wildfires, more workplace deaths, higher risk of terrorism, criminals set free. Is there any exaggeration going on here?



MR. CARNEY: I think all of those things come from reduced numbers of people fighting fires, reduced numbers of people doing inspections of our food, reduced numbers of people engaging in air traffic control. I mean, those are just the facts, Jon.



KARL: No other way to squeeze 3 percent out of the federal budget?



MR. CARNEY: I think we had this colloquy yesterday. The fact of the matter is that you are talking about a 13 percent cut in our defense budget and 9 percent cut in our nondefense discretionary budget this year. And there is no way to do that, based on the way the law is written, without having hugely negative impacts on individuals and families. Furloughs would have to happen. Layoffs would have to happen. That is a fact. And it’s not just us saying this. You don’t believe us, maybe you believe the CBO. Maybe you believe Macroeconomics Advisers or Moody’s. They have projected fully a half a percentage point reduction in GDP growth. And you know, because you cover this stuff, what that means economically. They have projected three-quarters of a million people will lose their jobs if the sequester takes effect and stays in effect.



Those are real-world consequences. These are real people. It’s not political leverage. It’s a fact. And we’re out there making clear that this is an important issue to deal with because of the real-world implications. The reason why the President continues to put forward and we made clear again on paper what we have been making clear all along, the President’s very reasonable offer remains on the table because he wants to avoid this.



Let’s just, again, go back to my basic point. It is not an easy sell to Democrats to go along as part of a big deal with superlative CPI. It is not an easy argument necessarily to get Democrats to go along with the reforms that the President has put in place in his proposal on entitlement reforms or with the spending cuts. It was not easy to sign into law $1.1 trillion in spending cuts. But he has done it, and Democrats have done it. And what we haven’t seen from Republicans is anything equivalent. And we’re just looking for a negotiating partner here. We’re just looking for somebody to meet us halfway."
http://news.yahoo.com/debt-ceiling-senate-vote-172019220.html,,[],Senate could vote this week to raise the debt ceiling,"Senate Democrats are considering holding a vote on a bill to increase the federal debt limit as early as this week, senior Senate Democratic leadership aides told Yahoo News.

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s plan, as first reported by Greg Sargent of the Washington Post, would give Senate lawmakers an opportunity to vote on a “clean” increase of the debt limit — one with no extra amendments attached.



President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders have called for a “clean” debt ceiling increase, but congressional Republicans say they will insist upon broad budget reforms as part of an agreement to raise the limit.

The Treasury Department estimates that the federal government will run out of money by Oct. 17, barring congressional action to increase the nation’s borrowing limit. Not doing so could cause the government to default on the interest of its $16.7 trillion debt, which economists predict would be disastrous for the economy.

Senate Democratic leaders are confident they have the votes to pass a debt limit increase, so long as Republicans allow it to pass by a majority vote. Senate Republicans could filibuster, which would require a 60-vote threshold to overcome. An aide to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democratic vote counter in the Senate, told Yahoo News that a clean bill would receive support from all 54 Senate Democrats, meaning six Republicans would need to join them to overcome a GOP filibuster.

Because of the dire economic consequences of not raising the debt limit, holding a vote now could put Republicans in a tough position and give Democrats fodder to blame the GOP if there is a default.



Even if it passes the Senate, the debt limit bill could result in the same kind of standoff between the Democrat-controlled upper chamber and the Republican-majority House currently happening over funding the government. In an interview with ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Republican House Speaker John Boehner said there aren’t enough votes in the House to approve a clean bill.

The debate over the debt limit comes while tensions are already high in the nation's capital one week into a federal government shutdown that has left more than 800,000 federal workers furloughed and many government services out of commission."

And by 94, the cumulative loss would be more than $8,300, according to the center’s calculations. But if she lived until 95, she would get the privilege of the second increase, also equivalent to 5 percent of the average benefit check. Her monthly check would climb back to the levels under the current law if she lived until 104, but by then, she would have lost about $10,200 in total income.

Of course, since the bump-up is a flat amount, some people with lower benefits might receive a bigger increase than they would under the current system, a senior administration official from the White House explained. Conversely, the bump-up offsets a smaller portion of the cut when benefits are higher.

This is not a popular move. According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, 51 percent of respondents opposed changing the way Social Security benefits are calculated so that benefits increase at a slower rate, while 37 percent supported such a change (11 percent had no opinion). The survey said there were no partisan differences, but among people 65 and older opposition was 64 percent.

The “three-legged stool” of retirement — that is, pensions, savings and Social Security — has already become more of a lopsided two-legged stool, because pensions have been waning for years. And the Social Security leg is providing most of the support for many retirees: about 43 percent of single people and 22 percent of married couples rely on the benefits for more than 90 percent of their income, the Social Security Administration says. More than half of couples and 73 percent of singles draw more than half their income from the program.

The new measure of inflation would alter the way their benefits increase. Right now, Social Security is pegged to the C.P.I.-W, which tracks the typical purchases of a sample of urban wage and clerical workers, but does not include retirees. (Social Security uses this index because it was the only one that existed when the benefits were first adjusted for inflation.) The chained C.P.I.-U includes some retirees.

The chained C.P.I. would more broadly account for how people change their buying habits when prices rise, substituting cheaper items for more expensive ones. When the price of Porterhouse steak increases, the current index considers that a consumer can switch to a cheaper cut, as explained in an AARP paper. But the chained index would account for substitution between category types. So instead of buying cheaper beef, the consumer might switch to chicken.

But critics argue that the elderly and disabled do not have the ability to substitute as much as other consumers. “When so much of their budget goes toward health care expenses,” said Cristina Martin Firvida, director of financial security at AARP, “you are not going to choose to replace a hip treatment with another treatment just because it is cheaper. There is a limit for substitution with older people. We already account for a great deal of it in the current calculation.”"

http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-promises-veto-gop-124006328.html,,[],White House promises veto of GOP spending plan,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House stepped in Monday with a veto threat against a House GOP plan to advance a round of 2014 spending bills that would ease sequester-imposed cuts on the Pentagon while forcing even deeper cuts on non-defense programs.

Those cuts would come in areas like education, energy and water development and foreign aid.

In a statement, the White House budget office said the cuts called for in the GOP plan would force thousands of poor children off of Head Start, harm special education, cut federal law enforcement and dent medical research grants to thousands of scientists. It called on the Democratic Senate and GOP House to reach a broader agreement on the budget before advancing spending bills.

The veto promise comes as the House is set this week to consider the first of 12 spending bills for the budget year beginning Oct. 1. The first measure totals $73 billion and awards a 3.5 percent increase for veterans programs while cutting construction costs at military bases. The House is also slated to debate and pass a $39 billion measure this week boosting the Homeland Security Department's budget by almost $1 billion compared with current levels.

Democrats and the White House don't have a problem with the substance of the first two bills. Rather they oppose the overall level of funding set by Republicans for the day-to-day operations of federal agencies.

The statement promised a veto of every spending bill until Washington reaches a bargain on ""an overall budget framework that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future.""

At issue is the almost $1 trillion portion of the $3.6 trillion federal budget that must be approved by Congress each year. This so-called discretionary spending has been cut sharply with the imposition in March of across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. The Pentagon is absorbing cuts of 7 percent this year and domestic discretionary programs are bearing a 5 percent cut from last year's levels.

Story continues

Hopes are fading for a budget bargain that would replace the cuts, which leaves lawmakers stuck with even bigger cuts for the upcoming year. Appropriated funding for the ongoing budget year totals $984 billion; the House measures total $967 billion, an almost 2 percent cut below already austere current spending.

Under a 2011 budget deal, the panel was supposed to receive almost $1.06 trillion for the 12 appropriations bills; the House panel is instead stuck with $967 billion under the across-the-board cuts imposed because Congress and President Barack Obama were unable to follow up the 2011 deal with further deficit cuts. The Democratic figures are $91 billion higher, a 9 percent increase from current levels.

Obama and Senate Democrats support advancing the annual spending bills at the higher levels called for under the hard-fought 2011 bargain, replacing the cuts with a mixture of tax increases and spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. But conservatives controlling the House insist that the spending bills be written at the post-sequestration cap of $967 billion.

The GOP plan opposed by Obama restores cuts to the military while making cuts to domestic programs favored by Democrats even deeper. The deepest cuts — almost 20 percent — would come from a huge domestic spending bill that funds aid to local school districts, health research and enforcement of labor laws. Cuts to housing, foreign aid, transportation and community development grants would be severe, though a popular program that provides food aid to pregnant women and their babies is likely to emerge intact.

Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Ky., appears to be embarking on a strategy to advance a handful of the annual spending bills by funding them at levels closer to Obama's budget than the tea party budget that passed the House in March. GOP conservatives have balked at such moves in the past, saying they're a trick aimed at boosting spending, but some Democrats were willing to give Rogers the benefit of the doubt by voting for the veterans and homeland security measures during Appropriations Committee consideration last month.

Neither the House nor the Senate are likely to have much luck in advancing the measures very far unless a broader deal is made."

Rove said liberal organizations had first exploited the loophole, which has garnered attention in the wake of news the IRS scrutinized applications for tax-exempt status from small tea party groups.

""501(c)4s have been around for a long time and the Democrats and the left have used these for years to do some politics and a lot of social welfare,"" Rove said on ""Fox News Sunday,"" listing the NAACP, the Sierra Club and Planned Parenthood as groups that serve a social welfare function and still engage in political activity. ""You have to spend a majority of your money on social welfare and a minority of your resources on political activity.""

Rove, a career political strategist, raised hundreds of millions of dollars during the 2012 election and spent them on political advertisements designed to influence the presidential and congressional races. Rove's Crossroads GPS is one of hundreds of essentially political organizations that receive tax-exempt status designed for ""social welfare"" groups.

While many have called for reforms to the law allowing such groups to receive tax breaks, Rove insisted that the exemption is justified, and that organizations that support the Democratic Party have been working the statute longer.

""What happened is the Democrats had this for decades, for literally decades, and no criticism at all. Then Republicans began in 2010 to say, wait a minute, if it's good enough for them, we'll duplicate that structure as well. Then suddenly we get what we get, which is a huge bunch of activity aimed at conservative groups.""

The Bush administration probed the NAACP's tax-exempt status between 2004 and 2006, and ultimately allowed the group to maintain its classification.

Rove's organizations do not provide the counseling, legal assistance and other support functions that the NAACP provides on civil rights.

Federal agencies frequently target smaller players who may be abusing the system to avoid lengthy legal battles with more prominent companies or organizations. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) on Sunday criticized the IRS for targeting small Tea Party groups while allowing bigger fish, like Rove's Crossroads GPS, to pass through with little scrutiny.



""It's outrageous that the IRS went after these small tea party groups when Karl Rove is out there saying that he wants to use these groups to change the outcome of the election,"" Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said on ABC's ""This Week."""

Possible Deal on Government Shutdown, Debt Ceiling; Muslims Gather in Mecca for Hajj

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Two weeks since the start of a partial government shutdown, two days before a deadline for the U.S. debt ceiling. Some political leaders say they are closer on a deal. Yesterday, one possibility was offered by Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. It would set aside funds to end the shutdown, increase the debt ceiling and address parts of the Affordable Care Act - Obamacare. That`s been one focus of the debates in Washington. Nothing is finalized. Any deal would have to be passed by the House and the Senate and then signed by the president. But Senate leaders say they are feeling more positive.

AZUZ: One position you wouldn`t expect to find on an NFL team, an infectious disease specialist, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are working with one to deal with something that`s now affected three players: MRSA. It`s a nasty little bacteria that might look like a pimple or spider bite on someone infected. MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. What that means, is that it`s hard to cure because regular antibiotics don`t phase it. Three players in Tampa Bay have been diagnosed with the MRSA infection. They are cornerback Jonathan Banks, guard Carl Nicks and kicker Lawrence Tynes. We don`t know yet how they got MRSA, but one way it can spread is through skin to skin contact. People can also get it when they touch something with the bacteria on it. That`s more likely in places with shared equipment, so think hospitals, gyms and locker rooms. Depending on the severity of the infection, it is possible to continue playing after being treated. Carl Nicks did that before his infection recurred. It`s not necessarily life-threatening, if treated. And the NFL has dealt with dozens of cases before. Ways to prevent MRSA spread include washing your hands, showering right after exercising, but without sharing soaps or towels, keeping your cuts covered and washing and drying your workout clothes. As for the Bucs, they`ve had their locker room sanitized and they say they`ll everything they can to stop MRSA from spreading any further.

AZUZ: Some of these Muslims are gathering in Saudi Arabia right now. They are in the city of Mecca for an annual event called Hajj. Hajj is a pilgrimage, a religious journey to Mecca. And making that journey is one of the five pillars of Islam. One of the religion`s fundamental practices. Most years, about 2 million Muslims perform Hajj. It involves several days of detailed rituals, some of them take place around the Kaaba, that`s the large cube shaped structure you see right here. It` s a shrine, and for Muslims it`s the most sacred spot on Earth. Every Muslim who is physically and financially able to go, is supposed to perform Haj at least once in his or her life. Those who do can add Al Haj of Haji to their name.

IRVINE: Yet the demand for life seafood in Hong Kong and mainland China continues to grow: each day, boats unload around 30 tons of fish at this market, with wild fish coming from hundreds of miles away.



MR. CHOI, FISH SHOP OWNER (through translator): Actually, there aren`t many fish from local waters. I think less than five percent of them. Only around 20 percent of our fish docs come from the sea. Most of them, around 80 percent, are from fish farms.



IRVINE: Fish farms like this one have thrived with the decline of wild fish stocks. They are starting to attract some big fish. In a high rise in the city, the science of fish farming is being perfected.

IRVINE: Oceanethix is operating an environmentally friendly system to grow and keep live fish indoors. Their operation looks like a scene from a science fiction movie, with the blue lights simulating the deep sea.



MOSKALIK: The ones we`re growing at the moment, the most expensive would be selling for about 90 to 100 U.S. dollars a kilogram. Wholesale, prices have been ratcheting up on ten to 15 percent per annum for the past five or six years.



IRVINE: And that means, good business. Live fish are a billion dollar a year industry.

(CNN) —

Tuesday marks the eighth day of the partial shutdown of the federal government, and there’s no end in sight.

President Barack Obama continues to refuse to negotiate with Republicans. They continue to insist that any government funding bill must somehow delay, defund or otherwise disrupt his signature health reform law.

What’s more, the issue of funding the government has now fused with the issue of raising the nation’s debt ceiling.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said that come October 17 (or so), the nation will be unable to borrow money to pay the bills it continues to rack up.

The president’s trip to Bali for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit was canceled even though he isn’t currently engaged in negotiations with Republicans on how to solve the shutdown.

Instead of talking to each other, the two continue to trade barbs.

So the impasse continues.

The Federal work force – From furlough to paid vacation

As we start Week Two, things are looking up for federal workers.

A large portion of the approximately 400,000 civilian employees who had been furloughed by the Department of Defense may soon return to work.

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has determined a special bill passed by Congress to fund the salaries of the active duty military also extends to those civilians.

Hagel: Most civilian Defense workers can return this week

Civilians in the rest of the government have reason to be happy too. The House of Representatives passed a special bill to ensure that furloughed government workers get paid once federal coffers are refilled. The Senate has yet to act, but Obama has said he will sign it.

So for them, a scary furlough is on course to turn into a paid vacation, although if it lasts too long, some workers might have real trouble paying mortgages and car loans and buying groceries while they wait for the shutdown to end.

Contractors and businesses feel effects

There is a lot less security for federal contractors – employees of private companies doing work for the government. But the reinstatement of Pentagon civilians led one contractor, Sikorsky Aircraft, to cancel furloughs for 2,000 workers at assembly plants in three states.

But the shutdown could soon start to affect sectors beyond defense as existing contracts run out of money. One industry group estimated that after another week of shutdown, up to 300,000 government contractors could be out of work.

Boeing is still making new planes, but because of furloughed Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, next week they can’t deliver any of them. And it’s working for imports too. A new Jetblue Airbus jet is stranded in Europe because it can’t be inspected.

The FAA announced on Monday it will recall more than 800 employees who work in aviation safety, some for the unit that inspects new planes and others assigned to airlines.

Furloughs for federal inspectors also kept the National Transportation Safety Board from dispatching a team to investigate a fatal explosion on a Washington Metro line over the weekend.

“Due to a lapse in funding, NTSB staff are furloughed. The agency can only engage in those activities necessary to address imminent threats to the safety of human life or for the protection of property,” according to a statement from the agency. “After careful consideration it was determined that this accident did not meet the criteria for exempting employees from furlough.”

Head Start – Expect more Closings

After reports during the first week of shutdown that some Head Start programs had been shuttered in Florida, Connecticut and a few other states, more programs will likely shut as local programs run out of money. Because these programs are administered with grants at the local level, they are difficult to keep track of.

But the threat from Karen was a reminder that the federal government usually plays a key role in preparation and cleanup.

FEMA has recalled some of the thousands of workers it furloughed, deeming them “essential.” If the storm had proved damaging, furloughed National Guardsmen would have been called up.

The longer the shutdown lasts, the more distinct its impact will be. By the end of the month, for instance, states will start to run out of funds for food assistance programs.

Council on Tuesday backed an hourly rate of $11.50 (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)

The D.C. Council unanimously endorsed an $11.50-an-hour minimum wage for the nation’s capital Tuesday, completing a rare act of regional cooperation with the Maryland suburbs and setting up a stark contrast with the $7.25 federal minimum wage.

By coordinating with lawmakers in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, which approved similar measures last month, the council put the three localities on the cusp of creating a contiguous region with 2.5 million residents and a minimum wage higher than any of the 50 states. Virginia requires employers to pay the federal rate.

The D.C. Council must hold a final vote on the rate-increase measure and send it to Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), probably early next year. But with all 13 council members pledging their support, the final vote appeared to be a formality and likely wide enough to override a veto by Gray, who repeated Tuesday that he would prefer a smaller increase — to $10 an hour.

After Gray announced Monday that he would seek a second term, the high-profile minimum-wage vote set the stage for a day of intense political theater in and around the council chambers on Pennsylvania Avenue.

The votes needed to pass the measure had been a foregone conclusion for days, but with four council members running for mayor and five more seeking reelection to the council next year, the suspense rested on who would claim credit.

The council’s appetite for a minimum-wage increase was whetted this fall when the mayor vetoed a bill that would have required Wal-Mart and other large retailers with District stores to pay a 50 percent premium over the city’s current minimum wage of $8.25.

Council member Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), a mayoral candidate who has been working to burnish his credentials with business leaders, cast a decisive no-vote against the Wal-Mart bill in September. He said at the time that it would create an unfair playing field for companies and help only low-paid Wal-Mart workers. Wells was among the first to introduce legislation for a minimum-wage increase, and his bill for $10.25 — though not the one that ultimately passed — was the first to attract a majority of the council’s support.

“I had the leadership to get nine votes. . . . I led the first bill to show I could get this done,” Wells told reporters outside the council chamber Monday morning. “I promised I’d get this done, and I’m getting it done today.”

Council member Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), another candidate for mayor, leads the committee that worked out a compromise among what became four bills to raise the minimum wage, including his own to set a top rate of $12.50 per hour. Orange used his own bill as the vehicle for the final vote.

“This is legislation introduced by me,” Orange said from the dais, adding that unlike Gray’s vote against the Wal-Mart bill in the fall, his ability to forge agreement amounted to a first step toward “not leaving people behind” in the wave of economic development and prosperity sweeping the city.

Before the vote, D.C. Council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) congratulated a group of union workers and advocates for the poor from the steps of the John A. Wilson Building. But Bowser, who voted against the “living-wage” bill that applied only to large retailers, was heckled by a supporter of that bill.

The Rev. Graylan Hagler, senior minister of Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ in Northeast and a longtime supporter of Gray’s who publicly split with the mayor over his Wal-Mart vote, said he was not surprised to see a unanimous vote.

“They are all running, and this is an attempt to make things square. . . . They realized where the numbers are,” Hagler said. “Voters are right now really sensitive if you’re always kowtowing to business interests and don’t seem to have the same level of concern for those of us who live in the neighborhood — it’s reprehensible.”

Prince George’s and Montgomery counties passed similar measures last week, raising the minimum in four increments by 2017.

The D.C. measure would go two steps further: It would ramp up the city’s wage to $11.50 a year earlier, in 2016. After that, it would be indexed to inflation.

The bill would give it one of the highest minimum wages of any major U.S. city.

The council also voted unanimously to back a related measure Tuesday: requiring employers to give tipped workers five days of accrued sick time. The measure closes a loophole in city employment law that advocates said had left workers susceptible to being fired for calling in sick a single time. Council members said the paid sick days would not only protect workers but also keep patrons of restaurants from eating food handled by sick employees."

On July 18, Detroit became the biggest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, with an estimated $19 billion in debt. Here’s a look at some staggering facts about Motor City’s population, unemployment rate and more. The data come from a June report called “Proposals for Creditors.”

On July 18, Detroit became the biggest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, with an estimated $19 billion in debt. Here’s a look at some staggering facts about Motor City’s population, unemployment rate and more. The data come from a June report called “Proposals for Creditors.”

The battle over the future of Detroit is set to begin this week in federal court, where government leaders will square off against retirees in a colossal debate over what the city owes to a prior generation of residents as it tries to rebuild for the next.

Soon after Detroit emergency manager Kevyn D. Orr and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) approved a bankruptcy filing Thursday, groups representing the 20,000 retirees reliant on city pensions successfully petitioned a county court to effectively freeze the bankruptcy process.

Now, city and state officials, who say the court ruling will not affect their plans, are asking a federal judge to hold hearings early this week to validate the bankruptcy and move forward with a strategy for Detroit to discharge much of its estimated $19 billion debt.

Orr has promised that retired city workers, police officers and firefighters will not see pensions or health benefits reduced for at least six months. But on Sunday, he said those retirement benefits will have to be cut down the road.

“There are going to be some adjustments,” Orr said on “Fox News Sunday.” “. . . We don’t have a choice.”

“This is a question of necessity,” he added.

But the prospect of cuts has sent a deep wave of fear over Detroit’s retirees, who like many in the city are skeptical of Orr, a corporate lawyer who previously worked in the District, and Snyder, a Republican unpopular in this deeply Democratic city.

“It’s been a nightmare for all of us,” said Shirley Lightsey, president of the Detroit Retired City Employees Association. “We don’t have that many people with pensions big enough for anything to be taken away from them.”

Of Detroit’s overall debt, about half — $9.2 billion — represents pension and health benefits that the city has promised retirees but that it now says it does not have enough money to fully pay. The lion’s share of the remaining debt is owed to bondholders.

Orr has discussed a range of steps the city could take to pay off its debts, and some have speculated that they could include selling Detroit’s international airport and valuable collections from the Detroit Institute of Arts. For current workers, he has proposed stopping pension contributions and shifting employees to individual retirement savings accounts.

But no part of the bankruptcy process is stirring as many passions as the potential need to slice pensions and benefits for retirees. Small cities that have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years have significantly cut retirees’ benefits.

Harry Harper, who lives in northeast Detroit and retired in 2003 from the city’s Water and Sewerage Department after 30 years of service, said talk of benefit cuts is making him very anxious.

View Graphic The decline of Detroit.

“I feel very vulnerable. I don’t feel we have any protection,” said Harper, 61, who receives $2,100 a month in pension payments. “I thought that at 30 years, you earned a pension that was accrued and you did not have to have a concern about that.”

Retirees such as Harper say that living in Detroit on a fixed pension is tough since public transit has been cut back and fuel prices have been going up. Michigan’s gasoline prices are among the highest in the country.

“I’m currently living check to check,” Harper said. “Every time I get in my car, the first stop I’m making is at a gas station because of my cash flow.”

Jeanette Fitz, who retired after 35 years working in accounting for the city government, said she fears that a cut to her pension or medical coverage will be devastating.

Fitz said that she pays more than $100 a month for a half-dozen medications and that much of what remains from her pension payments goes toward her housing and other necessities.

“If they cut it, I’m not going to be able to pay my rent,” she said. “I’m not going to have money. I’m going to be homeless. I’m going to be living out of my car, I guess.”

On Sunday, Orr and Snyder said that they empathize with the fears of retirees but added that the city had ignored its problems for too long and that now there is no choice but to limit pension payments.

“You get honest about it to start with,” Snyder said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “. . . In many cases for the last 60 years, people have ignored the realities of the situation. We’re being real now.”

Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” that one option not on the table is a federal bailout. “I think it’s very difficult right now to ask directly for support,” he said.

Technically, the dispute between the retirees and government leaders is about math — how to calculate how much of the pension system is not properly funded. But that is an unsettled area of accounting, and both sides are able to marshal expertise in their favor.

More fundamentally, though, the question facing Detroit is how much of its remaining financial resources it will use to repay bondholders who will be needed to lend money to the city in the future, to invest in the city’s basic services and to hold fast to promises made to retirees.

“Ultimately, it’s going to come down to a finite ability to pay,” said Brian O’Keefe, a lawyer who represents retired city workers, police officers and firefighters. “We just simply believe that we must honor our obligation to pensioners who spent their entire lives working for the city.”

Detroit’s financial and demographic decline will make that difficult, some experts note. The dramatic population slide the city has experienced over the past decade has hit municipal government hard.

In 2004, for instance, there was an even ratio of city workers to pensioners, but now there are six retirees for every four workers, according to a recent report by Orr.

Orr also has cast significant doubt on the calculations the pension systems have used to determine whether they have enough funding to meet obligations, noting that individuals involved in the pension system have recently faced criminal charges."

A Labor Day Lament,"Been shopping for a new car lately, was a decade and 124,000 miles ago when I paid $17,000 including taxes for an '03 VW Golf TDI diesel. During that decade millions of workers lost their jobs and wages stagnated, and one would think new vehicle prices would have at least kept to the rate of inflation. Electronics have dropped in price while adding features, the housing market is a bargain hunter's paradise if you've got cash or good credit, and about the only thing that's gotten pricier is food, fuel, and vehicles.

Why?

Well, I'm still tick'd about all the unwanted gadgetry I was forced to buy with that 2003 Golf TDI- I can wind windows up and down myself quite well, thank you. And those ten or so speakers are kind of a waste in an upholstered tin can anyway. But I still was allowed to shift for myself and there were even knobs on the quite excellent radio. Good luck finding a manual transmission today, and the radios are hiding behind video game like displays... Should I really have to go through menus at 75 MPH just to switch from MPR to KBEM Jazz 88? Sure it's got bluetooth, but I don't mix driving and business. And at every dealership I find cars similarly packed and prices jacked with useless gadgets, pushing even a so-called economy car into the $20k and beyond price range.

Good thing I'm not replacing my 1998 Ranger, which Ford conveniently discontinued. In it's place Ford proffers $30k F150s that get worse mileage and don't haul enough more than the Ranger to matter. Maybe $25k for a 2 wheel drive if you can find a truck only dealer like Boyer in an aging industrial zone, and these ""he man"" trucks only come with automatics. Want to take an end run around this lunacy by buying a 30 MPG compact car and a trailer to haul your tools and stuff? Most of the automakers have banned trailer towing with their cars and will void the warranty if you try. Ain't much better if you need a big truck for work, what with GM leaving that market and Ford all but abandoning it, leaving you to try to bargain with International and Daimler. Need a really big truck? There's only four suppliers left, and there's little chance to shop for the engine and transmission of your choice everywhere... Your stuck with the truck manufacturer's engine or maybe Cummins.

So you decide to fix up your old vehicle and hang on to it awhile longer... ""Cept Volvo seems to be discontinuing parts for Mack trucks built as recently as 7 years ago, VW has no printed manuals anymore and charges $35 a day to view them online, and those manuals assume you have the manufacturers multi thousand dollar diagnostic system that works on nothing else to do diagnosis.

Now if we were all earning living wages and later enjoying our old age pensions this'd be no problem... We'd just buy a new vehicle every few years like we did to the tune of twenty million a year like we used to and pay the dealer to fix it. But wages for new hire union autoworkers have been beaten down into the $14-15 an hour range, and at the nonunion plants in the south starting pay is only $11-12 an hour and don't expect any raises. And it's all downhill from there, with wages at supplier plants often less than $10 an hour, while many construction workers who used to buy a profitable new pickup every year are still unemployed.

So the math is pretty simple: low wage workers simply can't spare a year's wages to buy a new car, bein' as they gotta pay rent and buy food and such too. Yet the deluded automakers dream of twenty million vehicles a year sales, which given that there are over 200 million licensed drivers in the U.S. would only require said drivers to buy a new one every decade or so. But all but the top earning 20% of those drivers are paid too little to afford new cars, and the lowest paid 20% or so are leaving the auto market entirely for transit and bicycles.

Henry Ford, Soichiro Honda, Alec Issigonis, Hans Ledwinka and Nikola Tesla have left the industry. Heck, they probably couldn't even get into an MBA program these days and wouldn't last a day on the assembly line, probably get fired for unauthorized improving of the product. So we're left with lumbering and blundering corporations, led by MBA ""whiz kids"" who couldn't balance a family budget... Never mind figure out why the workers they underpay aren't buying their overpriced products.

Maybe we need another ""sit down strike"" to save their sorry MBA asses... And ours!

(CNN) —

House Speaker John Boehner may have stood up to conservative arm-twisters and embraced bipartisanship in moving a budget agreement through the House, but insiders don’t see it as the start of a sea change on Capitol Hill.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is one who was pragmatic about Boehner’s new and strident public tone this week toward several influential conservative groups that have questioned his leadership and blasted the compromise budget plan approved Thursday.

Senior GOP aides also cautioned that Boehner’s rhetorical flogging of these groups was not part of a larger legislative strategy moving forward – especially on immigration reform. They view it as the Speaker simply calling out people who he thought crossed a line.

Boehner took to the podium on Wednesday and Thursday to say that he was fed up with criticism from conservative advocates.

At first, he said they were “misleading their followers.” He followed up with this round-house:

“Frankly, I just think that they’ve lost all credibility.”

Spat puts conservative groups in the spotlight

In recent months, Boehner has downplayed internal GOP splits and was on the defensive about why he bent to pressure from the conservative wing of the party to wage what amounted to unwinnable fights with Democrats.

Some vindication

The inability of Boehner to control his majority in the House, many of whom take their cues from conservative advocates, has fostered perpetual gridlock on Capitol Hill and dwindling public support for Republicans and the overall Congress.

Thursday’s budget vote may provided some vindication for Boehner as the House overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan compromise panned by conservative advocates, sending it to the Senate, where it is expected to pass next week.

He enthusiastically banged the gavel down and thundered the final tally – 332-94.

Boehner said the proposal hammered out by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and his Senate counterpart, Patty Murray, didn’t achieve everything Republicans wanted.

But it proposes to reduce the deficit, relax forced military and other spending cuts under so-called sequestration, avoid another government shutdown, and restore a semblance of order to the congressional budget process, which has become an area of recurring political crisis in Washington.

House approves budget deal aimed at averting shutdown

A push on immigration coming?

Pelosi said she was “encouraged” by Boehner’s pushback. But when pressed if she thought Republicans would turn over a new leaf and begin working across party lines on other issues, she didn’t sound convinced that much would change.

“Certainly not achieving this would not have been a good signal, but I don’t under or overestimate the power of this one event today,” Pelosi said.

Immigration is one issue that has been stalled in the House over Republican divisions.

Those pushing for comprehensive reform seized on Boehner’s posture to conservative advocates.

“Our lawmakers’ abilities to work across the aisle will continue to be crucial for us to overhaul our broken immigration system,” Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said.

“The budget vote displayed Speaker Boehner’s great willingness to work across the aisle and move forward on issues that have bipartisan support,” he said.

But senior congressional GOP aides caution that Boehner’s comments this week did not signal a broader approach on legislation.

California Republican Rep Darrell Issa told reporters he’s been working to bridge the partisan divide over immigration for the past 13 years, but he predicted any progress will remain elusive.

“I would love it if we could find acceptable middle ground in which nobody won but the American people on immigration reform. I don’t expect it. I’m working for it but I don’t expect it after this many years,” he said.

Texas GOP Rep Pete Sessions flat out rejected the notion this budget deal means a green light for major immigration legislation.

“I don’t see that this is now clear channel for us to then move immigration, no I don’t. I don’t think that’s what this was about,” he said.

Not seeing eye-to-eye

A test of whether Boehner will continue to confront conservative criticism looms on another fiscal fight next year - the debate over increasing the nation’s ability to borrow money to pay its bills – or the debt limit.

That issue has rallied fiscal hard liners and outside groups to demand new spending reductions and entitlement reforms, Boehner will certainly face another round of pressure to not compromise with Democrats.

5 reasons why Congress might (finally) pass a budget

Why the move now to take on these groups? Boehner didn’t see eye-to- eye with many of them for some time, but hasn’t been willing to go public with his disagreements.

Those close to the Speaker say his public comments weren’t any different than what he’s been saying in closed-door meetings with Republican members.

One senior House GOP leadership aide told CNN that once the attacks got personal, Boehner felt the need to fight back.

The fact that conservative groups started attacking the budget deal before it was even announced particularly bothered Boehner, the aide said.

Asserting authority

Military retirees: You betrayed us, Congress

At one point, Boehner acknowledged the power of these groups have had over House Republicans, saying “they pushed us into the fight to defund Obamacare and shut down the government” in October.

After Boehner’s comments on Thursday, the same groups he singled out showed no signs of backing down.

“I don’t think it’s for anyone in Washington to decide who has credibility,” Michael Needham of Heritage Action said in an interview with CNN. “The American people have the right to be told different perspectives on a deal. We’re trying to have a policy disagreement with the deal that was cut, and that’s healthy.”

North Carolina lawmakers are considering a bill that would slash unemployment benefits and cause the state to lose roughly $600 million worth of extended jobless compensation paid entirely by the federal government.

The measure would reduce the maximum weekly benefit from $530 to $350 per person. If it passes, North Carolina workers will no longer receive long-term compensation starting in July, since states cannot remain eligible for federal unemployment insurance if local lawmakers cut weekly benefit amounts. An estimated 80,000 people would miss out on federal extended benefits, according to the North Carolina Justice Center, a worker advocacy nonprofit. At $25 million per week, the total loss over time amounts to more than $600 million.

Policy experts said the move would be unprecedented. ""It is pretty amazing,"" the center's Alexandra Sirota said in an interview. ""As far as we know, no other state has rejected federal dollars to push that level of benefit cuts.""

Sirota stressed that the benefits not only help the workers who receive them, but they also contribute to the state's economy, since recipients spend the money on things like food, rent and groceries.

The Republicans pushing the unemployment cuts, however, say unemployment taxes hurt the state's economy more than anything else. North Carolina businesses are paying higher federal taxes because the state has been slow to repay $2.5 billion it borrowed from Washington to pay benefits in recent years. The legislation will increase state business taxes and reduce state spending on benefits in order to repay the loan more quickly. The sooner the federal government gets its money back, the sooner federal taxes will come down.

“It will cause North Carolina to repay the debt to the federal government back in about six years less time,"" State Rep. Harry Warren (R-Rowan County) told the Salisbury Post.

The bill's supporters, including Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, don't seem to mind that the state would lose federal unemployment insurance as a result of the legislation. The extended federal benefits are set to expire at the end of the year anyway, but the bill would kill them six months early.

""I will not support the extension of unemployment beyond July of this year,"" McCrory said last week, according to WRAL.com. ""I think we need to now draw the line.""

The bill's opponents, however, see it differently. ""Reducing benefits in a way that causes us to disqualify for those federal funds is extraordinarily shortsighted and philosophically driven,"" State Sen. Floyd McKissick (D-Durham) told HuffPost. ""I think it's really horrendous.""

The bill passed the state House of Representatives on Tuesday and a state Senate committee on Wednesday. Republicans rebuffed Democratic efforts to delay the measure's implementation and prevent the loss of federal benefits. McKissick said he expected the bill to land on McCrory's desk soon.

States typically pay 26 weeks of unemployment insurance to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, and during recessions Congress routinely gives workers additional weeks of benefits. The North Carolina proposal, in addition to cutting the amount of state benefits, would also reduce their maximum duration to 20 weeks. The benefits could last for as few as 12 weeks when the state's unemployment rate declines. Florida and Georgia have recently adopted similar policies.

North Carolina's jobless rate stands tall at 9.2 percent, well above the national average of 7.9 percent.

George Wentworth, a staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project, said the bill would launch North Carolina into the upper tier of cheapskate states.

""With one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, North Carolina will offer its jobless workers 20 weeks of unemployment insurance or less while unemployed workers in other states will qualify for anywhere from 40 to 73 weeks of benefits,"" Wentworth said.



Wentworth also said the loss of federal benefits would undermine the state's economy.

""This will be an economic catastrophe that could easily be averted by simply delaying the state benefit cuts until January,"" he said.

(My organization has not endorsed a candidate in that race.) Doing so gives him some nifty talking points that align with most conservative groups, but it is little more than parliamentary sleight of hand.

Consider how he handled the vote on the bill. To defeat a filibuster, its supporters needed 60 senators to win cloture and move to a final vote. Instead of rallying his troops against the vote, Mr. McConnell allowed a handful of Republicans in battleground states — who needed to be seen as supporting the bill — to vote for cloture, while he and the rest railed against it, casting themselves in the role of budget hawks.

With cloture accomplished, a dozen Republicans were then free to vote against final passage if they need wiggle room when they’re confronted on the campaign trail next fall by voters demanding action on government spending. Mr. McConnell and many Senate Republicans used the vote to manipulate the system, allowing them to cast themselves as deal makers or principled conservatives, depending on their audience.

This is not principled policy making; what we’re seeing is simple gamesmanship that raises legitimate questions about which values Republicans truly hold and which are merely interchangeable with those of Democrats.

The job of Tea Party groups and other conservatives is pretty simple: to inform Americans about the need for restraint in spending, tax relief, pro-growth economic policies and individual liberty — and to support the men and women who pledge to promote these positions. To the extent that the speaker of the House and Senate Republicans are attacking such groups, it looks as if we’re doing our job.

But after this budget vote, our job expands to include informing Americans about who keeps their word in Congress and who does not.

When establishment Republicans call spending increases spending cuts, deny that raising taxes is a hike, and champion deficit reduction that doesn’t scratch the surface of our nation’s debt, it suggests a detachment from the facts. But when those who voted for them criticize their elected officials for not keeping their promises, and are then attacked for doing so, it suggests that Kurt Vonnegut was right in observing, “A sane person to an insane society must appear insane.”"

If you don’t pay your mortgage, he said, you’re a “deadbeat.” You’ll find it harder to borrow in the future, and if you do get a loan, you’ll be paying a higher rate.

The problem is he’s not being scary enough. The consequences of a government default are truly terrifying. If he wants to get the House GOP off its collective behinds, he needs to tell the American people how terrifying. Here are five points he should have made:

1. “Do you have a floating rate loan? An adjustable mortgage or home-equity line? You’ll be paying more--possibly hundreds of dollars per month more.”

Adjustable rate loans are keyed ultimately to Treasury rates. Let’s say a default causes a spike in the index rate of half a percentage point--and it could be a lot more. On a $300,000 adjustable-rate mortgage every half-point increase in the rate will cost you nearly $100 more per month. Your credit card interest will rise too.

2. “Do you own stocks or equity mutual funds? Look out below.”

During the August 2011 debt-limit stalemate, stock prices fell by about 17%, according to a Treasury white paper on the effects of that crisis. They didn’t recover until well into 2012. Over the last few weeks, the S&P 500 index has fallen by 4% from its high Sept. 18. As the debt-limit deadline comes closer, expect for more losses. And if a default actually happens, the stock market drop could be twice or three times what was seen in 2011, when the country came close to a default but didn’t cross the line.

3. “Do you own money market funds? Expect a panic.”

These popular cash-like savings accounts are especially vulnerable to changes in short-term rates and to short-term panics. In 2008, the Treasury had to step in with a $50-billion guarantee to keep the funds from “breaking the buck""--that is, seeing their price per share falling below $1. This will be worse. Much worse. Money market fund investors should brace themselves.

4. “Saving for college or your retirement? You’ll have to wait a few years.”

The cratering of individual stock, bond, and savings accounts will mean horrific pain for Americans who are coming close to needing their nest eggs. There will be no escape. Stock markets will plunge, and bond markets will plunge. In 2008, people say their nest eggs slashed in value by almost half. If you need the money soon, you might have half of what you thought you had.

5. “Looking for a job? Fat chance.”

During the 2011 crisis, the Treasury observes, consumer confidence fell 22% and business confidence fell 3%. The credit markets seized up, making it impossible for small businesses to get loans for hiring or expansion. If you think it’s hard finding a job now, while we’re in a nominal recovery, wait till all your local businesses put their hiring plans on hold.

The most insane notion being bandied about by the tea party wing of the Republican Party is that a default would be no big deal. But as long as President Obama fails to communicate to all Americans the pure frightfulness of the consequences, they’ll go on saying that.

It would be a big deal, and every man, woman and child in the United States would feel it. There will be no safe harbor. It’s not just about rattling the financial markets. It’s us. President Obama needs to make sure every voter in every state hears the message."

Rather than looking at how meager is the pay of millions of working Americans, the execs are blaming the expiration of the payroll-tax break on Dec. 31. The Bloomberg report noted that ""For a person making $40,000 a year, that is about $15 a week."" $15 a week is wrecking WalMart? Really? Or is it the fact that nearly one in every five U.S. households earns less than $20,000 a year?



WalMart, in fact, leads the list of The 20 Companies With The Most Low-Wage Workers. As Henry Blodget pointed out, Walmart could give every single one of its 1.4 million U.S. workers a $5,000 a year raise and STILL have $17 billion in profit.



In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed pushing the minimum wage up to a whole nine bucks an hour, or about $18,000 a year. A really serious proposal would have been $12 or more an hour. As Dean Baker explained a few days ago, if the minimum wage had kept pace with productivity growth the past few decades, it would have been $16.54 in 2012.



And let's note here the stunning news that The top 1% captured 121 percent of income gains since 2009. How is THAT possible? As a Naked Capitalism writer explained, "" How did that happen? Incomes to the bottom 99% fell by 0.4%.""

That means income inequality is getting worse faster under Obama, than it did under Dubya.

UPDATE: A big swooping tip o' the hat to PuddyTat and grover, who note in the comments below that there is also the factor of ""the negative publicity and exposure that WalMart has gotten that has increased the number of folks who won't walk in their door anymore."" Grover points to the highly interesting information that Sams Club, the membership retail warehouse owned by WalMart, is also suffering from slack sales, while its competitor, Costco, is not."

Globalization is driving the sinking fortunes of many ordinary Americans.

Prior to World War II, the U.S. economy was largely isolated. It traded with the world much less than rivals like Germany, labor was scarcer and wages were higher for ordinary workers than just about anyplace else.

The New Deal strengthened unions and the post-war growth of manufacturing created a thriving middle class. Competition for workers tended to raise wages in service activities too.

More On This...

Subsequently, the United States championed freer trade through the WTO. Cheaper ocean freight, then jet travel and now the internet blurred boundaries between national markets.

Combined with the rise of Japan and China, those severely injured U.S. electronics, auto and other manufacturing, and are now eroding employment in many professional services.

An open global economy created broad opportunities for college educated Americans with sophisticated skills in advanced technology, finance and the creative arts—like film making. First National City Bank, a dominant player in New York State, became Citigroup, a dominant force in global finance.

All of this decimated unions and lowered wages for workers with only a high school education or soft college degree, while enriching the relatively few in engineering, finance or other highly technical areas.

The top 1 percent now earn nearly one-fifth of the country’s household income, and the top 10 percent more than half. That’s the most since 1928, and Obama’s policies have made things worse—faster.

In a globalized economy, America has to play its strengths, but during the Obama recovery the international trade deficit has nearly doubled.

Bans on offshore drilling and in parts of Alaska require expensive oil imports, and send purchasing power and high paying jobs to the Middle East and Russia. The flood of manufacturers from China keeps growing, thanks to an undervalued yuan and other subsidies the Administration refuses to address.

Dodd-Frank bank reforms have not stopped reckless and unethical behavior on Wall Street. Witness JP Morgan’s ""London Whale"" and how often that venerable institution and Goldman Sachs are dragged into court these days.

Yet, new regulations have imposed burdensome costs on smaller banks, forcing many to sell out to the Wall Street casinos and permitting the latter to grasp control of more than fifty percent of U.S. bank deposits. The resulting downward pressure on CD rates deprives many older Americans of retirement income, while permitting the barons of Manhattan to continue receiving multi-million dollar bonuses.

ObamaCare is forcing businesses to divide full-time jobs for ordinary workers into part-time positions to avoid expensive health insurance mandates, and those jobs pay less.

Higher taxes on top income earners have hit small businesses the hardest. Financiers, high tech entrepreneurs and movie producers can pass off their salaries as capital gains through loopholes in the tax code. The president rails against that opportunity to enjoy much lower rates than the rest of us, but has done little to fix it.

Meanwhile, small businesses paying marginal rates as high as 60 percent in states with liberal governors like New York, California or Maryland don’t invest and create jobs.

During the Obama recovery, the top one percent has captured 95 percent of the income gains—almost double the average for the Clinton and Bush recoveries.

Obama tells Americans he’s for the middle class. The facts tell another story. The president’s policies are enriching the same folks that support his campaigns—the rich liberals on Wall Street, in the Silicon Valley and in Hollywood."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/23/Allen-West-Policies-like-amnesty-driving-up-black-unemployment-lead-to-things-like-Knock-Out-Game,2013-11-23 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Allen West: 'Dependency Society' Lead to 'Knockout Game',"Col. Allen West, former GOP U.S. Congressman from Florida, said at a Thursday morning panel focused on the devastating economic impacts of amnesty that economic policies that displace black youths from jobs–like President Barack Obama’s immigration policies–have led to fads like the “knockout game.”

The panel, hosted by the nonpartisan pro-jobs group Americans4Work and featuring West and other leaders on immigration policy, focused intensely on how the economy has not gotten better around the country for many groups of Americans, including the black community. They noted how the immigration policies proposed by the president and some in Congress would not help the situation.

West and fellow panelist Professor Jan Ting of Temple University were discussing what they called the “new normal” in America–how Americans are not succeeding independent of the government in record numbers.

“What we don’t want to see happening in the United States of America is this second and third generation of welfare,” West said. “That becomes the new normal. When you look and see your mother and your father or your grandmother or your aunt or uncle, whoever is raising you, that they were born in Section Eight housing, their kids were in Section Eight housing. And therefore, you think there is no place else for me to go but Section Eight housing.”

West said such levels of dependency on the government “affects your level of self-esteem.”

“That affects your ability to, to be a part of an American dream,” he said. “And, I think, the big problem that you see if this, a, situation continues to exacerbate itself, then the safety net is no longer a safety net. The safety net becomes a hammock. And therefore, you have to have an increase of government spending because you’re going to expand and grow this welfare nanny-state.”

Wets noted that the “exorbitant amount of spending” from the federal government on means-tested welfare programs, and what he describes as a diversion of the food stamps program from what it was originally intended to accomplish, leads America “in the wrong direction.”

“And, again, it comes to the fundamental question, are we going to promote an opportunity society or are we going to promote a dependency society?” West asked. “What is the problem if we head down this road? You’re going to have more Detroits. And think about what Detroit used to be. Think about what Detroit used to look like. And guess what? You have this–and this is something that is absolutely driving me crazy, this knockout game.”

West noted that many of those teens involved in the knockout game would have, in his day, had jobs in their towns and would not be engaged in this behavior. But since the economic and education systems created by the left–including immigration policy which allows foreign workers into the country to compete with them for jobs–they have nothing to do but engage in violence.

“Well, guess what? If you have all of these inner-city black teenagers that have nothing to do, their education system is failing them. Well, in the summertime, I knew I could go down to McDonald’s or Burger King, you know, Baskin Robbins, somewhere,” he recalled. “I would go and get my little part-time summer job. They don’t even have those options now. So, what are they doing? They’re going out and they’re beating on people. For what? For fun.”

“This is what happens when the policies are creating more dependence,” West explained. “They’re creating more despair. It’s creating more despondency. And it’s only going to get worse if we don’t turn it around.”

West also addressed amnesty’s devastating impact on the black community’s employment opportunities. When West was asked why the Congressional Black Caucus has been silent on the matter, he responded that “it just goes back to who is your master.”

“I think that they [the Congressional Black Caucus] are more so interested in the interests of the Democratic Party and their agenda rather than the people that they were sent here to Washington, D.C. to serve,” West said. “I’ll go back to a statement that the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Emanuel Cleaver, made, and I asked him about this. But he said that if there was anyone other than President Obama sitting in the White House that we would be marching on the White House when you look at the numbers as far as unemployment in the black community.”

West added that Cleaver said: “We give deference to President Obama for that.”

“So, you know, there is something wrong here,” West said. “And you’re right. When you look at our inner cities, America cannot recover economically unless we do something about our inner cities. If that continues to be the, the weak part of our economy, it will continue to drag the rest of this country down. Because there will be more resources poured into the welfare and nanny state instead of the economic opportunity.”

West said lawmakers and leaders need to be “very careful” with regard to the “trust and confidence that the American people have right now in government.”

“In 1986, let’s remember, we went down the path,” West said. “We had an amnesty program. But there were certain requirements that the federal government were supposed to undertake and they never did. And so, this problem has been exacerbated.”

The failures of Obamacare, West said, have also played into Americans’ mistrust of government, another reason why an amnesty program would not be a good thing.

“Right now, if anyone goes out before the American people and they say ‘comprehensive,’ everyone is running the other way because we have a comprehensive health care plan that we’re dealing with right now,” West said. “So, again, I think, that you need to look at this in multiple ways.”

“I mean, it affects your national security. It affects your economy. It affects your education. It affects your health care. It affects your local criminality,” he stated. “We can get to the point where we have some type of guest worker program. There’s no doubt about that especially in the agricultural industry.”

But before any type of immigration legislation adds to the amount of workers in the country, West said there must be “an economy that is growing”; compared to 1986, he said the economy now is in much worse shape.

“We need to have manufacturing coming back to the United States of America,” West said. “And, Senator [Jeff] Sessions talked about the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] numbers being up. Because on average 0.9 percent GDP growth over each year over the past five or six years. This time in Ronald Reagan’s economy, we were 7.2 percent GDP growth, big difference.”

“So, why are we talking about flooding more people into a workforce where the GDP that is barely, you know, making it, it cannot sustain itself really, a debt to GDP ration which is upside down where we are owing more than we’re, we’re producing, we cannot take more people coming to this workforce,” he explained."

Dionne Jr.: Conservatives contradict themselves on American power,"Do conservatives still believe in American greatness?

The question is not intended to discourage the healthy debate being pushed by Rand Paul and his allies over whether Republicans in the George W. Bush years were too eager to deploy our country’s armed forces overseas. After the steep costs of the Iraq war, it is a very necessary discussion.

But Paul has inadvertently called our attention to a deep contradiction within American conservatism.

Those who share Paul’s philosophical orientation are quite right in seeing the rise of American power in the world as closely linked to the rise of the New Deal-Great Society state at home. But this means that those who want the United States to play a strong role in global affairs need to ask themselves if their attitudes toward government’s role in our country, which are similar to Paul’s, are consistent with their vision of American influence abroad.

After World War II, there was a rough consensus in America, confirmed during Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency in the 1950s, in favor of an energetic national government.

We emerged from the war as a global power that had learned lessons from the Great Depression. Government action could lessen the likelihood of another disastrous economic downturn and build a more just and prosperous society at home by investing in our people and our future.

Thus did the Marshall Plan and the GI Bill go hand in hand. The Marshall Plan eased Western Europe’s recovery from the devastation of war, thereby protecting friendly governments and opening new markets for American goods. The GI Bill educated a generation of veterans, spurring prosperity from the bottom up by enabling millions to join a growing middle class.

Eisenhower built on these achievements by creating the first college loan program and launching the interstate highway system. It’s no accident that the former was established by the National Defense Education Act while the latter was known as the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.

Lyndon Johnson operated in the same tradition. It’s worth remembering that passage of the landmark civil rights acts was helped along by our competition with the Soviet Union. We realized we could not appeal to the nonwhite, nonaligned parts of the world if we practiced racism at home.

And we fought poverty — for moral reasons but also because we wanted to show the world that we could combine our market system with economic justice. We forget that we succeeded. A strengthened Social Security system combined with Medicare slashed poverty rates among the elderly. Food stamps dealt with a real problem of hunger in our nation while Medicaid brought regular health care to millions who did not have it before.

Through it all, Keynesian economics kept our economy humming while widely shared prosperity created the sense of national solidarity that a world role required.

Paul and his allies deserve credit for consistency. They are against the entire deal.

“As government grows, liberty becomes marginalized,” Paul declared at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which announced Saturday that the libertarian senator from Kentucky had placed first in its 2016 presidential straw poll. I think the evidence of all the years since World War II proves Paul flatly wrong. But then I am not a conservative.

But what of conservatives who endorse continued American global leadership but would drastically reduce government’s investments in our citizens and our infrastructure, in economic security and in health care?

Do they honestly think voters will endorse the military spending they seek even as they throw 40 million to 50 million of our fellow citizens off health insurance and weaken health coverage for our elderly? Can they continue to deny that their goal of an internationally influential America demands more revenue than they currently seem willing to provide? Have conservatives on the Supreme Court pondered what eviscerating the Voting Rights Act would do to the image of our democracy around the globe?

And do conservatives who say they favor American greatness think they are strengthening our nation and its ability to shape events abroad with an ongoing budget stalemate created by their refusal to reach agreement with President Obama on a deal that combines spending cuts and new taxes? Would they rather waste the next three years than make any further concessions to a president the voters just reelected?

Rand Paul is very clear on the country he seeks. Conservatives who reject his approach to foreign policy need to consider where the strong America they honor came from in the first place.

Previously', 'He Was Policy Editor', 'Where He Had Primary Responsibility For Wonkblog']",Spending cuts represent moment of truth for tea party,"Since the day they were swept to power more than two years ago, the tea party’s legions in Washington have made dramatic federal spending cuts the centerpiece of an economic message that has dominated the national debate.

Now they’re about to get what they want.

Deep reductions in domestic and defense spending are set to begin Friday in a process known as sequestration, which will make progress toward the tea party’s goal of shrinking the government. What unfolds over the following months will be a high-stakes test of whether significant cuts in spending will help or hurt the economy — and the Republican Party’s brand.

The cuts, worth $1.2 trillion over 10 years, are slated to become reality after a period when the tea party — a movement, represented by a group of Republicans elected in 2010, whose goal is to radically cut the government — has struggled to have a lasting impact on Washington. The tea party saw President Obama win reelection and enact more than $600 billion in tax increases on the wealthy, while GOP leaders agreed to allow more federal borrowing without anything in return.

But many Republicans say the sequester is the moment when the tea party can claim it has made its mark. Although Democratic and Republican leaders are pointing fingers, the tea party and its allies are happily accepting credit for the cuts.

You’ve heard politicians mention the word “sequester” a lot lately. The Washington Post’s Ed O’Keefe explains what the term means and why it matters. (The Washington Post)

“This will be the first significant tea party victory in that we got what we set out to do in changing Washington,” said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (Kan.), a tea party Republican elected in 2010.

Rep. Reid J. Ribble (R-Wis.), a conservative elected in 2010 who doesn’t consider himself a member of the tea party, said the movement “was significant in getting the American people’s attention on this problem. You have to give them credit.”

‘Can’t be both bad and good’

The sequester, which will begin slowly but build over time, has put Republican leaders in a difficult corner. They say they oppose the cuts to defense spending and see little wisdom in indiscriminate, across-the-board reductions elsewhere.

But they also say they agree with the magnitude of the budget reductions — and in fact want to eventually go much further, reducing discretionary spending and entitlement programs.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) recently advocated an approach that has been a hallmark of the tea party: reduce federal spending so the budget is balanced in 10 years, without any increase in taxes.

To do that, experts say, such cuts would need to generate $4 trillion to $5 trillion in savings over a decade — more than three times the $1.2 trillion under sequestration.

Huelskamp, who voted against the original bill authorizing the sequester because he wanted even more cuts, said he expects Boehner and other Republican leaders to come through but is nervous about recent statements suggesting that they might be looking for alternatives.

“They promised the sequester would happen,” said Huelskamp, who voted against Boehner for speaker this year. “For them to go back on their word certainly threatens their ability to lead.”

Some Republicans say it’s risky for GOP lawmakers to celebrate deep spending cuts while warning of their potentially negative consequences.

“It’s going to be difficult for the Republicans as a party in this,” said Tony Fratto, a former adviser to President George W. Bush. “They said the sequester is bad. You can’t say that and then say it’s a good thing, a step in the right direction. It can’t be both bad and good.”

But Barney Keller, communications director for the conservative Club for Growth, said Republicans who don’t support big budget cuts might face primary challenges next year.

“Many Republicans aren’t afraid of losing their job to a Democrat, because of redistricting” that virtually guarantees that GOP lawmakers will hold on to their seats, he said. “But they are afraid of losing their jobs to more fiscally conservative candidates.”

The effects of spending

Conventional economic theory holds that significant cuts in government spending harm the economy. Tea party Republicans, however, argue that reducing federal spending and borrowing will help minimize distortions in the economy and keep the government from crowding out private-sector growth. Quickly slowing the rise of the national debt, austerity advocates say, will raise the confidence of businesses and consumers in the nation’s long-term economic stability.

More traditional economic analysts agree that reducing budget deficits is a good goal, but they don’t think it should happen in any significant way during times of economic weakness. They tend to argue that government spending has a positive role in supporting the economy, and they note that Europe has struggled under austerity measures.

The tea party had an immediate influence on budget politics after its rise to power in 2010. Washington shifted to a debate about the size of government, and plans advanced by leading Republicans, especially Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), sought deep cuts in spending.

The push to slash the budget led to several battles with the White House, which would agree to cuts that were only a small fraction of what tea party members and other conservatives demanded. Many of the reductions did little to actually slow government spending.

“Up until now, this has been a clever game played on an imaginary budget,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist. “It hasn’t been real.”

Tea party members say the failure to do more hurt the GOP in last year’s election, which gave Obama a second term and Democrats gains in the House and the Senate.

“Part of that was rank-and-file Republicans were upset that we hadn’t followed through on what we had promised,” said Rep. Blake Farenthold (Tex.). “I think leadership sees that.”

No deal likely this time

The sequester was made law in the summer of 2011, after a fight over whether to raise the federal debt ceiling. Republicans would allow more borrowing only in exchange for spending cuts; the White House wanted any further discussion about the debt limit to be postponed until after the election.

The deal between the White House and Congress had authorized the sequester to begin Jan. 1, 2013, if lawmakers couldn’t find other ways to reduce the budget deficit. They didn’t, but the two sides agreed to postpone the sequester for two months in the “fiscal cliff” tax deal at the beginning of this year. Now, it doesn’t appear likely that another deal will be at hand before cuts begin Friday.

Kevin Smith, Boehner’s communications director, laid the blame for the sequester on the White House. He noted that the House last year passed bills to replace the sequester with alternative spending cuts.

“The White House is on defense because it doesn’t have a plan,” Smith said. “The president hasn’t lifted a finger to urge his allies in the Senate to pass a solution of their own.”

White House officials say they have an offer on the table to replace the sequester with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases, and they note that they back a Senate plan to postpone the sequester through the rest of the year.

Rep. Renee L. Ellmers (N.C.), who is part of the 2010 class of Republicans but not a member of the tea party caucus, said she worries about the sequester, especially since her district, home to Fort Bragg, would be hit hard. But she said it may have to happen.

“I do believe it will start a very important process that will help our economy to start to grow,” she said. “The debt that we have at the federal level is our biggest threat for our country.”"

That is what happened with the birth of the tea party, or rather it was the final punch in thirty years of regression, because the story of rural populism being regressed by the right does not begin in the Midwest but rather in rural manufacturing sections of the country like my hometown of Elmira New York. But the majority of voters who grew up under the new deal era became conservative when they got older so this shift in ideology only spans a lifetime in the majority of people, When people think of the populism in this country, they think of the Midwest and other regions of our country where populism prevailed.

What people fail to realize is that this populism had the certain cultural characteristic that redefined the left and in this modern age the Democratic Party. It is interesting that this populism came not from the Democratic Party but from the populist party among other groups. This might be strange to some but the state that gave FDR his biggest margin or 94% of the vote in 1936 was Mississippi, one of the few senators to oppose the new deal from the left was a southern democrat named Huey Long. It was the Midwest that supported the Socialist party of America during its existence was the Midwest with Wisconsin sending one of the only two socialist into Congress Victor L Berger. This state also sent to the Senate Bob Lafollete A Republican who ran as the Progressive Party candidate in 1912 garnering 12% of the vote. At this moment you might be asking yourself. What does this have to do with the Rebirth of Rural populism? If we analyze the shift of the white working class in this country it started to become increasingly conservative in our spectrum during the 1960s. So this shift has literally happened as the population had gotten older. But this is an anomaly in political ideology, because it was the Senior citizens in the 1930s that were part of the Townsend clubs (A movement created by Dr. Charles Townsend to ensure income for Senior citizens), vestiges of that movement are still alive in the AARP.

I recently had the chance to sit in a political discussion in a cigar shop a traditionally conservative atmosphere, as a progressive I could not really agree with them on social issues such as abortion or gay marriage, but demographics tend to defeat that argument in national circles. But the other part of the argument they can agree with me on is international trade, most rural politics tend to center around factory towns, and this is were we can take a stance on saying we represent the majority of people. Democrats could exploit the argument against free trade, if we did something about it such as renegotiating free trade deals, and this is something Conservatives can be won over on. Especially in states that have heavy industry and manufacturing, and usually this argument tends to be more bipartisan in agreement than message. All politics are populist no matter what side of the spectrum you are on, which is why the tea party was so effective in drawing around the cultural edges of the picture of existence in rural America. It was painting the argument of the ""people"" which the tea party represented or at least argued to represent against the elitist federal government and its special interest such as unions and the evil Planned Parenthood. The reason this argument worked is because it played to cultural attitudes within regions such as the south and midwest that flipped once thought safe democratic seats such as Chairman of the budget committee John Spratt's seat in North Carolina, anti NAFTA Mississippi congressman Gene Taylor among others. It is only an argument of rhetoric that Louisiana only has one democratic congressman even though the majority of their congressional districts are made up of what were considered once solid democrats. Now regionally there are several arguments that are populist in my hometown and the Surrounding Southern tier of Upstate New York its anti fracking, and it seems to have worked pretty well in unseating several Republicans such as Nan Hayworth and Ann Marie Buerkle. Both elected in the tea party wave of 2010. I believe that the anti fracking movement is key to the rebirth of rural populism, because it actually defines the rhetoric of populism perfectly.

If we look at what politicians have made the fracking debate about, it is about the elites against the people and no matter what Republicans say or do. They have defined themselves as taking the side of the elite and this is a view supported by most people in upstate New York even if they are Republican. Now the fact that this debate has cemented itself in Upstate New York as a fight against the elite even with Republicans says alot about the natural gas industry and its political supporters. Often to conservatives it is not the environmental problems but rather the economic ones such as the increase in rent prices and traffic increase. But also there is a different appeal specially with traditionally Republican winery owners within the finger lakes region of the southern tier if fracking comes to this area then the grape industry will be ruined because of lack of water. Now the anti fracking movement has united the people against corporate elite interest just trying to profit from our homes and then leave.

This rural populism is much more cultural and based on the self reliance of a region. There are other successful stories of where populist have won elections Jon Tester in Montana and Joe Manchin in West Virginia won elections in deep red states. The fact that a democrat won as a Senator and not as president in these states shows a big change in cultural attitude to their officials. I guess the label that all politics are local fits perfectly to how Democrats win and can win rural conservative leaning districts. It used to be that both Republicans and Democrats fought against NAFTA and other outsourcing policies. But Republicans tend to just want to play on the cultural attitudes of a rural area to win a congressional seat, which is failing because telling someone that banning gay marriage is somehow going to stop the outsourcing of jobs in America does not add up.

There are also several different demographic changes that will help democrats in places like upstate New York. If we look at demographics while rural areas seem to be emptying there is also a larger immigrant population. Within the 297 most rural counties within the States since 2000 immigrant populations have exceeded 5%. Generations in the future will mark this demographic trend. The outsourcing of jobs also tends to over affect rural America because 12.5% of the workforce in rural America is employed in manufacturing; this is a larger margin than farming. So this gives us progressives a better chance to fight against outsourcing of American jobs and it seems to be taking effect as well. This is why Republican senate candidates and Republican incumbent congressmen tend to lose their seats when it comes to these issues. There is no better example of this than the election of Pete Gallego in Texas kicking out tea party one term congressman Quico Canseco. The district they were fighting over was a majority latino rural district that stretched from the San Antonio suburbs to the Mexican border.

Now the antifracking movement in upstate New York is a temporary one since if we succeed there will not be fracking in New York State. But to keep this coalition alive you have to include people who have always voted Republican their whole lives. These people have already been convinced that Fracking is not a creator of jobs, so to keep this coalition alive people must be convinced that we need to bring manufacturing jobs back to the Southern tier of New York. This is how the populist would survive if fracking is banned. Not to mention that all of these rural areas contain several colleges, which are breeding grounds for activist. Furthermore the cohesiveness of a coalition lies not on its structure but on whether it can be continued by future generations. This can be replicated in several areas of the country which have bene gutted by NAFTA, CAFTA, among other trade agreements. It is isolating the enemy and creating a coalition to bring back jobs, by convincing the people. Fighting for the land rights of a landowner might not seem like a very progressive argument. But in upstate New York landowners who do not want to deal with the natural gas industry end up having to fight legal battles with gas companies. These landowners end up taking a position against fracking based on self-reliance and property respect.

Finally I want to highlight my own Congressional district the 23rd Congressional district in Upstate New York as a prime example of how rural populism can become instrumental in democrats mounting opposition to Republicans. A district that has a 2 to 1 advantage of Republicans to Democrats, the democratic candidate for Congress Nate Shinagawa only lost by 4%, in 2010 the Democratic candidate retired Army Captain Matthew Zeller lost by 7.4% but the difference was the opposition to fracking, as well as several factories shutting down under Congressman Tom Reed's tenure as Congressman even though many of his billboards said "" he was fighting for jobs"". This along with Republicans turning against him on the issue of fracking showed that people can fight the elite at the ballot box. With that being said we were outspent 3 to 1 but still spread the message through grassroots efforts. There is no doubt that rural populism is reborn through the anti fracking movement and the fight against outsourcing jobs. It is also fascinating to watch the people's movements give birth to a new dialogue within rural America. While we may not agree with city liberals on gun rights and some trade deals, we do stand together against Fracking, against outsourcing, in taxing the rich. Rural America has again become a key part to the populist message

The first time fast food workers at multiple restaurants across a city ever went on strike was in New York City in November, and after a second one-day strike in New York, city after city followed. With high unemployment, unions under attack and on the defensive, and labor law that does little to protect workers, low-wage workers in a decentralized industry were just about the last people who were supposed to rise up and demand more. But this week, fast food workers in seven cities will be walking out

Today, Monday, is a day of widespread rallies and walkouts, with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and city council members on hand to support the strikers. But:



This week’s wave of strikes got an early start Friday night, when workers walked out at a Brooklyn Domino’s to protest the firing of an activist co-worker, Gregory Reynoso, following their April strike. Striker Jose Cruz told Salon that about 90% of the workers on the busy evening shift joined the work stoppage, forcing cancellations of deliveries. (Workers at two other Domino’s locations, a Papa John’s, and a McDonald’s also took part in Friday’s prequel strike.)

On Friday, state Sen. Eric Adams helped deliver letters in support of Reynoso to Domino's.

Monday:





@FastFoodForward 13 fast food workers just walked-out of McDonald’s at 341 5th Ave. Only managers remain. #iamfastfood http://t.co/...

Today, workers and allies will rally at multiple locations in New York City at noon and at Union Square at 3pm. In coming days, workers in Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Milwaukee, Kansas City, and Flint, Michigan, will also strike, and workers in Seattle—who raised complaints of wage theft last week—will take action in other ways. This isn't a short-term fight, but the beginning of what will likely be a long campaign building pressure on the fast food industry to change. If you see workers striking outside a fast food restaurant, join them if you can. But whatever you do, don't weaken the fight by crossing their line and going inside.

Tell these brave fast food workers that you stand in solidarity with them."

Marty Morgenstern, secretary of labor and workforce development, said the backlog of claims building up at the EDD were “unacceptable.” He directed the agency to forgo verifying the claimants’ eligibility and push payments through — the equivalent of pay now, ask questions later.

The EDD has been contending with a huge backlog of unemployment claims after an upgrade of its 30-year-old computer system malfunctioned over Labor Day weekend. Since then, the agency has been hand-processing claims, which has delayed some payments by weeks.

Hundreds of state employees have been working overtime to reduce the backlog, which has snared about 15% of ongoing claims since the new system went live.

Morgenstern said despite these efforts, “it is unlikely that the claims backlog will be reduced quickly enough to respond to the very real financial hardship now being experienced by too many of our residents relying on timely payment of their UI benefits.”

Unemployment insurance recipients said they’ve fallen behind on rent, car payments and other bills because of the late payments. Some reported they’re already facing eviction.

Keion Morgan, 35, is among those struggling without his unemployment benefits.

The North Hollywood resident, laid off from a job in late May as a program coordinator for a university, said he had no idea there was a problem until he read media reports. He is owed about $1,100.

“It’s been very frustrating from the communication aspect,” Morgan said.

Morgan could see some of his claims paid as early as Thursday, EDD spokeswoman Loree Levy said. She said the agency would later go back and review the claims to determine eligibility, and seek reimbursement in case of overpayment.

The computer snafu is the latest problem to hit the EDD, which has been forced to reduce services in recent months because of federal budget cuts. The agency no longer answers its unemployment benefits hotline in the afternoons, and its regional jobs centers have lost some funding.

Levy told The Times on Monday that officials expected some hiccups with the system upgrade “but we didn’t know it’d be to this magnitude.”

The agency on Tuesday also confirmed that the contractor behind the upgrade, New York consultant Deloitte, is the same firm that upgraded Massachusetts’ unemployment benefits system. That state has also faced similar delays in benefit payments.

Massachusetts and California labor officials have repeatedly stressed that their systems are working since the upgrade, and that problems affect only a small portion of claimants.

A spokesman for Deloitte defended the computer upgrades in both states and said in a statement that the company is working to help resolve issues as quickly as possible.

“Although there have been some challenges with a small percentage of claimant accounts — which is not unusual for new systems this large and complex — there have been far more successes,” the statement said.

Legislators around California, who are on recess, said their offices have been fielding calls and emails from residents who are not getting unemployment payments.

Assemblyman Richard Hershel Bloom (D-Santa Monica) said the order by Morgenstern was a bold and appropriate move “because it deals with an emergency and gets money into people’s hands so they can deal with their immediate financial need.”

Bloom said he expects there will be oversight hearings to determine what exactly happened and how to avoid similar problems in the future. He took issue with how the EDD communicated the problem not just to the public but to state lawmakers.

“There were some issues with notification, even to the Legislature,” he said. “The flow of information was not what it should be.”

Jason Maloni, a crisis communications expert at Levick, a Washington, D.C.-based public relations firm, said the problem is a classic example of not anticipating potential problems ahead of a big computer upgrade.

He said that when the agency first discovered the problem, it should have communicated the issue more broadly and focused on finding a solution.

“Today’s society demands instant answers when a problem occurs,” he said. “It certainly doesn’t reflect well on government authorities.”

JPMorgan Chase has secured important concessions in a $13 billion settlement over its mortgage practices, allowances that could ultimately reduce the bank’s financial burden and leave the government itself on the hook for a small portion of the cost.

The concessions emerged on Friday in an agreement with one of the federal regulators suing JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank. The regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, ran ahead of a broader deal that the Justice Department and other authorities were negotiating with the bank.

The housing agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, extracted a $5.1 billion payout on Friday.

But unlike other regulators pursuing the bank, it did not require JPMorgan to admit wrongdoing. And in a provision buried in the settlement, the agency effectively allows JPMorgan to try later to recoup about $1 billion from another federal regulator: the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The results show that, even as JPMorgan is facing an onslaught from the government, the bank is seeking to contain the fallout — and is succeeding on some fronts.

In a statement, JPMorgan called the deal “an important step towards a broader resolution” with the Justice Department and the other government authorities.

And for its part, the housing agency, while not responding to questions about the wording of the agreement, also heralded the settlement. “This is a significant step as the government and JPMorgan Chase move to address outstanding mortgage-related issues,” Edward J. DeMarco, the acting director of the housing agency, said in a statement. Yet the housing agency’s announcement also suggests that the government may be split over how to punish the bank for misrepresenting the quality of mortgage securities it sold to investors before the 2008 financial crisis. The Justice Department, which has orchestrated the $13 billion settlement, is conversely demanding that JPMorgan not pass on its liabilities to the F.D.I.C.

JPMorgan has been locked in a legal battle with the F.D.I.C. over mortgage securities sold by Washington Mutual. In a deal that the F.D.I.C. orchestrated, JPMorgan bought the failed bank at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, just months after it acquired Bear Stearns. By JPMorgan’s account, the F.D.I.C. agreed that it would shoulder some liabilities from Washington Mutual. The agency disputes that notion and is fighting the bank in court.

The bank’s legal stance has now carried over into the negotiations over the $13 billion mortgage settlement.

Because the settlement deal with the housing regulator involves mortgage securities sold by Washington Mutual, JPMorgan could try to push some of the settlement cost onto the F.D.I.C. And the deal with the housing agency does not explicitly prevent the bank from doing so.

“Nothing in this agreement shall be used as an admission or concession that JPMorgan,” the deal said, “contractually assumed or is otherwise liable for any alleged liabilities or wrongdoing of Washington Mutual Bank.”

Armed with that wording, JPMorgan could file a claim against Washington Mutual’s receivership fund, which is maintained by the F.D.I.C. Such a claim could be for more than $1 billion, given that Washington Mutual accounted for a third of the disputed mortgage securities. It is unclear whether the bank would receive the full amount. The receivership contains about $2.7 billion, according to the F.D.I.C.’s Web site. And it already faces other large claims.

The settlement with the housing agency does prevent JPMorgan from making any claim on the agency’s deposit insurance fund. But some government officials worry that if JPMorgan consumes what’s left of the receivership, a few other claimants could take the bold step of pursuing the insurance fund.

The Justice Department, which wants to include other Washington Mutual-related investigations into the $13 billion deal, continues to fight with the bank over the F.D.I.C.

Some bank lawyers questioned whether it is fair for the $13 billion settlement to include any payouts related to Washington Mutual. The company, the lawyers argued, sold the dubious securities before JPMorgan bought it.

As both sides continued to wrangle over a final deal, the housing agency decided to announce its own settlement. By settling now, people briefed on the talks said, the agency can move on to negotiating with other banks it has sued.

For JPMorgan, the housing regulator settlement resolves only one element of the bank’s legal woes. The bank, which is also facing investigations into whether it turned a blind eye to Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and hired the sons and daughters of China’s elite to win business in that nation, said earlier this month that since 2010 it had set aside $28 billion for litigation expenses.

Still, the housing regulator’s case was one of the costliest.

In a 2011 lawsuit, the regulator accused JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual of misrepresenting the quality of the mortgage securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing finance companies. The banks, the agency claimed, did not fully disclose the risks of the securities, which ultimately imploded.

To settle the mortgage securities case, the bank paid $4 billion. It paid another $1.1 billion to the regulator to settle demands that the bank repurchase soured loans it sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from 2000 to 2008.

The $13 billion deal with JPMorgan also involves a number of other state and federal authorities. Under the current terms, the bank would pay a roughly $2 billion fine to prosecutors in California, commit $4 billion to help struggling homeowners reduce their mortgage balances and dole out billions more to state attorneys general and other officials who will then funnel the money to investors who sustained losses on mortgage securities.

The deal could embolden the Justice Department as it takes aim at other big banks suspected of similar mortgage breakdowns. Using the JPMorgan case as a template, the Justice Department is planning to take action against other big banks suspected of selling troubled mortgage securities, people briefed on the matter said.

The Justice Department’s cases rely on a law that extends the legal deadline for filing certain financial fraud cases to 10 years from five. The law also led a federal jury this week to find Bank of America liable in a mortgage case.

A spokesman for Eric T. Schneiderman — the New York attorney general who is expected to collect more than $500 million from JPMorgan — praised the housing regulator’s pact on Friday. “Five years after the financial crisis, it is critical that we continue to share resources to maximize the relief provided to struggling homeowners and ensure accountability for those who created the crisis in the first place,” said the spokesman, Damien LaVera."

Brown targets enterprise-zone tax credits,"SACRAMENTO — A battle is raging over a California program that grants businesses tax breaks for creating jobs but prevents the public from knowing who got them and why.

At issue are enterprise zones, which were established to boost employment in disadvantaged urban neighborhoods and rural areas. California is home to 40 of these special districts, in which about 35,000 companies have qualified for tax credits. Last year they reaped an estimated $700 million in credits — a figure that state tax officials project will grow to $1 billion by 2016.

Giants FedEx Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have availed themselves of these incentives, which are worth as much as $37,400 for each hire. So have small businesses, including two Sacramento strip clubs named Gold Club Inc. and Deja Vu Showgirls.

But the identities of most beneficiaries are a mystery. Because of the confidential nature of state tax laws, it’s nearly impossible to find out which companies got credits, how much they were worth and how the companies qualified for them.

Gov. Jerry Brown is now seeking to eliminate enterprise zones, which he has decried as inefficient, opaque and “loose” in handing out tax breaks. His administration contends that the program has rewarded some firms for simply moving jobs from one part of California to another and that it has helped businesses not located in impoverished areas. And it has showered benefits on low-wage industries including fast-food restaurants and retailers that do little to build middle-class jobs.

“Enterprise zones are not producing the kind of economic growth that we want,” said Kish Rajan, the director of Brown’s business development team. “Not in manufacturing or biotech research and development.”

Brown is supporting legislation that would replace the 27-year-old enterprise zone program with broader incentives. As part of his budget proposal for the year that starts July 1, Brown would redirect existing funds, spending $400 million on a sales tax credit to boost manufacturing and biotech, $200 million on incentives to provide jobs for the poor and unemployed and $100 million to reward businesses that expand in the state.

He faces powerful opposition from local governments and business groups that defend enterprise zones, calling them a crucial economic development incentive in a state that has long been considered unfriendly to business.

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is a major proponent of the zones. L.A. boasts two vast enterprise zones. One is centered in Hollywood and contained entirely within the city limits. The other is shared with the county in an area covering Highland Park, Eagle Rock, Chinatown, Boyle Heights and unincorporated areas of East Los Angeles. The county also administers the Harbor Gateway Communities Enterprise Zone with the cities of Los Angeles and Huntington Park.

Combined, these enterprise zones and others make Los Angeles County the No. 1 area in the state for handing out enterprise zone tax credits, with a 37% share in 2010, according to California tax officials.

“State enterprise zones are one of the few tools we have to create economic opportunity in the areas that need it most,” said Vicki Curry, Villaraigosa’s senior press secretary.

Businessman Martin Lopez credits the enterprise zone program with helping his small health-products business prosper. His company, Herbs of Mexico, is based in East Los Angeles with branches in Huntington Park and Fontana.

The incentives, Lopez said, helped him triple revenue and staffing over the last six years at his three stores, which sell traditional health remedies from Latin America. His business qualifies for the credits because his stores are in areas defined as economically distressed and because he hires economically disadvantaged workers such as ex-prisoners, veterans and the long-term unemployed.

“I’m very comfortable using those credits to do something worthwhile, and that helps me as a small-business owner,” he said. “It’s the first business I’ve successfully owned.”

But critics of enterprise zones say that most of the benefits flow to large companies.

According to the Franchise Tax Board, 65% of the credits issued in 2010 went to corporations with more than $1 billion in assets, 15% to companies with $100 million to $1 billion in assets and only 6% to employers with less than $10 million in assets.

A Sacramento enterprise zone recently released data showing that Wal-Mart and FedEx are among the companies that have received tax credits in its area. In Los Angeles, Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times, has also taken the incentives.

The Times, whose headquarters are in downtown L.A., “meets the qualifications of the California Enterprise Zone tax credit and has taken the credit in prior tax years,” Tribune spokesman Gary Weitman said in response to a query from a Times reporter. He declined to provide further details.

State Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo) and other lawmakers say all the secrecy makes it impossible to root out abuses or to discern whether the zones are effective. Hill is the author of a bill, SB 434, that would limit enterprise zone benefits and increase oversight and public disclosure.

“Without transparency, we and the taxpayer are in the dark,” Hill said. The enterprise zone operators “don’t want us to see what benefits businesses received and how much money it’s costing us.”

The California Assn. of Enterprise Zones contends its programs have boosted local economies. The state’s enterprise zones added 25,000 new jobs and saved 110,000 existing ones in 2012 alone, said Craig Johnson, the group’s president and the manager of an enterprise zone in Long Beach. “I’d say that’s a pretty good sign of success,” he said. The association’s data are mainly self-reported by employers.

A recent report by the state’s legislative analyst contradicted Johnson’s assessment. It said the “most rigorous research has found that [enterprise zones] do not create a net increase in jobs or increase the rate of job creation.” The analyst also raised the question of whether many of those hires would have been made anyway, without the enterprise zone incentive.

In a 2009 study, the Public Policy Institute of California said it was skeptical whether a “cash-strapped state” could afford to continue enterprise zones, given “the absence of evidence of a beneficial effect of California’s enterprise zones on job and business creation.”

Gov. Brown has lambasted the program for rewarding companies with up to five years’ worth of credits per hire for simply moving jobs from one part of the state to another, resulting in no net increase in jobs.

At a May 14 news conference, he pointed to the case of a medical and scientific supply company that has become a symbol of alleged enterprise zone abuses. Brown said that “a company that went from Brisbane to somewhere in the Central Valley” got “a tax credit for leaving one part of California to go to another.”

The company, VWR International of Radnor, Pa., last year closed its Brisbane distribution center south of San Francisco, laying off about 200 union workers, who were denied opportunities to transfer to a new facility in Visalia, 235 miles southeast in Tulare County.

VWR “took $22-an-hour jobs with family healthcare and pensions and turned them into $10-an-hour jobs with unaffordable healthcare and no retirement,” said Doug Bloch, political director for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in Northern California.

Whether VWR is getting tax credits or plans to seek them for the replacement hires in Visalia is unclear. The Sequoia Valley Enterprise Zone, which covers all of Tulare County, declined to discuss VWR’s status, citing tax confidentiality laws.

“To date, VWR has not claimed any enterprise zone tax credits or benefits,” said Valerie C. Collado, a company spokeswoman. Nevertheless, experts note that VWR appears to qualify for the incentive. Under current California law, the company could take up to four years to seek retroactive tax credits, without the public knowing about it.

The efforts by Sen. Hill and the governor still must overcome strong opposition from powerful lobbies for the local officials at dozens of enterprise zones who dole out tax credits as well as complaints from the companies that get them. Those companies make millions of dollars in political contributions to legislators and state and local elected officials.

Persuading the needed two-thirds of the members of both houses of the Legislature to get rid of a popular business tax break won’t be easy. This month, seven state senators and Assembly members from the Latino Legislative Caucus wrote to Brown, asking him to slow down his efforts to eliminate the zones.

“We are hearing from our constituencies, leaders, employees and businesses alike that the elimination of the [enterprise zone] program as we know it will potentially devastate our communities,” they wrote. “Businesses will be forced to lay off employees and/or go out of business, increasing poverty and unemployment in communities with already high rates.”

Enterprise zones have all the characteristics of “an old-fashioned political patronage system,” countered Barry Broad, a Sacramento lobbyist for labor unions. “I can deliver something to you, Mr. Businessman,” he said, “and you be friendly to me.”

The lawmakers seem to agree. Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas and a Tea Party caucus member, said in an interview on Wednesday that if American corporations wanted to send their money elsewhere, that was their choice.

“We have got to quit worrying about the next election, and start worrying about the country,” said Mr. Neugebauer, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee and is a recipient of significant donations from Wall Street.

Few of the most conservative House lawmakers draw substantial support from business political action committees, and business lobbyists acknowledged that the mere suggestion they were considering backing primary challenges next year could enhance grass-roots support for the very lawmakers they want to defeat. But the dysfunction in Washington has now turned so extreme, they said, that they had few other options.

“What we want is a conservative business person, but someone who in many respects will be more realistic, in our opinion,” said Bruce Josten, the top lobbyist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the single biggest lobbying organization in Washington.

In the two previous battles over the debt limit, many chief executives were reluctant to take sides, banding together in groups like Fix the Debt, which spent millions of dollars on a campaign urging Democrats and Republicans to work toward a “grand bargain” on the budget. But with shutdown a reality, and the clock ticking toward default, some of those same executives now place the blame squarely on conservative Republicans in the House."

Agency says that legalization would boost the retirement program%27s trust fund

Critics say the legalization will cost more than it generates

One study predicts the bill would cost %246.3 trillion over the next 50 years

The Social Security Administration estimated Wednesday that a Senate bill to overhaul immigration laws and legalize 11 million unauthorized immigrants would boost the retirement program's trust fund and help the economy.

In a letter to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the members of the Senate ""Gang of Eight"" that is pushing for the overhaul, Social Security Chief Actuary Stephen Goss estimated the bill would add 3.2 million jobs, increase the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by 1.63% and bolster the Social Security trust fund over the next 10 years.

Goss stated that many are working in an ""underground economy"" and don't pay taxes, so adding them to the tax rolls will bolster the nation's coffers. And if the security provisions of the bill reduce illegal immigration in the future by half a million people per year, Goss predicted a net positive for the country's retirement program.

""We estimate a significant increase in both the population and the number of workers paying taxes in the United States as as result of these changes in legal immigration limits,"" Goss wrote. ""Overall, we anticipate that the net effect of this bill on the long-range (Social Security trust fund) actuarial balance will be positive.""

However, those who oppose legalization of unauthorized immigrants, such as the Heritage Foundation, say allowing 11 million people who are largely low-skilled to access U.S. taxpayer-funded social benefits will cost more than it generates. A recent Heritage study predicted the bill would cost the country $6.3 trillion over the next 50 years.

The proposal from the Gang of Eight expands immigrant visa programs to attract more highly-skilled foreigners trained in science, technology, engineering and mathematics but also creates a new class of visas for lower-skilled immigrants to work in retail, hospitality, janitorial and construction work."

“Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,” senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told “Fox News Sunday.” “Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to … essentially enact the Romney economic plan. The American people rejected that, and Republicans shouldn't be doubling down on it.”

The White House effort comes three days before Obama releases his 2014 budget, which is expected to include a mix of tax increases and cuts to such entitlements as Social Security and Medicare.

“You can do both,” Pfeiffer said on ABC’s “This Week.” “That’s what you’ll see. … What we won’t do is cut our way to prosperity.”

However, the outline of the plan has already been criticized by Republicans and some of the president’s staunchest supporters.

More On This...

The release of the budget Wednesday, which will be followed by Obama meeting for dinner with Senate Republicans, is just part of a busy week in Washington.

Congress returns from a two-week break with the Senate attempting to reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration-reform legislation, and the leaders of the Democrat-controlled chamber trying to finish a gun-control proposal that might or might not include the contentious universal background checks for buyers.

Pfeiffer told Fox the meeting with Senate Republicans is simply an attempt to find a “caucus of common sense,” not end run leaders of the Republican-controlled House.

Last week, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Obama’s budget blueprint holds reforms “hostage” to tax increases. Organized labor also expressed its disappointment in the plan.

""The president should drop these misguided cuts in benefits and focus instead on building support in Congress for investing in jobs,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said.

Obama supporters disagree particularly with the part of his spending plan that calls for a new inflation formula that would reduce the annual cost of living adjustments for a range of government programs, including Social Security and benefits for veterans.

Still, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed optimism Sunday about the plan, suggesting it was at least a starting point toward an elusive, long-term budget deal between Democrats and Republicans.

""The president is showing a little bit of leg here,” Graham said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “This is somewhat encouraging. We're beginning to set the stage for the grand bargain.”

Among the highlights of the president’s plan is spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, replacing the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequester, over the same period.

The proposal also is expected to include new spending for public works projects, early education and job training, as well as $580 billion in new taxes that Republicans oppose.

Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute $4.3 trillion to total deficit reduction by 2023.

On Saturday, the president said his budget was not his “ideal plan,” but it was a compromise that he would be willing to accept.

The House and Senate have already passed their own budget plans. The House plan cuts $5.7 trillion in spending and balances the budget in 10 years while the Senate plan increases taxes by $1 trillion.

President Obama fills out his economic team with a pair of nominations

Obama picks Chicago business executive Penny Pritzker to be Commerce secretary

While House aide Michael Froman nominated for U.S. trade representative

WASHINGTON -- President Obama filled out his economic team on Thursday, nominating a long-time supporter and a top aide for the jobs of Commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative.

Obama picked Chicago business executive and political fundraiser Penny Pritzker for Commerce secretary and economic adviser Mike Froman for trade representative.

Describing both nominees as friends, Obama said Pritzker and Froman would work on what he called his top priorities: ""To grow the economy, create good middle-class jobs (and) make sure that the next generation prospers.""

Obama played up Pritzker's ties to the business community -- a group that has been critical of his administration -- but her nomination could face trouble over criticism from unions and her family's ties to a failed bank.

The Senate must confirm both Pritzker and Froman, neither of whom spoke during a brief ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.

Obama announced both nominations before departing on a three-day business trip to Mexico and Costa Rica, where trade and economic development are major agenda items.

Pritzker, who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Obama's two presidential campaigns, is on the board of Hyatt Hotels Corp. Her personal fortune is estimated at $1.85 billion, and she is listed among the 300 wealthiest Americans by Forbes magazine.

""Penny is one of our country's most distinguished business leaders,"" Obama said in unveiling his nominee. ""She's got more than 25 years of management experience in industries, including real estate, finance and hospitality. She's built companies from the ground up.""

Pritzker's nomination, long-rumored, could draw fire from Obama's union supporters. Hyatt and the hospitality workers union have been involved in a long contract battle, and workers have protested the company's treatment of them. The AFL-CIO and other organizations have called for a global boycott of Hyatt properties.

Senators may also grill Pritzker over the 2001 collapse of family-owned Superior Bank, which specialized in sub-prime lending, and federal lawsuits against her family over Caribbean tax shelters.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said of the nomination: ""Every nominee's offshore tax avoidance activities should be examined as part of the nomination process.""

Obama considered Pritzker for Commerce secretary after his election in 2008, but she withdrew from consideration.

Noting that Pritzker turned 54 years old on Thursday, Obama joked: ""So for your birthday present, you get to go through confirmation -- it's going to be great.""

The Commerce Department has been led by Acting Secretary Rebecca Blank since John Bryson resigned last summer amid health concerns. Blank is leaving the administration to become chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Pritzker worked as Obama's national fundraising chairwoman for the 2008 presidential campaign, using her extensive business connections to help catapult him into the White House.

In 2012, Pritzker had a lower profile. While she was listed among the more than 750 Obama bundlers who collected money from family, friends and associates for his re-election, she was not among the supporters who contributed to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC raising unlimited amounts to aid the Obama campaign.

Pritzker's relative absence was noted by Democratic insiders, particularly as Priorities USA Action struggled to raise money to compete with deep-pocketed Republican super PACs.

As for the trade post, Froman is a long-time friend of Obama -- they worked together on the Harvard Law Review -- and has served as the president's deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. Obama said Froman has been the ""point person"" and the ""driving force"" behind more than a dozen international economic summits.

Citing their years together at Harvard Law School, Obama joked: ""He was much smarter than me then -- he continues to be smarter than me now.""

Froman also raised money Obama's first presidential campaign in 2008.

If confirmed by the Senate, Froman would replace Ron Kirk, who left the U.S. trade representative position earlier this year.

Obama noted that Froman worked with Kirk on new free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.

Critics of Obama's trade policies noted that, over the years, Froman has also backed such ""corporate"" deals as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and that many of these agreements have led to the transfer of manufacturing jobs to other countries.

""Folks on Main Street have cause for concern, unlike Froman's former Wall Street colleagues,"" said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.

Obama touted Froman's trade record, saying, ""Mike believes -- just as I believe and just as Penny believes -- that our workers are the most competitive in the world, so they deserve a level playing field.""

President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats have repeatedly argued that they will not negotiate with the GOP on the budget until the government is reopened and the House stops using the $16.7 trillion debt limit as a lever to extract concessions. The limit is expected to be reached Oct. 17, but the House bill would push the debt ceiling back to around Thanksgiving.

""What we want to do is offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, an agreement to go to conference on the budget, for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government, and start to deal with America's pressing problems,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters on Capitol Hill.

""I would hope that the president will look at this as an opportunity and a good-faith effort on our part to move halfway, halfway to what he's demanding in order to have these conversations,"" he continued.

Several lawmakers said the debt bill could move as soon as Friday if Obama agrees to open up talks on other topics.

Yet reaction from the White House was not very positive, although press secretary Jay Carney said that if a clean debt ceiling bill actually reaches the president's desk, Obama would sign it.

Still, Carney reiterated the administration position that the White House doesn't see the debt ceiling being raised or the government being opened as any sort of concession, but as part of Congress' job.

""Our position is clear: they ought to turn on the lights, they ought to pay our bills,"" Carney said. ""The logic here is that they would harm the American economy and the American people in order to try to extract concessions from the president and their counterparts on Capitol Hill. That's an unsustainably bad proposition.""

Similarly, Senate Democrats did not seem impressed by the deal.

""Republicans may let one hostage go, but they are keeping a gun to the head of the other, while reserving the right to kidnap the first one again in a few weeks,"" an aide to Senate leadership told HuffPost on background, because the House's formal legislation has yet to be released.

It remains unclear if the Senate would go along with a short-term bill. Democrats introduced a measure in the upper chamber that would extend the debt limit for more than a year.

Ahead of a Thursday afternoon meeting between two-dozen Republicans and the White House, one Republican agreed that all the proposal does is essentially move the goal posts.

""We haven't changed our position, only the timeline,"" said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.). ""There won't be a vote on a temporary extension of the debt limit unless the president agrees this afternoon to sit down and talk with us.""

Yet even GOP reaction to the House plan seemed mixed coming out of the Republicans' closed-door meeting Thursday morning. After leaders presented the plan to members, many echoed Boehner in saying it was a show of good faith to the White House. But hard-line conservatives like Iowa Rep. Steve King said he was not ""enthusiastic"" about the deal, and others said they would only back the bill if the president pledges to begin negotiations on broader fiscal issues.

Although a half-dozen lawmakers leaving the meeting said the House's proposed debt-ceiling hike has no riders, The Wall Street Journal reported there was one possible wrinkle that would permanently ban the sorts of ""extraordinary measures"" that Treasury secretaries have long used to keep bills paid during debt limit debates.

The United States actually began brushing up against the debt limit in May, and since then the Treasury has essentially been borrowing from itself and raising pension funds to meet obligations. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said that while he thought the House bill was ""clean,"" he was concerned about how it deals with the measures Treasury has already taken. A six-week measure would add about $90 billion to the debt, but undoing all the steps taken going back to May could make the tab more like $300 billion, he said. ""If it says a date certain [six weeks], how do you take into account reimbursement of the federal government and our creditors for the extraordinary measures that the Treasury Department has been using since May?"" he said.

With Carney repeating the position that the president will not negotiate on opening the government, it seemed unlikely that the White House meeting would prove fruitful.

However, if Boehner's offer of a conference committee comes through, negotiations with the White House might not be required. Congress has the ability to work out its differences on its own through such a committee, with members from both chambers sitting down to craft a spending plan, as they have so far failed to do.

(CNN) —

In the middle of his first congressional hearing as the new head of the embattled Internal Revenue Service, Daniel Werfel was asked Monday how he would restore public trust in the agency after revelations that conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status were targeted for extra scrutiny.

“It is going to be a difficult process,” acknowledged Werfel, a career public servant appointed by President Barack Obama last month to clean up the mess that is dominating news headlines early in his second term.

Werfel described a process of identifying what happened, who was responsible and steps to ensure it can never happen again to address what Republicans depict as politically motivated harassment that abused constitutional rights of conservative groups.

’Liar’ charge a step too far for some Republicans

Democrats, while expressing outrage over the IRS targeting, reject Republican inferences that it was a broad political conspiracy reaching as high up as the White House.

In addition to the targeting uncovered by a Treasury inspector general, a second audit coming out this week described improper spending on IRS conferences to buttress GOP portrayals of big government gone wild under Obama.

The IRS spent close to $50 million on 225 conferences between 2010 and 2012, according to briefings given to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by the inspector-general overseeing the IRS. One of those, an August 2010 meeting for 2,700 employees in Anaheim, California, cost $4 million, and the agency spent $50,000 to produce two videos that were shown at the event, including one with a “Star Trek” theme.

In a response to the new audit, obtained by a congressional source, the IRS says it has cut training costs and reduced spending on meetings by 87% since 2010.

“The expenditures related to this 2010 meeting are not reflective of the current spending environment at the IRS or the spending that has occurred over the past several years,” wrote Pamela LaRue, the agency’s chief financial officer.

But LaRue defended the need for large-scale conferences at the time. Nearly a third of managers in the division under scrutiny were inexperienced, and the agency faced added concerns about security after a Texas man crashed his plane into the IRS office in Austin, killing himself and two other people.

“Although the average cost per employee was reasonable, the IRS recognizes that a number of less significant costs warranted additional scrutiny and were not the best use of government resources,” she wrote.

IRS faces new battle on overspending

Rep. Hal Rogers, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee who sat in on his panel’s Financial Service’s subcommittee on Monday, made clear that he would assess the effectiveness and commitment by Werfel to uncover the source of the wrongdoing when considering IRS funding for next fiscal year.

“The power of the purse rests in the Congress, and we’re prepared to use that purse to get to the truth,” the Kentucky Republican said.

Two more congressional hearings are scheduled for this week as Republicans seek to keep up the pressure on Obama and Democrats over the controversies.

They follow three previous hearings by House and Senate panels, and the matter also is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Treasury inspector generals office and Werfel in his new capacity.

A former Office of Management and Budget official, Werfel took over from former IRS Commissioner Steve Miller, who resigned under pressure after news of the targeting emerged. He described himself Monday as a fixer of problems in government.

“The IRS is an agency in need right now,” Werfel said, adding that he took the job “because I thought it could be helpful.”

That didn’t impress some Republicans on the Financial Services subcommittee, who expressed frustration with the lack of answers to their main question – who ordered the targeting?

Issa: Cincinnati IRS employees say direction came from Washington

Werfel said he also was frustrated and urged patience to allow the various investigations underway to work through the process.

Both Werfel and J. Russell George, the inspector general who conducted the audit that revealed the IRS targeting, repeated past assertions that the findings so far indicated gross mismanagement rather than political malfeasance.

Read IRS watchdog’s report

Meanwhile, White House spokesman Jay Carney sought to tone down the rhetoric over an increasingly bitter dispute with congressional Republicans over the issue.

Asked by reporters about an accusation by House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa that he was a “paid liar,” Carney at first jokingly feigned ignorance, answering: “I hadn’t heard that. That’s amazing.”

As laughter erupted in the briefing room, Carney took a more serious tone.

“I am not going to get into a back-and-forth with” Issa, he said, adding that the White House focus was on finding out what “inappropriate activity” occurred, hold responsible those at fault for “inappropriate, outrageous activity” and ensure it never happens again.

It was a diplomatic effort to avoid prolonging headlines about harsh statements Sunday from Issa and a former White House official that escalated the controversy into a full-fledged Washington political imbroglio, including name-calling and references to decades-old allegations of wrongdoing.

Carney brushes off Issa remark

Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Issa said Sunday that the White House was misleading the public about the full magnitude of the IRS targeting, in which some conservative groups seeking tax exempt status were singled out for extra scrutiny.

In particular, he called Carney a “paid liar” and claimed that interviews with IRS officials in the Cincinnati office that considered requests for tax-exempt status showed that Washington officials were involved.

However, he stopped short of providing proof of his claim, saying only that further investigation would reveal “the whole truth.”

In response, former White House adviser David Plouffe, a Democratic strategist, denied any political motivation in the IRS targeting.

In a tweet posted later Sunday, Plouffe referred to Issa’s comments as “strong words from Mr Grand Theft Auto and suspected arsonist/insurance swindler.”

By the Numbers: Internal Revenue Service

The tweet also called Issa “loose ethically today,” adding a link to a story about Issa’s appearance on CNN.

Plouffe’s tweet referred to allegations from 1972 and 1982 against Issa, the former owner of a car alarm company.

In 1972, then-19-year-old Issa was arrested under suspicion of stealing a car, but charges were ultimately dropped. Issa’s brother, on the other hand, is a convicted car thief.

In 1982, the office and factory of two companies Issa had purchased – Quantum Enterprises and Steal Stopper International – caught fire.

The insurance company’s investigation found “suspicious burn patterns” and company officials noted that in the month before the fire, Issa had increased his insurance from $100,000 to $462,000. Again, no criminal charges were filed.

IRS investigation takes nasty turn

He had been urging his Senate colleagues all week to oppose ending debate as a way to force Democrats to accept language defunding the Affordable Care Act. But with the clock ticking toward a shutdown, an overwhelming bipartisan majority wanted to act quickly to move the spending bill back to the House.

The Senate legislation would almost certainly win approval, largely with Democratic votes, if it was put to a vote in the House, but conservatives warned that it could hurt the beleaguered speaker dearly if he took that step.

“I think it would be devastating to the speaker’s support,” said Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina, one of the members urging the Republican leadership to drive a hard bargain with the Senate.

“I think the question is, Do we go with the carrot or the stick strategy?” Mr. Hudson added. “Do we try to do something bad enough to force Harry Reid to negotiate with us, or do we do something that we think he can’t refuse?”

Republicans may also consider a simple bill to keep the government open for as little as seven days while the legislative jousting continues. That was sternly opposed by senior Republicans, like Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee."

The White House kicked off ""sequester week"" by putting Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood on Sunday shows to again warn that automatic budget cuts will lead to long lines at airports.

LaHood told CNN's State of the Union that the cuts set to take effect Friday will force the government to furlough many air-traffic controllers, leading to delays of flights and backing up thousands of passengers.

Air-traffic control is ""a big part of our budget,"" said LaHood, who delivered the same kind of message Friday to reporters in the White House briefing room.

On NBC's Meet The Press, LaHood said the Federal Aviation Administration will not compromise safety, but ""we will have to work with the airlines to slow planes down.""

LaHood is a Republican and a former U.S. House member from Illinois. He urged his former congressional colleagues to look for a way to avoid the sequester, telling NBC ""this does not have to happen.""

The $85 billion in automatic budget cuts, known as the sequester, are set to take effect March 1 -- Friday -- unless Obama and congressional Republicans reach a new debt reduction deal.

Expect the White House to spend every day before Friday talking about the impact of cuts that affect defense and domestic programs.

President Obama has proposed avoiding the sequester with a new debt reduction agreement that includes higher taxes on the wealthy as well as budget cuts; the new revenues would come by closing loopholes and ending certain deductions.

Congressional Republicans say Obama got higher tax rates to avoid the last budget standoff -- ""the fiscal cliff"" -- and this deal should focus on reduced spending.

Some Republicans are also accusing the administration of exaggerating the impact of cuts to put political pressure on the GOP; Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said last week that ""the president is making stuff up."""

http://news.yahoo.com/panetta-defense-budget-cuts-damage-economy-154844125--finance.html,,[],Panetta: Defense budget cuts will damage economy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Wednesday laid out a grim list of spending cuts the Pentagon will have to make in the coming weeks that he said will seriously damage the country's economy and degrade the military's ability to respond to a crisis.

Slamming members of Congress as irresponsible, Panetta said lawmakers are willing to push the country off a fiscal cliff to damage their opposing political parties.

He said that if Congress doesn't pass a budget the Pentagon will have to absorb $46 billion in spending reductions in this fiscal year and will face a $35 billion shortfall in operating expenses.

""My fear is that there is a dangerous and callous attitude that is developing among some Republicans and some Democrats, that these dangerous cuts can be allowed to take place in order to blame the other party for the consequences,"" Panetta said in a speech at Georgetown University. ""This is a kind of 'so what?' attitude that says, 'Let's see how bad it can get in order to have the other party blink'.""

In separate, highly detailed memos sent to Congress, the military services described widespread civilian furloughs, layoffs and hiring freezes that will hit workers all around the country. Overall, the military will furlough 800,000 civilian workers for 22 days, spread across more than five months, and will lay off as many as 46,000 temporary and contract employees.

The Navy says it will cease deployments to South America and the Caribbean and limit those to Europe.

The Air Force warned that it would cut operations at various missile defense radar sites from 24 hours to eight hours. And the Army said it would cancel training center rotations for four brigades and cancel repairs for thousands of vehicles, radios and weapons.

""These steps would seriously damage the fragile American economy, and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe,"" Panetta said, adding that the self-made crisis ""undermines the men and women in uniform who are willing to put their lives on the line in order to protect this country.""

In addition to all of the more immediate cuts, U.S. troops are also likely to see a smaller pay hike next year than initially planned, due to strains on the budget. According to a defense official, the Pentagon will recommend that the military get a 1 percent pay increase in 2014, instead of a 1.7 percent raise.

The Georgetown appearance was likely one of Panetta's last speeches. He is set to leave the Pentagon this month. Former Republican senator Chuck Hagel has been nominated to take his place and a vote by the Senate Armed Services Committee is expected this week."

It has been corrected.

With his signature this week, President Obama will lock into place deep spending cuts that threaten to undermine his second-term economic vision just four months after he won reelection.

Obama has repeatedly championed a set of government investments that he argues would expand the economy and strengthen the middle class, including bolstering early-childhood education, spending more on research and development, and upgrading the nation’s roads and railways. He has said his comfortable reelection victory in November shows the country is with him.

But none of those policies have come close to being enacted. Instead, after returning this weekend from a trip to the Middle East, Obama is set to sign a government funding measure that leaves in place the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration — a policy that undermines many of the goals he laid out during the 2012 campaign.

Obama thinks the cuts are, in his words, “dumb,” and he says they will slow the economy and harm priorities by cutting spending on education, research and development, and many other programs. Yet Obama now finds himself enacting a broad domestic policy that he doesn’t support and that he believes will harm the country.

“What he got in terms of the sequester is clearly incompatible with his investment plans,” said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economic adviser.

Obama is in this predicament after failing to persuade congressional Republicans to agree to a plan of tax hikes and more targeted spending cuts to replace the sequester. The president misjudged his GOP opponents, who have held firm in opposing more tax increases and, so far, have decided to stomach the sequester cuts.

House Republicans, who passed a budget last week with even deeper domestic spending cuts than the sequester, say Obama should be able to manage the government with significantly less spending.

“We want to restrain spending. They want to spend more,” House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said last week after passing the House budget. “We think taxpayers give enough to Washington.”

One of the clearest examples of Obama’s dilemma is early-childhood education, a centerpiece of his State of the Union speech in February. Obama has proposed offering preschool to all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families, which research suggests would help move children up the economic ladder.

The idea isn’t cheap. W. Steven Barnett, the director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers, who was consulted by the White House, has estimated it could cost up to $10 billion a year.

Rather than raising new funds to pay to expand early-childhood education, however, Obama is now being forced to slash it. The sequester this year will cut about $400 million from the Head Start early-childhood education program, which will mean that tens of thousands of poor children would lose access to it, according to the administration.

“It’s not in the right direction, and it is disappointing,” Barnett said.

The administration never expected the sequester to happen, a former official says, and Obama himself said during a debate last year that it would not occur. White House officials had judged that deep defense cuts included in the sequester would move Republicans — who had warned loudly of risks to the Pentagon — to embrace an alternative, as they did in a Jan. 1 tax deal that delayed the cuts for two months.

Obama has proposed changes to Medicare, Social Security and other programs to generate savings, as well as scaling back hundreds of billions of dollars of tax breaks that benefit the wealthy and corporations. Republicans oppose any new taxes.

Obama could have forced a confrontation over the sequester, threatening to shut down the government if Congress insisted on the spending cuts. He chose a different strategy, avoiding an immediate fiscal crisis while encouraging Congress to spend several months on its own trying to find a solution.

Historians note that presidents sometimes get what they want, as Obama did with health-care reform, or they are rebuffed, as George W. Bush was in attempting to privatize Social Security. But rarely do presidents find themselves enacting major policies they fundamentally oppose.

Lawrence Mishel, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, said Obama shoulders part of the blame. Since 2010, he said, Obama has spent too much time focused on the debt, including agreeing to significantly shrink domestic spending as part of his own budget proposals.

“I think they brought it on themselves to the extent that they validated the deficit issue,” Mishel said. “It was always the case that the actual budget policy being pursued contradicted the rhetoric in the campaign. Now it’s even worse.”

White House officials say they will continue to press forward on proposals that would not require new federal funding, such as raising the minimum wage, opening manufacturing institutes, revamping housing policies and overhauling immigration laws.

“The reality is that the president’s economic vision is broad and his economic strategy is calibrated to try to make progress on a number of fronts,” said Brian Deese, a top White House economic adviser. “There is no reason why we can’t work on issues where there is and has been bipartisan support in the past, and the existence of the sequester today shouldn’t stop that.”

Advisers say they also won’t give up on replacing the sequester, rejecting the notion that it will be permanent. The budget measure expires at the end of September, and another battle is already brewing for the summer. Obama will continue to nurture relationships with Republicans potentially willing to compromise.

“The president has already got public opinion on his side. He’s got an election on his side,” said Ben LaBolt, a Democratic strategist who was the spokesman for Obama’s reelection campaign. “Now he has to go get a separate set of votes.”

The sequester undermines Obama’s vision for middle class-driven economic growth in two significant ways, economists and his allies say. First, it takes tens of billions of dollars out of the economy in the next six months. The Congressional Budget Office, echoing other analysts, says that will slow the economy by 0.6 percent this year and destroy 750,000 jobs.

Second, the sequester reduces spending on non-defense discretionary spending, a budget category with a mouthful of a name but a central role in the president’s plans. This is the part of the budget where government invests in programs that pay off in the future, like education or clean energy research.

The sequester cuts more than $25 billion from discretionary spending in the next six months, a 5 percent reduction. It saves $1.2 trillion by cutting discretionary and defense spending over the decade. These budgets were already under pressure as a result of a summer 2011 deal to constrain spending.

“The sequester cuts the things that are the investments and spending that are the best for long-term economic growth,” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, which is also close to the White House.

Obama’s supporters say he has already accomplished a lot toward his vision of helping the middle class — namely by securing the revenue from $600 billion in tax hikes at the start of the year and through his health-care overhaul.

Some say that might have to be enough, given the Republican opposition in Congress is intent on dramatically shrinking government services.

“He has to be the firewall presidency,” said Douglas Brinkley, a historian at Rice University. “All he is really ultimately trying to do is protect the progressive legacy of the New Deal.”"

So far, at least 29 Republicans have said they're on board -- exceeding the 217 votes needed to pass a ""clean"" funding bill if all 200 House Democrats joined them and voted in favor. Of course, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put such a bill on the floor in the first place. But if he did, the votes appear to be there for passage, at which point the bill would sail through the Senate and be signed by President Barack Obama, ending the shutdown.

HuffPost has been keeping a running tally of which Republicans have said they're done trying to force through provisions to delay or defund Obamacare in order to keep the government running. That list is below.

But as of Tuesday, Oct. 8, we're adding another category: Republicans in that group who have since changed their minds and say they will no longer support a bill that simply reopens the government without extra provisions. Four Republicans have flip-flopped as of Oct. 8, which means the total number of GOP members who publicly support a clean continuing resolution is back down to 25.

That's below the poverty line for a family of two, and it's not changing as long as Republicans control the House. But that doesn't mean that it's something to give up on, or that nothing can change for minimum wage workers. The past year saw a call to raise the minimum wage in the State of the Union address, only to have congressional Democrats push for a bigger raise than the president had proposed. And in November, President Obama got behind Sen. Tom Harkin and Rep. George Miller's bill to raise the wage to $10.10. The real action, though, the action that has already concretely changed people's lives, is at the state or even local level.

New York's minimum wage will rise from the federal level of $7.25 to $8 on December 31, then increase to $8.75 at the end of 2014 and $9 at the end of 2015; the minimum wage for tipped workers will also increase. The state Assembly had passed an increase in 2012, only to have it blocked by Republicans in the state Senate.

Rhode Island raised its minimum wage from $7.75 to $8 starting January 1, 2014, which is more a level it should be raised from , but yet puts the state ahead of the federal minimum wage by 75 cents, so ... better than nothing.

, but yet puts the state ahead of the federal minimum wage by 75 cents, so ... better than nothing. Connecticut's state legislature passed and Gov. Dannel Malloy signed a law increasing the minimum wage from $8.25 an hour to $8.70 on January 1, then to $9 on January 1, 2015.

California's minimum wage, currently at $8 an hour, will go up to $9 in mid-2014 and to $10 by 2016, thanks to a law passed by the state legislature and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown.

New Jersey voters passed a minimum wage increase to $8.25 an hour and then tie it to inflation—the same day they re-elected Gov. Chris Christie, who had previously vetoed a similar bill.

The city of SeaTac, Washington, voted to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour. The particularly charming thing about that is that SeaTac the city includes SeaTac the airport, meaning a concentrated hub of low-wage jobs will be affected. However, the vote was close and a challenge is likely.

Washington, DC, and two adjoining Maryland counties are raising the wage to $11.50 an hour. The combination of DC and the two counties will mean an area with a minimum wage higher than any state for an area with a population larger than that of 15 states (and the District of Columbia, it should go without saying). There's also a prospect for more in Washington—I'm told a drive by DC Working Families and other groups to put an increase to $12.50 and a raise for tipped workers on the 2014 ballot will continue regardless.

Several states have already indexed their minimum wage to inflation, meaning that workers in those states will get a small raise at the beginning of the year. It may not help them get much ahead, but least—unlike workers on the federal minimum wage—they won't be falling further behind.

Those states, counties, and cities represent a big chunk of the American population, and a lot of workers getting a raise. Prospects are good for 2014, too. The Massachusetts state Senate has passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $11 and the tipped worker minimum to $5.50 by 2016, and if the state House and governor don't seal the deal, there's a ballot initiative effort already underway. Delaware appears ready to go up a dollar to $8.25. There's that ballot initiative in Washington, DC, and a push for an increase to $15 in Seattle. There are also plans for ballot initiatives in Idaho, Alaska and South Dakota.

But the best prospect of all would be Democrats getting control of Congress and increasing the minimum wage at the federal level."

Many Washington insiders have assumed that if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, Obama could simply cut spending. But constitutional history says otherwise.

When President Richard Nixon tried to “impound” money that Congress had ordered him to spend, the courts slapped him down. During Bill Clinton’s administration, the Supreme Court ruled that the president has only a limited ability to cut spending even with congressional authorization. He has no constitutional power to cut spending without such authorization.

If every action the president might plausibly take would usurp a power of Congress, what should he do? He should minimize the usurpation.

During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln unilaterally suspended habeas corpus. Lincoln argued that if that decision was unconstitutional, it was nonetheless necessary to avoid a greater evil: violating his constitutional oath to defend the Union. Faced with a dilemma, Lincoln chose the less unconstitutional course.

The same goes for this president from Illinois. If Congress creates a trilemma, he must choose the least unconstitutional option.

Some commentators suggest that the Treasury could generate $2 trillion for the government by minting two platinum coins, using an obscure law that was enacted for the express purpose of creating memorabilia. But doing so would be economically equivalent to borrowing $2 trillion and thus, even if technically legal, would violate the substance of the debt ceiling law.

In a constitutional crisis, analysis should rest on constitutional principles, not technicalities. The core issue is separation of powers: What course of action would minimize the executive taking over legislative authority?

The answer is violating the debt ceiling, not cutting spending or raising taxes. By borrowing exactly enough money to cover the difference between funds in the Treasury and expenditures required by law, the president would simply be implementing Congress’ budget.

By contrast, a presidential decision to raise taxes or cut spending would require many policy-laden judgments: Whose taxes would be raised and by how much? What expenditures would be cut, to what degree and according to what criteria?

For the president to make these quintessentially legislative judgments on his own would usurp power on an enormous scale. Issuing debt beyond the debt ceiling would be unconstitutional but not as unconstitutional as raising taxes or cutting spending.

Despite some confusion, Obama has kept the least unconstitutional option on the table. In December, White House press secretary Jay Carney said that the “administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the president the power to ignore the debt ceiling.”

That observation is beside the point. True, some scholars argue that the debt ceiling violates Section 4 of the 14th Amendment. If so, then the debt ceiling is void and the president’s power to borrow money comes, not from the 14th Amendment, but from the statute authorizing the Treasury secretary to “borrow on the credit of the United States government amounts necessary for expenditures authorized by law.”

Putting aside the 14th Amendment, Carney’s claim at most shows that unilaterally raising the debt ceiling would override Congress’ borrowing authority. But that merely states one horn of the trilemma. Unilaterally raising taxes or cutting spending would usurp more congressional authority.

Our leaders can still act responsibly by raising the debt ceiling or, better yet, by repealing it entirely. Congress can then control federal debt simply by paying attention to the gap between spending and taxes. It should not force the president to usurp one of its powers.

But if Congress leaves the president no constitutional options, he must choose the least unconstitutional one: borrowing money beyond the debt ceiling.

* Bernanke says won't see 6 percent jobless rate until 2016

* Fed chief tries to calm concerns over risks of policies

* ""Significant majority"" support policy course

* One Fed hawk, Fisher, calls for immediate tapering of QE

By Pedro Nicolaci da Costa and Jonathan Spicer

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. jobless rate is unlikely to reach more normal levels for several years, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday as he again defended the central bank's forceful easing of monetary policy.

Appearing before a congressional panel for a second straight day, Bernanke downplayed signs of internal divisions at the Fed, saying the policy of quantitative easing, or QE, has the support of a ""significant majority"" of top central bank officials.

One lawmaker asked Bernanke when the economy might produce enough jobs to bring the unemployment rate, currently at 7.9 percent, down to 6 percent - the top of the Fed's long-term forecast range.

""A reasonable guess for 6 percent would be around 2016, about three more years,"" Bernanke told the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.

Moreover, as he had in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, the Fed chairman countered the notion that the Fed's loose monetary stance might be fueling asset bubbles or inflation.

""It's our view that there's still a good bit of slack in the economy. I don't think the economy is overheating,"" he said.

Financial markets were again encouraged by Bernanke's remarks, with stocks rallying for a second day on the Fed chief's signal of continued stimulus combined with enthusiasm over strong figures on business investment plans.

""He is going to be refilling the punchbowl for a very long time,"" said Keith Bliss, senior vice-president at Cuttone & Co in New York.

In response to the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-2009, the Fed slashed official borrowing costs to effectively zero and bought more than $2.5 trillion in mortgage and Treasury securities to keep long-term rates low.

It is currently buying $45 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage bonds per month, a policy Fed officials backed in an 11-1 vote in January. However, minutes of that meeting released last week showed many officials had concerns over the risks presented by the central bank's policy course.

Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who is among the minority of so-called hawks at the central bank, said later on Wednesday that he would like the Fed to immediately taper the purchases because the U.S. housing market is on sounder footing.

""The fact that the housing market gears have now begun to mesh is why I believe we are running the risk of overkill by continuing our mortgage-backed securities purchase program at the current pace, and I have suggested that we begin tapering those purchases,"" Fisher said at Columbia University.

""Personally I would begin tapering Treasuries as well,"" he later told reporters. ""I would like to start now. I just don't think the benefits are worth the costs.""

But most Fed officials are eager to continue the extraordinarily easy policies given the high jobless rate and the fact that inflation is below their 2 percent target, and they do not want to derail a recovery that has faltered in each of the last three years.

Bernanke argued the Fed's policy easing deserves at least some credit for the ongoing economic recovery, even if growth remains fragile and vulnerable to looming short-run spending cuts from the U.S. government.

Indeed, he argued that current plans for abrupt short-term deficit reduction could be counterproductive, even for the purposes of reducing government debt levels.

""I'm still concerned about the short-run impact on jobs,"" he said. ""(You) don't get as much benefit as you think because if you slow the economy that hurts your revenues and that means your deficit reduction is not as big as you think it is.""

A number Republicans on the House committee said they also were concerned about the Fed's actions.

""For diminishing marginal benefits, the Federal Reserve's unconventional strategy creates considerable risks,"" said Representative Jeb Hensarling, the panel's chairman. ""If the (Fed's) balance sheet is not unwound at the right time and at the right pace, we could be looking at another deep recession, soaring inflation or skyrocketing interest rates.""

Bernanke tried to soothe such worries, expressed by a number of lawmakers, that the central bank was so far into uncharted policy territory that an exit could be problematic.

Admitting the Fed would face an unprecedented task, Bernanke nonetheless said the central bank has the right tools to exit when the time comes, adding that those measures have been tested and used in other countries."

The revolving door between government and business is just one symptom of a bigger picture.

Political appointees in the executive branch should pay an extra income tax when they leave for high-paying jobs.

We should have hearings on this%2C where witnesses can talk about the extent of the revolving-door problem.

A few weeks back, I wrote here about taxing the revolving door that takes people back and forth between the federal government and the various industries that federal government agencies regulate. My proposal was to put a surtax -- 50%, say, or maybe 75% -- on the post-government earnings of federal officials in excess of their government salaries for the first five years: Leave a federal job paying $100,000 a year for an industry job paying $600,000 a year, and you'd pay a $250,000 surtax. After all, with folks leaving the Obama administration, as they left previous administrations, for salaries several times what they earned in the public sector, and with excessive entanglement between government and business a growing problem, why not use the power of the IRS to modify behavior?

I didn't think my proposal would go very far, but maybe I was too pessimistic. It seems that people are noticing and approving.

Not long after my column ran, it got an endorsement from Boston Herald,which noted: ""In his 2008 campaign, President Obama promised to 'close the revolving door.' It's still open."" And spinning more furiously than ever.""

And now Democratic eminence grise Bill Moyers has climbed on board as well. Writing with Michael Winship in the Huffington Post, Moyers observes: ""Imagine -- conservatives and libertarians making a favorable comparison to the capital gains tax! This and that Russian meteor may be signs of the apocalypse. Just gives you an idea of how deeply awful and anti-democratic the revolving door is, no matter which side you're on. That's why it has to be slowed down if not completely stopped -- and why we'll keep talking about it.""

The revolving door is just one symptom of a bigger picture: Whatever claims our political class makes about the general welfare, it is really running things mostly for its own benefit. That's why comparisons to theHunger Games, where the fat-cats in the Capital City live it up while the provinces starve, keep coming. Addressing the revolving door problem won't solve things, either, but it might help. And since it's getting more attention, perhaps I should flesh this idea out a bit more.

First, I'd apply it only to political appointees in the executive branch, at least to begin with. I'd be thrilled to apply it to congressional staffers -- and to members of Congress -- as well, but I think that such a bill would face too much opposition in, well, Congress to make it through. But if executive officials are subject to this sort of law, the pressure will grow to extend it the legislative branch as well. (And I wouldn't apply it to people who aren't political appointees because it seems unfair to slap a surtax on someone who finishes his hitch in the Marines and joins a private-security company).

Second, we might want to adjust things for people who take a pay cut when joining federal service: Perhaps if someone made more money before taking a government job, we should only tax earnings in excess of what he or she earned before. So leave a $250,000 job at a bank to take a $125,000 job with the feds, and when you leave the surtax applies only to your earnings in excess of $250K.

These are the sorts of details that the staff at the House and Senate tax committees, and the regulatory staff at the IRS, are used to addressing. Perhaps we should have some hearings on this, where witnesses can talk about the extent of the revolving-door problem, and approaches to dealing with it. Is a surtax the best one? Maybe yes, maybe no. But it will help, and it will certainly draw attention to the problem.

IRS targeted conservatives, despite spike in applications from labor groups","While IRS officials attributed the agency's heavy scrutiny on conservative groups to the spike in applications over the past few years, fresh reports and figures are raising questions about whether the agency knowingly applied a double standard.

A highly anticipated watchdog report, released late Tuesday by the inspector general's office, depicted an even bigger spike in applications for tax-exempt status from a type of group that includes labor organizations. Yet, according to the report, the conservative groups were the ones singled out for special treatment.

This special treatment included the agency creating a unique ""be on the lookout"" list. The list covered ""political-sounding"" names like Tea Party, Patriots, and 9/12. The criteria, labeled by the report as ""inappropriate,"" later expanded to include groups focused on government spending, government debt, taxes and other areas.

The IRS has explained that low-level staffers at an Ohio office were effectively scrambling to deal with an influx in applications from these groups, for tax-exempt status known in the IRS code as 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4).

But around the same time, there was another influx of cases under a classification known as 501(c)(5). This is the tax-exempt status that applies to labor organizations, as well as agricultural and horticultural groups.

More On This...

While the number of applications from these groups was not as high as the number from the other two categories, the increase in applications in both 2011 and 2012 was far more pronounced. The number increased by 41 percent in 2011, and then by a whopping 164 percent in 2012.

By comparison, the number of 501(c)(4) cases rose 30 percent, and then 48 percent in that time period. The IG report said the numbers could not be independently verified.

Conservatives have claimed since Friday, when Exempt Organizations Division chief Lois Lerner first admitted to the practice, that the selective scrutiny was politically motivated. Further, they've alleged that it may have gone well beyond the Ohio office.

""It's hard for me to imagine that this is just a bunch of low-ranking apparatchiks,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told Fox News on Wednesday, complaining about what he called ""selective"" treatment of these organizations by the IRS.

The IRS, in a statement released after the IG report was made public, acknowledged that its original approach for handling the ""influx"" of applications was ""inappropriate.""

However, the agency explained it is required to ensure tax-exempt groups are engaging in ""legally permissible political activity.""

""Centralizing these cases was necessary to achieve consistent treatment. After seeing issues with particular cases, inappropriate shortcuts were used to determine which cases may be engaging in political activities. It is important to note that the vast majority of these cases would still have been centralized based on the general criteria used for other cases,"" the IRS said.

But other news reports underscored the difference in the agency's treatment of various politically tinged groups. USA Today reported that during the two-year period when Tea Party applications were being held up, the IRS approved roughly a dozen applications from liberal and progressive groups.

The groups included those with words like ""progress"" or ""progressive"" in their names, and reportedly were engaged in the same types of activities as those organizations whose applications were held up.

The Daily Caller also reported that Lerner in 2011 approved an application for the charity run by Obama's half brother -- the Barack H. Obama Foundation.

While some Tea Party applications sat at the IRS office for years, the charity's application was approved within a month."

Negotiators talked into the evening as senators from both parties coalesced around a plan that would lift the debt limit through Feb. 7, pass a resolution to finance the government through Jan. 15 and conclude formal discussions on a long-term tax and spending plan no later than Dec. 13, according to one Senate aide briefed on the plan.

But while both Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, praised the progress that was made in the Senate, it was already clear that the most conservative members of the House were not going to go along quietly with a plan that does not accomplish their goal from the outset of this two-week-old crisis: dismantling the president’s health care law.

“We’ve got a name for it in the House: it’s called the Senate surrender caucus,” said Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas. “Anybody who would vote for that in the House as Republican would virtually guarantee a primary challenger.”"

The nation's tax agency has admitted to inappropriately scrutinizing smaller tea party organizations that applied for tax-exempt status, and senior Treasury Department officials were notified in the midst of the 2012 presidential election season that an internal investigation was underway. But the IRS largely maintained a hands-off policy with the much larger, big-budget organizations on the left and right that were most influential in the elections and are organized under a section of the tax code that allows them to hide their donors.

""The IRS goes AWOL when wealthy and powerful forces want to break the law in order to hide their wrongful efforts and secret political influence,"" said Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat who is among a small Senate group pushing campaign finance reform measures that would force these big outside groups to disclose their donors. ""Picking on the little guy is a pretty lousy thing to do.""

Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS and the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity were among those that spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and get-out-the-vote efforts to help Republicans. Democrats were aided in similar fashion by Priorities USA, made up of former Barack Obama campaign aides, and American Bridge 21st Century Foundation, an opposition research group led by a former adviser to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

And yet those groups so far have escaped investigations into whether they have crossed the blurry line under the law between what constitutes a tax-exempt ""social welfare"" organization that is free from donor reporting requirements and a political committee subject to taxes and disclosures.

Watchdog groups and lawmakers who have sought more disclosure and restrictions on such groups claim an injustice. They say the IRS saga over the targeting of smaller groups shines a bright light onto the agency's failure to guard against the flood of secret money into the political system through the creation of the deep-pocketed groups.

Yet other advocates of reform worry that, in light of the IRS disclosure of targeting small groups, government regulators will be less likely to scrutinize the tax-exempt status of the bigger, more powerful groups out of fear that they will appear to be targeting groups for political reasons.

""We expect that opponents of disclosure will try to use the recent developments to allow the groups that are misusing the tax laws to hide donors to continue misusing them. But that's a battle that we will engage in,"" said Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of watchdog group Democracy 21.

Since a series of court decisions including the Supreme Court's ruling in the 2010 Citizens United case, the IRS has seen an influx of applications -- from 1,735 in 2010 to 3,357 in 2012 -- by so-called social welfare groups wanting to form under section 501(c)(4) of the federal tax code. That section grants tax-exempt status as long as the primary mission of these organizations is not politics and influencing elections. The IRS makes that determination. Such nonprofits can keep secret the names of their donors, which are not subject to traditional campaign finance limits.

The rules are fuzzy. The law says that these groups can only be involved in social welfare activity and not politics. But IRS regulations give the groups leeway to conduct political activities -- as long as that is not its ""primary activity."" That conflict opens the door to potential abuses and different interpretations of what is allowed and what is prohibited.

An IRS inspector general's report released this week recommended developing for the first time specific guidelines to measure the primary activity of social welfare organizations, and some in Congress have shown a willingness to review big groups like the nonprofit Crossroads GPS and its sister super PAC, American Crossroads. They spent a combined $176 million in the last election cycle, much of it on television advertisements to benefit Republican candidates.

A Senate investigative panel led by Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan and Republican John McCain of Arizona has been reviewing the use of social welfare groups for political causes for the past year and now is examining the agency's handling of the tax-exempt reviews.

And in a letter to congressional investigators Thursday, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., urged the House Ways and Means Committee not to ignore the influx of groups that may be abusing the tax code as part of its upcoming IRS probe, saying: ""I hope we can remove the incentive for any group, regardless of its political orientation, to seek 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status to engage in significant political campaign activities while hiding their donors.""

Despite the bipartisan outcry over the IRS scandal, there's little incentive for lawmakers on either side of the aisle to push for reforms because Republicans and Democrats alike benefit from these big outside groups.

In fact, just the opposite may be happening.

Some congressional Democrats, fearful of being tied to the scandal, are backing the push for more aggressive enforcement of these groups. And some conservative leaders and Republican donors are using the IRS scandal to help protect the status quo while preparing to pump hundreds of millions of dollars -- raised anonymously in many cases with no contribution limits -- into the next election cycle, just as they did last fall.

""I would hope that this new information about the politicization of the IRS should put the brakes on any sort of disclosure of donors who wish to remain anonymous,"" said Charlie Spies, who helps raise money for several conservative organizations and previously led the super political action committee that raised more than $140 million to benefit Mitt Romney's presidential bid. ""We're now seeing exactly what the risk is for donors to be disclosed.""

At least some tea party groups are unwilling to trust the agency with more enforcement power in the wake of such damaging revelations.

""The IRS' integrity is shattered,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, chairman of the Tea Party Patriots, which was among the largest nonprofit conservative groups the IRS targeted. She said that now, more than ever, donors need freedom to give money anonymously ""without fear of retribution"" from a politicized IRS. In the meantime, she says her organization's influence is growing, fueled by anonymous unlimited donations.

Wertheimer, of Democracy 21, said the ""laundering of secret money into elections"" will become a greater scandal than IRS misconduct unless something is done.

""There will be efforts to sweep this under the rug,"" he said. ""They may succeed on a temporary basis for a relatively short period, but they are not going to succeed in the long term."""

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/opinion/brooks-beyond-the-fence.html,2013-05-07 00:00:00,['David Brooks'],Beyond the Fence - The New York Times,"Some intelligent skeptics say that mobility is fine through the second generation but stalls by the third. It is indeed harder to rise in a more chaotic and fragmented society. But one of the country’s leading immigration researchers, Richard Alba of the City University of New York, calls the third generation stall “a statistical illusion.”

Much of the research that shows the effect compares today’s third-generation immigrants with today’s second-generation group. But the third-generation families originally came to the U.S. decades ago, at a time when segregation was prevalent, discrimination was high and immigrants were harshly treated. You’d expect those families to progress more slowly than families that came to more welcoming conditions a generation later.

Fifth, immigration opponents are trying to restrict skills. Current reform proposals would increase high-skill immigration. Opponents of reform are trying to restrict an infusion of people most likely to start businesses and invent things.

Alba points out that, over the next decades, the retirement of the baby-boomer generation will open up a large number of positions, especially atop the labor force. He points out that the fastest-growing ethnic groups are already rising to fill these slots. Whites occupy 80 percent of the top-paying jobs among older workers. But, among younger workers, whites occupy only 67 percent of the top jobs. The work force is already more diverse the younger you go.

Finally, opponents of reform are trying to hold back the inevitable. Whether immigration reform passes or not, the United States is going to become a much more cosmopolitan country than it is now. The country will look more like the faces you see at college commencement exercises and less like the faces you see in senior citizen homes.

One crucial question is whether America will be better off in that future with today’s dysfunctional immigration laws or something else? Another interesting question is whether a major political party is going to consign itself to permanent irrelevance. If conservatives defeat immigration reform, the Republicans will definitely lose control of one thing for years to come: political power."

IRS targeted conservative groups for closer scrutiny

Field office personnel singled out %27tea party%27 groups and those critical of government

Obama faced questions about e-mails related to Benghazi talking points

WASHINGTON -- Facing a wall of outrage from GOP lawmakers over revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted ""tea party"" groups and non-profit organizations that criticized the government, President Obama on Monday called the actions by agency personnel ""outrageous"" and said ""there is no place for it.""

The president, who appeared alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron at the White House, weighed in on the IRS controversy for the first time and attempted to head off snowballing criticism from Republican lawmakers that he hadn't personally condemned the agency's targeting of conservative political groups for extra scrutiny.

Obama said he first learned about the IRS actions from news reports Friday. He said those responsible for the practice should be held ""fully accountable."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said later on Monday that White House Counsel's Office was alerted during the week of April 22nd that the agency's inspector general was completing a review about matters involving the office in Cincinnati.

Lois Lerner, the IRS director of exempt organizations, on Friday admitted the agency made ""mistakes"" in the last few years and that employees in the agency's Cincinnati office routinely required conservative organizations seeking non-profit status to undergo more scrutiny.

Multiple conservative groups have said their applications were delayed and returned with lengthy requests for supporting materials, sometimes including website printouts and lists of guest speakers.

""You don't want the IRS ever being perceived to be biased,"" Obama said.

Even as Obama attempted to make clear his unhappiness with the IRS, Republicans continued to level their criticism against the agency and the administration.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Monday called for Obama to fire acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller.

""It is clear the IRS cannot operate with even a shred of the American people's confidence under the current leadership,"" Rubio wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. ""Therefore, I strongly urge that you and President Obama demand the IRS commissioner's resignation, effectively immediately. No government agency that has behaved in such a manner can possibly instill any faith and respect from the American public.""

Some Democrats, including Sen. Max Baucus, on Monday joined Republican calls for a Congressional investigation of the IRS.

""I want to review the inspector general's report first, but the IRS should be prepared for a full investigation into this matter by the Senate Finance Committee,"" said Baucus, of Montana, who is chairman of the committee. ""The IRS will now be the ones put under additional scrutiny.""

Obama added that neither party wants the IRS to be perceived as ""anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate."" He added: ""This is something that I think people are properly concerned about.""

Still, the president pointed to the inspector general's ongoing investigation, saying he would not comment prematurely on specific findings.

The president added that his administration will get to the bottom of what happened at the IRS. ""I have no patience for it. I will not tolerate it. ""

Obama also faced a difficult question about the administration's response to last year's terror attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

E-mails unveiled last week show the State Department and other senior administration officials asking that references to terror groups and prior warnings be deleted from a unclassified memo on talking points about the incident shortly after the Sept. 11 attack.

GOP lawmakers have also criticized the State Department board that reviewed the incident for not interviewing then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

As the president held his press conference, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa announced that he had sent letters to Benghazi Accountability Review Board (ARB) co-chairs, former ambassador Thomas Pickering and former admiral Mike Mullen, requesting that they submit to transcribed interviews in anticipation of a public hearing on the board's investigation.

""Three senior State Department officials who testified at the hearing criticized the ARB's work as 'incomplete' and flawed because the ARB did not interview key witnesses and failed to hold senior officials accountable,"" wrote Issa in the letter to Pickering. ""On May 12, 2013, you defended the ARB's work on Face the Nation. You stated that those criticisms are 'unfair.' … The White House and the State Department have touted the ARB's report as the definitive account of how and why the Benghazi attacks occurred. It is necessary for the committee to understand whether the criticisms of the ARB's work that we heard from witnesses on May 8, 2013, are valid.""

But the president pushed back, saying his administration officials have been forthcoming about Benghazi and suggesting that Republicans are more interested in scoring political points than figuring out how to prevent such incidents from happening again in hot spots where U.S. diplomats and other personnel are deployed.



""There is no there, there,"" Obama said.

Obama and Cameron met for about hour at the White House before the news conference. Cameron said their talks centered on the economy, the ongoing civil war in Syria and next month's Group of Eight summit that Cameron will host in Northern Ireland.

Both Cameron and Obama acknowledged they have a difficult task in persuading Russia to abandon Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime.

Obama noted that there are long-term ""suspicions"" by Russia toward the G-8 alliance — which includes the USA, Britain and Russia -- but both he and Cameron were trying to ""break down"" some of those suspicions.

""As a leader on the world stage, Russia has an interest and obligation to resolve this issue that can lead to an outcome we all want to see in the long-term,"" Obama said.

""Syria's history is being written in the blood of her people,"" Cameron said. He added, ""and it is happening under our watch."""

Assembly Bill 10 would increase the state's minimum wage for the first time in six years. It passed the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee on a party-line vote, with majority Democrats in support.

""This bill goes to the heart of economic security,"" testified Mitch Seaman of the California Labor Federation. ""For workers, the minimum wage is all that's keeping you from sinking further down as the economy moves on without you.""

Eighteen states have a minimum wage above the federal level of $7.25 an hour, led by Washington at $9.19 an hour and then Oregon at $8.95. Ten of those states provide for annual, inflation-adjusted increases.

California's wage ranks fifth-highest in the country and also trails the minimum required in Vermont and Nevada, although employers in Nevada can pay $1 an hour less than their state's $8.25 minimum if they provide health insurance benefits to workers.

The California bill, which now advances to the Assembly floor, would raise the minimum wage to $8.25 in 2014, $8.75 in 2015 and $9.25 in 2016. Each year after, it would go up based on the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index.

The bill is opposed by all the state's major employer organizations, including the California Restaurant Association, Western Growers Association, California Grocers Association and state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Businesses.

Another opponent, the California Chamber of Commerce, has placed the bill on its annual ""job killer"" list, which includes legislation it most aggressively seeks to defeat.

Matt Sutton of the restaurant association said an increase in the minimum wage would benefit only its employees who earn tips, as the added cost would force operators to hold down wages for hourly employees to absorb the mandated increases for tipped workers.

""A minimum-wage increase is going to do nothing but harm my business,"" testified Joe Thompson, a Sacramento restaurant operator.

Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas, the bill's author, countered that no evidence shows that higher minimum wages have done economic harm in Oregon or in San Francisco, which has a citywide minimum of $10.24.

""There's been no adverse impact to jobs,"" he said.

Alejo said the state's failure to increase its minimum wage for six years has led communities to begin taking matters into their own hands. In addition to San Francisco, San Jose implemented a $10 per hour minimum wage last month, and Sacramento is considering similar action.

Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez, D-Los Angeles, said that his parents worked ""four to five jobs a week"" to make ends meet and always impressed upon their children the importance of having a job to avoid becoming a burden on the government.

That philosophy falls apart when a job pays so little that it does not ""fulfill its purpose"" of allowing workers to get by without government subsidies or programs, he said.

Assemblyman Jeff Gorell, R-Camarillo, is the only legislator on the committee who represents any part of Ventura County. He cast one of the two no votes on the measure.

Congressional Democrats are fully aware of this, too, and that creates a powerful incentive for them to hold the line.

So sequestration will begin. Obama won’t cave. And then the tension sequestration was intended to create — and in fact has created — between defense hawks and the rest of the GOP will intensify and actually splinter the party. If that doesn’t happen quickly enough, then the sequestration fight will become tangled up in the need to renew funding for the federal government at the end of March. If Republicans don’t cave before then, they’ll precipitate a 1995-style government shutdown, public opinion will actually begin to control the outcome, and it’ll be game over.

So there are real dynamics at work here that can break the GOP’s resolve in this fight but that can’t easily be turned against Obama."

In a letter signed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Senate Democratic Policy Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and other Democrats and dated Jan. 11, the Democratic Senate leaders wrote they believed Obama “must be willing to take any lawful steps” to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling.

They wrote:

In the event that Republicans make good on their threat by failing to act, or by moving unilaterally to pass a debt limit extension only as part of unbalanced or unreasonable legislation, we believe you must be willing to take any lawful steps to ensure that America does not break its promises and trigger a global economic crisis–without Congressional approval, if necessary.

The leaders also warned House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to not allow conservative members of Congress to hold the nation’s economy and reputation “hostage” during the upcoming negotiations concerning raising the debt ceiling.

Last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said if she had a choice, she would invoke the 14th Amendment “in a second” to raise the debt ceiling if she were president.

Democrats want Obama to raise the debt ceiling unilaterally because they do not want to cut spending, which Republicans will demand in return for authorizing the debt ceiling to be raised.

During the last round of debt ceiling negotiations in the summer of 2011, Obama was asked if he would invoke the 14th Amendment to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling.

Obama replied then that he had talked to his lawyers, and they were “not persuaded that that is a winning argument.”"
http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/19/news/economy/government-shutdown-what-happens/index.html,2013-09-19 00:00:00,['Jeanne Sahadi'],Government shutdown gears in motion,"Experts agree: A federal government shutdown would be a dumb way to go.

Yet the risk of a shutdown on Oct. 1 is now a distinct possibility. And federal agencies have been instructed to make plans for one just in case.

The House on Friday will vote on a short-term government funding bill that will include a provision to defund Obamacare. That provision is a no-go for Senate Democrats and President Obama.

If they can't work out a compromise, many functions of the federal government will be shut down indefinitely on Oct. 1.

Besides causing inconvenience and delays, a shutdown could have larger consequences.

A long, broad shutdown could weaken an already modest economic recovery, Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf said Wednesday.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, meanwhile, noted that ""a government shutdown and, perhaps even more so, a failure to raise the debt limit could have very serious consequences for the financial markets and for the economy.""

To say nothing of the fact that a shutdown wouldn't come cheap. Federal agencies have to use up time, energy and resources to plan for one. Shutting down, and then reopening the government, also costs money. Two shutdowns in the mid-1990s cost an estimated $1.4 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service.

There's no telling exactly what a shutdown this October would look like because the White House has some discretion in terms of what's hit and what's not. But based on the shutdowns in the mid-1990s, the following is a pretty good bet.

What will be closed for business: Many, if not most, federal government offices, programs, museums and parks would be shuttered.

So if the shutdown lasts awhile, the travel industry could take a hit as vacations and business trips are scuttled -- whether because people can't get a visa or passport or because they have to cancel their plans to visit Yosemite.

For federal contractors, projects may be delayed because the agencies they work for can't issue the paperwork needed to move forward.

And Americans who need something from a federal office affected by the shutdown may be out of luck.

What will be open for business: Parts of the government that provide what the White House budget office deems critical would still operate.

Critical services, broadly speaking, protect human life and property. Typically that has included air traffic control, national security, the handling of hazardous waste, food inspections, border protection, maintenance of the power grid and disaster assistance.

In addition, taxes likely would still be collected, and U.S. bonds issued. Anything else deemed essential to the preservation of the country's banking system would likely carry on as well.

Related: Pessimism deepens over budget standoff

Who will come to work and who won't: Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed without pay. Historically that pay has been restored when the shutdown ends, but there's no guarantee of that in law.

Many federal employees, however, would be exempted from furloughs. President Obama and his presidential appointees, as well as members of Congress, fall into that category.

Also expected to work through a shutdown are federal employees needed to preserve key parts of the money and banking systems.

Anyone authorized to work during a shutdown would be paid, although in most instances they will not get their checks until after the shutdown ends.

How mail would be affected: The mail would still be delivered.

How justice will be served: The federal judiciary estimated that if a shutdown had occurred this year, the court system could have functioned for roughly 10 working days on the basis of fees and funds from prior appropriations, according to CRS.

Related: Budget follies: 3 crazy years and counting

When that funding runs out, the judiciary would allow ""essential work"" to be performed, including the resolution of cases.

Federal court staff and officers who work through the shutdown would not be paid during the shutdown. But Supreme Court justices and federal judges appointed under Article III of the Constitution would.

If you're called for federal jury duty, you won't get paid for it on time.

What happens to Social Security and other benefits: Funding for entitlement benefits is considered mandatory, meaning it's not subject to the annual appropriations process.

So the money will be there to pay the benefits. The only question is whether the federal workers who process them will be.

Social Security checks did go out during the last shutdown, and the White House should be able to ensure the same thing happens again if need be.

During the mid-1990s shutdowns, the Social Security Administration initially retained nearly 5,000 employees to send benefits to those already enrolled in the program. But during the second, longer shutdown, it realized it would need closer to 50,000 employees to process applications for new claims or Social Security cards, address changes and other benefit-related tasks.

How Obamacare will fare: Those who would threaten to shut the government down are those who most want to see Obamacare delayed and defunded.

But an analysis by the CRS concludes that the implementation of Obamacare is likely to continue in the event of a shutdown."

(CNN) - A conservative group says it's spending six figures over the next two weeks to run a TV commercial in Louisiana that criticizes Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu over her support of Presidential Barack Obama's judicial nominees.

""Mary Landrieu voted for every one of Obama's liberal activist judges,"" the narrator says in the 30-second spot by the Judicial Crisis Network.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='psteinhausercnn']

The group also goes after Landrieu, who could face a challenging re-election next year, for supporting a measure that lowered the threshold for ending Republican-led filibusters in the Senate.

""Landrieu even helped change the rules to pack a key court with new liberal judges who will review Obamacare, the EPA, the IRS, and agencies Obama is using to push his unconstitutional job killing agenda,"" adds the narrator.

Under the old rules, it took 60 votes to break a filibuster of presidential nominees. The change means a simple Senate majority of 51 now suffices in the chamber that Democrats currently control with a 55-45 majority. The change affects presidential executive nominations such as ambassadors and agency heads, along with judicial nominations except for Supreme Court nominees. It does not include filibusters of legislation.

""The latest blatantly false attack ad by the Judicial Crisis Network attacks Sen. Landrieu for voting to confirm judicial nominees, whom were confirmed with bipartisan majorities, while shockingly claiming that Landrieu voted to confirm two nominees that never received a vote, and were never even confirmed,"" said an email by Landrieu's campaign, in response to the new commercial.

""The ad goes on to accuse Sen. Landrieu of packing the court with liberal judges, another completely false claim that has already been slammed once by Politifact as 'false.' ""

This is the second recent ad by the Judicial Crisis Network to go after a vulnerable Democratic Senator up for re-election in 2014 in a Republican-leaning state. They went up with a spot last month that targeted Sen. Mark Pryor of neighboring Arkansas.

The Washington Post was first to report on the new commercial."

The plan calls for $975 billion in new tax revenue through closing loopholes and ending deductions and credits benefiting corporations and the country’s highest wage earners.

It also calls for $100 billion in new stimulus spending while cutting $1.85 trillion from the deficit over 10 years. The rest of the savings would come through spending cuts.

Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray said the budget takes a balanced, “pro-middle-class” approach and argued the country’s economic problems started long before fellow Democrats entered the White House in 2009.

“Despite some of the rhetoric you may hear from my Republican colleagues, the Great Recession didn’t start the day President Obama was elected,” said Murray, D-Wash.

More On This...

The plan also calls for replacing the recent, $85 billion in spending cuts with more measured cuts.

Committee members will begin voting and submitting amendments Thursday, with a full Senate vote expected by next week.

Alabama Sen. Jeff Session, the committee’s ranking Republican, immediately criticized the proposal.

“It’s anything but balanced,” he said. “Raising taxes and spending is anything but balanced.”

The budget was presented one day after the Republican-controlled House rolled out its fiscal 2014 budget -- a plan to balance the budget in 10 years largely by slowing the rate of spending and adding in the roughly $600 billion in tax increases Democrats got in January.

The upper chamber announced the details as President Obama met with House Republicans.

Obama said after the meeting that it was ""good” and “useful.""

However, the recent optimism about Democrats and Republicans perhaps agreeing on a mix of tax increases and spending cuts to craft a single budget – or a so-called “grand bargain” – appears to be fading.

""Ultimately, it may be that the differences are just too wide,"" the president told ABC before going to Capitol Hill."

Stewart'],"In Rural Iowa, Spending, Not the Shutdown, Raises Worry","The Republican Party has long claimed to be the champion of business, large and small, and an advocate for fiscal responsibility. Yet now Republicans in Congress have precipitated a shutdown of the federal government and are threatening to let the nation default on its once Triple-A-rated debt.

How could this be?

Since no one in Washington seems to be listening to anyone on the other side of the standoff, I spent much of the week on the phone with voters and business people in Iowa’s Fourth Congressional District, a sprawling, mostly agricultural region that runs from Sioux City, on the Nebraska border, to Mason City, close to Minnesota in the northwest quadrant of the state. I picked the district because its representative in Congress, the Republican Steve King, has been one of the most outspoken advocates for blocking Obamacare, even if that means shutting down the government or defaulting on the national debt.

In this bedrock conservative district, I found that people were fed up with the gridlock in Washington. But while they are beginning to question Mr. King’s tactics, they continue to support his core commitment to cutting the size of government.

Mr. King has certainly staked out some controversial positions, even by conservative standards, and is a frequent target on both the Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert shows. He claimed that “radical Islamicists” would be “dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on Sept. 11” if Obama was elected. He warned that Iowa was in danger of becoming a “gay marriage mecca” and led a successful effort to recall three State Supreme Court judges who ruled in favor of gay marriage. He was one of only 11 members of Congress to oppose aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina, has defended racial profiling and has brushed off concerns about global warming as being “more religion than science.” He has drawn the ire of animal rights activists with his support for dog and cock fighting while opposing food safety measures. House Speaker John Boehner described some of his comments on illegal immigrants as “hateful” and “ignorant.”"

Most Americans will pay more in taxes in 2013 because of the expiration of a payroll tax cut

Obama's claim that the deal will reduce the deficit depends on one's baseline assumption

Video could make some think they won't see a tax increase unless they make more than $400,000

In a Web video, President Obama leaves out some key facts about the fiscal cliff deal, possibly leaving the wrong impression about its impact on taxpayers and the deficit:

Obama boasts that ""middle-class families"" will not have to ""pay upwards of $2,000 more in taxes this year."" That's accurate for income taxes, but Obama doesn't mention that the deal allowed a payroll tax cut to expire. About 77% of taxpayers will pay more in taxes this year — nearly $1,200 more for those earning between $75,000 and $100,000, a group that fits squarely in Obama's broad definition of middle class.

Obama says the agreement ""will reduce the deficit."" In fact, the deficit will increase by about $4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for all but those in the top 1% of taxpayers. The deal will ""reduce the deficit"" only compared with what it would have been if the Bush tax cuts had been extended for everyone.

All the president's talk about preserving middle-class tax cuts in the just-passed bill to avert the so-called fiscal cliff may give one the impression that, except for the wealthy, people will be paying the same amount in taxes this year as last. But that's not correct. Left out of Obama's analysis is that a temporary, two-year reduction in Social Security payroll taxes was allowed to expire. As a result, most people will actually pay more in taxes this year.

In some cases, Obama has been clear that the fiscal cliff deal means an extension of lower income tax rates for middle-income earners. For example, he told reporters on Jan. 1 that under the new law more than 98% of Americans ""will not see their income taxes go up.""

He made no mention of payroll taxes in that press briefing. Nor is there a mention in the White House fact sheet about the fiscal cliff deal.

And in a campaign-style video sent out to supporters, Obama says only that the deal spared middle-income households from a bruising tax hike.

Obama, Jan. 2: You know my top priority has been preventing a tax hike that could have hit 98% of all Americans in 2013. Because the last thing middle-class families can afford right now would be to pay upwards of $2,000 more in taxes this year.

It's true that the deal spares middle-income earners the worst of the fiscal cliff tax hikes. The law is likely to raise $620 billion in new high-income revenues, mostly by allowing Bush-era tax cuts to expire for individuals making more than $400,000 and couples making more than $450,000 a year (that affects 1% of Americans, not 2%, as Obama said). But for people below that income threshold, the income tax rate will remain the same.

That's certainly a big deal. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projected that if all of the expiring tax cuts were allowed to go away, the nation would probably slide into a recession and the unemployment rate would rise to 9.1%.

But Obama's video — in which he leaves out the qualifier income tax — may lead many to believe that if they don't earn upward of $400,000, they will not see a tax increase in 2013. And they may be surprised when they get their first paycheck this year to see that it is a bit lighter. That's because a two-year reduction in the Social Security payroll tax — that pesky FICA line on your paycheck — was allowed to expire.

As a result, those with income between $40,000 and $50,000 would pay an additional $574 in payroll taxes in 2013, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. Those with household income between $75,000 and $100,000 (still solidly middle-class by Obama's definition) would pay an additional $1,194 in 2013. Allowing the payroll tax to go back up to 6.2% from 4.2% will mean an average tax hike for all Americans of $721 over the course of 2013. That's $60 a month.

Overall, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 77% of Americans will be paying more in taxes in 2013 than they did in 2012.

""For most, the only reason is because of the payroll tax,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

Many politicians do not view that as a tax hike, but rather as simply the expiration of a two-year tax cut that was always designed to be temporary. Extending the payroll tax cut was not part of Obama's 2013 budget. But whether it was part of the Obama administration's initial fiscal cliff proposal is a bit fuzzy. As we reported on Dec. 5, the president's opening offer in the fiscal cliff negotiations included $200 billion in new stimulus spending. At that time, Treasury declined to give us a detailed list of proposals for new spending, but it did confirm published reports that some of the elements of the stimulus plan might include an extension of the Social Security payroll tax holiday, as well as infrastructure spending. Those were not part of the law that passed.

One could argue the Bush tax cuts were also temporary, but only because Republicans didn't have enough votes to make the tax cuts permanent when the legislation was approved in 2001. And so they were enacted for nine years, with Republicans expecting that the cuts would ultimately be made permanent. And then they were extended for another two years by Obama and Congress.

Deficit-cutting?

As for Obama's claim that the fiscal cliff deal will reduce the deficit, that depends on one's baseline assumption. The deficit is smaller than it would have been if the Bush tax cuts had been extended for everyone, including the wealthy. But it is larger than if the Bush tax cuts had been allowed to expire for everyone as scheduled at the end of 2012.

Among budget experts, it is the difference between starting with a baseline of ""current policy"" — which assumed the Bush tax cuts would have been extended for everyone, as they were in 2010 — and ""current law,"" which called for the expiration of all the Bush tax cuts on Jan. 1, 2013.

Assuming ""current policy,"" Obama is able to claim the fiscal cliff law reduces the deficit, mostly by increasing high-income revenue by $620 billion. But assuming ""current law,"" the deal actually increases the deficit by nearly $4.6 trillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office — because it permanently extends the Bush tax cuts for most taxpayers.

Obama is trying to have it both ways, as he toggles between the two assumptions. By assuming the tax cuts would have expired for everyone without his action, the president claims credit for averting an income tax hike for middle-income taxpayers. But, in order to take credit for cutting the deficit, Obama is assuming that the tax cuts would have been extended for everyone."

We have two alternatives, two paths to take here. Either fix the financial problems in a longer-term, bigger fix or do something with sequestering that we've punished ourselves basically because we have been unable, as a body, to come together.

So I think that was also said, if we're going to do a sequestering, shouldn't it also be done in a more or a smarter way to where there's more flexibility?

Bernanke: Well, as you point out, it was done to be sort of like, in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" the bomb that goes off.

So if — obviously if you can find a way to, you know, a bipartisan way to make it more effective and —and — and better prioritize, that would be a good thing.

And people disagree on the second point but, again, what I suggested today is try to make some trade-off on the effects of the near-term recovery and, you know, aligning the policy with the timing. The timing says that you've made progress on the very near-term as far as the budget is concerned.

Where — where the problem still remains unaddressed is — is in the longer term. And so it doesn't quite match to be doing tough policies today when the real problem is a somewhat longer-term problem."

(CNN) - House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan thanked President Obama for hosting a ""frank discussion about Washington's budget challenges"" when the two met Thursday.

Obama, who dined with 12 Republican senators Wednesday night, invited Ryan and Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the ranking member on the budget committee, to the White House for lunch.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

In a statement, Ryan said he believes ""everyone needs to be a part"" of the conversation surrounding the country's debt and deficit issues.

""We need an open debate about how best to balance the budget and expand opportunity,"" he continued. ""I look forward to having that debate next week with specific budget proposals from House Republicans and Senate Democrats.""

Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, is expected to introduce specific proposals in his budget on Tuesday.

Appearing on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" Van Hollen said the meeting lasted more than an hour and included only the three men, without any aides at the table.

""It was a good lunch, it was a good meal and it was a very good conversation,"" he said. ""The president is trying to open every avenue of dialogue to try and get something done.""

The meeting marked the first time Obama sat down with Ryan since the two competed head on in the presidential race last fall.

""Their relationship is developing very well,"" Van Hollen said, without going into detail about the meeting.

A White House official said the president was ""pleased"" to host Ryan and Van Hollen, adding that the group had a ""constructive discussion.""

Obama, the official said, ""expressed his desire to continue a dialogue with them in the weeks ahead.""

On the menu was lentil vegetable soup and broiled sea bass served with a roasted vegetable ragu, according to the White House.

The meeting came one day after the GOP-controlled House passed a Republican measure to keep the government funded through September, while softening the impact of forced spending cuts on the military and veterans affairs program. The continuing resolution now goes to the Senate for consideration.

In his dinner with a dozen Republicans Wednesday night, the conversation also focused on the country's budget issues–and many senators walked away from the meeting describing it as a cordial and genuine exchange.

The bipartisan meetings signal a shift in approach for the president, as they come less than a week after both sides were engaged in bitter, partisan fight over the failure to produce a deficit-reduction plan that averted $85 billion in across-the-board cuts from going into place.

Obama on Friday placed blame on Republicans for not compromising, while Republicans faulted Democrats for the same reason.

Asked if the latest Republican outreach was a change in strategy, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that it was ""a change in circumstances.""

""And a strategy that is born out of that change in circumstances,"" Carney continued.

Because there's no impending fiscal deadline, Carney added, then there's ""a little room and time for constructive conversation.""

Carney said the president was specifically reaching out to Republicans in Congress who have expressed an openness to moving forward.

""The president has been...having phone conversations and other kinds of encounters with lawmakers of both parties and we don't read all of them out and we won't read most of them out because, as the president said to me earlier with regards to the dinner, part of the effort here is to foster an environment where these conversations can be held in a way that allows for a free exchange of ideas,"" Carney said earlier in the day during the press briefing.

In an interview with CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi applauded Thursday the president's efforts to meet with Republicans.

""He’s been very bipartisan in his approach. So, I think that these meetings are not something to say, ‘well, I’ll do this with you now, and do that with them later.’ I think it is, ‘let’s get some things done together to make elections less important.’ Let’s come together for the benefit of the American people, first and foremost, that’s our responsibility.""

She continued: ""So if he can diffuse some of their opposition to some of these issues, bravo, for the, again, for the American people.""

(CNN) – A monthly jobs report showing sluggish hiring in March gave Republicans an opening Friday to chastise President Barack Obama's economic policies.

""The president's policies continue to make it harder for Americans to find work,"" House Speaker John Boehner wrote in a statement released a half hour after the Labor Department report was released. ""Hundreds of thousands fled the workforce last month and unemployment remains far above what the Obama administration promised when it enacted its 'stimulus' spending plan.""



Friday's report showed 88,000 jobs were added in March, far lower than the 190,000 jobs that economists expected. The unemployment rate fell to 7.6%, though the drop was pegged to 500,000 Americans leaving the workforce.

During last year's election, Obama's record on jobs creation formed the core of rival Mitt Romney's attacks, even as hiring began picking up and the unemployment rate dropped. Republicans have continued attacking Obama's jobs record after the election as the White House and Congressional Republicans grapple over a deficit reduction plan.

Next week Obama will unveil his annual budget, which is expected to make changes to Medicare and Social Security in an effort to reach a deficit deal with Republicans.

In his statement Friday, Boehner said that ""one of the best things President Obama can do is follow the House and outline a balanced budget next week – one that includes entitlement reforms that are not conditional on enactment of more tax increases, which will suppress growth instead of encourage it.""

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus cast the March jobs report as a consequence of Obama's focus on upcoming midterm elections.

""What exactly was the president doing in the last month to create jobs as the economy sputtered along?"" Priebus asked. ""Why did he flit off to San Francisco this week to fundraise on Billionaire's Row instead of sending a budget to Congress? Why is adding money to Nancy Pelosi's campaign coffers more important than adding jobs to the economy?""

Obama's fundraising swing through California began Wednesday evening and continued Thursday with events for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee.

Priebus also placed blame on Congressional Democrats, whose policies he said were hurting American hiring.

""Why don't liberals admit their big government programs are straining Americans' budgets? Why are they sticking young people with higher insurance costs through Obamacare? Why won't they work with Republicans to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid?"" he said.

""Are the president and his fellow Democrats out-of-touch–or just not serious about doing their jobs?"" he concluded.

Rep. Eric Cantor, the number two House Republican, wrote it was time for Obama and Democrats in Congress to ""stop making excuses and start working together on common sense solutions to address our lingering unemployment problem, and the stagnant economy.""

Public polling shows Americans split on who to trust with the economy, Obama or Congressional Republicans. An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted March 7-10 showed 44% trusted Obama more on the economy and 40% trusted members of the GOP in Congress.

Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in a statement that ""more work remains to be done"" to spur hiring.

Today’s employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression,"" Krueger wrote. Similar statements are released after every monthly jobs report. ""It is critical that we continue the policies that are helping to build an economy that creates jobs and works for the middle class as we dig our way out of the deep hole that was caused by the severe recession that began in December 2007."""

USA TODAY

The federal budget expires Sept. 30 without a new act of Congress

Federal agencies have to determine which workers are essential to health%2C safety and compliance

Workers are not allowed to volunteer to come to work

WASHINGTON — If Congress doesn't pass a new spending bill in the next week, the federal government will shut down on Oct. 1.

That is, 41% of it will.

An estimated 59% of non-defense federal employees would be exempt from the shutdown and would go to work as usual, according to a USA TODAY analysis of 119 shutdown contingency plans filed with the Office of Management and Budget.

Among them: political appointees, law enforcement, most overseas foreign service officers and anyone else deemed necessary for health or safety of people or property.

That last category can account for a broad cross-section of federal employees, because positions that support a key function — such as information technology, security or even legal help — are also protected. Even a receptionist responsible for picking up sensitive mail deliveries could be considered essential and exempted from furlough.

Maintaining an agency website usually isn't a necessary function, although the Office of Management and Budget said this month that the IRS website may be necessary ""to allow for tax filings and tax collection."" That's one key difference from the last government shutdown in 1996, when agencies were less reliant on the Web.

""Where those lines are drawn can change from time to time,"" said Ray Natter, a former deputy chief counsel of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. And the two government agencies responsible for interpreting the law on who's essential and who's not — the Office of Legal Counsel and the Comptroller General — often give inconsistent advice, he said.

Agencies that don't operate on an annual appropriation from Congress also will continue to operate normally. That would include the Postal Service, the Patent and Trademark Office and the Federal Highway Administration. A Census Bureau statistician working on a project in Bangladesh is paid outside of the annual budget and could continue to work.

Meteorologists at the National Weather Service would continue to issue weather forecasts because they're necessary for aviation safety. But ocean and atmospheric scientists who don't produce daily forecasts would also continue to work in order to maintain ""crucial long-term historical climate records,"" according to the Department of Commerce's plan.

At the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the commissioners would continue to work because they're appointed by the president. But the commission's contingency plan also calls for some of the agency's lawyers to go to work, so they can provide ""timely and accurate legal advice"" to the commissioners about what they can and can't do during a shutdown.

About 65% of Washington-based State Department employees — and 10% of overseas-based employees — would be furloughed. Passport offices would be closed, but any State Department official deemed necessary for the president to carry out his treaty-making responsibilities under the Constitution would come to work. And foreign nationals employed by the State Department may be subject to their country's labor laws, which may not allow an unpaid furlough.

For most federal agencies, almost all employees would work at least a half-day after a shutdown to lock their filing cabinets, update their voicemail and fill out time cards. When the shutdown is over, agencies might take a half-day to ramp back up before opening their doors to the public.

USA TODAY looked at the most recent contingency plans for 339 federal departments, agencies and offices, all filed in 2011 when the government last faced the possibility of a shutdown. The analysis does not include the District of Columbia and many smaller agencies that did not submit a report or those that did not provide personnel figures in their reports.

Also not included: the Department of Defense. ""While military personnel would continue in a normal duty status, a large number of our civilian employees would be temporarily furloughed,"" Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said in a memo to employees Monday. Just how many would be furloughed is unclear; Carter said the department is still updating its contingency plan.

At the White House, 365 staffers would report to work and 1,166 would be furloughed during a shutdown.

Natter noted that the Anti-Deficiency Act, the 129-year-old law that forces the government to shut down without an appropriation from Congress, also makes it illegal for furloughed workers to volunteer — even though many end up getting paid whether they work for not. ""It really ought to be rewritten to be more relevant for the 21st century,"" he said.

Roy Meyers, a professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore who teaches federal budgeting, said he's not surprised to see agencies use as much flexibility as they can get away with.

""To the extent that agencies are taking advantage of the vague guidance OMB has given them, it doesn't bother me a bit,"" he said. ""What the agencies are being told to do (is) an asinine thing.""

Hardest-hit states include Alabama%2C Texas%2C Virginia and Pennsylvania

Army depots face the biggest potential cuts

At least 450%2C000 jobs could be affected

WASHINGTON -- Budget cuts by the Air Force, Army and Navy scheduled to take effect March 1 will force almost $34 billion in wage and spending reductions and prompt furloughs or layoffs for millions of people, according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.

The Army's estimated cuts will force $15 billion in wage and spending reductions and prompt furloughs or layoffs for 300,000 people nationwide, while the Navy could face $11 billion in similar cuts affecting a potential 186,000 employees, records show. The Air Force estimates $7.7 billion in lost pay for its civilian employees.

Hardest hit states by the Army cuts include Alabama, Texas, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Among the least affected: Delaware, Wyoming, Montana and Rhode Island.

The Navy meanwhile expects sequestration will force it to cut $7.75 billion from its shipbuilding programs and another $4 billion in funds for operations and maintenance, according to Navy planning documents. The Navy's civilian employees could lose 20% of their salaries through furloughs.

California, Florida and Virginia would be most affected by the Navy cuts, the planning documents show.

Overall, the military faces $500 billion in budget cuts over 10 years from sequestration -- automatic budget cuts. The Pentagon anticipates that it will need to slash $46 billion in spending cuts by the end of this fiscal year on Sept. 30 for all the services to meet the requirement for 2013. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said the cuts could render the U.S. military a second-rate power.

""It reaffirms what we have continued to say about the serious implications that sequestration will have on our national defense and broader economic well-being,"" said Mike Amato, a spokesman for the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.

The cuts will affect every Army installation, according to the documents. States with large bases and military contractors are taking the biggest hits.

Texas, for instance, would face a $2.4 billion economic loss from the Army's budget cuts. Nearly 30,000 Army civilian employees will be furloughed if the cuts go into effect. They will lose $180 million in pay. Texas is home to two of the Army's largest installations -- Fort Hood and Fort Bliss.

""These states are where the soldiers are -- Texas especially,"" said Thomas Donnelly, a defense expert at the American Enterprise Institute.

Michael O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the services were playing politics to a degree by releasing figures showing cuts in the most dramatic ways. However, he said the cuts could have lasting, damaging impacts.

Texas would also be hard-hit by Air Force cuts, losing $127 million in wages. Other states affected by the Air Force cuts include Oklahoma, whose civilian employees stand to lose $124 million in lost wages.

President Obama stepped up pressure on Republicans in Congress to help avoid the cuts by passing a plan including other spending cuts and changes in tax policy that would bring extra revenue. The cuts, he said Tuesday, are ""not an abstraction — people will lose their jobs.""

In testimony last week on Capitol Hill, Gen. Raymond Odierno, the Army chief of staff, told lawmakers that 3,100 temporary employees were being laid off and a hiring freeze had been implemented because of the budget crisis. Maintenance would be canceled and training for soldiers not headed to Afghanistan or South Korea would be curtailed.

The Army's plan might overstate the budget crisis a bit, but it also points out major problems on the horizon, Donnelly said. Since military personnel costs are exempt from sequestration, the cuts fall more heavily in other areas, particularly training. That affects readiness for fighting, he said.

The states most affected have big maintenance depots, which will be shuttered in coming months because of the cuts. Pennsylvania, for example, has two major maintenance depots and is targeted for $751 million in savings. Its Letterkenny Depot upgrades weapons systems, including Patriot missiles.

Alabama's Anniston Army Depot could see $710 million in cuts, while the Corpus Christi Army Depot in Texas could face $799 million in cuts, the documents show.

Closing the depots would stop repairs on 17,000 weapons, 14,000 communication devices and 1,000 vehicles, according to the Army. Purchase orders would also be reduced, affecting 3,000 companies and putting 1,100 at risk of bankruptcy.

Senate plans votes to stop broad spending cuts%2C but no agreement is likely

Friday%2C federal agencies will have to cut %2485 billion from programs

The House may pass a bill to give the Pentagon more flexibility

WASHINGTON — The Senate will vote on dueling legislative proposals Thursday to prevent sweeping across-the-board federal spending cuts, but there is no confidence lawmakers will reach a bipartisan deal with President Obama before the Friday deadline.

Obama has summoned the top four congressional leaders to a White House meeting Friday to discuss the cuts, known as the ""sequester,"" while House Republicans are maneuvering to give the Pentagon more discretion in how to implement the cuts.

The sequester will require federal agencies to make $85 billion in spending cuts between March 1 and the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. The cuts are the first tranche of a decade-long plan to reduce spending by $1.2 trillion by applying an across-the-board cut to nearly every program of the federal government, except for military personnel and entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

Senate Democrats have offered an alternative to pay for the sequester through 2013 with a combination of a minimum 30% tax on millionaires and cuts to defense and farm payments. It will fail because it does not have the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster. GOP senators oppose the plan because it raises taxes.

""Now, less than 48 hours before the clock runs out, all they've offered is a gimmicky tax hike that's designed to fail. I hope they're not expecting a round of applause for this particular act of political bravery,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Senate Republicans are considering an alternative that would require the same level of budget cuts but put the burden on the president to determine which programs would be cut and which would be spared. The White House contends they will not support any sequester alternative that doesn't include both revenue increases and spending cuts.

""What we haven't seen when we hear Republican leaders adamantly refuse to consider revenue as part of deficit reduction is anything like that same spirit of compromise or seriousness of purpose that I think you've seen demonstrated by the president and Democratic leaders,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has not voted on any alternatives to the cuts. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said the House will consider alternatives when the Senate finds a plan that can pass the upper chamber.

In the previous Congress, the House twice passed sequester alternatives, but they never became law. ""We should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something,"" Boehner said Tuesday.

Instead, the House intends to take up a resolution next week to fund the government through Sept. 30. The current funding runs out March 27, threatening a government shutdown if Congress doesn't act. Attached to the bill will be two defense spending bills that will give the Pentagon more flexibility to implement the sequester.

Many lawmakers have expressed concern about how the cuts could impact national security.

""It will require some cuts in defense, but they do not adversely affect readiness or training,"" said Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., who oversees defense spending bills. Young said the bill has broad support among House Republicans and is expected to pass next week. Even so, it is unclear whether it can pass the Senate. ""This is a fallback position,"" he said.

Boehner also issued a further signal that sequester cuts would not be averted before Friday: He informed lawmakers that he was canceling the use of military aircraft for lawmakers' travel. ""The speaker believes this is the prudent and responsible course of action, and it goes above and beyond the spending cuts the House will be implementing to comply with the president's sequester,"" said spokesman Michael Steel.

Lawmaker travel on commercial airlines, however, can continue."

(CNN) —

Congressional negotiators had no agreements to report Saturday, but they issued positive reports on their talks to end a partial government shutdown and avert a default on government debt.

“Cordial” was the word Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, used to describe his “preliminary” discussions with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

“Good” discussions were going on among Senate leaders, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, “so I think all of us want to support those efforts, and hopefully they bear fruit over the weekend.”

Rallier tells Obama to ‘put the Quran down’

For all the positive talk, the only actions Saturday fell into the “no” category:

–Republican leaders said President Barack Obama rejected their proposal for a six-week debt limit extension.

–The Senate defeated a procedural measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached.

–Reid said a proposal by a bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, is no longer on the table because it treated opening the government as a “concession.”

Reid continues to demand that any plan include a “clean” bill with no strings attached that raises the debt limit and reopens the government.

Countdown to default

The Treasury Department says it will be unable to pay the government’s bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday. The partial shutdown of government services has been in effect since October 1.

7 crazy side effects from the shutdown

Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said Saturday the consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit would be dire for economies around the world. She spoke to CNN’s Richard Quest at an Institute of International Finance conference in Washington.

“You know, I’ve just spent the last two days with representatives of about 188 countries around the world. I wouldn’t say they are confident. I would say they are concerned, and they are very anxious to see this crisis resolved, because they know it’s going to impact on their economy,” Lagarde said.

Senate Democrats meet with president

Senate Democrats met with Obama for 75 minutes Saturday afternoon. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the party is unified.

“Democrats are willing to negotiate on anything Republicans want to discuss as soon as we reopen the government and pay our bills,” said the aide.

Another Democratic source said party leaders regard Republicans as lacking a coherent position. They hope McConnell can “cut through the clutter,” the source told CNN’s Dana Bash.

The sources, who are familiar with the talks, spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could speak candidly.

Despite the lack of agreement, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said progress was being made.

“I think our Republican colleagues are moving in our direction with the fact that Obamacare is not a major part of the discussion anymore among most all Senate and many House Republicans,” he said.

No votes on Sunday

Before the White House meeting, the Senate’s second highest-ranking Democrat, Richard Durbin of Illinois, told CNN’s Deirdre Walsh that Democrats hoped to reach agreement with Republican negotiators before stock markets open Monday.

Even if that optimistic timetable could be met, a deal could not be voted upon Sunday.

Will 2014 election solve anything?

The Senate is scheduled to come back into session at 1 p.m. ET Sunday, but no votes are planned and Senators have been told their presence is not required. The House is not scheduled to meet until Monday afternoon.

Even as he demanded a “clean” bill, Reid said he and McConnell are involved in “cordial” and “preliminary” discussions.

“I hope that our talking is some solace to the American people and the world,” Reid said. He said McConnell had approached him. “This hasn’t happened until now,” Reid said.

Obama-Boehner talks stall

Republican leadership told the Republican caucus during a Saturday morning meeting that the president will not accept their proposal to raise the debt limit for six weeks.

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told CNN Saturday that “the President rejected our deal.”

Paul Ryan steps into budget fight

The standstill came after a Friday afternoon phone call between Boehner and Obama in which they decided to keep talking.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, said the President is waiting for a better offer.

“It doesn’t seem like the White House is serious at all about entering negotiations with us until they see what comes out of the Senate. If they get something out of the Senate that’s weaker than our negotiated position, it obviously strengthens their position,” Kinzinger said.

While Democrats flat out rejected Boehner’s proposal, even some Republicans didn’t like it. That’s because it lacked a mechanism in the House proposal to immediately reopen the government, which has been partially shut down since October 1, prompting the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers, the closing of national parks and an increase in public anger.

The Tax Policy Center calculated that less than 5 percent of families earning $200,000 to $500,000 will actually pay more.

The size of those increases will be much smaller than President Obama originally proposed. The net effect, according to the center’s estimates, is that the top 1 percent of households will see an average income tax increase this year of $62,000 rather than $94,000. “The high-income people really are doing very well in this compared to what the president wanted to do,” said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

The deal passed by the Senate and the House will impose fewer limits on deductions than the White House plan. It will also tax income from dividends at a flat rate of 20 percent, rather than the same marginal rate as earned income. And there is another important point, often misunderstood: Affluent households will pay the new 39.6 percent rate only on income above $450,000. They and everyone else will still will pay lower rates on income below that threshold.

Households making $500,000 to $1 million will pay an additional $6,700 in taxes on average. Those making more than $1 million will pay an additional $123,000 on average.

Changes in the estate tax will also benefit affluent families. The tax will not apply to the first $5 million of an inheritance, extending the current exclusion rather than reverting to the $3.5 million threshold that President Obama initially favored. However, wealth above that amount will be taxed at a rate of 40 percent rather than the previous rate of 35 percent.

The Obama administration did win a five-year extension of tax breaks for lower-income families, including the child tax credit and earned-income tax credit. Those credits eliminate income tax liability for many lower-income families. In many cases, the government actually makes a direct payment to the family to help offset the burden of payroll taxation — up to $1,000 a child under the child credit and up to $5,900 total under the earned income credit.

The deal will also restore unemployment benefits for about two million Americans. People who can’t find work, and have already received government checks for the standard period of 26 weeks, have been able to stay on the rolls for up to an additional 47 weeks. But financing for that program, which is aimed at the states with the highest unemployment rates, expired Saturday. Under the terms of the deal, people who are eligible will receive any missed benefits retroactively."

Looking back, what I should have done the day after the election was to make it clear the House has passed a bill to extend all of the current tax rates, the House has passed a bill to replace the sequester with cuts in mandatory spending, and the Senate ought to do its work. We’re ready, able and willing to work with the Senate as soon as they produce a bill. It should have been what I said. You know, again, hindsight is 20-20.

Instead, Boehner opened the negotiations with a press conference announcing Republican concessions. In an attempt to appear temperate and moderate, Boehner discarded the principle that Republicans would not embrace higher taxes – a move that Obama quickly turned against Boehner, insisting that higher taxes would be the solution to any debt crisis.

Boehner now recognizes the problem with his strategy, and vows not to engage in any one-on-one negotiations with Obama in the future; instead, he says he will only allow bills to be passed in the House, then in the Senate, as provided for by the Constitution. The House threat to Boehner’s speakership, which was covered in depth by Breitbart News, apparently frightened Boehner enough to change course. “You have no idea the suspicions and the undercurrents that [negotiations with Obama] caused, frankly, a lot of my members,” said Boehner. “It really has, in fact, caused somewhat of a breach that I’ve been in the middle of trying to repair.”

Boehner is engaged in rehabilitating his image, attempting to overcome perceptions that he has the tendency to cave to President Obama:

Some of our members don’t realize that while I may be a nice enough guy, and I get along with people, when I was voting I had the 8th most conservative voting record in the House. But a lot of our newer members – they don’t know that. And so, you know, they think I’m some squish, that I’m ready to sell them out in a heartbeat, when obviously, most of you in this room know that that ain’t quite who I am.

The best way to overcome that perception is to stand up to the bully president. Unless Boehner embraces that truth, he will continue to lose favor among members of his own caucus.

President Obama discusses his post-shutdown agenda

There have been %22no winners%22 in %22self-inflicted crisis%2C%22 the president said

Obama urges Congress to pass a long-term budget plan%2C farm bill and immigration overhaul.

WASHINGTON — President Obama said Thursday there have been ""no winners"" in the government shutdown dispute, and lawmakers will have to work hard to regain the trust of Americans.

""The American people are completely fed up with Washington,"" Obama said during remarks at the White House.

Repeatedly criticizing Congress over the just-ended shutdown and a near-default, Obama said: ""At a moment when our economic recovery demands more jobs, more momentum, we've got yet another self-inflicted crisis that set our economy back.""

The president said Congress can recover by passing three agenda items: a long-tern budget plan that cuts spending but preserves essential programs, a new farm bill, and a bill to fix a ""broken"" immigration system.

""We can get them done by the end of the year if our focus is on the American people,"" Obama said.

Obama spoke hours after signing a bill that ended that ended the 16-day government partial shutdown and extended the government's borrowing authority, averting a potential default on some of the nation's debts.

The measures are temporary, creating the possibility of renewed conflict in the months ahead.

The new bill funds the government through Jan. 15. The debt ceiling borrowing authority expires Feb. 7, though the Treasury Department could use special accounting measures to extend it for a month or so.

In his brief speech, Obama bashed Congress by saying ""these last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy"" and ""there was no economic rationale for all of this.""

The budget impasse has also hurt U.S. credibility overseas, Obama said, encouraging enemies, emboldening competitors and depressing friends across the globe.

""The good news is we'll bounce back from this,"" Obama said. ""We always do.""

Politics in Washington ""has to change,"" Obama said. ""All of us need to stop focusing on the lobbyists, and the bloggers, and the talking heads on radio and the professional activists who profit from conflict.""

He did not specifically cite his Republican opponents in Congress, but did criticize ""the one side"" that practiced ""brinkmanship"" in recent weeks.

""There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, despite our differences, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis,"" Obama said.

He added: ""Disagreement cannot mean dysfunction.""

Some congressional Republicans opposed any new spending plan unless Obama delayed parts of his new health care plan. Obama refused, and enough GOP members eventually approved a plan with no major changes to Obamacare.

The bill also calls for new budget negotiations between Congress and the White House.

In outlining his new legislative agenda, Obama called for a ""balanced"" budget plan. In the past, that has included new revenues from wealthier Americans; congressional Republicans say they will oppose higher taxes, saying the emphasis should be on spending cuts.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pointed out that spending has been cut under the sequestration provisions of the previously signed Budget Control Act. ""The bipartisan legislation we passed to reopen the government and prevent a default will continue the BCA spending reductions,"" he said.

Obama noted that the Senate has approved an immigration bill this year on a bipartisan vote. Members of the Republican-run House want to split that plan into separate pieces. Many also object to a provision providing a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are already in the country illegally, describing that proposal as amnesty for lawbreakers."

Oops, no, you missed it.","Oh. Oh dear. (Right Wing Watch)

Approximately 100 conservative activists gathered in front of the White House on Tuesday for a kickoff of what organizers call ""the second American revolution."" The event could easily have been mistaken for a tea party rally, with American and Gadsden flags, a smattering of biker jackets and a few lawn chairs. Freedom Watch founder Larry Klayman, who emceed the event, told attendees if President Barack Obama does not resign by Nov. 29, conservative activists will meet in Philadelphia to elect a shadow government.

Oh, heavens, whatever shall become of our fair republic Two people per state? That's not a revolution, that's a Senate. If this shadow government is going to contain a full House as well, they're going to have to start appointing pets and toasters.

You have probably heard of Larry Klayman before. If not, no worries—but I should clarify that this is the loudmouthed neorevolutionary wingnut that has not been arrested for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, not the one who has. Yes, it can get confusing. While the other revolutionary is all about being able to carry guns wherever you want because you never know when the mushrooms will kick in, this one is still on the whole Obama is possibly a Kenyan kick, plus also ""Benghazi-gate"" and the shutting down of our precious war memorials, etc., and so forth.

Alright, so Mr. Klayman has said that if President Obama does not resign by the sacred date of Black Friday, he and other likeminded crackpots will immediately meet, perhaps on what shall henceforth be known as Honky Saturday, to elect their own shadow government. One that is not from Kenya, and is not a secret Musslim and so forth:



Bishop Dan Johnson of the Heart of Fire Church in Louisville, Ky., prayed with ralliers, asking God to ""cause [elected officials] to get on their knees, not to Allah, but to God almighty."" In his prayer, Johnson denounced homosexuality, permissive parenting, pornography and welfare.

""We have a scoundrel living in that building,"" [Former Rep. Bob Barr] said, pointing at the White House, ""and need to do something about it.""

In addition to a bewigged George Washington impersonator and the editor of conspiracy website World Net Daily Joseph Farah because, well, duh, there was also a former congressman on hand to lend the proceedings another few shovelfuls of skin-crawling creepiness.Ew, I thought that fellow had died. I suppose he might have, and his speech could have just been gas escaping—please get on that hypothesis, Mr. Farah, America demands an answer.

So there you go: the revolution is upon us, at least once they decide between Denny's and Olive Garden for the ceremonies. Never have so few given so little to scream so loudly—true patriots, all. Someday each one of them will be commemorated on trading cards, a little paperboard sea of revolutionary flags and trucker hats.

God speed, heroes, and remember to leave the 'shrooms at home.

Government says overpayments reveal weaknesses in Social Security procedures

Social Security plans to investigate and recoup improper payments

Last year%2C Social Security paid out %24137 billion in disability payments

WASHINGTON (AP) — Social Security made $1.3 billion in potentially improper disability payments to people who had jobs when they were supposed to be unable to work, congressional investigators said in a report Friday.

The Government Accountability Office estimated that 36,000 workers got improper payments from December 2010 to January 2013.

The numbers represent less than 1 percent of beneficiaries and less than 1 percent of disability payments made during the time frame. But GAO said the overpayments reveal weaknesses in Social Security's procedures for policing the system.

""The report lays out clear, common-sense steps that the agency can and should take in order to avoid improper payments,"" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""However, if we're serious about preventing waste and fraud and ensuring that these critical benefits get to the people who need and deserve them, Congress must also do its part and provide needed resources and access to basic anti-fraud data to the Social Security Administration.""

The Social Security Administration said its accuracy rate for disability payments is more than 99 percent. But the agency noted that even small errors translate into big numbers.

""We are planning to do an investigation, and we will recoup any improper payments from beneficiaries,"" Social Security spokesman Mark Hinkle said. ""It is too soon to tell what caused these overpayments, but if we determine that fraud is involved, we will refer these cases to our office of the inspector general for investigation.""

More than 8.2 million disabled workers received disability payments in December 2010, a figure that has grown to nearly 9 million. Last year, the agency paid out $137 billion in disability payments.

Before people can receive disability benefits, there is a 5-month waiting period in which they can, in general, earn no more than about $1,000 a month. The waiting period is to ensure that beneficiaries have long-term disabilities.

Using a federal wage database, investigators checked whether a sample of disability beneficiaries had worked and earned significant wages during the waiting period, the report said. They found that most of the improper payments went to people who worked during the five months they waited for payments to begin.

Once people start receiving benefits, they can return to work and still get benefits during a trial work period, in an attempt to re-enter the workforce. Using the same wage database, investigators checked whether another sample of disability beneficiaries earned significant wages after their trial work period had ended, the report said.

Based on their findings, the GAO estimated the amount of improper payments and the number of people receiving them.

Citing a potential weakness, the report said Social Security might not detect a person who worked during the waiting period if the period started in one year and ended in another. For example, if Social Security starts paying benefits in February, the agency might not detect significant wages earned the previous November because they weren't earned in the same year that benefits were awarded, the report said.

In a written response to the report, the Social Security Administration agency questioned whether GAO overestimated the amount of overpayments. The agency said investigators did not determine whether the work activity qualified as an unsuccessful attempt to return to work, or whether there were any other special circumstances.

The report comes as Social Security's disability program faces a financial crisis. If Congress doesn't act, the trust fund that supports the disability program will run out of money in 2016, according to projections by Social Security's trustees. At that point, the system will collect only enough money in payroll taxes to pay 80 percent of benefits, triggering an automatic 20 percent cut in benefits.

Congress could redirect money from Social Security's much bigger retirement program to shore up the disability program, as it did in 1994. But that would worsen the finances of the retirement program, which is facing its own long-term financial problems.

""This report demonstrates just how little importance the Social Security Administration places on policing its disability rolls,"" said Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""SSA has known for years that it could prevent millions of dollars in improper disability payments using quarterly wage records, but chose not to."""

The think tank, which closely tracks the debt limit issue, updated an earlier estimate that the date for a potential default would be between Oct. 18 and Nov. 5.

Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has warned Congress that the $16.7-trillion debt limit must be raised by Oct. 17 or the federal government would face default because it would be out of its so-called extraordinary measures for juggling the nation’s finances.

At that point, Lew said, the Treasury would have to depend on cash on hand of about $30 billion and incoming revenue to pay bills on any given day.

QUIZ: Test your knowledge about the debt limit

The new estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center could give Congress more time to overcome a political stalemate and raise the debt limit before the government defaults.

The center’s analysis was based on major federal government payments scheduled at the end of October and early November. But the report warned that it was difficult to set an exact date when a default might occur because the flow of incoming revenue can be random and vary by several billions of dollars.

“No one can predict with absolute certainty the date and time when Treasury will have exhausted all its extraordinary measures and run out of cash on hand,” the report said. “Therefore, policymakers should not assume that they have until Oct. 22 to make decisions concerning the federal debt ceiling.”

Financial markets are likely to start reacting before the date is reached by demanding higher interest rates on U.S. debt, the analysis said. Already, the cost of insurance on U.S. goverment debt has started rising, the center said.

The federal government faces payments of $12 billion for Social Security benefits on Oct. 23, $3 billion for federal employee salaries on Oct. 28, $2 billion to Medicaid providers on Oct. 30 and $6 billion in interest on public debt on Oct. 31.

But bigger payments loom on Nov. 1. The Treasury must pay at least $58 billion on that date -- $25 billion to Social Security recipients, $18 billion to Medicare providers, $12 billion in military and veterans pay and benefits, and $3 billion to recipients of Supplemental Security Income benefits to disabled people.

The large Nov. 1 payments are the reason Halloween is the real debt limit deadline, said Chris Krueger, a senior policy analyst at financial services firm Guggenheim Partners.

Even if the Treasury managed to continue paying all the federal government’s bills after Oct. 17, it would be “highly unlikely” that could continue into November, he said.

Krueger predicted there was a 40% chance the debt limit would not be raised by Lew’s Oct. 17 deadline.

More than 5,000 Head Start grant recipients -- of the millions that get it -- have had to close their doors

(CNN) —

Tuesday marks the eighth day of the partial shutdown of the federal government, and there’s no end in sight.

President Barack Obama continues to refuse to negotiate with Republicans. They continue to insist that any government funding bill must somehow delay, defund or otherwise disrupt his signature health reform law.

What’s more, the issue of funding the government has now fused with the issue of raising the nation’s debt ceiling.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said that come October 17 (or so), the nation will be unable to borrow money to pay the bills it continues to rack up.

The president’s trip to Bali for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit was canceled even though he isn’t currently engaged in negotiations with Republicans on how to solve the shutdown.

Instead of talking to each other, the two continue to trade barbs.

So the impasse continues.

The Federal work force – From furlough to paid vacation

As we start Week Two, things are looking up for federal workers.

A large portion of the approximately 400,000 civilian employees who had been furloughed by the Department of Defense may soon return to work.

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has determined a special bill passed by Congress to fund the salaries of the active duty military also extends to those civilians.

Hagel: Most civilian Defense workers can return this week

Civilians in the rest of the government have reason to be happy too. The House of Representatives passed a special bill to ensure that furloughed government workers get paid once federal coffers are refilled. The Senate has yet to act, but Obama has said he will sign it.

So for them, a scary furlough is on course to turn into a paid vacation, although if it lasts too long, some workers might have real trouble paying mortgages and car loans and buying groceries while they wait for the shutdown to end.

Contractors and businesses feel effects

There is a lot less security for federal contractors – employees of private companies doing work for the government. But the reinstatement of Pentagon civilians led one contractor, Sikorsky Aircraft, to cancel furloughs for 2,000 workers at assembly plants in three states.

But the shutdown could soon start to affect sectors beyond defense as existing contracts run out of money. One industry group estimated that after another week of shutdown, up to 300,000 government contractors could be out of work.

Boeing is still making new planes, but because of furloughed Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, next week they can’t deliver any of them. And it’s working for imports too. A new Jetblue Airbus jet is stranded in Europe because it can’t be inspected.

The FAA announced on Monday it will recall more than 800 employees who work in aviation safety, some for the unit that inspects new planes and others assigned to airlines.

Furloughs for federal inspectors also kept the National Transportation Safety Board from dispatching a team to investigate a fatal explosion on a Washington Metro line over the weekend.

“Due to a lapse in funding, NTSB staff are furloughed. The agency can only engage in those activities necessary to address imminent threats to the safety of human life or for the protection of property,” according to a statement from the agency. “After careful consideration it was determined that this accident did not meet the criteria for exempting employees from furlough.”

Head Start – Expect more Closings

After reports during the first week of shutdown that some Head Start programs had been shuttered in Florida, Connecticut and a few other states, more programs will likely shut as local programs run out of money. Because these programs are administered with grants at the local level, they are difficult to keep track of. But more than 5,000 – of the millions that get it - have now lost their Head Start program. This means parents are scrambling to find care for their children.

Hurricane Prep/Dodging the storm

But the threat from Karen was a reminder that the federal government usually plays a key role in preparation and cleanup.

FEMA has recalled some of the thousands of workers it furloughed, deeming them “essential.” If the storm had proved damaging, furloughed National Guardsmen would have been called up.

The longer the shutdown lasts, the more distinct its impact will be. By the end of the month, for instance, states will start to run out of funds for food assistance programs.

""About half"" of the 19 Fed ""participants"" expect the economy will improve enough to warrant an end to QE3 later this year.

But only 12 Fed officials get to vote on monetary policy at each meeting, and of those key ""members,"" ""many"" said they need to see further improvement in the job market before they'd be willing to start gradually winding down the stimulus program.

""Many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.""

Related: Fed officials in damage control mode

Investors welcomed that news and stocks rose shortly after the minutes were released.

In Fed-speak, ""participants"" refer to the 19 people who debate monetary policy at the central bank's meetings, but the word ""members"" refers to the 12 voters, who actually set policy. That distinction was key in how investors interpreted the minutes Wednesday.

At a press conference last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke laid out a scenario in which the Fed would start cutting its monthly asset purchases gradually this year, but not end them until mid-2014, as long as the economy improves and the unemployment rate falls to around 7%.

That announcement initially sent stocks plunging and interest rates climbing, until Bernanke's colleagues took to the speaking circuit in full force, to calm investors' nerves.

The Fed's controversial stimulus program includes buying $85 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month, in an effort to lower long-term interest rates. It marks the third round of so-called quantitative easing, which is why it's nicknamed QE3.

The Fed has also been holding short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, and has plainly stated that, regardless of what happens with QE3, it plans to keep short-term rates near historic lows until 2015."

Previously']","Obama’s plan to link corporate tax reform, jobs spending is quickly rejected by GOP","At a speech in Chattanooga, Tenn., Tuesday Obama said, “a job is a source of pride...proof that you’re doing the right things.” (The Washington Post)

At a speech in Chattanooga, Tenn., Tuesday Obama said, “a job is a source of pride...proof that you’re doing the right things.” (The Washington Post)

President Obama on Tuesday proposed spending more on creating jobs in exchange for an overhaul of business taxes. But the idea quickly devolved into the type of partisan finger-pointing that shows why any agreement will be so difficult.

With great fanfare, Obama and his aides promoted what they called a new “grand bargain” that would sidestep disagreements and focus on a longtime Republican goal: a rewrite of the business tax code to lower corporate rates.

The overhaul, administration officials said, would generate new revenue that could be used to pay for Obama’s priorities, including hiring workers to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure.

“Here’s the bottom line: I’m willing to work with Republicans on reforming our corporate tax code, as long as we use the money from transitioning to a simpler tax system for a significant investment in creating middle-class jobs. That’s the deal,” Obama said Tuesday during a speech at an Amazon.com warehouse in Chattanooga, Tenn.

The visit was part of his summer campaign to highlight his economic message and frame the fall debate over the federal budget.

“If folks in Washington want a ‘grand bargain,’ how about a grand bargain for middle-class jobs?” Obama asked rhetorically.

But within hours, Republican leaders in the Senate and House had rejected and ridiculed the idea as a tired repackaging of old proposals.

“It’s just a further-left version of a widely panned plan he already proposed two years ago, this time with extra goodies for tax-and-spend liberals,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), saying he had learned of the proposal late Monday night.

David Plouffe, a longtime Obama adviser, tweeted that the Republican reaction to the proposal “lays them bare again.” He wrote: “Not serious, Pavlovian opposition to even mainstream ideas.”

The White House proposal’s long odds were also underscored by opposition from the Business Roundtable, which represents the nation’s biggest companies.

“All revenues from corporate base-broadening measures should be applied to corporate rate reduction and to modernizing our international tax system, not for unrelated spending,” said Business Roundtable President John Engler, a former Republican governor of Michigan.

In principle, an overhaul of the corporate tax code could offer room for compromise for both sides. Republicans and Democrats generally agree that the corporate tax code is unnecessarily complex, has excessively high official rates and hurts U.S. competitiveness globally.

The Obama administration and key congressional Republicans, such as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (Mich.), also agree that U.S. companies that have amassed profits overseas should pay a tax or fee to bring those funds home. About $2 trillion in such profits remain abroad.

A fee on foreign profits could go a long way toward paying for the jobs proposals Obama wants, which also include opening manufacturing institutes and investing in community colleges to train workers. Obama has proposed $50 billion in jobs-related spending.

White House officials said Tuesday that it makes sense to try to strike a broad agreement on what the two sides agree on even if compromise remains elusive on more contentious topics, such as a long-term budget deal that involves cuts to the social safety net and new tax revenue.

“We should take a look at what we all do agree on,” White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri said during a conference call Tuesday. “This is something that would create jobs in the short term and be a big boost for the middle class.”

But Obama’s proposal did little to bridge the huge disagreements that remain. While the White House has advocated a new corporate tax rate of 28 percent, Republicans are pushing for a lower rate and have rejected the idea of using added revenue for new federal spending.

“This proposal allows President Obama to support President Obama’s position on taxes and President Obama’s position on spending, while leaving small businesses and American families behind,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).

In his remarks in Chattanooga, Obama challenged Republicans to lay out their own proposals and accused them of trying to gut federal investments in education and energy and roll back the administration’s landmark health-care program.

“If they’ve got a better plan to bring back more manufacturing jobs . . . then let me know, let me hear them,” Obama said.

The White House first introduced a proposal for revamping corporate taxes early last year — one that was almost identical to the one released Tuesday. But at the time, it didn’t address what would happen with the revenue raised as a result of the changes, mainly from a fee on past foreign profits of U.S. companies.

Republicans have argued the revenue should be put toward further reducing corporate tax rates. But administration officials say that doesn’t make sense because the lower rates would be in place indefinitely while the revenue would be a one-time event.

Camp and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who are working on their own tax-reform plan, did not endorse the proposal but expressed satisfaction with the president’s interest in the issue. They said in a joint statement that the “outdated tax code is making it harder for U.S. companies to compete.”

A number of congressional Democrats, meanwhile, backed the proposal while stressing their support for a broader package to replace the deep spending cuts known as sequestration."

White House lists how looming sequestration cuts would affect all 50 states

The sequester -- %2485 billion in automatic budget cuts -- takes effect Friday

Obama to discuss budget with the nation%27s governors on Monday

The White House kicked off a week of warnings about the sequestration by issuing reports Sunday on how the looming $85 billion in automatic budget cuts will affect each of the 50 states.

Among the examples: A slowdown of Superstorm Sandy cleanup in New Jersey, teacher layoffs in Ohio, reduced ship maintenance in Virginia, fewer vaccinations in Georgia, military base cutbacks in Texas and California, and similar reductions in states across the country, said the reports.

With the automatic cuts set to begin Friday, President Obama is expected to cite the state reports as part of his effort to pressure congressional Republicans over the sequestration. Obama's schedule this week includes remarks Monday to the National Governors Association and a Tuesday visit to shipyards in Newport News, Va.

The sequestration threatens ""hundreds of thousands of middle class jobs,"" as well as ""vital services for children, seniors, people with mental illness, and our men and women in uniform,"" said an introduction to the White House's state-by-state breakdowns.

By releasing sequestration reports on 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, the Obama administration is hoping that local media outlets will spotlight the jobs and services that are threatened in their areas.

The reports list numerous cutbacks in federal programs that have big constituencies or political popularity, including Head Start, military readiness, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and Clean Air and Clean Water programs.

For weeks, Obama has proposed replacing the sequestration with a new debt reduction agreement that would include both targeted spending cuts and new taxes through the elimination of loopholes and deductions that benefit the wealthy.

Republicans said Obama got higher tax rates in the agreement that ended their last budget standoff – ""the fiscal cliff"" – and this deal should be spending cuts only.

In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said ""surely"" Obama can find a way to cut 2%-3% from a $3.5 trillion budget. ""Rather than issuing last-minute press releases on cuts to first responders or troop training or airport security, he should propose smarter ways to cut Washington spending,"" McConnell said.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on CNN's State of the Union that Obama needs to speak directly to congressional Republicans about avoiding the sequestration. ""The president should be calling us over somewhere -- Camp David, the White House, somewhere -- and sitting down and trying to avert these cuts,"" McCain said.

Obama and aides said debt reduction should be ""balanced"" between program cuts and tax revenues because middle-class Americans should not bear all the burden of reducing a national debt that exceeds $16 trillion. White House officials said Obama is willing to work with Republicans, but Republicans have shown no desire to give up tax breaks benefiting the wealthy.

""The Republicans are making a policy choice,"" said White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer.

In his weekly Saturday radio address, Obama said the cuts will slow the economy, eliminate jobs and ""leave many families who are already stretched to the limit scrambling to figure out what to do.""

Obama also pledged to work with Republicans on an alternative, and aides said he would do that right up until Friday's deadline.

""The president is an eternal optimist,"" Pfeiffer said."

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama indicated a willingness Wednesday to agree to a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, if Republicans will accept it, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN.

The president signaled more “give” to the idea of a six-week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private White House meeting with House Democrats, said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The revelation comes amid a stalemate that has Republicans trying to use spending and debt limit deadlines as leverage to wring concessions from Obama and Democrats.

One thing any budget resolution won’t include, it appears, is provisions targeting the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

CNN has been reporting that senior House GOP sources are signaling openness to the idea of a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, as long as Democrats agree to negotiations on how to reduce the debt and deficit during the time the debt ceiling is increased.

Talking about a short-term solution, Obama told the group “if that’s what (House Speaker John) Boehner needs to climb out of the tree that he’s stuck in, then that’s something we should look at,” according to the lawmaker, who attended the meeting.

’Measure of hope’

The lawmaker left the White House meeting with a “small measure of hope that this becomes an exit strategy.”

The president warned if Republicans want to propose a short-term fix and Democrats say no, then the firm ground Democrats think they’re standing on now would soften.

Boehner and Republicans are demanding that Obama and Senate Democrats negotiate on deficit reduction steps that would be part of legislation to reopen the government and raise the limit on federal borrowing needed to pay the bills.

Obama has refused to enter formal talks until the shutdown ends and the debt ceiling has been raised to remove the threat of default.

A senior House Republican told CNN that GOP members may be willing to go for a short-term debt ceiling hike – lasting four to six weeks – as long as the president agrees that negotiations will occur during that time.

However, no specifics were immediately available about how such legislation would take shape or how the talks would occur.

But Republican sources have also told CNN the parameters of those talks have to be specific enough to sell to their skeptical GOP members.

So what would Democrats be willing to talk about? The lawmaker said House Democrats are open to hearing what Republicans have in mind with a short-term deal.

GOP seeks leverage

The shutdown began when Congress failed to pass a spending plan for the new fiscal year that started October 1. Now another deadline looms – the need to increase the federal borrowing limit by October 17 or risk a U.S. default.

Days of back-and-forth rhetoric and jibes between the leaders have brought no direct negotiations, but plenty of accusations and political spin.

On Wednesday, GOP leaders appeared to shift their focus from efforts to dismantle Obama’s signature health care reform, the initial driving force behind the shutdown, to securing spending cuts elsewhere.

Boehner, who earlier this year told his GOP colleagues that he was finished negotiating one on one with the president, has called for Obama to sit down for what he calls a “conversation” on how to reopen the government and prevent what would be the first-ever U.S. default as soon as next week.

But when Obama invited the entire House Republican caucus to the White House as part of a series of meetings with legislators, Boehner’s office responded that only the GOP leadership and committee chairmen would attend the Thursday gathering.

“It is our hope that this will be a constructive meeting and that the president finally recognizes Americans expect their leaders to be able to sit down and resolve their differences,” said a statement by a Boehner aide.

Obama’s invitation was intended to demonstrate outreach to Republicans just eight days from when the Treasury says Congress must increase the federal debt ceiling or risk default.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was disappointed that Boehner was limiting attendance at Thursday’s meeting to fewer than 20 of the more than 200 House Republicans.

“The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country” about the potential harmful impacts from the shutdown and a possible default, Carney said in a statement, repeating that Obama “will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job.”

Meanwhile, GOP leaders were distancing themselves from demands by tea party conservatives to also make dismantling Obamacare a condition for agreement.

Ryan’s plan drops Obamacare

Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman who was the party’s vice presidential nominee last year, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Democrats and Republicans should focus on “modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.”

“Right now, we need to find common ground,” Ryan wrote in the column posted online Tuesday night. “We need to open the federal government. We need to pay our bills today – and make sure we can pay our bills tomorrow. So let’s negotiate an agreement to make modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.”

However, Ryan’s column never mentioned Obamacare, focusing instead on forced spending cuts to domestic and military programs, as well as reforms to Medicare.

Ryan’s Obamacare omission appeared to anger conservatives, who took to Twitter in response.

“Much like White House press, Paul Ryan doesn’t mention Obamacare in WSJ oped,” tweeted Dan Holler, spokesman for the conservative group Heritage Action.

Perhaps in response to a conservative backlash, Boehner made a brief statement Wednesday on the House floor that focused on the GOP message that Obamacare was detrimental to the country. He stopped short of linking it to any negotiations on ending the shutdown and raising the debt ceiling.

Boehner insists that the government must reduce deficits, declaring that Republicans won’t raise the debt ceiling without steps toward that goal.

Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase

But a House GOP leadership source told CNN on Wednesday that Obama’s rejection of linking negotiations to raising the borrowing limit meant Republicans would likely be forced to agree to a “clean” debt ceiling limit proposal in exchange for setting up talks on deficit reduction steps.

According to the source, the economic implications of a U.S. default “scares people” to make such a deal acceptable to enough House Republicans in order to get negotiations started.

The source acknowledged Boehner may lack support from some or most of his GOP caucus, requiring Democratic votes for the proposal to pass.

Democrats planning

Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN his side already was mulling over “what we will discuss, what we will negotiate over, what things will be on the table.” Obama also met with the House Democratic caucus at the White House.

The GOP-led House passed a measure on Tuesday to set up a special negotiating team comprising members of both parties from the House and Senate, but Obama and Democrats rejected the concept as the latest Republican gimmick to force talks before raising the debt ceiling.

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats announced they will propose a measure to increase the debt ceiling beyond next year’s congressional elections with no additional issues attached.

While many Republicans are certain to oppose it, Democratic leaders hope increased pressure for Congress to prevent a default next week will cause some GOP senators to vote for it.

A GOP source told CNN on Tuesday that the White House was having corporate chief executives call Republican leaders. The business community has called for resolving the Washington stalemate to avoid a default that would spike interest rates to impact the economy.

Without a breakthrough, the shutdown would continue at a cost estimated at up to $50 billion a month. Failure to raise the debt ceiling by next week’s deadline would leave the government unable to borrow money to pay its bills for the first time in its history.

All the partisan bickering – and lack of progress – is taking its toll not just on furloughed workers, shuttered government facilities and programs, but also on Americans’ confidence in their government.

Poll: Most angry at both parties

Shutdown forecast: Week two and clouds ahead

In a national poll released Monday, most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country.

The CNN/ORC International survey indicated that slightly more people were angry at Republicans than Democrats or Obama for the shutdown, though both sides took a hit.

According to the poll conducted over the weekend, 63% of respondents said they were angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown, while 57% expressed anger at Democrats and 53% at Obama.

“It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around, and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown,” said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

According to a new Gallup poll Wednesday, the Republican party’s favorable rating dropped to 28%, down 10 percentage points from September. The 43% for Democrats was a 4-percentage-point drop from last month.

Will 2014 election solve anything?

Senate Democrats sought to keep up the pressure, holding a rally on the Capitol steps on Wednesday to demonstrate their unified stance in calling for House Republicans to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.

A CNN survey indicates enough Republicans in the House would join Democrats in voting for a Senate-passed spending plan to end the shutdown.

All 200 Democrats and 19 Republicans support passing a continuing resolution with no additional legislative strings attached .

With two vacancies in 435-member House, 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the House.

However, not enough Republicans are willing to join Democrats in a procedural move to force Boehner to hold a vote on the Senate plan.

Boehner has said the measure would fail to pass in the House, a contention rejected by Obama and Democrats.

The speaker has previously allowed measures to pass the House with mostly Democratic support, which has weakened his leadership among conservatives. Doing so now could cost him his leadership post due to the conservative backlash in would likely unleash, analysts believe.

The job pays $5.25 an hour, plus tips. “I’m glad I don’t have a family,” Stewart said. “Because if I had a family, man, we’d be hit.” (Will Figg/For The Washington Post)

The alarm rang on John Stewart’s phone at 1:10 a.m. Up at 1:30, he caught one bus north into Philadelphia a little after 2 and another bus, south toward the airport, half an hour after that. He made it into work around 3:25 for a shift that started at 4, for a job that pays $5.25 an hour, which he cannot afford to lose.

Stewart is 55, tall and thin and animated. At work he wears a clip-on tie, a white cotton shirt with a fraying collar and a pair of black sneakers he nabbed on sale for $12.99 a few days ago. He wheels elderly air passengers from the ticket counters through security and to their gates, and back again, and every once in a while they tip him. Usually for lunch he buys a candy bar. His skin flakes from psoriasis, which gets worse when he worries, which, these days, is all the time. He can’t pay for treatments to soothe the itching or for a car to shorten his pre-dawn commute.

“I can’t save money,” he said recently, “to buy the things I need to live as a human being.”

American workers are living with unprecedented economic anxiety, four years into a recovery that has left so many of them stuck in place. That anxiety is concentrated heavily among low-income workers such as Stewart.

More than six in 10 workers in a recent Washington Post-Miller Center poll worry that they will lose their jobs to the economy, surpassing concerns in more than a dozen surveys dating to the 1970s. Nearly one in three, 32 percent, say they worry “a lot” about losing their jobs, also a record high, according to the joint survey, which explores Americans’ changing definition of success and their confidence in the country’s future. The Miller Center is a nonpartisan affiliate of the University of Virginia specializing in public policy, presidential scholarship and political history.

View Graphic Lower-income workers have job and income worries.

Job insecurities have always been higher among low-income Americans, but they typically rose and fell across all levels of the income ladder. Today, workers at the bottom have drifted away, occupying their own island of in­security.

Fifty-four percent of workers making $35,000 or less now worry “a lot” about losing their jobs, compared with 37 percent of ­lower-income workers in 1992 and an identical number in 1975, according to surveys by Time magazine, CNN and Yankelovich, a market research firm. Intense worry is far lower, 29 percent, among workers with incomes between $35,000 and $75,000, and it drops to 17 percent among those with incomes above that level.

Lower-paid workers also worry far more about making ends meet. Fully 85 percent of them fear that their families’ income will not be enough to meet expenses, up 25 points from a 1971 survey asking an identical question. Thirty-two percent say they worry all the time about meeting expenses, a number that has almost tripled since the 1970s.

Americans’ economic perceptions often divide along political lines; supporters of the incumbent president are usually more optimistic about the job market and the health of the economy. But that’s not the case with this new anxiety. Once you control for economic and demographic factors, there is no partisan divide. There’s no racial divide, either, and no gender gap. It also doesn’t matter where you live.

What matters in this new anxiety, what unites the people who worry more now than ever, are income and education. Workers who earn less, and workers who didn’t graduate from college, fear losing their already weaker livelihoods more than anyone else.

Spend a day with John Stewart — a man who has worked low-wage jobs since the late ’70s — and you start to understand why.

Back then, fewer worries

His first job — he doesn’t remember if it was in 1978 or ’79 — was cooking eggs and pancakes at a five-and-dime in New York City. He made $2.35 an hour, which would be a little less than $8 an hour today. He was 19 years old, a high school graduate who had grown up in Brooklyn and North Carolina. He hadn’t gone to college. He was sending chunks of his paycheck south to his parents, who were battling health issues. It was an anxious time in the national economy, with inflation running high.

He worried hardly at all, about any of it.

“In the years back then,’’ Stewart explained recently, “if you left a job, you were able to find another job, within the next day or the same week.”

He did leave that cooking job, fairly quickly. He found work right away as a messenger, running documents all over the city. In later years he would work in offices and at a trash dump infested with rats. He tried college for six months but left when his mother died. He has never gone back, though he would like to; he says he has never had the time or money for school. Eventually he landed in New Jersey at a Wal-Mart, poised, he thought, for a manager’s job. But he lost the promotion chance and the job — he was late to work too often, because of unreliable public transportation, he says — and in the fall of 2010 he retreated to Philadelphia to live with a cousin and look for a new gig.

This time, finding a job took him five months. It’s sadly typical for this recovery: In October, more than 4 million Americans had been looking for work longer than six months. That was down from nearly 7 million people at the start of 2010, but still 1 million more than at any point in U.S. history before the Great Recession.

When Stewart finally got the job at the airport, through a man at his church, he thought he was signing on for $7.25 an hour. On the first day they told him no, it’s $5.25 plus whatever tips come your way. That’s not usually very much. He brings home about $600 most months after taxes and accounting for unpaid sick days, he says. He pays a family friend $400 a month to live in her basement.

It makes him grateful to be a bachelor: “I’m glad I don’t have a family,” Stewart said. “Because if I had a family, man, we’d be hit.”

He has held the job for two years, arriving hours before sunrise on the circuitous bus route that takes more than an hour to cover what would be a quick ­seven-mile drive.

Before the shift begins at 4 a.m. he sits with colleagues, usually chatting about family and friends and complaining about work. On a recent Thursday, his first assignment came at 4:05. He picked up a 91-year-old woman at the counter and wheeled her through security, helping her shed her coat and walk through the checkpoint. It was a cold morning in the terminal, as usual, and he wore a blue jacket over a navy windbreaker over a navy sweater over his usual shirt and tie. At the gate she tipped him. He wouldn’t say how much.

Tips vary from day to day — sometimes he leaves work with enough cash in his pocket for a takeout dinner. Sometimes hardly any at all. Some folks bark directions sternly at the man pushing them around. Some passengers in the terminal curse him when they need to move as he rolls the chairs through. One man tried to fight him after Stewart asked him several times to make way.

The job is hardest before the sun comes up, Stewart said, but he tries to treat every day like he’s “going to a party” when morning comes.

“I believe in God,” he said, “and I try to keep that smile on my face, even though I may be struggling.”

He is usually tired by 6 a.m.

“My feet hurt now,” he said, boarding the bus, shortly after his shift ended at noon. “I’m tired. I always get tired.”

A stagnant labor market

There is a reason workers like Stewart are so nervous in today’s economy. That reason is the economy itself. There are still 11 million Americans looking for work who can’t find a job. The unemployment rate is 7.3 percent, higher than it has been since 1980, except during recessions and their immediate aftermaths. Adjusting for inflation, average household incomes for the poorest 40 percent of workers have fallen steadily — by more than 10 percent, total — since 2000.

Lower-income workers get most of their money from wages, as opposed to investments or other capital gains, said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute, who writes extensively about unemployment and income.

“It’s no surprise that security concerns are off the map now [among those workers] because the labor market is so bad,” Shierholz said. “High unemployment hurts workers across the board, but it hurts workers with low and moderate incomes more.”

Even worse, there aren’t many signs that job and wage growth will rocket upward anytime soon — especially for workers like Stewart without college degrees.

“High-paying jobs for people who didn’t go to college just aren’t there anymore” in large numbers, said Melissa Kearney, an economist who directs the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution.

As low-income workers tightly grip their current jobs, few are seeking the skills and education often required to land better-

paying ones, the Post-Miller Center poll suggests. Fewer than four in 10 of those earning less than $35,000 annually said they’ve taken training programs in the past year to update their knowledge or skills, compared with about half of middle-income workers and nearly two-thirds of those whose household income tops $75,000.

Several economists say there’s a simple explanation for that gap: Poorer people can’t spare the time or money to go to school. Stewart, for example, would love to ditch his airport job to work as a hospital aide, hopefully for higher pay and at least some health benefits. (His job now offers none.) He’d need to take classes to earn a certification to qualify for that work. He has no idea how he’d swing that, financially. But he has hope that he will — and that, too, is typical of low-earning, anxious workers today.

Nearly six in 10 of those workers think it’s likely they’ll find a new job that pays better in the next five years, compared with fewer than four in 10 middle- and upper-income workers. Almost half expect a significant raise at their current job in the next half-decade, again outpacing the optimism of those who currently take home more.

Day to day, though, Stewart battles fatigue and depression. He rode two buses home from work when his Thursday shift ended, then hopped off and walked a few blocks toward his basement apartment. He had visitors, so he sat in the upstairs living room, near a computer table with pictures of the smiling Obama family, and talked for almost an hour.

But if it were a normal day, he said, if he were alone, he’d have walked off the bus and into the house and straight downstairs. He’d strip off his shirt and light a cigarette and lie down. Just to take it easy, for a bit.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said consumer spending increased 0.3 percent last month, after a revised 0.3 percent drop in April.



Consumer spending in April was previously reported to have declined 0.2 percent.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 346,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the previous week were revised to show 1,000 more applications than previously reported.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to fall to 345,000 last week.

The four-week moving average for new claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,750 to 345,750.

A Labor Department analyst said no states had been estimated and there were no special factors in the state data.

Employers added 175,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month, with the unemployment rate ticking up a tenth of a percentage point to 7.6 percent. Job gains have averaged 172,000 over the last 12 months.

The Federal Reserve, which has been closely monitoring the labor market, said after its policy-setting meeting last week downside risks to the outlook for the jobs market had diminished since the fall.

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank could trim the $85 billion in bonds it has been buying each month to keep interest rates low and bolster the economy sometime later this year and likely bring the program to a close by mid-2014.

The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid fell 1,000 to 2.965 million in the week ended June 15.

U.S. consumer spending rebounded and incomes recorded their largest increase in three months in May, adding to data that have suggested the economy has shifted to firmer ground.

Last month's consumer spending increase was in line with economists' expectations. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent last month after dipping 0.1 percent in April.

Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. Though the pace of spending has slowed from the 2.6 percent rate notched in the first three months of the year, consumers will likely continue to drive growth in the second quarter.

Recent data, including housing, regional factory activity, business spending plans and consumer confidence, have pointed to an economy that is regaining some speed after stumbling early in the second quarter.

That is broadly supportive of the Fed's view last week that the downside risks to the economy's outlook have waned.

That theme held as other details of the Commerce Department report showed income grew 0.5 percent last month, the largest gain since February, after nudging up 0.1 percent in April. That reflects a steady pace of job gains.

There was also a bit of inflation in the economy last month, pointing to some pick-up in demand.

A price index for consumer spending inched up 0.1 percent in May after declining two straight months. A core reading that strips out food and energy costs also rose 0.1 percent after being flat in April.

Over the past 12 months, inflation rose 1 percent, still below the Fed's 2 percent target. The index had increased only 0.7 percent in the period through April.

Core prices were up 1.1 percent from a year ago after rising by the same margin in April.

After all, it was just 99 years ago that Henry Ford offered the workingman $5 a day and profit-sharing. How, in less than a century, did it come to this?

The short answers: municipal mismanagement, race riots, white flight, black flight, dead flight (people routinely disinter their deceased and relocate them to the suburbs). There were the overreaching unions and management that couldn’t balance a ball. Proof? The multibillion-dollar bailout of the auto industry. Thank you, American taxpayers!

Then there is our spectacular civic corruption: A former mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, waits for a bed in federal prison, convicted of extortion, racketeering and bribery. He looted the city of millions of dollars and stole the future of thousands of children. They can send him to hell for all I care. I don’t want to pay for his upkeep. But thank you, taxpayers! You will pay for it. And the ex-mayor’s team of super lawyers will also be paid with the public dime.

So Detroit files for bankruptcy. What does this mean? Pay close attention because it may be coming to you soon, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia. In 2011, Moody’s calculated the unfunded liabilities for Illinois’s three largest state-run pension plans to be $133 billion. (It is expected to be even larger this year.) That’s the size of six Detroit bankruptcies — give or take a few hundred million.

Of Detroit’s debt of at least $18 billion, about $7 billion is secured by collateral like casino revenues and utility taxes. That means creditors — read: big banks — will get paid. Of the remaining $11 billion dollars or so in unsecured debt, about $9 billion is owed to retirees and current municipal workers, people like firefighters and police officers. These debts come in the form of promised pension checks and health care benefits, all backed by a false, unsecured promise. These are the people who are likely to lose out.

In simple math, do we sacrifice 30,000 former and current workers to save a city of 700,000 people and their progeny? Most Detroiters will tell you yes. Don’t judge. We feel bad about it. But we’re simply Americans. We are a gaunt dog. We are desperate. And you are watching and studying us.

Pension checks will be much smaller than planned and health care benefits will get foisted off on Medicaid and Obamacare. Thanks again, taxpayers!"
http://news.yahoo.com/washington-dc-city-council-raises-minimum-wage-11-181750866--finance.html,,[],Washington city council ups minimum wage to $11.50 per hour in 2016,"By Ian Simpson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington's city council on Tuesday approved raising the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour, one of the highest rates among U.S. cities and part of the wealthy region's push to hike base pay. The minimum wage in the U.S. capital would rise in 2016 from the current $8.25, and then be indexed for inflation. The council gave unanimous final approval to the measure, which it first passed two weeks ago. Democratic Mayor Vincent Gray has opposed the measure, saying it is unclear how it would affect the labor market, and urged an increase to $10 an hour instead. The unanimous vote means the council could pass it over Gray's veto. The council coordinated raising the base wage with lawmakers in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, in Washington's Maryland suburbs. They approved similar measures last month. Once the higher pay takes effect, the three jurisdictions would form a region with 2.5 million residents and a minimum wage higher than any of the 50 states. Virginia, which borders Washington, requires employers to pay the federal rate of $7.25 an hour. Some business groups said the measure was ill-advised. Jim Dinegar, the president and chief executive of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, told Reuters the higher wages would make the capital and the region less attractive to business, especially since Virginia's rate remained unchanged. ""They think they're doing this in a vacuum. They're not,"" he said of the council's vote. Another business group, the District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce, has called for raising the minimum wage to $10 over three years and then indexing it to inflation. Washington state has the highest hourly minimum wage among U.S. states at $9.19 an hour. Among city workers, those in Sonoma, California, enjoy the highest rate, at $15.38 an hour. Gray had vetoed a bill this fall that would have required Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other big retailers to pay a 50 percent premium over the city's current minimum wage. The pay hike comes after fast-food workers went on strike this month across the United States as part of a campaign to raise pay to $15 an hour. The city council voted as the region emerges relatively unscathed from the recession and with the capital's economy and population growing. The Census Bureau reported last week that eight of the 13 U.S. counties with the highest median income last year were in the Washington area. (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

It can be difficult to objectively assess the quality of a state’s management. The economy and standard of living can be affected by decisions made decades ago, forces outside the control of the state’s government and administrators, as well as the government’s own actions.

Every year, 24/7 Wall St. tries to answer this question by conducting an extensive survey of every state. To determine how well states are managed, we examined their financial data, as well as the services they provide and their residents’ standard of living. This year, North Dakota is the best-run state in the country for the second year in a row, while California is the worst-run for the third year in a row.

Identifying appropriate criteria to compare the 50 states can be challenging because they vary so much. Some states have abundant natural resources, while others rely on services or innovation. A few have been burdened by struggling industries. Some are more rural, while others are more urban. Because of such differences, a spending or tax policy that can be beneficial in one state can be disastrous in another.

Many of the best-run states in the nation benefit from an abundance of natural resources. North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, and Texas, among the best-run states, are all among the states with the greatest concentration of GDP in the mining industry, which includes activities such as oil and natural gas extraction, as well as coal mining. The presence of this industry benefits states in several ways. North Dakota and Texas led the nation in real GDP growth in 2012, while Alaska has used its oil revenue to establish a permanent fund that pays residents an annual dividend.

The housing crisis has had a major negative impact on a number of the worst-run states. It caused a drastic decline in construction employment in states like Arizona, California, and Nevada. Many of these lost jobs have yet to be replaced. In the hardest-hit states, this has resulted not only in worsening unemployment, but increased poverty and budget shortfalls. Although the economies of these states have largely improved, the residual effects of the housing crisis remain.

While these can be considered extenuating circumstances, the fact is that each state must deal with the cards it is dealt. Governments must plan for worst-case scenarios, including the collapse of an industry. Several resource-rich states have squandered their advantages and rank poorly on our list. Good governance involves raising and spending enough to provide for the well-being of the population without risking the state’s long-term stability.

To determine how well the states are run, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed hundreds of data sets from dozens of sources. We looked at each state’s debt, revenue, expenditure, and deficit to determine how well it was managed fiscally. We reviewed taxes, exports, and GDP growth, including a breakdown by sector, to identify how each state was managing its resources. We looked at poverty, income, unemployment, high school graduation, violent crime and foreclosure rates to assess the well-being of the state’s residents.

While each state is different, the best-run states share certain characteristics, as do the worst run. For example, the populations of the worse-off states tended to have lower standards of living. Violent crime rates in these states were usually higher and residents were much less likely to have a high school diploma.

The worst-run states also tended to have weak fiscal management reflected in higher budget shortfalls and lower credit ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poors.

The better-run states tended to display stable fiscal management. Pensions were more likely to be fully funded, debt was lower, and budget deficits smaller. Credit ratings agencies also were much more likely to rate the well-run states favorably. Only two poorly run states received a perfect credit rating from either agency. California and Illinois, which are ranked worst and third worst, received the lowest ratings from both agencies.

The states that were well-managed also tended to have lower unemployment rates. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates ranked as the best-run states. California, Illinois, and Nevada — the states with the highest unemployment rates as of 2012 — were among the five worst-run states.

Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that worst-run states tended to have better fiscal management. They have weak fiscal management.

Members of Congress called for firing the agency’s acting commissioner, one of the senior officials involved, and President Obama said he would “not tolerate” any such abuse of power by the IRS.

“If you’ve got the IRS operating in anything less than a neutral and nonpartisan way, then that is outrageous; it’s contrary to our traditions. And people have to be held accountable, and it’s got to be fixed,” Obama said at a White House news conference, noting that the IRS’ practices are under investigation. “We’ll wait and see what exactly all the details and the facts are. But I’ve got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it. And we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this.”

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) announced a hearing Friday. “News that the agency admits it targeted American taxpayers based on politics is both astounding and appalling,” he said. “It is almost inconceivable to imagine that top officials at the IRS knew conservative groups were being targeted but chose to willfully mislead the committee’s investigation into this practice.”

Despite calls for firings, neither the president nor members of Congress have legal authority to fire any IRS officials other than the commissioner and general counsel, who are the agency’s two political appointees. Neither of those jobs is currently filled.

Top officials at the IRS didn’t reveal the improper targeting until Friday, when it acknowledged mistakes it said had been made by its Cincinnati office, the main office handling tax-exempt entities — although members of Congress started asking questions about the agency’s handling of tea party organizations as early as 2011.

On Monday, Jay Sekulow, a lawyer representing 27 tea party groups, said IRS queries came not only from Cincinnati but from offices in Washington, D.C., and Laguna Niguel and El Monte, Calif.

Sekulow, a former lawyer for the IRS chief counsel’s office, said the groups would continue to press for answers on who was guiding the review of tea party groups. “Agents can’t do that on their own,” he said.

Some groups were sent detailed questionnaires that asked about their relationships with candidates or public officials, details of their fundraising pitches and their lists of donors.

The controversy centers on “social welfare” organizations set up under section 501(c)4 of the tax code, which can participate in elections as long as politics is not their primary purpose. Unlike political committees, such groups are not required to disclose their donors. Social welfare groups had a limited role in campaigns until 2010, when the Supreme Court ruled in the Citizens United case that corporations could spend unlimited sums on elections — a decision that also unleashed a flood of spending by the nonprofit groups.

The IRS staff has the job of determining which groups qualify for tax-exempt status. Lois Lerner, the IRS director of exempt organizations, said the disputed actions were devised as shortcuts by workers dealing with a flood of applications from groups seeking to become tax-exempt social welfare organizations.

The agency has acknowledged that employees in Cincinnati, in reviewing applications for nonprofit status, inappropriately singled out conservative organizations whose applications included the words “tea party” or “patriots” for closer examination.

Advertisement

But at least two top agency officials repeatedly assured members of Congress in 2012 that the IRS was processing applications in a smooth and consistent manner, even though they knew of the problems.

Steven T. Miller, a 20-year veteran of the agency who is the acting IRS commissioner, first learned on May 3, 2012, that the agency had inappropriately singled out groups by name, the IRS told the Los Angeles Times. A month later, Miller made no mention of the matter in a letter to Congress about the issue.

Advertisement

In a June 15, 2012, letter to the chairman of a key House oversight subcommittee, Miller wrote that after an increase in applications for tax-exempt status in 2010, the agency “took steps to coordinate the handling of the cases to ensure consistency.”

Miller, then deputy IRS commissioner, noted that some applications had lingered “for a longer time than expected,” according to the letter obtained by The Times. And he made an allusion to some internal problems, writing that, in early 2012, “issues with respect to these cases were brought to the attention” of top officials who “ensured more timely and consistent handling of the cases.”

Advertisement

Lerner had raised concerns about the criteria used to identify potentially problematic tax-exempt applicants at a June 2011 IRS staff meeting, according to a timeline assembled by the Treasury Department’s inspector general for tax administration.

When Lerner learned that groups with “tea party, “patriots” or “9-12 Project” in their names were selected for further review, she “instructed that the criteria be immediately revised,” according to the timeline, which is part of a report that a Treasury Department spokesman said would be released this week. The “9-12"" designation refers to a conservative movement to restore the national unity felt after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Advertisement

But nearly a year later, in an April 26, 2012, letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Lerner said the agency was trying “to promote consistent handling” of tax-exempt applications. She also said the applications were judged by IRS agents who used “sound reasoning based on tax law training and his or her own experience.”

In a May 4, 2012, follow-up letter to the committee, Lerner wrote, “To minimize possible variances, the IRS utilizes training and tools to promote quality and consistency in similar cases.”

Advertisement

The IRS did not respond to questions about why the officials had not revealed the improper targeting sooner.

The timeline prepared by the inspector general depicts an agency mired in confusion, hung up on bureaucratic infighting and frozen by what the report calls “a lack of management oversight and guidance.”

Advertisement

The actions in question started about March 1, 2010, when an IRS specialist started pulling applications using keywords like “tea party.” By the time Lerner learned about the practice in June of the next year, employees were also selecting applications that criticized the government or talked about lobbying to “make America a better place to live.”

It was not until May 17, 2012, that the agency adopted its final criteria for review, which focused on organizations with a “significant amount of political campaign intervention.”

Advertisement

By that time, the questionnaires had already gone out and organizations had begun protesting about IRS harassment, drawing the attention of agency higher-ups. In April, a “senior technical advisor” visited Cincinnati and looked over the pending cases, pointing out “troubling questions,” including requests for donor information. On June 4, 2012, the agency drafted a letter assuring groups that any donor information would be destroyed.

Obama told reporters he learned about the issue from news reports Friday after Lerner revealed it during a talk at a conference. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the White House counsel received a “normal sort of heads-up” about the inspector general’s report the week of April 22.

“We, like everyone else, are awaiting the results,” Carney said.

Current head has been criticized for opposing plans for partial forgiveness of mortgage debt

If confirmed by the Senate%2C he would replace Edward DeMarco

Watt%27s nomination comes at a crucial time for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

WASHINGTON -- President Obama nominated North Carolina congressman Mel Watt on Wednesday to head the government agency that oversees the government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, prompting criticism from Republicans opposed to allowing some principal reductions for struggling homeowners.

""Mel understands as well as anybody what caused the housing crisis,"" Obama said in nominating Watt to be head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. ""He knows what it's going to take to help responsible homeowners fully recover.""

If confirmed by the Senate, Watt would replace acting FHFA Director Edward DeMarco, who has been criticized by Democratic lawmakers and housing advocates for opposing plans for partial forgiveness of mortgage debt.

Republicans have signaled opposition to Watt's nomination, saying proposals to reduce principals are likely to lead to more mortgage defaults and cost taxpayers money.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., a member of the Senate banking committee, said, ""I could not be more disappointed in this nomination. This gives new meaning to the adage that the fox is guarding the hen house. The debate around his nomination will illuminate for all Americans why Fannie and Freddie failed so miserably.""

Senate Republicans blocked a previous Obama nominee for the housing job, North Carolina banking regulator Joseph A. Smith Jr.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called on the Obama administration to remove DeMarco as acting director of FHFA, saying it ""has refused repeatedly — often with cold indifference — to work with families struggling to save their homes.""

Warren also said that Watt ""is a thoughtful policymaker with a deep background in finance and a long record as a champion for working families.""

In March, attorneys general from nine states, led by Democrats Eric Schneiderman of New York and Martha Coakley of Massachusetts, sent Obama a letter saying that under DeMarco's tenure, Fannie and Freddie have been a ""direct impediment to our economic recovery.""

Obama made the Watt announcement at the same time he nominated venture capitalist Tom Wheeler to chair the Federal Communications Commission.

Watt has represented the Charlotte area in the U.S. House for 20 years. Obama pointed out that Watt is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, which handles housing policy.

""Mel has led efforts to rein in unscrupulous mortgage lenders,"" Obama said. ""He's helped protect consumers from the kind of reckless risk-taking that led to the financial crisis in the first place. And he's fought to give more Americans in low-income neighborhoods access to affordable housing.""

Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Tex., who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said the issue isn't Watt, but what he called the Obama administration's refusal to reform the housing finance system.

Hensarling said DeMarco, the acting director, ""has emphasized protecting the interests of taxpayers and reforming Fannie and Freddie,"" and that ""whoever sits in the FHFA director's chair needs to continue DeMarco's policies. If they simply do whatever the administration wants, they will have failed.""

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government sponsored mortgage-finance enterprises that the government rescued at the height of the financial crisis in September 2008 as they neared collapse from losses on soured mortgage loans.

Taxpayers have spent about $170 billion to rescue the companies. So far, they have repaid a combined $55.2 billion.

Fannie and Freddie together own or guarantee about half of all U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million home loans. Those loans are worth more than $5 trillion. Along with other federal agencies, they back roughly 90% of new mortgages.

The White House has been lining up supporters who might hold some sway with GOP senators as they consider Watt's nomination.

Erskine Bowles, a fellow North Carolinian and former White House chief of staff under President Clinton, praised Watt as a first-rate selection, telling the Associated Press that he brings ""a bright mind, great work habits and an understanding of how Washington works to the job.""

Obama: Job of debt reduction nearly done

By Lori Montgomery,

When President Obama delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, here’s one thing you won’t hear: an ambitious new plan to rein in the national debt.

In recent weeks, the White House has pressed the message that, if policymakers can agree on a strategy for replacing across-the-board spending cuts set to hit next month, Obama will pretty much have achieved what he has called “our ultimate goal” of halting the rapid rise in government borrowing.

“Over the last few years, Democrats and Republicans have come together and cut our deficit [over the next decade] by more than $2.5 trillion through a balanced mix of spending cuts and higher tax rates for the wealthiest Americans,” Obama said during his weekend radio address. “That’s more than halfway towards the $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists and elected officials from both parties say we need to stabilize our debt.”

By the administration’s math, Washington needs to enact only $1.5 trillion more in 10-year savings to hit the $4 trillion target, White House economic adviser Jason Furman told reporters last week. At $1.2 trillion, the automatic cuts, known as the sequester, quite nearly fit the bill.

Deficit hawks have reacted with alarm to the administration’s position. Since a calamitous recession hit in December 2007, the amount the government owes outside investors has more than doubled, soaring from about $5 trillion to more than $11.6 trillion. By the end of this year, the debt will top $12 trillion, according to new projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — about 76 percent of the nation’s economy.

Cutting an additional $1.5 trillion would indeed stabilize the debt, leaving it growing at about the same rate as the broader economy for the rest of the decade, the CBO said. However, the debt would remain above 73 percent of gross domestic product — the highest level in U.S. history except for the period after World War II.

That’s much higher than the 62 percent target policymakers set three years ago when Obama appointed the Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission. And because policymakers have avoided changes to the big federal health and retirement programs, the debt would start rising again after 2023 as the bulk of the baby-boom generation retires.

“You don’t do half the job and say you’re done,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “And stabilizing the debt is just half the job.”

As MacGuineas spoke, her organization released an updated analysis of the issue titled “Our Debt Problems Are Far From Solved.”

“While the deficit reduction enacted to date represents notable progress, lawmakers have achieved only slightly more than half of the minimum necessary deficit reduction to achieve sustainability over the next decade by our estimates,” the report says. “. . . [T]he debt-to-GDP ratio is on a path to reach about 79 percent by 2023 under our current policy projections, rather than 91 percent of GDP absent this deficit reduction. Though this represents a notable improvement, it still leaves debt on an upward path — rising from 73 percent of GDP today to nearly 130 percent by 2040.”

The report concludes that policymakers need to find an additional $2.4 trillion in savings to put the debt on “a clear downward path.” A similar report released Monday by the Democratic group Third Way calls for additional savings of roughly $2 trillion.

A third report, by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, on Monday backed the White House target of $1.5 trillion as “the minimum appropriate budget policy.” Though it would not “permanently solve our fiscal problems, it would still represent an important accomplishment,” the report says.

However, the center’s analysts concluded that “a somewhat larger amount of deficit reduction would be desirable, if it can be secured through sound, balanced policies that don’t impede the economic recovery . . . don’t increase poverty and inequality (which are already larger in the United States than in most of the Western world), and don’t sacrifice health care quality or access or raise overall U.S. health care costs.”

That is a direct shot at House Republicans, who have set their sites on finding roughly $4 trillion in savings on top of the sequester, which is what the CBO says is needed to wipe out deficits entirely by 2023.

That is a whopping figure, and House Republicans have pledged to do it without raising taxes, cutting military spending or reducing current benefits for the elderly. That does not leave them much to cut. But if they can do it, it would bring the debt ratio down dramatically by 2023, to less than 60 percent of GDP, according to CBO estimates.

Administration officials say that the president is willing to consider more than $1.5 trillion in additional savings and that his most recent offer to House leaders, worth around $1.8 trillion, remains on the table. That proposal includes changes to Social Security and federal health programs that would produce even bigger savings after 2023.

However, Obama is insisting that any new package include new revenue. It does not have to be 50/50, Furman told reporters; he suggested a ratio of $900 billion in spending cuts to $600 billion in tax hikes.

But with Republicans opposed to more tax increases, the parties are facing the same old stalemate for the third year in a row."

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) left the Capitol after a midmorning meeting with his leadership team failed to reach consensus on an approach. He plans to assemble Republicans again at noon Saturday.

The Democrats who control the Senate easily beat back a GOP strategy led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that aimed to tie the government funding bill to a measure that would have blocked President Obama’s healthcare law. More than half of the Republican senators joined the Democrats in rejecting Cruz’s hard-line approach.

But Cruz and his conservative Republican allies in the House have refused to relinquish the fight. The senator met privately with tea party lawmakers in the House this week, complicating Boehner’s efforts to unite his restive majority around a strategy.

As the speaker and his leadership team tried to devise an endgame, federal agencies began notifying employees about whether they would be furloughed in the event of a shutdown, and prepared to shutter the popular Smithsonian museums, close national parks and halt many basic government services.

Obama, in a late-afternoon appearance in the White House briefing room, warned Republicans not to “threaten to burn the house down simply because you haven’t gotten 100% of your way.”

“My message to Congress is this: Do not shut down the government. Do not shut down the economy,” he said. “Pass a budget on time. Pay our bills on time. Refocus on the everyday concerns of the American people.”

The president cast the GOP effort as “political grandstanding” and said he would not buckle. “The House Republicans are so concerned with appeasing the tea party that they’ve threatened a government shutdown or worse unless I gut or repeal the Affordable Care Act,” Obama said. “That’s not going to happen.”

Tea party Republicans see the threat of a shutdown as their best chance to stop the Affordable Care Act before Tuesday, when the online marketplaces to buy health insurance under the new law are set to open. But the president said Friday that the marketplaces would open on time even if there is a shutdown. “That’s a done deal,” he said.

Many Republican strategists have warned that voters will blame their party for a shutdown, noting that happened the last time government offices were shuttered in 1995 and 1996. But many conservative lawmakers were not in Congress then and have rejected such warnings, saying polls show Americans do not support Obamacare.

Republicans, meanwhile, sought to blame Obama for the standoff.

“The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want the train wreck that is Obamacare,” said Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck. “Grandstanding from the president, who refuses to even be a part of the process, won’t bring Congress any closer to a resolution.”

The deep GOP divisions spilled into the open this week as Cruz rankled fellow Republicans with his attention-getting, 21-hour-plus Senate speech promoting what many colleagues view as a doomed strategy.

Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) met Thursday with some of the most conservative House Republicans for a dinner that lasted late into the evening. The senators encouraged their colleagues to stand firm against any funding bill that does not fully delay the healthcare law.

“I am hopeful; I am confident that the House will continue to stand its ground, continue to listen to the American people and step up to respond and to stop this train wreck — this nightmare that is Obamacare,” Cruz said after the Senate votes that sent the bill back to the House without the provision to cut money for the healthcare program.

At the same time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is influential among Republicans, urged Congress in a letter also signed by 235 other groups not to shut down the government or default on the debt. The debt limit must be raised by Oct. 17 for the nation to continue paying its bills and avoid a default.

The party’s former standard-bearer, presidential candidate Mitt Romney, also warned against the strategy. “The tactic of using a government shutdown to try and push that will be counterproductive politically,” he said in an interview on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper.” “I don’t think that will be as effective.”

House Republicans plan to discuss several proposals Saturday that would tie a new Obamacare rollback provision to the funding bill. That could prolong the standoff with the Senate and lead to a legislative pingpong that could take days to resolve, all but ensuring that the government would shut down.

The hard-right flank is pushing for a one-year delay of the healthcare law. The proposal, by Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), is supported by more than 60 other House Republicans, and if they hold firm, they could deny Boehner the majority he needs to pass a less restrictive measure.

Other Republicans have suggested delaying the mandate that individuals must carry health insurance by 2014 or face a fine.

Some have also suggested more modest measures, including one to repeal a tax on medical-device manufacturers and another to prevent members of Congress and staff from receiving federal funding toward their health insurance — a hit to lawmakers’ pocketbooks that members of Congress oppose.

Boehner may see no option but to try again to cut back Obamacare, but the strategy of tacking other healthcare provisions onto the funding bill appears doomed to fail. Democrats in the Senate are united in their pledge to protect the healthcare law. No Democratic senators voted Friday to end funding for the program.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has taken to calling House Republicans “anarchists,” dismissed the tea party flank as the “weird caucus.”

“Any bill that continues to play political games will force a government shutdown,” he said. “To be absolutely clear: We are going to accept nothing as it relates to Obamacare.”

Alternatively, Boehner could seek support from Democrats to approve a funding bill without any healthcare provisions, but he has been reluctant to do that for fear of upsetting his conservative majority.

That Cruz has continued to pursue his strategy despite its failure in the Senate pointed to the sway of tea-party-aligned organizations that have supported the renegade Republican over the elected party leadership.

“It says more about the Republican leadership than it says about Cruz,” said Chris Chocola, a former Indiana congressman who is president of the Club for Growth, a free-market group influential among Republicans. “They leave this huge void for someone to come up with an idea and provide leadership, and they don’t like it when someone does.”

Really?,"Former Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter: ""When my father left our family, I was 13 years old. My mother went on food stamps for a year, until she found work as a bookkeeper. Those food stamps were a lifeline for us. I do now know what we would have done otherwise.""

Sen. Patty Murray: ""When my father was diagnosed with MS and to stop working, it was food stamps that helped my family keep our heads above the water and put food on the table while my mom looked for work.""

Rep. Barbara Lee: ""When I was a young, single mother, I was on public assistance. It was a bridge over troubled water, and without it, I wouldn't be where I am today.""

Former Rep. Joe Baca: ""As a young Veteran, food stamps helped me feed my family.""

Politicians not the kind of dreamer you respect? Fear not! People go on from food stamps to all kinds of achievement.

Music: Moby says ""food stamps enabled my mom and I to eat without having to ask for hand-outs.""

Acting: Tobey Maguire recalled how ""Me and my Mom would go into a grocery store and get groceries and pay for them with food stamps, and I would run out of the store embarrassed.""

Sports: Baseball's father-son legacy of Cecil Fielder and Prince Fielder relied on food stamps early in Cecil's career. WNBA center Ruth Riley has been outspoken about how free school lunches ""gave me the energy I needed to learn in school and participate in sports.""

And of course, given the sheer number of people who've participated in nutrition programs over the years, there are millions of everyday successful adults—teachers, lawyers, writers, chefs, executives—who would say things similar to what politicians, actors, musicians and athletes say about how food stamps helped them get through tough times.

Of course, not everyone who needs food stamps at some point in their lives goes on to lavish success. But, as with so many other things about government assistance, that's more about poverty than it is about assistance. This is, after all, a nation where rich kids with low test scores are more likely to graduate from college than poor kids with high test scores and where, in big parts of the country, a kid raised in the bottom fifth of the income scale has less than a 10 percent chance of rising to the top fifth. And Paul Ryan's policies would make those outcomes worse, at the same time he's trying to rid himself of the stench of Mitt Romney by claiming to be some kind of anti-poverty crusader.

Anyway, Paul Ryan's own dreams apparently weren't killed by the Social Security survivor benefits he collected after his father died."

The bill, which was signed into law by President Obama on Wednesday, kept a number of tax breaks for education and low wage earners that many young adults rely on. However, the deal merely put off budget cuts that could hurt key programs like education grants and job training programs.

The so-called sequester, which includes across-the-board slashing of funds to domestic programs, is now slated to start in March.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a letter to Congress that it would cut programs like the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, which allows millions of students to apply for post-secondary student aid. Duncan said that under the sequester, the Education Department may also have to cut contracts with private-sector entities that service federal student loans. This could hurt borrowers once they're out of school.

Though the popular federal Pell Grants for education are safe from the sequester, they aren't protected come 2014 and beyond, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""This generation is facing rising college costs and high unemployment rates, so those are the kinds of investments we need to make sure we're preserving,"" said Jennifer Mishory, the 27-year-old deputy director of Young Invincibles, an organization that represents the interests of 18 to 34-year-olds.

Programs like Americorps, which provides skills training through community service projects, or Job Corps, which helps people find jobs though training programs, are also expected to take a hit.

Besides the specific budget cuts, young adults are also worried about the quick fixes that Washington has resorted to recently, rather than long-term agreements that would remove uncertainty.

""We're frustrated that this is only a short-term agreement that has set up more of these 'crisis countdown' scenarios in the coming months,"" said Matthew Segal, the 27-year-old founder of OurTime.org, a news website for young adults.

Related: Families keep tax breaks

While many young adults are concerned for what's next, they did not fare as badly as other demographics in terms of tax changes stemming from the fiscal cliff deal.

Congress saved the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which helps defray the cost of higher education, the Earned Income Tax Credit, a benefit for low-income individuals, and the Child Tax Credit, which helps low-income parents pay for education by allowing them to claim up to $1000 per child.

Most tax increases were limited to upper-income earners -- a group that excludes the vast majority young Americans. The median income for people aged 25 to 34 barely topped $30,000 in 2011, according to the U.S. Census.

""We are pleased that the president and both parties in Congress came together to prevent more severe tax increases that could have adversely impacted young Americans,"" said Aaron Smith, executive director of Young Invincibles."

The federal budget cuts hitting Garden City Regional Airport would save the government more than $300,000 but leave pilots to man landings, takeoffs and weather conditions mostly by themselves.

The federal budget cuts hitting Garden City Regional Airport would save the government more than $300,000 but leave pilots to man landings, takeoffs and weather conditions mostly by themselves.

The federal budget cuts were still an abstraction as American Eagle Flight 3429 crossed the snow-crusted plains into southwestern Kansas. Kevin Colvin, a construction manager flying in for work, looked out of the window at the tiny airport below.

“They make it sound like, ‘Oh my God! We’re going to die if we make these cuts!’ ” he said, eating a potato chip, the cuts still two days away. “I think it’s a bunch of BS.”

The cuts came into clearer focus Thursday. Garden City Regional Airport would lose its air traffic controllers, saving the federal government $318,756 and leaving pilots to handle landings, takeoffs and weather conditions mostly by themselves.

“Oh,” said Dave Unruh, a retired farmer who heard the news as he waited for a flight to Dallas. “Is that part of the deal?”

By Friday, people in this solidly conservative area faced the reality that it was.

“Great!” said Terryl Spiker, a rancher and banker catching the 2 p.m. American Eagle out for the weekend. He crossed his arms over his flannel shirt and smiled. “Just cut a little more.”

As sequestration dawned, reactions in Kansas’s 1st Congressional District ranged from disbelief to concern to a kind of defiant joy that the $85 billion in mandatory spending cuts had arrived at last. In the 2012 House elections, voters here overwhelmingly backed tea party conservative Tim Huelskamp, who recently hailed sequestration as “the first significant tea party victory” in Washington.

Not everyone here sees it that way. Mayor David Crase and airport director Rachelle Powell spent last week writing letters to Huelskamp and other elected officials urging them to save Garden City’s tower, one of 238 at relatively small airports across the country set to close beginning April 1. Crase said the closure would “undo years of investments” at the local, state and federal level. Powell warned of a decline in flights and associated revenue from fuel or fees or dinners at the popular restaurant Napoli’s at the Flight Deck. Though it was too soon to know, she worried that American Eagle might curtail the only regional jet service in and out of southwestern Kansas — a constellation of gridded towns that dissolve into farm fields and ranches and some of the largest meatpacking plants in the world.

Mostly, Powell was worried about what she described as “a severe negative impact” on airport safety. While the early and late American Eagle flights take off and land at a time when the tower is closed, Powell said, air traffic controllers guide the two afternoon flights, along with occasional military jet training runs, medical evacuation flights, casino charters and private jets that have delivered people such as Dick Cheney, Harrison Ford and Huelskamp himself to the high plains.

If the tower is eliminated completely, those responsibilities revert to pilots, who must communicate among themselves to coordinate landings, takeoffs and emergency responses.

Jeff De Busk, an air traffic control manager and father of six who expects to lose his job, recounted two recent near-collisions — both involving pilots on the wrong radio channel — averted by the tower. “I understand we have to cut the budget,” he said. “But this? It just doesn’t make any sense.”

It was around 1 p.m. Friday, and De Busk was sitting before work in the small, low-ceilinged waiting area of the red brick terminal, a space with light blue chairs and mauve couches and a glossy sign — “It’s worth the trip!” — welcoming visitors to the place people just call Garden.

At the moment, the terminal was quiet except for the hiss of the Bunn automatic coffee maker over by the two rental-car counters. You could hear 18-wheelers hum along the two-lane highway outside, and the rattle and snap of the American and Kansas state flags blowing in the wind.

Soon, the passengers began filing in for the afternoon American Eagle to Dallas, which has steadily picked up business since it started last year.

Here were Judy and Earl Kleeman, retirees headed to Florida for a cruise to the Turks and Caicos Islands. “I feel strongly about the need to cut the national debt,” Judy Kleeman said, wondering whether she was willing to fly without the tower. “But I do feel strongly about education, and so many people need help. I don’t know much about air traffic control. I wonder if there was anyone there when I flew in last time.”

Here was Inocencio Feria, who was seeing off a family friend and said he would just drive to Amarillo, Tex., if American curtailed its flights. “It’s just four or five hours,” he said.

John Bogner, a beer wholesaler, was heading to Las Vegas for a convention. He was a family friend of Huelskamp’s, voted for him, and agreed completely that it was time to cut the budget. He was not sure cutting an air traffic control tower was the safest option, he said, “but I guess they have to start somewhere.”

CNN was on the TV, and a reporter was talking about the partisan gridlock triggering the budget cuts. Saeed Abdalla watched and compared U.S. politics to those of his home country of Somalia, where for more than 20 years clan rivalries and power grabs, among other factors, prevented any central government from functioning. He rubbed his forehead.

“American politics is complicated,” he said.

Robert Rouse, an ammonia refrigeration technician in town for the well-regarded industrial boiler class at Garden City Community College, wheeled in his luggage.

“I hate to see somebody lose a job,” he said.

Terryl Spiker and his wife, Ruth, sat down next to him. Besides being generally glad that the cutting was beginning, Spiker said that he was disgusted by both sides in Washington and that any businessman knows how to cut 10 percent of a budget without much pain. Although closing the tower was unnecessary, he said, he was not worried about flying without one. “From this little airport?” he said. “No.”

“Is that legal?” asked his wife, and soon the loudspeaker announced that security was open, just through the double doors.

Thirty people filed through. They scanned their boots, their quilted duffles and their computer cases and walked out onto the runway under what appeared to be an empty blue sky.

De Busk was in the tower, his voice squawking through a speaker in Powell’s office. She looked out through her windows at the silvery jet on the runway. A small propeller plane had just landed, and the jet soon took off.

By the time it returned eight hours later, President Obama had signed the papers officially ordering sequestration to begin. In Garden City, it was dark, the little airport lit up by blue, red and white lights. Here came the plane, and here came the passengers, including Justin Swift, a hotel proprietor who was coming home after a trip to Los Angeles, where he said he had gone through three security checks. “It’s so unnecessary — just fluff,” he said.

He wanted the budget reduced, but shutting down Garden City’s air traffic control tower did not strike him as the best way to do that. “It’s a stupid cut,” Swift said. “But we’ve got to cut. We’ve got to cut more.”"

The Republican-controlled House on Tuesday passed a “fiscal cliff” deal that President Obama and the Senate had reached late Monday. The late-night vote completed a day in which the legislation had appeared to be on its political deathbed for several hours.

President Obama and the Senate reached a sweeping deal late Monday that the Republican-controlled House began considering on Tuesday, setting up a late-night vote to complete a day in which the legislation appeared to be on its political deathbed for several hours.

President Obama and the Senate reached a sweeping deal late Monday that the Republican-controlled House began considering on Tuesday, setting up a late-night vote to complete a day in which the legislation appeared to be on its political deathbed for several hours.

The bill was 153 pages long. It was written only the day before, by Washington insiders working in the dark of night. It was crammed with giveaways and legislative spare parts: tax breaks for wind farms and racetracks. A change to nuclear-weapons policy. Government payments for cheese.

And, most significantly, the bill will raise taxes but do relatively little to cut government spending or the massive federal deficit.

To a tea-party-influenced crop of House Republicans, the bill to resolve the “fiscal cliff” crisis was everything they had wanted to change about the way Washington worked. Too rushed. Too bloated. Too secretive. Too expensive.

“There’s lots and lots of pork in this bill,” said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), one of its most outspoken opponents.

On Tuesday, however, it passed on their watch. After the Senate approved the compromise, it briefly appeared that the GOP-led House would rebel against the bill. But the threat faded: For many Republicans, it appeared, the risk of rejecting the bill — and courting economic calamity — outweighed their unhappiness with the bill’s contents.

Tax breaks for rum producers and racetrack owners are some of the growth that lawmakers have added to the ”Fiscal cliff” deal. The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold talks about some of the lesser known measures in the new legislation and how the deal could be blocked or amended. (The Washington Post)

The fiscal-cliff bargain had been worked out on the phone by Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), two 70-year-olds with a combined 68 years in office in Washington. They stepped in after President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) tried, and failed , to reach a far-reaching agreement to tackle the debt.

Instead, McConnell and Biden lowered their ambitions and cut a “small deal.” It will raise marginal tax rates only for a sliver of high-earning individuals and avert a massive budget cut by pushing it back for two months.

But “small” was really not the the best description. The bill carries a substantial cost.

Although it will raise some taxes, it also will extend the vast majority of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts, as well as loopholes for many businesses. In all, the bill will cause deficits to rise by nearly $4 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But that estimated increase is based on the massive tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled to take effect without a resolution to the fiscal cliff.

House Republicans wanted the Bush tax cuts to be extended. But they had also wanted big spending cuts. To many conservatives among them, the bill looked like a massive failure of will.

“To pass something at 2 o’clock in the morning, when the senators didn’t even get a real good chance to look at it, we’re tired of that,” said Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.), elected in 2010 and defeated in November. He faced the prospect of casting his final vote in Congress on this package.

“I think it’s important to do it right. There’s a lot of us who feel that way. This is what we did with Obamacare — now look what we’re living with,” Walsh said, referring to the health-care law. “We don’t want to do that again.”

The bill that McConnell and Biden crafted was also not small in a physical sense. It ran to more than 24,000 words of small type. And many of those words had nothing to do with the marquee controversies of the fiscal cliff.

Instead, McConnell and Biden had included Capitol Hill’s version of stowaways: “riders,” unrelated provisions, attached to this bill because somebody in power wanted badly for them to pass.

“It’s a train, leaving the station, as they used to say,” said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. “Climb aboard and go for a ride.”

There were dozens of rider provisions that had nothing to do with the cliff. The renewable-energy industry got one worth $12 billion over 10 years. The owners of auto-racing tracks got one that will cost $78 million. A $1 million break will help coal-mining operations on Indian lands.

Another oddball provision dealt with excise taxes on imported rum, which the U.S. government mainly funnels to the territorial governments of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This deal said that arrangement will continue.

Nobody had said a word about excise taxes and rum on the floor of the House or the Senate in the two years since the provision was renewed the last time.

“I keep saying, let’s take the occasion to reform it,” said Pedro Pierluisi (D), Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative in Congress. Pierluisi believes that too much of this money gets funneled back to rum distillers instead of being used for economic development. “It didn’t happen this time around.”

The list went on. One provision renews an Agriculture Department price-support program through which the government buys cheese and butter from dairy farmers. That averted not a fiscal cliff but a dairy cliff: Milk prices were set to rise sharply.

The bill also blocks a 0.5 percent cost-of-living pay increase for members of Congress, reversing parts of an executive order Obama issued last week — because Congress had yet to set the federal government’s pay scale for 2013.

Another provision dealt with nuclear weapons. It will alter a law setting conditions under which the president could reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Before, this could happen only after the president certified that Russia was abiding by its treaty obligations.

The bill changed “that” to “whether.” It was unclear on Tuesday which lawmaker had demanded this. Or, for that matter, why.

To many new House Republicans, this bill looked like the kind of overstuffed, underscrutinized monster they had promised to stop. In their “Pledge to America,” made before the 2010 elections, the GOP had promised to post every bill online for three days before it got a vote.

On Tuesday, with only a few hours to look at the Senate bill, House legislators complained that they had not begun to understand what McConnell and Biden had concocted.

“It’s the only responsible way to proceed: to make sure we see and understand what’s in the bill and what we’re voting on,” said Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.). “I think most of the American people would expect that. It’s how business should be done here in Washington, instead of being forced into a vote and finding out what’s in it later on.”

But in the end, Barletta voted for the bill. He had heard that Senate leaders were saying they wouldn’t vote on an amended House bill. The Senate had left the House with little choice: Accept this path to avert the cliff, or there would be no other.

“I’m not willing at this point to risk tax hikes to all Americans not knowing what the Senate will do,” he said. “We will have that fight over spending. No question.”"

Frank Lucas, R-Okla., speaks at a news conference in the Capitol where he and others primarily expressed support for victims of the Oklahoma tornado. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

WASHINGTON -- Republicans in the House of Representatives removed food stamps from broader farm legislation in hopes that doing so would make it easier to pass a separate bill cutting nutrition assistance. But now there's a chance the House won't vote on a food stamp bill at all.

House Agriculture Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) told the Oklahoma Farm Report Wednesday that so far, House Republican leaders have been unable to muster the votes they need to pass a bill reforming the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

""Right now that equation is not there, and discussions are still going on,"" Lucas said. ""My friends on the left don’t want to have any reforms and my friends on the right want dramatically more reforms than probably are achievable in this environment.""

For decades, rural and urban lawmakers have joined forces to pass farm bills that include both agribusiness subsidies and nutrition assistance for poor people. That arrangement has broken down with the rise of tea party Republicans who are hostile to the food stamp status quo, as the Great Recession pushed the program's enrollment to 47 million people. Last month, a traditional farm bill collapsed on the House floor largely because Democrats willing to accept modest cuts withdrew their support in the wake of a Republican amendment seeking to make the cuts harsher.

This month, House Republicans passed a ""farm only"" farm bill without any Democratic support. Lucas started preliminary negotiations with Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) about how the fractured House bill might be combined with the traditional farm legislation that passed the Senate earlier this year.

Lucas said he doesn't want to wait for the House to pass SNAP legislation to begin the formal conference committee process with members of the Senate.

""My personal goal is by some point next week, if it’s quite clear that consensus cannot be achieved, if it’s just not achievable, then I think we need to recognize that fact and move on conferencing the bill that the Senate’s passed and the House has passed and see what evolves from that,"" Lucas told the Farm Report. ""But right now [we're] still trying to achieve consensus. That consensus is at the very least elusive. It might even be impossible. But I’m still trying.""

A House Republican leadership aide suggested that House Republicans wouldn't hurry to conference with the Senate.

“We are still moving forward with member discussions to develop SNAP reforms that have consensus and get these programs back on track so they can be there for the most vulnerable,"" the aide told HuffPost. ""Those discussions will likely continue into August and we will readdress it when we return back after recess.""

If House leaders appoint conferees without approving nutrition legislation first, those lawmakers would probably have less leverage to push for food stamp cuts in the conference committee. Both chambers would have to approve the committee's eventual compromise legislation.

The Senate bill cut nutrition assistance by $4 billion, or less than 1 percent of the program's $800 billion cost over 10 years. Before it was amended, the House bill would have cut SNAP by $20 billion. Without new legislation, the food stamp program would likely continue with no cuts at all -- an outcome Lucas has tried to warn his colleagues about."

Announcing the news Tuesday, ICE officials said that the immigrants were released under supervision and continue to face deportation. After reviewing hundreds of cases, those released were considered low-risk and “noncriminal,” officials said.

The releases took place over the last week and were an effort “to ensure detention levels stay within ICE’s current budget,” said ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christiansen, citing uncertainty caused by a budget standoff in Washington.

“All of these individuals remain in removal proceedings. Priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety,” she said.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

Much of the federal government is braced to feel the pinch from $85 billion in across-the-board budget cuts due to start Friday. Both Republicans and Democrats have said they oppose the cuts, but the two parties cannot agree on a budget deal that would avert them.

ICE’s decision was praised by some who have long criticized the rise in detentions and deportations under the Obama administration. Human rights and immigration advocates have accused the administration of ramping up arrests in response to political pressure.

“We have long advocated for expanded use of alternatives to detention, a step we knew would save taxpayers millions of dollars,” said Ruthie Epstein of Human Rights First. “It is a shame that it took the threat of serious budget cuts to prompt this move. Even so, ICE’s decision makes clear that the government can save money by reforming its approach to immigration detention.”

Officials say the released detainees are under other forms of supervision, including electronic and telephonic monitoring. Their cases continue to proceed in court.

Still, some Republicans blasted the announcement as part of the White House’s attempt to gin up public outcry about the looming spending cuts. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said the decision was a political ploy that put the public in danger.

“It’s abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,” the Virginia Republican said in a statement. “By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives.”

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano hinted at the coming news Monday, when she outlined the impact the budget cuts would have on her agencies. Napolitano said ICE would not be able to maintain its inventory of detention beds if the department is forced to cut roughly 5% of its budget this year.

“Look, we’re doing our very best to minimize the impacts of sequester. But there’s only so much I can do,” Napolitano said. “I’m supposed to have 34,000 detention beds for immigration. How do I pay for those? We want to maintain 22,000-some odd Border Patrol agents. I got to be able to pay their salaries.”

Maxine Waters Inflates Sequester to '170 Million' Jobs Lost,"Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) had a dire prediction for America about sequestration, claiming that 170 million jobs would be lost as a result of the across-the-board cuts. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only about 140 million jobs in the whole country.

During a press conference on February 28, Waters told reporters of a visit by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke who told members of congress that sequestration is not the optimal way to cut the federal budget.

Talking of Bernanke’s comments, Waters claimed that “if sequestration takes place, that’s going to be a great setback. We don’t need to be having something like sequestration that’s going to cause these jobs losses, over 170 million jobs that could be lost.”

However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Table A-9, Selected Employment Indicators, in January of 2013 there were 141,614 million jobs in the current American economy.

Using Waters’ math, the US would lose about 30 million more jobs than it had to start with."

But Flores, 34, ran into an obstacle when he tried to file a class-action lawsuit to get back his and other janitors’ wages. He had signed away his right to file a lawsuit against his employer.

After being hired, Flores had been presented with a pile of papers to sign. And he had unknowingly agreed not to take any legal problem with his bosses to the courts, but instead go to a private arbitrator handpicked by his employer.

“This is the equivalent to saying you have to give up your right to vote in an election,” said Ari Moss, Flores’ attorney. “It’s about punishing the poor and the weak, and saying you don’t have the right to come and seek redress.”

Emboldened by a series of Supreme Court decisions and an employers’ job market, many companies are starting to require workers to sign away their rights in return for a job. It is a trend that experts worry could further wear away employees’ power in the workplace. The contracts make it harder for employees to join class-action lawsuits, take their employers to court, or leave to go work somewhere else.

“You can see this common thread of making it more difficult to have your day in court,” said David Yamada, a professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. “The legal climate for employees is a tough one.”

Employers defend arbitration agreements as a low-cost way to resolve disputes while freeing up space in the overburdened court system. But some lawyers label arbitrators “corporate courts” because the arbitrator is hired by the employer, and because employers statistically win much more in arbitration than they do in courts.

“It unevens the playing field,” said Paul Bland, a senior attorney at Public Justice. “It used to be if you took away a right that you would have under normal law, the courts would throw it out.”

The use of these arbitration agreements has become more common since a 2011 Supreme Court decision, AT&T; Mobility vs. Concepcion, that made it easier to prevent workers from participating in class-action lawsuits, Bland said. That further complicates things for employees who have small claims that aren’t big enough for a lawyer to take on unless they turn into a class-action lawsuit.

Mazhar Saleem is bound to his employer by a number of contracts that made it hard to earn enough money to live, but also hard to go work anywhere else. He drives a town car for a company in New York as an independent contractor, rather than as a full-time employee. That means he doesn’t get benefits, never gets overtime, and isn’t guaranteed set hours.

But he also signed a non-compete contract when he started working, meaning he can’t drive a car for anyone else in New York. So even if his employer doesn’t give him any work, he’s not allowed to go find it elsewhere, says his attorney, Michael Scimone, with the law firm Outten and Golden.

“It ties into the larger theme of employers trying to use contracts to alter pieces of the employment relationship that are supposed to be governed by law,” Scimone said.

Non-compete clauses, once a staple of the high-tech world, are being extended to cover hairdressers, auto mechanics, exterminators and other professions that courts would traditionally not uphold them for, lawyers say. They essentially mean an employee can’t leave a job to take another one nearby, unless he or she wants to stop working for a year or so.

It’s a way to keep promising employees from leaving, said Matt Marx, an MIT professor who has studied these contracts.

“Given the increased job mobility of today’s world, companies are saying, ‘We can’t count on people to be here forever. We have to lock them up with contracts,” he said.

In a recent case in Worcester, Mass., three women working at a hair salon tried to leave after their conditions at work deteriorated. All three received cease and desist letters when they started working elsewhere, because they had signed non-compete clauses. They had to wait a year for the clauses to expire before they could work in the area again.

In other contracts being distributed at the workplace, employees agree to pay the costs of litigation if they lose, and employers shorten the amount of time in which employees can sue them. All of these contracts make it less likely for employees to win against their bosses in court -- if they are even allowed to take them to court.

That means lawyers will be more hesitant to take on workplace cases because it has gotten more difficult for them to win them, said Catherine Fisk, an employment law professor at UC Irvine’s law school.

“The less likely an employee is to file a claim, the less incentive a company has to extend money and other resources to prevent the illegal discrimination from happening,” she said.

Two recent Supreme Court decisions have made it harder for employees to win discrimination suits.

Many lawyers say they’re not surprised that courts have made life tougher for employees. Since the beginning of the Roberts court, experts say, the Supreme Court has issued decision after decision cutting back employees’ legal avenues to complain.

“Since the Warren court, employers have done well at the Supreme Court, but in the Roberts court, they have done exceptionally well,” said Cynthia Estlund, a professor at New York University’s School of Law. John G. Roberts Jr. became chief justice in 2005.

Law historians trace the court’s conservative leanings to the long stretches of Republicans in the White House in the 1980s and 2000s that allowed presidents to appoint more conservative judges to lower courts and to the Supreme Court.

A study published earlier this year in the Minnesota Law Review found that two of the court’s current justices are the most conservative out of any of the justices who served from 1946 to 2011, and that court under Roberts is friendlier to business than it was during either of the two previous chief justices.

Adding up seven years of decisions, the workplace is getting to be a tough place for many, said Cliff Palefsky, an employment lawyer at McGuinn, Hillsman & Palefsky in San Francisco.

Employers already can ask employees to work harder for less because the job market is still so sluggish in many fields. But in some cases, employees who think they can find a better situation elsewhere are going to have trouble doing so.

“The law is being undermined and it’s putting some workers in a bind,” Palefsky said. In some situations, when non-compete clauses are mixed with arbitration agreements, he said, “We’re one step away from indentured servitude.”

Before Heading East', 'He Was The Los Angeles Times Bureau Chief In Sacramento', 'Where He Spent A Decade Untangling California S Epic Budget Mess', 'Political Dysfunction.']",California discourages needy from signing up for food stamps,"WASHINGTON — It was not surprising that Texas held out.

For years, Texas was among a handful of states that required every resident seeking help with grocery bills to first be fingerprinted, an exercise typically associated with criminals.

Even though Republican Gov. Rick Perry ultimately got rid of the policy, Texas — always seeking to whittle down “big government” — remains one of the most effective states at keeping its poor out of the giant federal food stamp program.

But it is not No. 1. That distinction belongs to California.

Liberal California discourages eligible people from signing up for food stamps at rates conservative activists elsewhere envy. Only about half of the Californians who qualify for help get it.

That stands in contrast to other states, including some deeply Republican ones, that enroll 80% to 90% of those with incomes low enough to qualify.

That public policy paradox — one of the country’s most liberal states is the stingiest on one of the nation’s biggest benefit programs — has several causes, some intentional, some not. It also has two clear consequences: Millions of Californians don’t get help, and the state leaves hundreds of millions of dollars of federal money on the table.

The federal government pays for almost all of the food stamp program, which provides cash aid to about 46 million Americans at a cost of $74.6 billion this year. States administer the program.

In Washington, those costs have generated a furious debate that will heat up again next month when Congress returns from its summer recess.

While the federal government pays the bill, states get an economic boost from more people with money to spend on groceries.

Cash for food is so close to free money for states that several, such as Florida, with a Republican-controlled Legislature and a conservative GOP governor, pay contractors to scour the landscape for people to enroll in the program.

“It is impossible to get states to do conservative types of reform to this program,” said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has tried and failed to get GOP-controlled states to enact tougher enrollment standards.

“The things they could do, they don’t,” he said. “It would bring them political controversy and no financial gain for their state. It is like asking them to jump into a buzz saw and to bring their governor along.”

Not so in California, where onerous paperwork requirements, inhospitable county benefits offices and confusing online applications often prevail. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s latest study reflects the participation rate in 2010, agency enrollment figures released since then leave California stuck in last place.

In California, sometimes even those who qualify get rejected, as understaffed agencies prove unable to properly process applications.

Edlyn Countee had no idea she was eligible for food stamps until a friend who volunteered at a food bank brought it up. The 61-year-old from Oakland applied. She was rejected. “They said I made too much money,” she said. “I figured, ‘There goes that.’”

Advertisement

The friend insisted that there had been a mistake and that Countee should keep at it. The advice was solid, but it took an attorney from Bay Area Legal Aid calling social services officials, and Countee filling out an affidavit, before she got her $101 per month.

In Washington, the debate over food stamps has pitted Republicans, concerned about how much the program has grown, against Democrats who defend it. But that partisan divide does not truly reflect the reality of food stamp use back in lawmakers’ districts.

Much of the program’s growth involves the deep recession that started in 2008. But a big part stems from states that have actively tried to boost enrollment.

California has been slow to follow, as 36-year-old Sarah Palmer, a single mother from the East Bay city of Albany, discovered when the state threatened to cut her off unless she could produce receipts every few months detailing her child-care costs.

“Every three months I had to ask the day care to write a note detailing what I paid,” she said. Staff would keep forgetting. “Finally, one day I had to go in and tell them. ‘You know, we are receiving food stamps. I really need you to write this note for me.'…. It was humiliating.”

In most other states, Palmer would not have to produce such receipts; few require as much paperwork and none still require people to keep proving their eligibility as often.

“People are being denied benefits because of policies California chooses to employ,” said Jessica Bartholow, a legislative advocate at the nonprofit Western Center on Law and Poverty.

Some of those policies came into place under two Republican governors, Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who campaigned on promises to vigorously root out government waste.

Schwarzenegger vetoed several bills to end the state’s fingerprinting of food stamp recipients.

“Our first responsibility to taxpayers is to take necessary steps to prevent fraud and abuse,” he wrote in a 2005 veto message.

In 2011 the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California concluded after a study that the costly fingerprinting process did little to combat fraud but did discourage about 280,000 qualified people from signing up for CalFresh, as the food stamp program is known in California.

By then, even Texas had done away with fingerprinting. That October, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill ending California’s fingerprinting requirement.

Advertisement

Other hurdles, however, involve a problem that affects much of California’s government: the outmoded and inefficient data-intake systems the state uses to process applications. Different county agencies use different software programs, which are often incompatible with one another.

As other states have moved nimbly to overhaul their application processes, constantly simplifying them, California finds even a minor tweak can be a monumental undertaking.

The state’s complex history of dealing with immigrant families also has had a lingering effect. Only 20 years ago, California voters directed law enforcement to prosecute people suspected of being in the country illegally who applied for benefits.

The state’s requirements to produce bank statements, utility bills, day-care receipts and, until recently, fingerprints have left many immigrants, even those in the country legally, wary that an application will trigger a visit from immigration authorities, advocates say.

California is also one of 13 states that has a lifetime ban on food stamps for anyone convicted of drug dealing.

At a recent hearing in Sacramento, Wendy Still, chief adult probation officer for San Francisco, urged lawmakers to lift the ban, which affects about 20,000 felons. “If an individual does not have this basic need met, it can trigger an episode, an addiction, and then that triggers the cycle [of criminal behavior] over and over again,” she said.

Brown has taken several steps to loosen the state’s rules. In addition to ending the fingerprinting requirement, he also signed a measure that reduced the number of times each year applicants need to prove they qualify for assistance.

Yet nobody expects California to reach a participation rate of 92% anytime soon. That figure comes from conservative Tennessee, where Republicans control the governor’s office and both legislative chambers.

“We all know that we have one looming,” Boehner said on ABC’s “This Week”. “And we have one looming because we have entitlement programs that are not sustainable in their current form. They’re going to go bankrupt.”

Boehner expressed agreement with Obama’s statement in an ABC interview the other day that the debt doesn’t present “an immediate crisis.”

But Boehner took issue with Obama’s assertion that it doesn’t make sense to “chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance.”

The new spending plan from House Republicans would balance the budget in 10 years, a priority Boehner said this morning is important to the economy.

“Balancing the budget will, in fact, help our economy,” Boehner said. “It’ll help create jobs in our country, get our economy going again, and put more people back to work.”

“The fact that the government continues to spend more than a trillion dollars every year that it doesn’t have scares investors, scares businesspeople, makes them less willing to hire people,” he said.

In a wide-ranging interview, Boehner said the House would “review” any gun control measure that came out of the Senate. He restated his opposition to gay marriage, and said that, unlike his fellow Ohio Republican, Sen. Rob Portman, he can’t imagine a situation in which he would change his mind. Portman said this week that his views had evolved since he found out his son is gay.

Dwelling on budget issues, Boehner said he has a good relationship with Obama and trusts him, and that a lack of good relations is not the problem getting in the way of a sweeping deficit-reduction plan.

The challenge is in overcoming big differences, he said.

“When you get down to bottom line,” he said, “if the president believes that we have to have more taxes from the American people, we’re not going to get very far.”

“Washington has responsibility, to our seniors and our near seniors, that we firm up these programs so that they’re there for the long term,” Boehner said.

“Because if we don’t do it, not only will they not get benefits, we will have a debt crisis right around the corner. We have time to solve our problems. But we need to do it now.”

Yellen told friends in recent weeks that she did not expect to be nominated as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Although she had been the Fed’s vice chairman since 2010 and would make history as the first woman to hold the job, President Obama’s aides made clear throughout the summer that he wanted Lawrence H. Summers, his former chief economic adviser.

Now, awkwardly, it appears that the president may have to circle back to Ms. Yellen after Mr. Summers withdrew from consideration on Sunday, bowing to the determined opposition of at least five Senate Democrats. On Monday, Ms. Yellen became the front-runner by elimination, officials close to the White House said.

Supporters of Mr. Summers, including many of the president’s closest advisers, had raised some concerns about Ms. Yellen in recent months. Perhaps most potently, they said that institutions benefited from fresh leadership and argued that Ms. Yellen’s crucial role in creating the Fed’s current policies could inhibit her ability to make necessary changes.

Some presidential advisers also argued that Mr. Summers brought crisis management experience and a working knowledge of financial markets that Ms. Yellen lacks — although so did Ben S. Bernanke when President George W. Bush selected him as chairman."

In the approximately two minutes that Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke on All In with Chris Hayes, she articulated the Democratic message that every Democrat running for office must turn into muscle and reactive memory. Sen. Warren was on the show to talk about her new bill, the Equal Employment for All Act that would prevent employers from discriminating against Americans with poor credit ratings. She successfully made the case that employers checking credit ratings of potential employees disproportionately affect the poor and the middle class. It further damages potential employee credit as they are unemployed for a longer time or may have to settle for low wage jobs. Hayes could not have Sen. Warren on the show without pivoting to her populist propensity. He asked her if there is an Elizabeth Warren wing of the party that she leads. She humbly dismissed the personalization of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. “This isn’t about me,” she said. “This is about the issues about what’s happening to America’s families.” Sen. Warren went on to say that America’s hardworking families have been hammered on for a generation as a the result of supply side economics. She then enumerated the specific issues they are dealing with like declining wages, core expenses, housing, healthcare, daycare, and college, then tying it to how the middle class has coped so far. Everyone in the household has to work. When that is not enough, they get into debt. And for that debt, they are exploited by a predatory credit industry that make huge profits on their backs. She said no longer can a parent tell their kids they will be better off. Hayes detailed a sad truth. The middle class decline occurred under both Democratic and Republican rule. This can be attributed to a Democratic party that for all practical purposes has kept supply side economics in effect. Hayes asked if Democrats had done enough. Sen.

According to p.4 of this Congressional Research Service Report, where social security taxes once applied to 90% of income, growing wealth imbalance has resulted in only 83% of income being subject to social security taxes.

Our era is different from most of the past 4 generations in that those who have income above any reasonable definition of affluence continue to see themselves as solidly middle class. A successful framing device will drive what arguments must be weighed and compared, and will force internal contradictions into the open. What if we were to take the $113,700 and use it to draw a line in the sand. Above that limit of income you are no longer middle class. And if you argue that $250,000 ought to be the boundary for what is considered middle class, then why not increase the social security income cap to $250,000? And if that anchors the boundary back down at $113,700, then increased income tax rates on those wealthier than the middle class should be under consideration.

PS: I am aware of regional differences. I live in Southern California, and am fortunate enough so that I would personally pay more taxes if the cap on income for purposes of social security taxes were raised. But I still think that it is the right thing to do."

http://apps.chicagotribune.com/bond-debt/about.html,,['Chicago Tribune'],Chicago Bond Debt,"Published Nov. 1, 2013, 11:55 p.m.

Over the course of eight months, Tribune reporters examined thousands of pages of documents — including city spending records, bond offerings, accountants' reports, tax certificates, land records and City Council proceedings — to analyze how the city of Chicago issues general obligation bonds and spends those funds.

The team built comprehensive databases to follow the money over years of city spending. Reporters also studied bond regulations and tax codes and spoke with a variety of financial and legal experts to fully understand the process, tax rules and best practices.

To examine borrowing, the Tribune examined documents and data on 49 separate bond series issued 2000 to 2012. Each of the series has separate principal amounts, or maturities, that come due at varying dates. Each maturity has an interest rate, or coupon, attached to it. That's the annual amount bondholders will earn on the principal.

In total, the deals accounted for $9.4 billion in principal. However, because many of the bonds carried coupon rates that were higher than what the market was offering, the city received additional income from the bonds, known as premiums. Those amounts, along with interest earned on the money before it was spent, brought the total amount of bond proceeds up to $9.8 billion.

The Tribune used offering documents given to investors, known as official statements, as well as pledges known as tax certificates, to collect information on the maturities, interest rates, duration and other characteristics of the bonds. The tax certificates are available only for tax-exempt bonds. Reporters also relied on reports from independent accountants, known as verification reports, to collect this information. Verification reports are only available on bond deals that include the refinancing of old debt.

The various documents were cross-checked for accuracy. In the rare cases when the amounts from the three documents did not match, the differences were slight. In those cases, reporters relied first on the tax certificates, then the verification reports and lastly the official statements. For taxable bonds that did not include refinancing, the Tribune used the official statements to collect data.

Reporters also used those documents to figure out how money was allocated. For example, proceeds from a single bond may be used to fund building projects or refinance old debt. Bond money is also used to pay closing costs and, in many cases, pay the first few years of interest owed, known as capitalized interest. Reporters gathered all of this information from the documents and entered it into a spreadsheet for analysis.

In addition to information on the bonds, the Tribune collected data on spending. To do this, reporters scanned paper records from the city's annual supplement to the comprehensive annual financial report, or CAFR, and then used a computer program to create a database of the records. However, the city stopped reporting this information in 2011. So reporters submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to the city seeking computerized records of the spending. The city provided 13 years of spending data that were aggregated by project and budget year.

When bond proceeds come in, the city places them into separate funds. The funds are designated as either capital or equipment. Capital funds are intended to pay for expenses related to building projects. Equipment funds are reserved for shorter-term purchases, such as vehicles, software and radios. Each fund is connected to a bond series. The city was unable to provide a key to describe which fund matched up to which bond series. So the Tribune used records from the city's CAFRs as well as its capital improvement program to match bond funds to specific series.

Reporters then ran queries on the data, sorting and categorizing the information by the type of expenditure. For example, $1 billion in bond proceeds went to judgments or other legal expenses. Other categories include landscaping, new police stations, police station rehab, street resurfacing and sidewalk construction.

To determine whether expenditures were short or long term, the Tribune turned to the tax certificates. Those documents include detailed charts on the city's plans to spend bond money. Included in the charts are determinations of economic life. Economic life is an accounting term that captures the length of time the city expects something to last. Any item from capital funds that had a useful life that was 10 years or less was determined to be short-term. All of the items from the equipment fund data provided by the city were included on the short-term list.

The Tribune did not include some spending from the capital funds in its short-term calculations, even though many of those items had economic lives that were 10 years or less. The reason: It was unclear whether items had been part of larger construction projects that have longer lives.

To check whether the economic life of the item was shorter than the duration of the bond, reporters matched the short-term expenditures to the earliest maturities of the bonds that paid for them. For example, the city often bought software with an economic life of six years using a bond in which the earliest maturity was 15 years.

In its list of short-term expenditures, the Tribune also included closing costs on the bonds, capitalized interest, the paying off of short-term bank loans and refinancing deals known as refunding bonds.

To determine whether a refunding bond was short term in nature, the Tribune analyzed annual payments on the bonds, known as debt service. Using verification reports from independent accountants, reporters compiled payments by year for the old bonds and, after aggregating them, compared them to the new bonds used to refinance them. For both the old bonds and the new bonds the newspaper calculated the present value of future dollars. This is a standard finance calculation that discounts the value of future dollars, which are affected by inflation. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because its purchasing power decreases as inflation increases.

Any refunding deal that will end up costing taxpayers more in the long run was deemed a short-term expense."

Cuts would run through end of the fiscal year

Active military personnel and anti-poverty programs protected

Democratic and GOP alternatives failed to pass U.S. Senate

The White House made public an order at about 8:30 p.m. ET signed by President Obama making the budget cuts known as sequestration official and giving the federal government the authority to begin implementing $85 billion in across-the-board decreases.

The order released by the White House demands that ""budgetary resources in each non-exempt budget account be reduced by the amount calculated by the Office of Management and Budget.""

The cuts would run through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.

According to a letter dated today from Jeffrey Zients, deputy director for management of the Office of Management and Budget, to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, the sequestration calls for a 7.8% cut in non-exempt defense discretionary funds and 5% cut in non-exempt non-defense discretionary funding. It also calls for 2% cuts to Medicare, 5.1% to other non-exempt non-defense mandatory programs and 7.9% to non-exempt defense mandatory programs.

The federal government has said the cuts will soon translate into furlough notices to government workers, and that there will be cuts to government spending on defense contracts and domestic government programs. The plan protects active military personnel and anti-poverty programs.

The letter to Boehner, which introduced a detailed OMB report on the cuts, noted that federal lawmakers voted for sequestration ""as a mechanism to compel the Congress to act on deficit reduction."" The letter continued, ""As a result of Congress's failure to act, the law requires the President to issue a sequestration order today canceling $85 billion in budgetary resources across the Federal Government for FY 2013.""

An identical letter was sent to the president of the Senate, Vice President Biden.

The order comes after both Republican and Democratic alternatives to imposing across-the-board spending cuts failed to pass in the U.S. Senate.

The Democratic plan would have imposed a tax of 30% or more on millionaires, and cuts to defense and farm programs. The Republican plan would have forced responsibility on the president to determine how to implement the cuts as opposed to imposing an across-the-board decrease.

But right now, both are being promoted for their tax benefits.

Money put into these products grows on a tax-deferred basis just as it does in retirement accounts. In the case of annuities, the money is eventually taxed as ordinary income when it is taken out. With permanent life insurance, the death benefit goes to the beneficiaries free of income tax, but if it is a permanent policy, as opposed to a term policy, the owner of the policy could also borrow against its cash value and never pay income tax on it. (The insurance company charges interest on the borrowed money, though, and that loan reduces the value of the death benefit if it is not paid back.)

And while insurance companies are using the tax issue as a selling point, that is by no means the full picture. I have written recent columns on how this year’s tax increases have influenced behavior around estate planning and investments. As in those two cases, the decision to buy various life insurance policies or annuities can be unduly influenced by the tax advantages inherent in insurance. Many policies carry high upfront and management fees, have limited investment options and penalize people for withdrawing their money within a few years of buying the policy or annuity.

With these downsides, insurance companies are regularly looking for reasons to sell their products beyond the death benefits of insurance and the steady income stream of annuities."

Citizen applications to carry a concealed weapon, meanwhile, rose 49 percent last year, according to county records.

At grocery stores in Grants Pass, stopping and citing shoplifters — sometimes with whole carts of beer or food in tow — have become part of the daily law enforcement routine.

“I hold my breath, every day, for everything,” said Sheriff Gil Gilbertson in an interview in his office, where images of John Wayne lined the walls.

The causes of Josephine County’s plight are convoluted and complex, and echoed in varying degrees across a swath of Oregon timber country that was scarred a century ago by a weird historical wrinkle: the collapse of the Oregon and California, or O&C, Railroad. Around World War I, the railroad’s lands were taken over by the federal government, leaving almost two-thirds of Josephine County, which is about the size of Rhode Island, in federal ownership. And since the federal government pays no property taxes, Congress established a system channeling revenues from the sale of timber, which the county has in abundance.

But as federal timber harvests have been reduced, the lush payments that kept property taxes low have fallen to a trickle. And a federal stopgap payment measure to make up for the timber money was phased out last year. County residents, meanwhile, have voted multiple times, most recently in May, against raising their property taxes to resolve the shortfall."

Cynthia Lummis wants

people to lobby Congress to stop

the sequester

Just ask Wyoming’s lone House member, Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R), who applauded the $85 billion carved across the board in a letter to constituents. “Instead of blindly filling empty desks,” she wrote last week, “federal agencies will be forced to consider which positions are crucial and make their decision based on necessity rather than luxury.”

Conservatives love cheering government spending cuts......until they hit home, like they did last week at Yellowstone National Park in Lummis's home state of Wyoming, where park superintendent Dan Wenk froze his workforce and delayed the start of seasonal hiring and plowing after being ordered to cut $1.8 million from his budget due to sequestration. The cuts will hurt Yellowstone tourism, delivering a blow to the region's economy, but thanks to cheerleaders of sequestration like Lummis, Wenk's hands were tied.

When Lummis was confronted with angry constituents, the obvious thing to do would have been to support repealing or replacing the sequester. Instead, she invented a fantasy in which Wenk was the villain, because instead of cutting his operating budget he should have lobbied Congress for permission to cut his capital budget. But not only was her ""solution"" not actually a solution, it would have actually increased spending over the long-run.



In an interview, Lummis suggested that Wenk petition House and Senate appropriators for permission to take money from his capital budget to cover the cuts, an idea he said was not legal and would never get through Congress in time.

Beyond the absurdity of a member of Congress urging one of her constituents to solve his problem by lobbying Congress, it would be astonishingly stupid to shift money from capital projects to current operations when interest rates are as low as they are. If you neglect long-term capital projects, sooner or later the bill will come due, and the longer you wait, the bigger the bill will be—and interest rates are bound to be higher when they do. Unless you're planning to let your most core assets rot, in the long-run it's cheaper to act earlier with low interest rates, and you get the side benefit of whatever capital improvements you've made.

Basically, what Lummis says Wenk should have asked for is like that old saying about shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic, except instead of telling him to shuffle the deck chairs, she's saying he should have asked the crew for permission to shuffle the deck chairs—never mind the fact that she's a member of the crew. If this is the kind of genius Wyoming sends to Congress, they get what they deserve. It's just a shame that those of us who didn't vote for Lummis have to suffer the consequences as well.

Meanwhile, Republicans are still whining about losing their White House tour perk even as real people are getting hurt. Please tell them to stop bellyaching and do something about the sequester."

Who knew that so many random activities of daily life could be imperiled by a shutdown of the federal government?

Americans are finding that ""the government"" entails a lot more than the stereotype of faceless D.C. bureaucrats cranking out red tape.

And so it is that two dozen October weddings, including nine this week, are in jeopardy because they're scheduled for monument sites on the National Mall. Ditto for a New Jersey couple planning to marry at the Grand Canyon.

Mike Cassesso and MaiLien Le's permit to get married Saturday on the lawn near the Jefferson Memorial looks to be among the casualties, giving rise to a new Twitter hashtag for their #shutdownwedding. They're looking at alternate sites, including the restaurant booked for their reception.

Also canceled: a weekend Ku Klux Klan rally at Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania.

Want to take a drive along Virginia's popular Skyline Drive to take in the fall colors in Shenandoah National Park? Not till the government reopens.

It's not just romance, tourism and public events that are in jeopardy.

Consider the Wisconsin farmer who can't cash a check for a cow he sold.

Ben Brancel, the state's agriculture secretary, said that because the farmer has a loan from the Farm Service Agency, he can't cash the check without both his own signature and one from an FSA official, unavailable during the shutdown.

""Our advice to him was he was going to have to wait, that there wasn't anything he could do about it,"" Brancel said.

Ready to buy your first house?

Borrowers applying for a mortgage can expect delays, especially if the shutdown is prolonged. That's because many lenders need government confirmation of applicants' income tax returns and Social Security data. Mortgage industry officials say they expect bottlenecks on closing loans if the shutdown stretches on for more than a few days.

Story continues

In addition, low- to moderate-income borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-insured mortgages for single-family homes from the Federal Housing Administration can expect longer waits because of sharp reductions in FHA staffing.

Even workers who get their paychecks from a state government aren't safe from the ripple effects of a federal shutdown.

An assortment of state workers around the country are on furlough because the money for their jobs includes dollars from Washington. Among those are hundreds of workers at Arkansas' Military Department and one at the Crowley's Ridge Technical Institute, a vocational school in Forrest City, Ark.

In Illinois, the furloughs include 20 workers in the state Department of Employment Security and 53 in the Department of Military Affairs.

""These are the first, and there may be more,"" said Abdon Pallasch, the state's assistant budget director.

Want to escape the shutdown worries with a bike ride on the C&O Canal, a popular 184-mile trail and national park between Washington and Cumberland, Md.?

Closed. Those thinking of ignoring the closure notice and going anyway should consider this: Restrooms will be locked and handles removed from water pumps along the way.

One possible silver lining to shutdown annoyances writ small and large: The whole thing could serve as a teachable moment for all those people who tell pollsters that they want budget cuts — as long as they aren't directly affected.

""As time goes by, more and more people see these little things that they took for granted,"" said Ed Lorenzen, a policy adviser at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group pushing for spending discipline.

He said the shutdown could serve as a reminder that ""you're not going to be able to the balance the budget just by cutting spending in Washington that doesn't affect people.""

That question is at the heart of the warring Republican and Democratic budget plans coming out this week — with Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin vowing to eliminate the federal deficit within 10 years, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington State setting a more modest goal of bringing spending closer in line with revenue over time.

While economists generally agree that narrowing the government’s deficit and limiting the size of the debt are necessary in the long run, most argue that balancing the budget would not restore the nation’s still-weak economy to health in the near term. Indeed, rushing to do so with unemployment still elevated and the economy growing at only a sluggish pace could even set back the effort to reduce the deficit.

“There’s nothing magic about exact balance,” said Alice M. Rivlin, a Democratic economist at the Brookings Institution who has worked with Republicans like former Senator Pete V. Domenici on bipartisan deficit-reduction proposals. “The really important thing is to keep the debt from growing faster than the economy.”

The question of whether to balance the budget and when is a new staging ground in the long-running fiscal fight between Republicans and the White House. Mr. Ryan, whose previous budget proposals did not bring spending below revenue for decades, vowed this time to do so by 2023, in part to satisfy the demands of the more conservative members of the Republican Caucus."

WASHINGTON -- Despite the tough rhetoric from President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) about respective refusals to negotiate, there is talk that a way out of the government shutdown and debt ceiling deadline could include a bargain of sorts -- even if it isn't exactly grand.

One Republican lawmaker walked a group of reporters through how this might happen on Thursday afternoon, and said that he thinks a deal will be reached by the Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling.

""I think we'll avoid default. I think we'll stumble toward a larger deal that will continue to narrow the deficit,"" said the lawmaker. ""I don't think it will be as grand as the grand bargain.""

In short, the GOP member, who spoke on the condition he not be quoted by name in order to speak more frankly, said during an hour talk that members of his party might be willing to vote to end some or all of the sequester, in exchange for changes to Social Security and Medicare.

The sequester was the result of the last budget showdown, and it cut discretionary spending across the board. Because neither party is happy with the sequester cuts, they could become another key bargaining chip in a deal to pass a funding bill and end the government shutdown. Republicans could possibly seek the changes to entitlement spending, and in turn vote to restore funding in other areas -- all within negotiations over a deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.

""Sequester is a very blunt instrument,"" the GOP member said. ""It's a pretty common view among Republicans that we've done way too much. So some of the spending can be restored. ... Then the president's going to get some of what he wants, for domestic initiatives, Head Start and whatever.""

The lawmaker said non-discretionary spending, or mandatory spending that's locked in each year and not appropriated by Congress, could ""hold the savings of the sequester,"" while Republicans could ""let the belt out a couple notches on the discretionary side of the budget.""

The changes the GOP is aiming for, he said, would include ""at least chained CPI and at least means testing."" In other words, a different measure of inflation would be used to calculate Social Security benefits, leading to lower increases over time, and lower-income Americans would receive more generous Social Security and Medicare benefits than those in high-income brackets.

One Democratic congressional source noted that Obama has signaled in the past -- including in his budget this year -- that he is willing to support using chained CPI. And a Republican leadership aide said this week that Republican hopes for a deal are based in part on their understanding that Obama wants very badly to get rid of the sequester cuts.

The Democratic source laid out a way a deal could proceed so that the president could claim to have won a ""clean"" government funding bill and a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase, but changes to the sequester and entitlements would be tied to these actions.

""The political appeal of this kind of approach ... is that it offers each party a way out of the corner it’s in,"" wrote conservative policy expert Yuval Levin, editor of National Affairs and an informal adviser to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), in National Review Online. Levin laid out in detail how a deal such as the one described by the Republican lawmaker to reporters would work.

The Republican member said that if a such a deal is reached, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) can move forward even if his right flank in the House, and tea party lawmakers in the Senate like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), oppose it.

""If it's a real bargain and the president and the speaker come to the deal, that way you make the left wing and the right wing irrelevant, because deals have votes from both sides,"" he said.

""The irony of this is that the guys who got us into this mess won't be there to cut the deal that gets us out. And they will attack the people that actually come to the deal, and profit by it politically,"" he said. ""This is more about political position for a few members. For most of them I don't question their motives.""

As for Cruz, the GOP lawmaker said: ""I tell you one thing: He's never played team sports in his life.""

(CNN) - President Barack Obama continued to promote his signature health care reform on Saturday and argued Republicans are trying to ""confuse people"" about the law.

His comments come as some GOP members in Congress have called for an effort to defund Obamacare in an upcoming budget deadline.



""A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail, they'll somehow be sticking it to me. But they'd just be sticking it to you,"" the president said in his weekly address.

Read a transcript of his remarks below.

Hi, everybody. Over the past few weeks, I've been visiting with Americans across the country to talk about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class.

We need to rebuild an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility; an economy built firmly on the cornerstones of middle-class life. Good jobs. A good education. A home of your own. A secure retirement. And quality, affordable health care that's there when you need it.

Right now, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. And in the next few months, we'll reach a couple milestones with real meaning for millions of Americans.

If you're one of the 85% of Americans who already have insurance, you've already got new benefits and protections under this law that you didn't before. Free checkups, mammograms, and contraceptive care. Discounted prescription medicine on Medicare. The fact you can stay on your parents' plan until you turn 26. And much, much more. And it's okay if you're not a fan of the Affordable Care Act – you can take advantage of these things anyway.

If you don't have insurance, beginning on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business. You can comparison shop in an online marketplace, just like you would for cell phone plans or plane tickets. You may be eligible for new tax credits to help you afford the plan that's right for you. And if you're in the up to half of all Americans who've been sick or have a preexisting condition, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies have to cover you – and they can't use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else.

You can find out more about the law, and how to sign up to buy your own coverage right now at HealthCare.gov. Tell your friends and neighbors without insurance about it, too. And tell your kids that there's a new, easy way to buy affordable plans specifically tailored to young people.

Many Members of Congress, in both parties, are working hard to inform their constituents about these benefits, protections, and affordable plans. But there's also a group of Republicans in Congress working hard to confuse people, and making empty promises that they'll either shut down the health care law, or, if they don't get their way, they'll shut down the government.

Think about that. They're actually having a debate between hurting Americans who will no longer be denied affordable care just because they've been sick – and harming the economy and millions of Americans in the process. And many Republicans are more concerned with how badly this debate will hurt them politically than they are with how badly it'll hurt the country.

A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail, they'll somehow be sticking it to me. But they'd just be sticking it to you.

Some even say that if you call their office with questions about the law, they'll refuse to help. Call me old-fashioned – but that's lousy constituent service. And it's not what you deserve.

Your health insurance isn't something to play politics with. Our economy isn't something to play politics with. This isn't a game. This is about the economic security of millions of families.

See, in the states where governors and legislatures and insurers are working together to implement this law properly – states like California, New York, Colorado and Maryland – competition and consumer choice are actually making insurance affordable.

So I'm going to keep doing everything in my power to make sure this law works as it's supposed to. Because in the United States of America, health insurance isn't a privilege – it is your right. And we're going to keep it that way.

Thanks. And have a great weekend."

With the Treasury Department warning that it could run out of money to pay national obligations within a day, the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday evening, 81 to 18, to approve a proposal hammered out by the chamber’s Republican and Democratic leaders after the House on Tuesday was unable to move forward with any resolution. The House followed suit a few hours later, voting 285 to 144 to approve the Senate plan, which would fund the government through Jan. 15 and raise the debt limit through Feb. 7.

Mr. Obama signed the bill about 12:30 a.m. Thursday.

Most House Republicans opposed the bill, but 87 voted to support it. The breakdown showed that Republican leaders were willing to violate their informal rule against advancing bills that do not have majority Republican support in order to end the shutdown.

By a vote of 53 to 38, the Senate failed to break a filibuster of Robert L. Wilkins, a federal judge who was nominated to fill one of three vacancies on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, falling seven votes short of the 60 needed. Two Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — voted with the Democrats.

The impasse over Mr. Wilkins followed Republican blockades of two other candidates for the court since Oct. 31. Unlike previous fights over judicial nominees, the dispute is not as much about the judges’ individual political leanings as it is about the overall ideological makeup of the court. Republicans have raised few objections to the three candidates’ qualifications or legal positions.

Rather, Republicans are seeking to prevent Mr. Obama from filling any of the three existing vacancies on the 11-seat court, fearing that he will alter its conservative tilt. The court has immense political importance because it often rules on questions involving White House and federal agency policy."

At Josh Marshall's online news operation, he has been soliciting people for PPACA (Obamacare) stories, and someone just sent in something that implies that the way that this is set up is nothing short of genius, both in terms of policy, and politics.

Basically it goes as follows:



Because of state regulatory issues, insurance companies have an incentive to overprice their policies, because they are serving a new (broader) market, and because the state rate setting bureaucracy is slow and cumbersome.

If this is true, then the 80% medical loss ratio requirements will mean that they have to issue refunds to people at the end of the year.

So, this means that it is pretty likely that a lot of people will be getting refunds in early 2015.

Looking at this through my political lens, it looks pretty good.

News about lots of people being eligible for refunds should start percolating up sometime toward the end of the 3rd quarter of 2014.

That is September and October of 2014.

Just before congressional elections."

Labor Secretary Hilda Solis is leaving ahead of Obama's second term

Labor Secretary Hilda Solis will not be returning for a second term, President Obama said Wednesday.

""Over the last four years, Secretary Solis has been a critical member of my economic team as we have worked to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and strengthen the economy for the middle class,"" Obama said.

Meanwhile, White House officials said three other Cabinet members will remain after the president's next term starts Jan. 20: Attorney General Eric Holder, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.

In disclosing her resignation to Labor Department employees, Solis trumpeted their work on job training and community college programs. She also cited programs devoted to veterans employment, worker safety, and reclaiming lost wages.

""Because President Obama took very bold action, millions of Americans are back to work,"" said Solis, a former member of Congress from California. ""There is still much to do, but we are well on the road to recovery, and middle class Americans know the president is on their side.""

Obama did not announce a replacement.

Solis is the fifth Cabinet-level to announce his or her resignation prior to the start of Obama's second term on Jan. 20.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and Environmental Protection Agency administration Lisa Jackson have also announced their departures.

The president has nominated Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to replace Clinton at State and former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., to replace Panetta at the Pentagon. He is expected to tap White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew to succeed Geithner at Treasury, and has not nominated a new EPA administrator.

Other Cabinet members are expected to stay for a second term:"

Fifty-four percent think it's bad that Republicans control the House, the poll found. That's up from 43 percent in December 2012, during the last fiscal standoff. The figure is the first time a majority thought Republican control was bad for the country since CNN started asking in December 2010. Sixty-three percent of respondents want Boehner replaced, but by another Republican, which would not change GOP control of the House.

Congress as a whole has a measly 12 percent approval rating, while 86 percent disapprove, according to the CNN/ORC International poll. President Barack Obama received a 44 percent approval rating, while 52 percent said they disapprove -- a number virtually unchanged since June.

But if they don't, then what happens?

In one of the first orders of business, a dividing line will be drawn between the federal services and workers deemed essential and non-essential.

Or, in the more delicate language of those drawing up contingency plans, ""excepted"" and ""non-excepted.""

Those in the first category will carry on operations during the shutdown. The others will power down until Congress comes to its senses and funds the government.

Workers who stay on the job during the shutdown will be paid, but they may not get their check until after it is over. Those who are furloughed are furloughed without pay but Congress may decide after the shutdown to pay them for the time off anyway.

(Related: Are Social Security payments safe?)

Essential activities are defined as anything that protects life and property.

Also in this category is the actual act of shutting down an agency for the shutdown. After all, someone's gotta hit the light switch on the way out.

And it pertains to the issuance of benefits like Social Security, funding for which is not dependent on lawmakers' annual appropriations.

In all likelihood, the decisions agencies make about how to handle a shutdown will have to pass muster with the general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, as was the case during the shutdowns in the mid-1990s.

""This was entirely handled by OMB and it was all a legal determination,"" said Charles Konigsberg, who was assistant director of OMB at that time.

In past shutdowns, essential meant many things, including: air traffic control and other transportation safety, national security, the handling of hazardous waste, food inspections, border protection, maintenance of the power grid and disaster assistance.

It meant the continued payment of entitlement benefits.

And it meant collecting taxes, issuing U.S. bonds plus anything else required for the preservation of the country's banking and monetary system.

(Related: Shutdown's impact on Main Street)

What exactly will happen this time if there's a shutdown?

Federal agencies have not publicly revealed their plans yet.

But if the plans they submitted in 2011 are any guide, fewer than 40% of federal employees would be furloughed. That still represents hundreds of thousands of people, however.

The percentage for a given agency may be far higher or far lower. It all depends on how many of its activities meet the legal definition of what's excepted.

The Department of Interior said in 2011 it would furlough about 76% of its employees. The department, which oversees national parks and the U.S. geological survey, said it would keep on 9,100 people to complete shutdown activities, provide for law enforcement and safety, among other things.

Another 8,000 employees would have been kept on because they were in positions that derive funding from something other than current-year appropriations.

The Department of Defense, by contrast, indicated all military personnel on active duty would be required to report to work. Most civilian personnel, however, would have been furloughed. And the only new contracts the department would issue would be for those performing excepted duties.

Meanwhile, some positions in the federal government are automatically exempt from furloughs, like the president of the United States and members of Congress."

The two proposals, which would set spending targets for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, will be miles apart ideologically and difficult to merge. Democrats plan to rely heavily on closing tax loopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthy to produce new revenue, while Republicans will focus on slashing spending to balance the budget in 10 years.

But the fact that both houses of Congress are working on their budgets simultaneously after years of impasse raised some measure of hope — albeit slight — that Democrats and Republicans might be able to work out some sort of compromise."

President Obama wants to tie spending cuts to tax revenue hikes in the debt ceiling talks, but that could mean trouble for the middle class taxpayers he has pledged to protect.

""They'll have to go down to where the real money is, which is the middle class,"" said Brian Gardner, Washington policy analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank. ""Politically, that would be very tough.""

The White House and Congress just finished a bruising fiscal cliff battle that raises taxes on the rich by $618 billion over a decade. Next up is the debt ceiling debate and dealing with the sequester -- automatic spending cuts set to kick in by early March.

Republicans want any debt limit increases to be coupled with spending cuts. In return, Democrats are demanding more revenue, mentioning closing loopholes and corporate subsidies like the $38 billion given to the oil industry over 10 years.

But to bring in significant tax revenues, lawmakers would have to tap into some politically sensitive tax deductions, said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition.

""The problem with exempting the middle class from any pain is that it's hard to make the numbers work,"" Bixby said. ""Corporate tax loopholes are not as large as the ones for individuals.""

How to raise a trillion dollars

Tax exclusions and deductions total roughly $1.1 trillion a year, but less than 10% benefit corporations, according to the Tax Policy Center. That means most cuts to those benefits would hit individuals.

So who would pay? Further restricting itemized deductions and exclusions for the rich could be one way to bring in several hundred billion dollars over a decade, but there may not be enough there to raise enough revenue to balance out the spending cuts.

Eliminating several other major tax breaks could also bring in billions a year in savings for the government, but would amount to tax increases on the middle class people that benefit from them.

For example, the largest exclusion is the one for employer health insurance, which totals $164 billion for fiscal 2014, according to the Congressional Research Service. This one spares the 60% of Americans who have employer-sponsored coverage from paying taxes on the share of health insurance premiums paid for by their companies. Without the tax break, companies might offer less generous plans.

Related: Your taxes under the fiscal cliff deal

Another tax break that helps the middle class save for retirement is the one for employer-provided pensions, which allow companies to offer tax-deferred pensions and 401(k)s. But at a cost of nearly $163 billion in revenue, this one could also be a major target for savings.

And one of the most cherished middle-class tax breaks -- the mortgage interest deduction -- costs nearly $100 billion a year. Nearly 40% of filers claiming this deduction make between $50,000 and $100,000 a year.

But major reform of any kind still faces many obstacles. The Democrats won't have a lot of leverage to negotiate any tax increases going forward, experts said. The Republicans were more willing to bend during the fiscal cliff negotiations because they were facing a massive tax hike on everyone had the Bush tax cuts expired. Now, there's no such threat.

""The incentive to support major tax reform is gone,"" said George Yin, a law professor at the University of Virginia and former chief of staff at Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation."

(CNN) – Food safety inspections, early education classrooms and mental health treatment are all at risk if massive forced spending cuts are allowed to take effect at the end of this week, the White House said Sunday.

Those cuts would accompany deep reductions in defense spending - including stalling maintenance on Navy ships - that are also poised to trigger March 1.



In detailed reports for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, President Barack Obama's budget office spelled out how the cuts - which are the result of a stalemate between Congressional Republicans and the White House over reducing the federal deficit - will affect localities, putting the stakes of the budget debate in stark terms as Congress returns to Washington after a week-long break.

But some Republicans question whether the Obama administration is simply crafting a doomsday scenario for the indiscriminate cuts to force Congressional Republicans into accepting a deal that includes more tax increases for wealthy Americans, which GOP leaders say is unacceptable. They would rather cut spending on entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security, which they say are the real drivers of the country's debt.

Nationwide, the White House said, 70,000 children would no longer have access to Head Start early education programs, and 10,000 teacher jobs would be at risk, consequences that Education Secretary Arne Duncan detailed Sunday.

""It creates tremendous instability,"" Duncan said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""And there are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips, who are getting notices that they can't come back this fall.""

Reduced federal funding for vaccines would mean children would go without shots that prevent measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough, influenza and hepatitis B. The report indicated 2,100 fewer food inspections would occur, and medical research would be stalled.



READ MORE: 'These cuts do not have to happen,' Obama says



Hundreds of thousands of ""seriously mentally ill adults and seriously emotionally disturbed children"" could go without treatment for their ailments, according to the White House, which could lead to higher rates of hospitalization and incarceration.

And the Federal Aviation Administration would be forced to cut $600 million from its budget, which the agency's boss said Sunday would result in furloughs - or forced leave - for nearly all of the FAA's 47,000 employees.

""We're going to try and cut as much as we possibly can out of contracts and other things that we do,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said. ""But in the end, there has to be some kind of furlough of air traffic controllers, and that will also begin to curtail or eliminate the opportunity for them to guide planes in and out of airports.""

All told, non-defense programs would be forced to reduce their spending by 9%, the White House said, while defense programs would have to cut 13%.

Cuts to the military would include calling off maintenance on 11 ships in Norfolk, Virginia, home of the world's largest naval base. Air Force operations in the Commonwealth could be cut by $8 million. In San Diego, maintenance on five ships would be canceled. In Jacksonville, Florida, funding to maintain an aircraft depot would disappear.

The state-by-state analysis by the White House is a continuation of the administration's attempt to demonstrate in stark terms how the forced spending cuts would affect Americans - and to pin the blame on the GOP. That effort has been met with some skepticism from Republicans.

""Rather than issuing last-minute press releases on cuts to first responders or troop training or airport security, [Obama] should propose smarter ways to cut Washington spending. After all, Washington spending, even with the sequester, is bigger than it was when he got here,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in response to the White House's detailing of the cuts.

“There are smarter ways to reduce the size of government. And with the national debt well over $16 trillion dollars, it’s time for the White House to stop spending all its time campaigning, and start finding smarter ways to reduce the deficit,"" McConnell continued.

Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said ""The White House needs to spend less time explaining to the press how bad the sequester will be and more time actually working to stop it.""

Some Republicans argue the White House is exaggerating how much Americans would feel the effects of the cuts.

""The American people, we see all these claims about what a tragedy it's going to be,"" Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said on ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointing to statements from LaHood and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.

""They have plenty of flexibility in terms of discretion on how they spend money,"" Coburn said. ""There are easy ways to cut this money that the American people will never feel. What you hear is an outrage because nobody wants to cut spending.""

Another Republican, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, called the dire warnings from Obama administration officials merely ""great political theater about how cutting less than 3% of the federal budget can cause all these awful consequences.""

""Here is (Obama's) chance to say, 'Here is how we can do it better.' The reality is, the federal budget, even after the cuts, will be larger than last year's budget,"" Jindal said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to the president, denied that the White House was overstating the effects of the cuts, saying that it's Obama's ""responsibility to make sure the American people understand what's at stake here in this debate.""

""This is going to have a very real impact on people's lives and on communities, and people need to know why that is,"" Pfeiffer said. ""Are all these things going to go into effect on the first day? No. But there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who are working today who will lose their jobs as a consequence of this Republican decision."""

Agency says that legalization would boost the retirement program%27s trust fund

Critics say the legalization will cost more than it generates

One study predicts the bill would cost %246.3 trillion over the next 50 years

The Social Security Administration estimated Wednesday that a Senate bill to overhaul immigration laws and legalize 11 million unauthorized immigrants would boost the retirement program's trust fund and help the economy.

In a letter to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the members of the Senate ""Gang of Eight"" that is pushing for the overhaul, Social Security Chief Actuary Stephen Goss estimated the bill would add 3.2 million jobs, increase the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by 1.63% and bolster the Social Security trust fund over the next 10 years.

Goss stated that many are working in an ""underground economy"" and don't pay taxes, so adding them to the tax rolls will bolster the nation's coffers. And if the security provisions of the bill reduce illegal immigration in the future by half a million people per year, Goss predicted a net positive for the country's retirement program.

""We estimate a significant increase in both the population and the number of workers paying taxes in the United States as as result of these changes in legal immigration limits,"" Goss wrote. ""Overall, we anticipate that the net effect of this bill on the long-range (Social Security trust fund) actuarial balance will be positive.""

However, those who oppose legalization of unauthorized immigrants, such as the Heritage Foundation, say allowing 11 million people who are largely low-skilled to access U.S. taxpayer-funded social benefits will cost more than it generates. A recent Heritage study predicted the bill would cost the country $6.3 trillion over the next 50 years.

The proposal from the Gang of Eight expands immigrant visa programs to attract more highly-skilled foreigners trained in science, technology, engineering and mathematics but also creates a new class of visas for lower-skilled immigrants to work in retail, hospitality, janitorial and construction work."

She contacted a headhunter. “I’ve got to get a job,” she said. “I just have to.” She had two job interviews lined up and her fingers crossed.

Long-term joblessness — the kind that Ms. Barrington-Ward and about four million others are experiencing — is now one of the defining realities of the American work force.

The unemployment rate has fallen to 7.3 percent, down from 10 percent four years ago. Private businesses have added about 7.6 million positions over the same period. But while recent numbers show that there are about as many people unemployed for short periods as in 2007 — before the crisis hit — they also show that long-term joblessness is up 213 percent.

In part, that’s because people don’t return to work in an orderly, first-fired, first-hired fashion. In any given month, a newly jobless worker has about a 20 to 30 percent chance of finding a new job. By the time he or she has been out of work for six months, though, the chance drops to one in 10, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Facing those kinds of odds, some of the long-term jobless have simply given up and dropped out of the labor force. So while official figures show that the number of long-term jobless has fallen steeply from its recessionary high of 6.7 million, many researchers fear that this number could mean as much bad news as good. Workers over 50 may be biding their time until they can start receiving Social Security. Younger workers may be going to school to avoid a tough job market. Others may be going on disability, helping to explain that program’s surging rolls.

Stan Hampton, 59, a veteran of the Iraq war, is now earning his associate degree. But he has not had a job since returning from active duty in 2007, and is now living in an apartment complex for veterans near Las Vegas."

Appearing to confirm widespread expectations that Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is not seeking a third term, Obama said this weekend that he had not made a final decision on a nomination.

An announcement would come in “the next several months,” Obama said.

Bernanke’s second four-year term as chairman ends Jan. 31 and he has not indicated he wants to be reappointed.

“I’ve narrowed it down to some extraordinarily qualified candidates,” Obama said in a New York Times interview published Sunday. Whoever Obama nominates, even if it is Bernanke, the Senate must confirm the choice.

Quiz: How well do you understand the Fed stimulus?

Obama declined to say anything more about the candidates or confirm a report last week that former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers was the front-runner for the post.

Summers, who was Obama’s top economic advisor from 2009 to 2010, and Fed Vice Chair Janet L. Yellen, are the leading contenders to replace Bernanke, according to administration officials familiar with the deliberations but who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

In the interview, Obama explained his criteria for picking a new Fed chairman, one of the most important nominations he’ll make in his second term as president. Analysts began scouring the comments for clues about which way he might be leaning.

“What I’m looking for is somebody who understands the Fed has a dual mandate, that that’s not just lip service, that it is very important to keep inflation in check, to keep our dollar sound, and to ensure stability in the markets,” Obama said.

“But the idea is not just to promote those things in the abstract,” he continued. “The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better.”

Obama went on to warn against the creation of new asset bubbles, such as the one in the housing market that led to the Great Recession and financial crisis.

“And when unemployment is still too high, and long-term unemployment is still too high, and there’s still weak demand in a lot of industries, I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, let’s make sure that we’re growing the economy, but let’s also keep an eye on inflation, and if it starts heating up, if the markets start frothing up, let’s make sure that we’re not creating new bubbles,” Obama said.

Obama’s emphasis on inflation could bode well for Summers. He is viewed as being more concerned about the effect of the Fed’s stimulus policies on prices than Yellen, who has been a strong ally of Bernanke in taking unprecedented steps to reduce unemployment.

But Obama also could have been making a case for Yellen in his praise of Bernanke in the interview.

“Ben Bernanke, by the way, has done a fine job as Fed chairman,” Obama said. “And when you look at Ben Bernanke’s testimony, not just last week but over the last couple of years, what he’s consistently said is right now, our priority needs to be growing the economy faster and strengthening incomes for ordinary Americans.”

Obama had a close relationship with Summers during his time in the White House. But the president is under pressure from many Democrats to choose Yellen, who would be the first woman ever to lead the Fed.

Senior White House officials are discussing a budget strategy that could lead to a government shutdown if Republicans continue to demand deeper spending cuts, lawmakers and Democrats familiar with the administration’s thinking said Thursday.

The posture represents a more confrontational approach than that of this spring, when President Obama decided not to escalate a fight over across-the-board reductions known as sequestration in an earlier budget battle with Republicans.

The change in tone has been evident in repeated and little-noticed veto threats over the past few weeks by Obama, who has rarely issued the warnings with such frequency. He has made it clear that he will not sign into law Republican spending bills that slash domestic programs even more deeply than sequestration.

If Republicans do not relent and the White House sticks to its position, a shutdown would be likely at the end of September, when Congress must authorize a new measure to fund the government.

The discussions at the White House illustrate the extent to which the looming budget battle is worrying the administration, which is seeking to advance Obama’s second-term agenda in the face of GOP opposition.

White House officials also are discussing a potential strategy to try to stop the sequestration cuts from continuing, the lawmakers and Democrats said. Under this scenario, the president might refuse to sign a new funding measure that did not roll back the sequester. No decision has been made.

But some of Obama’s top economic advisers fear that they may not be able to stop what they consider damaging cuts without a sharper confrontation, the sources said. Other advisers are urging a more cautious course, saying it would be better for Obama to seek a more targeted agreement that would increase funding for a smaller set of priorities.

Obama would still prefer to replace all the domestic and defense cuts with a long-term budget deal and avoid talk of a shutdown, according to the people familiar with the discussions. But some White House officials consider the Sept. 30 date the last chance to cancel a portion of the sequestration cuts before the 2014 midterm elections.

White House officials are all but resigned to any potential budget agreement lasting just a year or two — not the long-term fiscal pact they have sought.

Negotiations have not started on Capitol Hill, where the two parties are far apart, and many officials on both sides are skeptical that any agreement will be found before the September deadline. Senate Democrats are advancing spending bills worth $1.058 trillion, while Republicans are assuming a total spending level of $967 billion.

The White House is likely to frame any government shutdown as a consequence of Republicans protecting the wealthy at the expense of the nation’s economy and poor.

But Republicans are portraying Obama’s increasingly confrontational tone — which has been on display this week as he began a series of economic speeches — as a way to pull more taxes from the rich to fuel additional government spending.

Republicans have seized on Obama’s veto threats and speeches as a setup for a shutdown. “The president wants to raise taxes so he can do more stimulus spending,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) said this week. “And the fact is, it’s his sequester, and if we’re going to get rid of his sequester, we’re going to have to look for smarter spending cuts in order to do that.”

Congressional Democrats say they and the White House are preparing for a bigger clash in September.

“I think they’re in a position, and I’m urging my House members to be in a position, of a much stronger, less flexible agreement with policies that we believe undermine the operations of our government, our national security and our creditworthiness,” said House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (Md.).

Several Democrats suggested that they might accept an interim spending measure to keep the government open into November, delaying the fight until just around the time of another looming deadline: raising the statutory limit on federal borrowing. The exact deadline has not been determined by the Treasury Department, but the Congressional Budget Office recently estimated it would come in October or November.

Republicans are insisting they will demand additional spending cuts in exchange for agreeing to raise the debt limit, while Obama and Democrats say the nation’s creditworthiness cannot be subject to negotiation.

The president maintained the same position on that issue at the beginning of the year, and Republicans ultimately folded by agreeing to suspend the debt limit for several months. It is not clear whether they will acquiesce again.

The choice about how hard to fight Republicans over sequestration in September tugs at two competing impulses for the president. One is to avoid brinkmanship that could endanger the economy or unravel government operations. The other is to try to force an end to spending cuts that represent the opposite of his core second-term vision.

Deciding to escalate the confrontation with Congress over the budget would be a break from the president’s approach earlier this year. In March, he signed a budget resolution that continued to fund the government through Sept. 30 without forcing a fight over the sequestration cuts. Several weeks later, he agreed to move around money to cancel furloughs at the Federal Aviation Administration to eliminate flight delays, angering congressional Democrats who wanted broader negotiations.

Administration officials said that they had no choice because Senate leaders said that Congress probably would override any veto.

Congressional Democrats, led by Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough after the FAA episode that the administration had to send a much clearer signal about its intentions.

In recent weeks, Obama has been issuing a fusillade of veto threats and signaling that he will not sign bills that do not support his priorities.

In a Thursday letter to Van Hollen, ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, the Congressional Budget Office said canceling sequestration cuts in 2014 would create 900,000 jobs.

“There’s a real cost to keeping the sequester in place,” Van Hollen said in an interview, but he added that the options Democrats will consider in September will depend on public response.

“There is evidence that the pressure from the sequester is continuing to build,” he said. “I think the viable options will depend in part on what the public mood is at the time.”

There is little time for Congress to work out its differences. Lawmakers will leave for August recess next week and will not return until Sept. 9. Obama will spend a week in August on Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., and will be at a summit in Russia in early September.

That leaves only two weeks for both sides to reach a budget agreement upon their return. Some lawmakers are considering a short-term extension of budget funding to gain additional flexibility."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/29/food-stamp-cuts_n_4173942.html,2013-10-29 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],Democrats Protest $5 Billion Food Stamp Cut They Voted For,"WASHINGTON -- A group of nine Democratic members of the House of Representatives held a press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday to demand Congress avert an automatic food stamp cut scheduled to take effect on Friday.

""The average family of four will see a $36 cut in their monthly benefits, bringing the average per-person benefit from $1.50 a meal to $1.40 a meal,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said. ""Shame on this Congress for allowing this to happen.""

But the cut, which will reduce monthly benefits for all 47 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by roughly 7 percent, is happening thanks mainly to Democratic votes that hastened the demise of a benefit increase from the 2009 stimulus bill. Each of the representatives at Tuesday's presser voted with their party for a pair of 2010 spending bills that set the cuts in motion.

The first bill took money allocated for future food stamp use and used it instead to prevent states from laying off teachers. Democrats supported the bill grudgingly, lamenting that it would cause a food stamp cut in 2014. When it came time to support a second bill that raided future food stamp funds once again, pushing the cut to November 2013, they protested -- at least at first.

""This is one of the more egregious cases of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and is a vote we do not take lightly,"" more than 100 Democrats wrote in an August 2010 letter to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

But then President Barack Obama smoothed things over in a meeting at the White House, because the bill in question was the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act -- a priority of the first lady's. The measure provided free lunches and updated nutrition standards for schools.

""I am very pleased we were able to work together with the president and his team to address concerns regarding cuts to the food stamp program that are included in the child nutrition bill,"" Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in a statement at the time. On Tuesday, Lee told HuffPost the president had pledged to support replacing the SNAP funds, a vow he fulfilled in subsequent budget blueprints that didn't become law. Congress and the White House have been otherwise silent about the issue for the past three years.

On Tuesday, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) defended the 2010 tradeoff.

""It was a piece of legislation that said let's change nutrition standards, let's get junk foods out of our schools, and let's make sure that our kids can have those fruits and vegetables,"" DeLauro told HuffPost. ""There was no money for it. The price of it was $2.2 billion. That came from the food stamp program and all of us here complained. And we were opposed to that but we knew that it was a good first step in getting the Hunger-Free Kids Act.""

Friday's cut is happening thanks to the expiration of a 13.6 percent food stamp boost from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus bill. Originally, lawmakers had planned to let SNAP's annual inflation adjustments catch up to the increase sometime after 2015. Canceling the enhanced benefits this November means the government will spend $5 billion less on nutrition assistance next year -- an annual SNAP spending cut 25 percent larger than what House Republicans are seeking in farm bill negotiations starting this week.

DeLauro pivoted from November's food stamp decrease to Republican demands that food stamps be reduced by 5 percent, or $40 billion over 10 years, though the two things are completely separate.

""This is about people wanting to make a $40 billion cut in the food stamp program,"" DeLauro said, ""not to put in place a Hunger-Free Kids Act, but in fact to take food out of the mouths of our children, or seniors, and the disabled. A much different time, a much different place, and a much different set of circumstances."""

He was Treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010.

Imagine a library where many books have been borrowed and are long overdue. There is a case for an amnesty to get the books back and move on. There is a case for saying that rules are rules and fines must be paid. But the worst strategy is to keep indicating that an amnesty may come soon without ever introducing it. And this is roughly where we are in our corporate tax debate.

No one is satisfied with the U.S. corporate tax system. Some argue the main problem is that, while corporate profits are extraordinarily high relative to gross domestic product, tax collections are relatively low. Many very successful companies pay little or nothing in taxes at a time when the budget deficit is a major concern, hundreds of thousands of defense workers are being furloughed and lotteries are being held to determine which children Head Start can no longer afford to help.

But others say the main problem is that the United States has a higher corporate tax rate than any other major country and, unlike other countries, imposes severe taxes on income earned outside its borders. This, they argue, unfairly burdens companies engaged in international competition and discourages the repatriation of profits earned abroad. The resulting patterns of investment are also said to benefit foreign workers at the expense of their U.S. counterparts.

With respect to tax reform, these perspectives seem to argue in opposite directions. The former points toward the desirability of raising revenue by closing loopholes; the latter seems to call for a reduction in corporate tax burdens. But while many can get behind the idea of “broadening the base and lowering the rate,” consensus tends to collapse over the means to broaden the base. A principal objective of many business-oriented reformers seems to be narrowing the corporate tax base by reducing the taxation of foreign earnings through movement to a territorial system.

Despite the tension between perspectives, the debate has landed us in so perverse a place that win-win reform would be easy to achieve. The central issue is the taxation of global companies. Under current law, U.S. companies are taxed on their foreign profits — with a credit for taxes paid to other governments — only when they repatriate these profits. Right now, U.S. companies are holding nearly $2 trillion in cash abroad. Businesses argue, with some validity, that current rules make it expensive to bring money home while not raising much revenue for the government. Tax relief, they assert, would help them bring money home, at a minimum benefiting their shareholders but also possibly leading to an increase in investment.

Critics counter that companies that have used what might politely be called aggressive accounting practices to locate income in low-tax jurisdictions should not be given further relief.

In the meantime, what’s a corporate treasurer to do? With the possibility of some kind of relief looming, there is every reason to delay repatriating earnings to the United States even if the company has no good use for the cash abroad. And so the debate encourages exactly what all sides can agree is desirable to avoid: corporate cash kept abroad to the detriment of companies and to no benefit for the U.S. fiscal situation.

A clear and unambiguous commitment that there will be no rate reduction or repatriation relief for the next decade would be an improvement over the current situation because companies would know that they will have to pay taxes on their foreign profits if they wish to make them available to shareholders and would no longer have an incentive to delay.

But this would not be the best outcome. As a very general rule, improvement is possible anytime tax rules are experienced by taxpayers as a substantial burden without generating substantial revenue for the government. Having taxpayers be burdened less and pay more can make them better off and help the fiscal situation. The United States should eliminate the distinction between repatriated and unrepatriated foreign corporate profits for U.S. companies and tax all foreign income (after allowances for taxes paid to other governments) at a fixed rate well below its current corporate rate, perhaps in the range of 15 percent.

A similar tax should be imposed on past accumulated profits held abroad.

Such a proposal could easily be designed to raise revenue relative to the current baseline, encourage the repatriation of funds and reduce the competitive disadvantage faced by U.S. multinationals operating abroad. It is about as close to a free lunch as tax reformers will ever get."

http://uk.news.yahoo.com/thousands-face-benefits-cut-bedroom-tax-032754589.html,,[],'Bedroom Tax' To Hit Thousands Of Families,"Thousands of families living in social housing are facing a cut in their benefits from April because they are seen to have too big a home.

The under-occupation penalty, dubbed ""the bedroom tax"", aims to encourage households to downsize if they have spare rooms, freeing up their properties for larger families.

But council house tenant Eddie Bird says the policy fails to take into consideration individual cases. His wife Shirley has terminal cancer, and weighing just five-and-a-half stone, needs her own room.

""Any form of movement on the bed and it affects my wife. She's in constant back pain,"" said Mr Bird. ""There's no room for separate beds so I sleep in the box room.""

They have been told they will lose nearly £14 a week in benefits.

""It's going to affect my wife's quality of life. We have a Motability car but if we can't afford to put petrol in it, we can't go on any day trips.""

The Government hopes the policy will make better use of almost a million rooms that are not used and help reduce the £23bn housing benefit bill.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ""We've put a fairly sizeable sum aside to be able to ensure that those kind of cases can be paid for.

""But the general idea that there has to be a limit on the amount of benefit that people receive I think is a correct one.

""And these are exactly the same kind of rules that have existed in the last few years in private rented (accommodation), so we are applying to public housing.

""If it was good enough for private renting, it's got to be good enough for public housing.""

But critics question how you can penalise tenants for not moving somewhere smaller when there simply are not enough suitable sized properties available.

It is something the Coast and Country Housing Association has seen in South Teesside. They have 10,000 properties but only two one-bedroom apartments available.

Chief executive Iain Sim said: ""We had the pasty tax last year - this is the nasty tax. This is hitting people directly who through no fault of their own are under-occupying the property that they live in.

Story continues

""The cut in their benefit will range from 14% for one room up to 25% for two rooms. That's a loss in income of between £10 and £22 a week. That's a lot of money to take from people with very limited incomes.""

The change is expected to affect 660,000 claimants.

Some households will be exempt if, for example, a non-resident carer for a disabled person helps at the home overnight.

But as Eddie and Shirley Bird are married they will not be eligible for this exemption. Their only hope is that they will qualify for financial assistance from a fund called the Discretionary Housing Payment scheme, but it is not guaranteed."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/27/should-government-tax-email/,2013-03-27 00:00:00,['Barnini Chakraborty'],Should the government tax your email? One California official thinks so,"Your property is taxed. Your income is taxed. Your investments are taxed.

But ... your email?

A California official is bringing new life to the argument that the Internet -- including emails -- is an untapped revenue resource that should be taxed to help local economies.

Berkeley City Councilman Gordon Wozniak brought up taxing emails during a recent council meeting. He suggested the money collected, which would be part of a wider-reaching Internet tax, could be used in Berkeley's case to save the local post office.

""There should be something like a bit tax,"" he said during the March 5 meeting. ""I mean, a bit tax could be a cent per gigabit and they would make, probably, billions of dollars a year.""

More On This... Unions rally against Postal Service move to end Saturday delivery

Plus, he said, there should be a ""very tiny tax on email.""

This idea goes beyond already-controversial proposals to tax e-commerce -- like buying used books on Amazon. This would be a tax on data.

Wozniak told FoxNews.com the response to the idea has been varied.

""Most people don't like the idea of taxing the Internet,"" he acknowledged. ""There are a number of people who say it's a good idea, but some are saying it's impractical and there's no way to do it.""

Chris Edwards, an economist with the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, is one of those people.

""It's a terrible idea,"" Edwards told FoxNews.com.

""The government doesn't need any more tax money. That's not the problem. The American government is spending more than ever.""

Plus, he said, a tax like this would hit ""different types of industry in different ways.""

Local governments can't legally impose a tax on the Internet -- but Wozniak's idea is not as new, or perhaps as far-fetched, as it sounds. Amid concerns that the government could one day turn to the Internet for a new-age funding stream, Congress in 1998 passed a law called the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bans Internet taxation.

That law is set to expire next November. If that happens, Wozniak's proposal could someday turn into a reality -- but the likelihood is slim.

Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte and Dean Heller have already introduced legislation this year that would indefinitely extend the law prohibiting federal, state and local governments from taxing Internet access.

The idea of a ""bit tax"" is the brainchild of Arthur Cordell, a former information technology adviser for the Canadian government. Cordell proposed the tax during a 1997 lecture at Harvard Law School.

""While there are few kudos for proposing a new tax, the time is ripe to suggest positive and constructive ways of dealing with serious fiscal realities,"" Cordell said at the time. ""The move to a new economy should be matched by consideration of a new tax base. A tax base that is growing. A tax base that is at the heart of a new economy. A tax base that can be easily identified, one where collection is in few hands. A tax that is difficult to avoid.""

He, too, called it a ""bit tax.""

Cordell did not return a request for comment from FoxNews.com. But he did tell a Los Angeles Times columnist this month that he still supports the Internet tax, saying, ""it's needed more than ever as we get rid of brick and mortar stuff. ... eventually it's going to happen.""

The idea seemed to get an endorsement from the LA Times columnist, George Skelton, who suggested such a tax could even cut down on ""spammers and scammers."" Skelton suggested emails that run off the screen be taxed an additional amount, ""just as a bulky letter costs more than a 46-cent stamp.""

Under Cordell's framework, the bit tax would impose a levy on each digital bit of information flowing through global networks. That means people could have to pony up a fee for emails, file transfers, electronic check transactions and more.

And that could be just the beginning.

Cordell said in 1997 that the new revenue could be used for schools, parks and health care, among other services. Critics of this idea, he argued, are interested in trying to ""wrestle the state to the ground."" At the time, he quoted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., ""who wrote in a decision in 1904 that 'Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.'""

Edwards disagrees.

""Holmes said that during a time when federal taxes were 4 percent of the GDP,"" Edwards said. ""Yes, taxes might have paid for a civilized society then, but that's not where we are now."""

Accuses Illinois of Securities Fraud,"“Public pension disclosure by municipal issuers continues to be a top priority,” said Elaine C. Greenberg, chief of the S.E.C.’s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, which was formed in 2010.

Its first action against a state accused New Jersey of fraud that year in connection with pension disclosures that said a special reserve had been set up to pay for pension increases. The reserve was an accounting illusion, The New York Times had previously reported.

In that case, as with Illinois, the S.E.C. has cited the harm done to the investors who bought the governments’ bonds — not the retirees whose pensions were at risk, or the taxpayers who found themselves expected to make outlays they never agreed to. The S.E.C.’s mission is to uphold the integrity of the capital markets, not to protect retirees or promote balanced budgets.

“Municipal investors are no less entitled to truthful risk disclosures than other investors,” George S. Canellos, acting director of the S.E.C.’s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement. “Time after time, Illinois failed to inform its bond investors about the risk to its financial condition posed by the structural underfunding of its pension system.”

The S.E.C. noted that Illinois had passed a law in 1994 allowing itself to put less than the required amount into its pension system each year. It is not the only state to have done so. For the next 15 years, Illinois issued annual reports showing that it was on track with its lawful schedule, even as it fell further behind the real-world amount needed to pay all current and retired public employees.

By 2003, the state was so far behind that it issued $10 billion of bonds and put the proceeds into its pension funds to make them look flush. The main underwriter of those bonds, Bear Stearns, was later found to have made an improper payment to win the business, figuring in the corruption trial of a former governor, Rod R. Blagojevich.

In 2005, the state passed another law, giving itself a holiday from making even the inadequate annual pension contributions called for by its 1994 schedule. It said it would offset the missing money with bigger contributions from 2008 to 2010, but then did not do so. By 2010, the reported shortfall of the pension system was $57 billion, and senior officials were warning that the system was at risk of breaking down completely."

* Bernanke says won't see 6 percent jobless rate until 2016

* Fed chief tries to calm concerns over risks of policies

* ""Significant majority"" support policy course

* One Fed hawk, Fisher, calls for immediate tapering of QE

By Pedro Nicolaci da Costa and Jonathan Spicer

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. jobless rate is unlikely to reach more normal levels for several years, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday as he again defended the central bank's forceful easing of monetary policy.

Appearing before a congressional panel for a second straight day, Bernanke downplayed signs of internal divisions at the Fed, saying the policy of quantitative easing, or QE, has the support of a ""significant majority"" of top central bank officials.

One lawmaker asked Bernanke when the economy might produce enough jobs to bring the unemployment rate, currently at 7.9 percent, down to 6 percent - the top of the Fed's long-term forecast range.

""A reasonable guess for 6 percent would be around 2016, about three more years,"" Bernanke told the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.

Moreover, as he had in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, the Fed chairman countered the notion that the Fed's loose monetary stance might be fueling asset bubbles or inflation.

""It's our view that there's still a good bit of slack in the economy. I don't think the economy is overheating,"" he said.

Financial markets were again encouraged by Bernanke's remarks, with stocks rallying for a second day on the Fed chief's signal of continued stimulus combined with enthusiasm over strong figures on business investment plans.

""He is going to be refilling the punchbowl for a very long time,"" said Keith Bliss, senior vice-president at Cuttone & Co in New York.

In response to the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-2009, the Fed slashed official borrowing costs to effectively zero and bought more than $2.5 trillion in mortgage and Treasury securities to keep long-term rates low.

It is currently buying $45 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage bonds per month, a policy Fed officials backed in an 11-1 vote in January. However, minutes of that meeting released last week showed many officials had concerns over the risks presented by the central bank's policy course.

Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who is among the minority of so-called hawks at the central bank, said later on Wednesday that he would like the Fed to immediately taper the purchases because the U.S. housing market is on sounder footing.

""The fact that the housing market gears have now begun to mesh is why I believe we are running the risk of overkill by continuing our mortgage-backed securities purchase program at the current pace, and I have suggested that we begin tapering those purchases,"" Fisher said at Columbia University.

""Personally I would begin tapering Treasuries as well,"" he later told reporters. ""I would like to start now. I just don't think the benefits are worth the costs.""

But most Fed officials are eager to continue the extraordinarily easy policies given the high jobless rate and the fact that inflation is below their 2 percent target, and they do not want to derail a recovery that has faltered in each of the last three years.

Bernanke argued the Fed's policy easing deserves at least some credit for the ongoing economic recovery, even if growth remains fragile and vulnerable to looming short-run spending cuts from the U.S. government.

Indeed, he argued that current plans for abrupt short-term deficit reduction could be counterproductive, even for the purposes of reducing government debt levels.

""I'm still concerned about the short-run impact on jobs,"" he said. ""(You) don't get as much benefit as you think because if you slow the economy that hurts your revenues and that means your deficit reduction is not as big as you think it is.""

A number Republicans on the House committee said they also were concerned about the Fed's actions.

""For diminishing marginal benefits, the Federal Reserve's unconventional strategy creates considerable risks,"" said Representative Jeb Hensarling, the panel's chairman. ""If the (Fed's) balance sheet is not unwound at the right time and at the right pace, we could be looking at another deep recession, soaring inflation or skyrocketing interest rates.""

Bernanke tried to soothe such worries, expressed by a number of lawmakers, that the central bank was so far into uncharted policy territory that an exit could be problematic.

Admitting the Fed would face an unprecedented task, Bernanke nonetheless said the central bank has the right tools to exit when the time comes, adding that those measures have been tested and used in other countries."

Cynthia Lummis wants

people to lobby Congress to stop

the sequester

Just ask Wyoming’s lone House member, Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R), who applauded the $85 billion carved across the board in a letter to constituents. “Instead of blindly filling empty desks,” she wrote last week, “federal agencies will be forced to consider which positions are crucial and make their decision based on necessity rather than luxury.”

Conservatives love cheering government spending cuts......until they hit home, like they did last week at Yellowstone National Park in Lummis's home state of Wyoming, where park superintendent Dan Wenk froze his workforce and delayed the start of seasonal hiring and plowing after being ordered to cut $1.8 million from his budget due to sequestration. The cuts will hurt Yellowstone tourism, delivering a blow to the region's economy, but thanks to cheerleaders of sequestration like Lummis, Wenk's hands were tied.

When Lummis was confronted with angry constituents, the obvious thing to do would have been to support repealing or replacing the sequester. Instead, she invented a fantasy in which Wenk was the villain, because instead of cutting his operating budget he should have lobbied Congress for permission to cut his capital budget. But not only was her ""solution"" not actually a solution, it would have actually increased spending over the long-run.



In an interview, Lummis suggested that Wenk petition House and Senate appropriators for permission to take money from his capital budget to cover the cuts, an idea he said was not legal and would never get through Congress in time.

Beyond the absurdity of a member of Congress urging one of her constituents to solve his problem by lobbying Congress, it would be astonishingly stupid to shift money from capital projects to current operations when interest rates are as low as they are. If you neglect long-term capital projects, sooner or later the bill will come due, and the longer you wait, the bigger the bill will be—and interest rates are bound to be higher when they do. Unless you're planning to let your most core assets rot, in the long-run it's cheaper to act earlier with low interest rates, and you get the side benefit of whatever capital improvements you've made.

Basically, what Lummis says Wenk should have asked for is like that old saying about shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic, except instead of telling him to shuffle the deck chairs, she's saying he should have asked the crew for permission to shuffle the deck chairs—never mind the fact that she's a member of the crew. If this is the kind of genius Wyoming sends to Congress, they get what they deserve. It's just a shame that those of us who didn't vote for Lummis have to suffer the consequences as well.

Meanwhile, Republicans are still whining about losing their White House tour perk even as real people are getting hurt. Please tell them to stop bellyaching and do something about the sequester."

A marathon session Saturday failed to produce an agreement, with some of those involved saying the two sides were far apart on some issues.

According to KCBS radio, neither side has provided any media updates Sunday, with just hours to go before the planned walkout.

The unions insist they don’t want to strike.

“Our team is giving it our best shot. We really do not want to disrupt service Monday,” president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555 told the Associated Press. “We want a deal. We will do whatever it takes.”

Unions representing the majority of Bay Area Rapid Transit workers issued a 72-hour notice of intent to strike late Thursday.

BART trains carry an estimated 400,000 passengers each day, and emergency measures such as additional bus and ferry service and increased reliance on casual carpooling did little to cut the sting of a 4 1/2-day strike that severely hampered the region in early July.

With a line of local and regional officials behind him, California Labor Secretary Marty Morgenstern joined San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee in his City Hall office Friday morning to call for an end to the uncertainty.

Lee said that over the last month he had spoken to numerous workers at hotels, coffee shops and restaurants, as well as to owners of small businesses, all of whom conveyed the suffering another strike would cause them.

“I couldn’t even get a burrito without confronting someone who asked that we take our stand on behalf of the public,” Lee told reporters. “We need an agreement and not a strike in our public transit system. The public ridership … need a voice at this table.”

Lee said a strike would hit lower-income families hardest — those trying to get to more than one job who cannot afford the cost of high-priced parking garages. He wanted, he said, “to put a face on the ridership … we need an agreement.”

Mediators from the state and federal government have been at the table, but the past month has produced little more than acrimony between the two largest worker unions and BART management.

After making a series of concessions in a down economy in recent years, Service Employees International Union Local 1021 and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555 have pressed for raises that exceed 20% over three years.

BART management has countered with a proposed 8% raise over four years. But the agency also has asked workers, who earn a median salary of about $80,000, to contribute to their pensions. BART employees currently pay nothing into the pension system. Workers also are being asked to increase their healthcare contribution from the current flat rate of $92 per month.

Union leaders have lambasted management for being at the table for only about half of the last four weeks because of vacations.

Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), center, and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), left, speaks during a Dec. 17 news conference urging the Senate to change the budget proposal that cuts retirement benefits for current and future military retirees. (Susan Walsh/AP)

After 25 years of service, including a combat tour in Afghanistan, Lt. Col. Stephen Preston retired from the Army and began collecting a pension of nearly $55,000 a year. The money made it possible for Preston to go back to college, get his MBA and embark on a second career in corporate strategy.

So it happened that Preston was sitting in his new office shortly before Christmas when he heard on the radio that he had become the latest target in Washington’s war on spending.

“I’m not an angry man, but I was very, very angry,” Preston, 51, said in a telephone interview from his home in Tampa. “This is a pact between the greater population of the United States and the fraction of people who served and sacrificed. If you didn’t want to pay us what you promised us, then you probably shouldn’t have promised it.”

The plan to trim pension increases for working-age military retirees such as Preston is by far the most controversial provision in a bipartisan budget deal approved by Congress and signed last week by President Obama.

The cut is small — a one-percentage-point reduction in the annual cost-of-

living increase — but it has provoked outrage among veterans, some of whom argue that the country is reneging on a solemn pact. And even though lawmakers, especially in the GOP, fulminate about the need to cut the cost of federal health and retirement benefits, many have vowed to roll the cut back when Congress returns to work next week.

The authors of the budget deal, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.), have agreed to amend the provision to exempt disabled retirees and survivors of those killed in action, eliminating roughly 10 percent of the $6 billion in savings projected over the next decade.

But Ryan has resisted efforts to abandon the pension cut entirely, calling it a “modest” adjustment to a particularly generous program — and therefore a more sensible choice than harder decisions that may lie ahead.

“I stand behind the need for reform,” Ryan wrote in a Dec. 22 op-ed in USA Today. Noting that a special commission is due in May to make recommendations for an overhaul of the military compensation system, Ryan wrote, “That’s why this reform does not take effect until the end of 2015 — it gives Congress ample time to consider alternatives.”

Opponents say the policy retroactively penalizes a deserving group while doing nothing to contain the much larger cost of health and retirement benefits for the general public. Independent budget analysts note, how­ever, that lawmakers have shied away from reductions in federal retirement benefits for any recipients — including changes to Social Security and Medicare included in Obama’s most recent budget request — illustrating the enormous political difficulty of trimming the federal government’s largest category of expenditures.

“It’s easy to be bold and brave in general, but it’s very hard to be bold and brave in specific,” said Richard Kogan, a former Obama budget adviser who works at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

“You can talk about ‘reforming entitlements.’ But you can’t talk about ‘cutting Social Security,’ because the public knows what that means,” Kogan said. “Now, we’ve got $6 billion taken from military pensions — an infinitesimally small provision — and it causes people heartburn because it’s specific.”

Military compensation

Military pensions have long been on the chopping block, in part because the Pentagon, like many government and private entities, is struggling to cover the cost of promises made to people who now typically spend long decades in retirement. In 2012, 2.3 million military retirees and survivors of those killed in action received about $52 billion in payments, a nearly 50 percent increase over 2002, according to Defense Department actuaries.

Overall, military compensation — including health benefits and salaries paid to active-duty personnel — eats up roughly half the defense budget, a proportion that is steadily rising. In a speech in November, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned that “without serious attempts to achieve significant savings” in military compensation, “we risk becoming an unbalanced force.”

Military pensions would appear to be particularly ripe for reduction. Anyone who puts in 20 years can receive payments immediately and look forward to annual cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, for life. That means service members who signed up at 18 could find themselves with a full pension — roughly half their ­active-duty paycheck — at 38. And the government finds itself doling out cash to former troops who have launched lucrative second careers, often with defense contractors that draw their profits from government coffers.

In 2010, as part of a sweeping proposal to rebalance the federal budget, an independent deficit reduction commission appointed by Obama suggested eliminating COLAs for military retirees younger than 62.

In the budget deal they hammered out this month, Murray and Ryan took a less drastic approach, proposing to knock one percentage point off annual ­COLAs for working-age retirees. Under the provision, which takes effect in 2015, pensions will be recalculated at age 62 so retirees thereafter receive the same amount they would have if the reduction had never happened.

The provision accounts for a fraction of the $85 billion in savings identified in the budget deal. Ryan has called it a reasonable adjustment to a program that benefits a small portion of military men and women, only 17 percent of whom serve long enough to qualify for a pension.

“If a serviceman enlisted at 18 and retired at 38, under this policy his lifetime benefit would be about $1.7 million instead of $1.8 million,” Ryan wrote in USA Today. “For a service member who retired at the average military retirement age of 44, the difference would be smaller, about $30,000 over his or her lifetime.”

“And to be clear, the money we save from this reform will go right back to the military,” he wrote. “Veterans aren’t Washington’s piggy bank.”

Opponents of the policy do not deny the need to overhaul military pensions, or military compensation in general. But they argue that changes should be made for future enlistees, not for people who have already served and planned their lives around promised benefits.

Mike Hayden, director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America, noted that Congress directed the commission analyzing military compensation to grandfather the current force in its recommendations.

The budget deal, Hayden said, “is definitely a change of the contract that we’ve made with the currently serving.”

Broader approach sought

Just as troubling, opponents say, is the cavalier manner in which budget negotiators cherry-picked savings from the military to cover the cost of a small budget deal that solves none of the nation’s biggest problems.

“It’s horrible policy. If we’re going to reform entitlements, let’s do it in a fashion that’s comprehensive,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), an advocate of broad entitlement reform who voted against the budget deal and is campaigning to overturn the military pension provision.

Graham said it would be more acceptable — and more fiscally responsible — to adopt a less generous measure of inflation for all federally compensated retirees, including Social Security recipients. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the alternative inflation measure, known as chained CPI, or chained consumer price index, would save more than $200 billion over the next decade — 33 times the savings forecast from changing military COLAs alone.

This agreement “is not an effort to deal with the entitlement problem,” Graham said. “This is an effort to single out one group of people and put a penalty on their benefits that you’re not putting on anybody else. And this would be the last group we’d want to penalize, I think, not the first.”

Preston, the retired soldier, agrees. He said he nearly left the military after 10 years but was talked into staying by a battalion commander who explained the wisdom of putting in 20. Then the nation went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Preston said he felt an obligation to “stick it out a little longer.”

“Those of us who make it to 25, 30 years, we deserve to get what we were promised,” he said. “It isn’t even really about the money. If we need to balance our budget, fine.”

“But let’s not balance it by breaking the deal you have with me, who served, in order to provide for somebody who just showed up,” he said. “You just don’t do that.”"

In a sign that the warnings may have gone too far, President Obama sought to dial back some of the rhetoric. Most Americans, he said, won’t immediately feel the effects of the complex process known as sequestration, which is expected to unfold like a slow-motion budgetary car crash.

“The longer these cuts remain in place, the greater the damage to our economy — a slow grind that will intensify with each passing day,” Obama said after meeting congressional leaders for less than an hour in the Oval Office. “This is not going to be an apocalypse.... It’s just dumb. And it’s going to hurt.”

The pain of $85 billion in across-the-board cuts will kick in next month when agencies are forced to order air traffic controllers, food inspectors, prosecutors, janitors and other federal workers to take one or two days of unpaid leave for every two-week pay period. Most federal agencies are required to give workers at least 30 days’ notice of any furloughs.

The slow ramp-up gives Obama and congressional Republicans time to strike a deal before the next crisis hits — a potential government shutdown. The legislation authorizing money to run the government expires March 27.

The GOP-led House plans to pass a budget bill next week, giving the Democratic-controlled Senate a chance to act in time to keep the government running.

“I’m hopeful that we won’t have to deal with the threat of a government shutdown while we’re dealing with the sequester at the same time,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters after the White House meeting.

The Justice Department and National Labor Relations Board issued furlough notices ahead of Friday’s midnight deadline. The vast majority of furloughs at other agencies are not expected to begin until April.

The acting head of the Internal Revenue Service, Steven T. Miller, informed employees that they would not be furloughed until after tax-filing season ends this summer. They then would need to take five to seven days of unpaid leave before Sept. 30.

The Pentagon said it would furlough most of its 800,000 civilian employees one day a week — amounting to a 20% pay cut — with notifications coming this month.

Except for military pay and a few other accounts, all the Pentagon’s 2,500 budget accounts will be cut by up to 15% for the rest of the fiscal year, as the Defense Department is required to cut spending by $42.7 billion in 2013.

“As the year goes on, it will be unmistakable,” Ashton Carter, the deputy secretary of Defense, said of the effect. “It’s not subtle.”

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Air Force would start reducing flying hours immediately, the Army would curtail training and the Navy would “gradually stand down” four of its air wings. A Navy air wing typically has seven or eight squadrons of aircraft.

When asked for specific actions the Pentagon would take this weekend, Carter did not name any. Over the next two weeks, he said, Army units scheduled to go to the National Training Center, a vast installation in the California desert, would see those plans canceled.

Other reductions also are coming.

Cuts in Medicare reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and other medical providers would take effect in April, as claims administrators must update their systems to implement an across-the-board 2% reduction in reimbursement payments.

Advertisement

Most cuts in federal funding for education would not take place until the fall as grants for the current school year have already gone out.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that $44 billion of the $85 billion in cuts would be imposed by the end of September, the first part of nearly $1.2 trillion in spending reductions over the next decade.

The greatest hit will be to the defense budget, which would see spending for 2013 cut 7.9%. Non-defense spending would be reduced 4.6%.

Some major budget items are exempt, including Social Security benefits, veterans programs, Medicaid and many types of assistance for low-income Americans.

The threat of the impending cuts already has had some effect.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said this week that they had released “several hundred” low-risk immigrants from deportation centers nationwide in anticipation of spending reductions, though news reports Friday indicated the release may have been much larger.

Advertisement

The Federal Aviation Administration has alerted more than 100 airports with fewer than 150,000 landings and takeoffs a year, such as Santa Monica Airport, that their air traffic control towers could be shut down. Overnight shifts at an additional 60 towers could be eliminated.

In his comments Friday, Obama tried to put a personal face on the budget standoff.

“Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol ... they’re going to have less pay, the janitors, the security guards. They just got a pay cut, and they’ve got to figure out how to manage that,” the president said. “That’s real.”

Bruce Moyer, chairman of the Federal-Postal Coalition, an alliance of unions representing about 2.5 million federal and postal service employees, said those workers are the victims in the political standoff.

Advertisement

“It’s stressful. It’s uncertain,” he said. “You can’t actually come in to do your job as the American people expect you to if you’re furloughed.”

Obama put the blame on Republicans, saying they chose the steep cuts rather than agree to compromise. He insisted the only way to avert the cuts was a package that combined reduced spending with new revenues from higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations.

But Republicans blamed Obama for the across-the-board cuts and said they would not approve new taxes after agreeing to several in the deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff crisis Jan. 1.

“Let’s make it clear the president got his tax hike on Jan. 1,” Boehner said. “The discussion about revenue, in my view, is over. It’s about taking on the spending problem in Washington.”

A thousand times no.

After The Financial Times reported in late May that Larry Summers was at the top of President Barack Obama's short list for chairman of the Federal Reserve when Ben Bernanke's second term in the post expires in January, opposition quickly built against that possible choice. Among those who don't want the job to go to the former Secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton and former director of the National Economic Council under Obama are 20 Democratic and allied senators who signed a letter urging that Janet Yellen get the job instead. She is currently vice chair of the Fed.

The letter and other pressure being exerted on the White House over the chairman's post have, according to The Wall Street Journal, made the president cross. The selection of the next Fed chief is in his view a crucial decision of presidential prerogative and one he apparently believes nobody should be meddling in. Thus, sources informed the Journal's reporters, there have been behind-the-scenes efforts telling the dissenters to keep their traps shut.

It's no surprise that Obama is miffed over the often acidic assessments of Summers's policy record, his abrasive personality and his sexism. Two weeks ago, he vigorously defended Summers during a private meeting with leading Democrats. Subsequently, he publicly announced that two strong choices among several he is considering are, in fact, Summers and Yellen.

The White House pushback seems to have worked, at least for now. In recent days, public critiques from the Yellen backers seem to have fallen off. Whether that's just the August recess at work or an indication that many of Summers's opponents within the party aren't up to fighting about it is anybody's guess. Top Democratic congressional leaders, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have indicated they will support whomever the president nominates.

Before going below the fold to read more, please sign our petition requesting that President Obama not appoint Larry Summers as Federal Reserve chair, and consider instead appointing a more qualified person, such as Deputy Chair Janet Yellen."

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-challenges-gop-accept-corporate-tax-deal-180909359.html,,[],Obama challenges GOP to accept corporate tax deal,"CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) — President Barack Obama on Tuesday offered congressional Republicans a new corporate tax cut and jobs spending package he said might ""help break through some of the political logjam in Washington,"" only to have GOP lawmakers immediately throw cold water on the idea.

The announcement and quick rejection underscored how elusive common ground is between the Democratic White House and Republicans in Congress on fiscal issues. The divide was particularly stark on the corporate tax proposal given that both parties generally have supported overhauling the code for businesses, though the White House and Republicans have differed on specifics.

Obama outlined his proposal in a speech at a massive Amazon.com plant in Chattanooga, his latest stop on a summertime campaign to refocus his agenda on the economy. He said ""serious people"" in both parties should accept his offer.

""I'm willing to work with Republicans on reforming our corporate tax code, as long as we use the money from transitioning to a simpler tax system for a significant investment in creating middle-class jobs,"" Obama said. ""That's the deal.""

But the office of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, complained that Obama's plan was simply a repackaging of proposals the White House has always supported.

""It's the opposite of a concession,"" said spokesman Brendan Buck, noting that Republicans want to link a corporate tax overhaul with changes in the individual tax code.

In another sign of their sour relationship, Boehner and the White House also dueled over the proposal's rollout, with the speaker's office saying officials there first learned about the plan from media reports. An Obama spokesman said the White House tried to tell Boehner's staff about the plan a day in advance but the call was not returned.

Like Republicans, the president previously has called for corporate tax reform to be coupled with an individual tax overhaul. But his new offer drops that demand and calls only for lowering the corporate rate from 35 percent to 28 percent, with an even lower effective tax rate of 25 percent for manufacturers.

Story continues

The White House also said the president will continue to seek changes to the individual tax rate as part of a larger ""grand bargain"" he wants with the GOP. But with the prospects of such a deal growing increasingly slim, Obama advisers say they've opted to isolate an area on taxes where they believe they have more agreement with Republicans.

Obama also wants lawmakers to pour one-time revenue generated from the tax overhaul into jobs programs, including infrastructure, manufacturing and community colleges.

""If we're going to give businesses a better deal, we're going to give workers a better deal too,"" the president said.

Republicans have opposed using tax revenue to support more spending. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Tuesday that ""everything should be negotiated, but certainly I'm not in support of it.""

Administration officials said the jobs programs would be paid for with a one-time revenue boost from measures such as changing depreciation rules or having a one-time fee on earnings held overseas. But they wouldn't put a price tag on the revenue total or the corporate tax overhaul at large.

When Obama first unveiled his corporate tax plan last year, congressional Republicans called for even deeper cuts for the business world. His campaign rival, Mitt Romney, wanted a 25 percent corporate tax rate.

The U.S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, but many businesses avoid the full cost by taking advantage of deductions, credits and exemptions that Obama wants to eliminate.

Obama wants to do away with corporate tax benefits like oil and natural gas industry subsidies, special breaks for the purchase of private jets and certain corporate tax shelters. He also wants to impose a minimum tax on foreign earnings, a move opposed by multinational corporations and perhaps the most contentious provision in the president's plan.

John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable, welcomed Obama's call for lowering the corporate tax rate. But like many Republican lawmakers, he called for addressing individual tax rates at the same time and said he opposed using corporate tax overhaul revenue for ""unrelated spending.""

""Corporate tax reform should be part of a comprehensive fix for the individual and business tax codes, and corporate reform should be achieved in a revenue-neutral manner,"" said Engler, who heads the association of business leaders.

The backdrop for Obama's remarks Tuesday was an Amazon fulfillment center, a massive, 1 million-square-foot warehouse. During a tour of the facility, Obama was shown how the company gets packages ready for delivery, from the employees who pull orders from three stories of floor-to-ceiling shelves, to loading into boxes sealed with water-activated tape and quality control

Amazon announced Monday that it would add 7,000 new jobs, including 5,000 more at U.S. distribution centers that currently employ about 20,000 workers who pack and ship customer orders.

Tea party lawmakers who say they believe ordinary Americans want to end the Affordable Care Act have committed to that goal, even if Republicans are blamed for shutting down routine government services for the first time in nearly two decades.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) was cheered with chants of “Vote! Vote! Vote!” as he outlined the proposal during a noon meeting in the Capitol basement. After midnight Saturday, the House approved the plan, sending legislation to the Senate to fund the government through Dec. 15 but delay the rollout of the healthcare law for one year and repeal the law’s tax on medical-device manufacturers. A separate bill was unanimously approved to ensure that military troops continue to be paid if there is a shutdown.

House Republicans appeared unswayed by the certainty that this latest effort is doomed in the Senate, where Democrats have the majority, or by stern warnings from the White House, which promised a veto and said the amendments “advance a narrow ideological agenda and threaten the nation’s economy.”

The president’s spokesman warned Republicans against pursuing this “reckless and irresponsible” path. “Today, Republicans in the House of Representatives moved to shut down the government,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. “The president has shown that he is willing to improve the healthcare law and meet Republicans more than halfway to deal with our fiscal challenges, but he will not do so under threats of a government shutdown that will hurt our economy.”

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) vowed Saturday that Americans would not be “extorted by tea party anarchists.”

“To be absolutely clear, the Senate will reject both the one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act and the repeal of the medical-device tax,” he said in a statement. “After weeks of futile political games from Republicans, we are still at square one.”

The Senate, which was not expected to resume work on the bill until Monday, could operate under rules that require only a simple majority to reject the Republican amendments, a leadership aide said. That could leave the House on the hook to pass the government funding bill later Monday or launch a shutdown.

Boehner would then have few choices. He could try to approve a stopgap measure to keep the government running for a short time as talks continue or try to attach more modest changes to the healthcare law. He could also simply abandon his most conservative colleagues and seek a bipartisan coalition with Democrats to continue to fund the government and prevent a shutdown, risking the ire of his majority.

In the afternoon, Boehner walked through the crowded Speaker’s Lobby off the House chamber for a smoke break on the balcony, but declined to answer reporters’ questions.

The gloomy prospect of an economic disruption that could be triggered by furloughed federal workers and closed museums, parks and government operations on Tuesday, the first day of the new fiscal year, was no match for the enthusiasm of GOP lawmakers filling the halls of the Capitol on Saturday.

“Did you hear all the hooting and hollering?” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), as rank-and-file lawmakers spilled out of a private strategy session. “The conference is pretty unified. Ready to fight on.”

A day earlier, it had seemed that the Republican Party’s far-right flank had exhausted its efforts after the Senate defeated its bid to halt federal funding for the healthcare law. Boehner remained largely silent and out of sight.

But the failed GOP effort in the Senate led by tea party Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) appeared only to energize the conservative flank in the House. Cruz held the Senate floor for more than 21 hours to denounce the law, also known as Obamacare, and encouraged his compatriots in the House to carry on the fight. More than 60 GOP lawmakers pledged their support of a one-year delay of the law.

With such overwhelming numbers, Boehner had few options but to embrace their strategy lest he loosen an already wobbly grip on his increasingly defiant GOP majority.

“He saw folks coalescing around a concept,” said Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), who led the effort to delay Obamacare in the House. “It’s one step at a time.”

Republicans see Tuesday’s launch of the healthcare law’s online marketplaces as one of their last chances to stop Obamacare, even though Senate Democrats appear united in their commitment to protect the president’s signature legislative accomplishment. The House bill would delay the marketplaces for a year.

Any delay in the healthcare law remains highly unlikely. Moreover, key aspects of the law are already underway.

The president said Friday that the marketplaces, where the uninsured will shop for policies, will open for business on Tuesday even if there is a federal shutdown. “That’s a done deal,” he said.

But the attempt to repeal the medical-device tax put some Democrats in a bind. More than 30 Democrats in the Senate and a similar number in the House have previously backed a repeal, including many from states with companies that make medical devices.

The 2.3% tax on devices other than such routine equipment as eyewear and hearing aids is expected to raise about $30 billion over 10 years to help pay for the Affordable Care Act.

However, key Democratic lawmakers said they would not agree to repeal the tax as part of the government funding bill. House

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said in a statement that the repeal effort was “a gift to the insurance companies by putting them back in charge of Americans’ healthcare.” Seventeen House Democrats voted for the repeal.

The difficulty Boehner had convincing Republicans to vote for any measure that does not fully end Obamacare was evident in the bill. It includes a provision that would allow employers that have religious or moral objections to contraception not to provide it on their company health insurance policies for employees.

Only one lawmaker, Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), publicly urged his colleagues in the meeting of House Republicans to keep in mind the “big picture.” But others privately worried about the political fallout over what they feared was the inevitable outcome, and hoped a last-minute resolution would emerge on Monday. In the end, all but two Republicans voted for the delay.

“If this is part of a process, fine. I’ll vote for it,” said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.). “But we can’t let the government shut down. If we do, we’ve just allowed people to hijack our party and the government.”

Here’s how it happened: In 1894 Pullman workers, facing wage cuts in the wake of a financial crisis, went on strike — and Grover Cleveland deployed 12,000 soldiers to break the union. He succeeded, but using armed force to protect the interests of property was so blatant that even the Gilded Age was shocked. So Congress, in a lame attempt at appeasement, unanimously passed legislation symbolically honoring the nation’s workers.

It’s all hard to imagine now. Not the bit about financial crisis and wage cuts — that’s going on all around us. Not the bit about the state serving the interests of the wealthy — look at who got bailed out, and who didn’t, after our latter-day version of the Panic of 1893. No, what’s unimaginable now is that Congress would unanimously offer even an empty gesture of support for workers’ dignity. For the fact is that many of today’s politicians can’t even bring themselves to fake respect for ordinary working Americans.

Consider, for example, how Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, marked Labor Day last year: with a Twitter post declaring “Today, we celebrate those who have taken a risk, worked hard, built a business and earned their own success.” Yep, he saw Labor Day as an occasion to honor business owners."

The company also acknowledged paying a longtime Bills friend, Marty O'Malley, $2.03 million as a Chicago consultant. Some of the money was likely intended for Bills, according to the findings, which said the arrangement will ""likely be considered bribery by the authorities,"" according to the company's report."

Now that the cuts are in effect, they may end up being a crutch to let Congress avoid making tough choices about where money should be spent and where it should be cut.

Sure, both parties continue to decry the across-the-board cuts, which primarily hit discretionary spending and do nothing to address the key causes of the country's long-term debt problem.

So while there may be attempts to replace the cuts over the coming weeks, don't be shocked if they fail and the cuts stay in place for the rest of the year.

Why? Agreeing on how to replace them may continue to prove too contentious and less of a priority than other fiscal issues.

Congress must pass a bill to keep the government funded past March 27, or the government will shut down all but essential services. Since a shutdown is anathema to both parties, priority No. 1 right now is to avoid one.

As if to stress that point, President Obama indicated on Friday that he would sign a new funding bill even if it doesn't replace the sequester, assuming the bill met other conditions.

And on Monday, House Republicans proposed a bill that would authorize continued funding but doesn't replace the spending cuts. Instead, it offers the Pentagon some flexibility in how defense cuts are executed.

Senate Democrats are also expected to propose a funding bill that doesn't replace the sequester.

So while the risk of a shutdown may be declining, ""the chance the sequester is here to stay is increasing,"" said Sean West, U.S. policy director for the Eurasia Group.

Technically, the House and Senate might try to replace the sequester in their proposed budgets for 2014, due in mid-April. But the chambers' proposals will be so far apart in size and substance that the chances of reconciling the two are very low.

There's another built-in opportunity to replace the sequester -- the upcoming debate over raising the debt ceiling.

But the drop-dead deadline for that may not come until August. At that point, the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will be almost over, and the overriding priority will be to avoid default.

So it may be that only political pressure would force a compromise on replacing the sequester, said budget expert Charles Konigsberg.

The public pitching a fit might work. So, too, might terrible economic numbers.

While everyone agrees the sequester is no way to run a budget, there seems to be growing resignation that maybe this is the best Congress can do."
