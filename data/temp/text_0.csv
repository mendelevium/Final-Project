21 states have laws similar to Florida%27s %22stand your ground%22

It allows people to defend themselves with force if they feel threatened in their space

Florida reviewed its laws%2C but made only minor recommendations

The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., raised fresh discussion of ""stand your ground"" laws.

The case centered around whether Zimmerman acted in self defense and drew national attention to Florida's law, which allows people to defend themselves with force if they feel threatened in their home, business, car, or a place where they ""have a legal right to be."" At least 22 states have a similar law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

While Zimmerman did not ultimately use the ""stand your ground"" defense in his case, Sanford police did not arrest him until almost two months after the shooting because of the Florida stand your ground rules that require police to have specific evidence to refute a self defense claim in order to arrest someone claiming self defense.

That provision of the law ""does a disservice to Floridians because it's so vague,"" said Florida Sen. Dwight Bullard, a Democrat, in an interview Sunday with CBS Miami.

The police initially did not have evidence to disprove Zimmerman's self-defense claim, said former Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, Jr.

It was not until the case drew national attention and a Department of Justice investigation that prosecutors found evidence to charge Zimmerman with second-degree murder. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund is urging Attorney General Eric Holder to undertake a review of the case and encouraging Trayvon Martin's family to pursue civil action against Zimmerman.

Last year, a Florida task force headed by the lieutenant government reviewed the state's ""stand your ground"" law, but in a final report, the task force only made minor recommendations that required no action from the legislature. No changes were made to the law this year.

""The liberal activists tried to use that tragedy (the shooting death of Trayvon Martin) as an opportunity to take our rights as Americans,"" said Florida House Speaker Rep. Will Weatherford, a Republican, on the attempts to change the state's stand your ground law. ""We stood our ground on Stand Your Ground.""

Across the country, at least 22 states have ""stand your ground"" laws, with varying degrees of requirements for when citizens may use deadly force to protect themselves. Before these new laws were put in place beginning in 2005, people who felt threatened outside their home were required to flee from an attacker before they were allowed to use force to defend themselves.

The new laws make clear, however, that if someone feels threatened either inside or outside their home, they do not have to run away and are legally justified in using force to protect themselves.

""If (my family and I) are walking through the mall and someone attacks us, I should not have to retreat. I should be able to defend myself in any place or forum that I need to,"" said Florida Rep. Carlos Trujillo, a Republican, on Sunday in an interview with CBS Miami.

Some states just allow people to defend themselves in their homes or businesses, while others extend the law to cars or any place someone ""has a right to be."" Florida's law falls into this second category. (See chart)

The Zimmerman case drew national attention to the ""stand you ground"" laws, which were promoted by the National Rifle Association and the American Legislative Exchange Council through model legislation and advocacy.

In a study of ""stand your ground"" laws commissioned by the National Bureau of Economic Research, researchers found that in states with ""stand your ground"" laws, the number of homicides had significantly increased from the years before the law was enacted. They found that the provision that allows self-defense ""in any place a person has a legal right to be"" is the driver of the increase in homicides. The increase in homicides, they argue, negates the claim that these laws reduce crime.

Mitchell Professor At Georgetown University Law Center. He Is Also The Legal Affairs Correspondent For The Nation', 'A Regular Contributor To The New York Review Of Books.']",Don’t let DOMA fool you — the Supreme Court is restricting your rights,"David Cole is a professor of constitutional law and criminal justice at Georgetown University Law Center and a fellow at the Open Society Foundation.

The Supreme Court’s 5 to 4 decision to strike down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act was undeniably historic, a victory not just for gay rights advocates but for anyone committed to advancing equal rights in America.

It was also an anomaly.

For all the celebration Wednesday — and who will forget the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washingtonsinging the national anthem outside the court? — the underlying theme of the Supreme Court’s term was not the recognition of rights, but their dilution. Time and again, in closely divided decisions on issues as disparate as antitrust law, privacy and discrimination, the court either watered down rights or made it difficult or impossible to enforce them effectively. (Unless, of course, you are a white college applicant challenging affirmative action.)

In two cases, the justices made it impossible for plaintiffs alleging serious violations of federal law even to have their claims heard. In Clapper v. Amnesty International, the court denied a constitutional challenge to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which vastly expanded the National Security Agency’s surveillance powers. This law authorizes the recently disclosed surveillance programs, which involve the interception of international e-mails, phone conversations and social-network communications. The act permits surveillance without having to show that the target is suspected of anything, thereby jettisoning the bedrock requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs in Clapper included lawyers, human rights advocates and journalists, all of whom communicated frequently with people overseas whom the government was likely to be targeting under the statute, and therefore had to take expensive and burdensome measures to preserve the confidentiality of their communications.

With a majority comprised of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs’ claims could not be heard because they could not show that they had actually been subjected to the surveillance. The catch: The surveillance is conducted in secret, so no one can be certain that he or she is subject to it.

In a second case, American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant , the same five justices ruled that corporations can insulate themselves from liability for violating federal law by inserting clauses in their contracts that prohibit class-action arbitration. A group of small merchants argued that American Express had violated antitrust laws by using its monopoly power to charge credit card fees 30 percent higher than those of its competitors. But American Express had used the same monopoly power to draft a form contract that directed all legal disputes into arbitration — and then forbade arbitration on a class-wide basis. The merchants argued that because antitrust claims are so expensive to prove, they are not worth pursuing on an individual basis and can be vindicated only through collective, class-wide proceedings.

The Supreme Court previously ruled that contracts may require arbitration rather than court litigation only if the arbitration proceeding provides an adequate forum for individuals to vindicate their rights. In Italian Colors, the court’s majority conceded that requiring individual arbitrations would make it too expensive to challenge American Express’s conduct, but, as Justice Elena Kagan paraphrased the majority’s response in her dissent: “Too darn bad.”

In three other closely divided decisions, the court’s conservative justices made equality rights decidedly harder to enforce. In Shelby County v. Holder, the court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required select states with a history of discrimination to clear any changes in their voting arrangements with the federal government ahead of time, by showing that the changes would not dilute the rights of minority voters. This preclearance requirement was the most effective part of the law because it prevented discriminatory actions from taking effect in the first place, rather than requiring victims to later sue in court, where challenges are often so expensive and time-consuming that they cannot adequately address many discriminatory voting practices.

The court previously upheld the preclearance requirement four times, but on Tuesday the conservative majority broke with years of precedent and concluded that the rights of states are more important than the equal voting rights of minority citizens.

In a pair of less-noticed decisions released the day before Shelby County, the court, once again by 5 to 4votes, issued employer-friendly, worker-hostile interpretations of Title VII, the section of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination in employment. In both cases, the court rejected long-standing interpretations of the law by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, the court imposed a more demanding standard on “retaliation” claims, brought when an employer responds to a discrimination complaint by punishing the employee for raising the issue.

And in Vance v. Ball State University, the court narrowed the definition of “supervisors” under Title VII, thereby reducing employers’ responsibility for racial and sexual harassment in the workplace. Title VII says employers are more responsible for harassment from supervisors than from co-workers, and the EEOC had sensibly defined “supervisor” as a person with the authority to direct another’s daily work. But the court’s conservatives limited “supervisors” to those who have the formal authority to hire, fire, and grant or deny promotions, a much narrower group. The ruling means that victims of harassment by supervisors who lack such formal authority will be significantly less protected.

The justices also curtailed our rights against the police. In Maryland v. King, the court ruled that the state can take DNA samples from arrestees without a warrant or any basis for suspicion. It reasoned that DNA samples, like fingerprints, are taken for identification purposes, not to investigate a crime, and so don’t have to meet the “individualized suspicion” standard that applies to investigatory searches. But as Justice Scalia pointed out in a dissent joined by Justices Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, DNA samples are not taken to identify arrestees but to investigate whether they are responsible for some other crime.

The practice of taking DNA samples, if strictly limited to identifying characteristics and not used to determine an individual’s genetic traits, may seem reasonable enough, as the intrusion is minor. But allowing sweeping searches without individualized suspicion runs contrary to the court’s long-standing Fourth Amendment rules.

Meanwhile, in Salinas v. Texas, the court’s conservative majority ruled, paradoxically, that Americans’ right to remain silent won’t be protected unless they speak up. The court decided that if someone refuses to answer potentially incriminating questions, it’s perfectly permissible for the state to use that refusal in a criminal trial, as long as the questions were asked outside the trial or an interrogation in custody. The result is that individuals who believe they have a right to remain silent (having been so informed by countless television shows) and exercise it will be punished for doing so.

Of course, the high court was not uniformly hostile to individual rights. In addition to striking down the Defense of Marriage Act’s limits on federal marriage benefits, it also gave a partial victory to Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who challenged the University of Texas’s affirmative action plan; in that case, the court compromised, concluding that the lower courts had not subjected the university’s plan to sufficient scrutiny, and sent the case back for further review. But of course that ruling, issued in the name of equal protection, actually limits efforts to remove barriers for minorities.

The larger pattern is clear: This term, the Roberts court regularly favored restricting people’s rights or, more insidiously, limiting their ability to enforce those rights.

Almost all these rulings were 5 to 4 decisions, most divided along familiar ideological lines. The close votes reflect the fact that there were reasonable arguments to be made on both sides. But courts play an essential role in safeguarding individual rights, and in this term, the Supreme Court repeatedly did the opposite. Congress could, of course, fix many of the problems through legislation — but leaving the protection of individual rights to a polarized and partisan institution offers cold comfort.

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']","ObamaCare in Trouble? Exchange provision delayed, as lawmakers push to repeal another","Parts of ObamaCare are starting to fray, even before full implementation.

The Obama administration now says a special system of exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses to provide insurance will be delayed an entire year -- to 2015.

""Lots of small businesses struggle with providing insurance for their workers so this was supposed to facilitate it and make it easier for small business to do this,"" said Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. ""It was a huge portion of the sale job. When they passed the law in 2010 there were many senators and members of Congress who were saying 'I am doing this because it's going to help small businesses.'""

The exchanges were designed to give workers a range of choices supported by dollars from their employers. But now they will have only one choice until 2015, which could mean they can't shop for insurance that includes their current providers. Capretta said the administration is ""way"" behind schedule.

Since insurance is more expensive for small businesses, many of which have no obligation under the law to provide coverage, analysts now fear many might just stop trying and let workers go on the soon-to-be-launched state exchanges.

More On This... Delays and Denials Threaten Obama Health Law

Sara Teppema of the Society of Actuaries -- which did an exhaustive study of ObamaCare -- said that ""even if it's just a small change of people who are leaving the employment-based insurance and coming into the individual insurance market, their costs and their numbers will overwhelm those who are currently uninsured.""

That means costs would increase.

Meanwhile, 79 senators including several liberal lawmakers recently voted to repeal a new tax on medical devices contained in the health care law following a similar vote in the House.

""The House and the Senate agreeing? This is a harmonic convergence, it doesn't happen,"" said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ""But on this it's happened because the adverse consequences to our economy and the quality of health care are so apparent.""

The two separate votes have not become law but show widespread opposition to the 2.3 percent sales tax on medical devices. Critics say the law is unfair to the industry since it's a tax on gross sales -- meaning it adds up to a much bigger percentage of a company's profits.

But supporters such as Paul Van de Water of the Center for American Progress oppose any repeal.

""I think that repealing the device tax would be irresponsible. We need the revenue and it's not going to be a job killer,"" he said.

The theory was that ObamaCare would insure 30 million more people and that device makers, like pharmaceutical companies, would get lots of new customers and a steady stream of new revenue to make up for the tax. Van de Water predicted that would still happen.

""These device manufacturers are for the most part going to be getting a large increase in business thanks to health reform, thanks to ObamaCare,"" he said.

But the CEO of one company said that's not true for the 7,000 small companies with 400,000 employees who make a wide range of devices.

Christine Jacobs of Theragenics said: ""We make widgets -- hips, knees, stents, pacemakers, and implants, even, for prostate cancer. Those widgets tend to be used by people that are elderly. As the body parts wear out, we're needed.""

But Jacobs notes that most people whose body parts wear out are already on Medicare, so ObamaCare does not provide a new revenue stream for her company -- only financial pain.

""In the case of a small company, that medical device tax is equal to our R-and-D budget for this year,"" Jacobs said.

Bayh said in his own state of Indiana, one company planned to open up to five facilities over the next five years but had to scrap those plans because of the ""uncertainty created by this tax.""

Jacobs said the huge multinational device makers might be able to handle the burden but not the small companies.

""It's just such a disproportionate burden for little guys,"" she said. ""Because we're all being told that it's the little companies that create the jobs. And that's not message that we're getting.""

The tax will even be applied to sutures used on pets that Theragenics developed for the veterinary market.

She sought FDA approval to demonstrate the quality of her products. But now she said ""it's hard for me not to get frosted on this one"" -- she explained that whoever wrote the regulations said ""if you have FDA approval, you will be taxed.""

President Obama has vowed to veto any repeal of the tax, but Bayh notes that 79 votes in the Senate would be more than enough to override any veto."

Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and other Representatives pushing for immigration legislation that would legalize the status of America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants.

In a public statement that will be released Thursday morning but has been provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release, USCIS Council president Kenneth Palinkas warned that Goodlatte (pictured), House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-VA), House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) seem to be following the same pathway that Senate “Gang of Eight” members did, regarding how they are working on immigration legislation.

“At every step, this administration places obstacles and roadblocks in front of our adjudication officers in their attempts to protect our nation’s security and the American taxpayer,” Palinkas said. “I documented these abuses on more than one occasion with the authors of Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven [S. 744] only to have them ignored.

“I worry the House may be following a similar path. Media reports reveal that Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman Paul Ryan, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are working to advance proposals to open citizenship benefits to the majority of those here illegally, in combination with proposals to expand visa programs.”

Palinkas warned, too, that any group of “step-by-step” House immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee, at which point they would be combined with the Senate bill and sent to the president for his signature, and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty. That is exactly what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Gang of Eight members Sens. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republicans have said they want to do.

“These plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency – USCIS – that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card, temporary visa and citizenship applications,” Palinkas said. “Advancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at USCIS would be to invite disaster.”

In his statement, Palinkas cited a recent MSNBC report where Gutierrez said he, Goodlatte, and others have worked on a “compromise” position. That MSNBC report also noted that Goodlatte and other Republicans are working with Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), another Democrat, on a plan to get to conference with the Senate bill. Palinkas stated that USCIS agents have been, like they were from the Senate conversations, excluded from all discussions among House leaders. “Why aren’t USCIS officers being consulted on this ‘compromise’ offer?” Palinkas asked.

He further expressed concern over Cantor’s GOP DREAM Act, tentatively called the KIDS act. “I am also worried about the arguments being used to support the KIDS Act, one piece of the wider citizenship plan being drafted,” Palinkas said. “Legislators, including Mr. Cantor and Mr. Goodlatte, have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens. But if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?”

He warned that the KIDS Act may lead down a slippery slope. “This seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries,” Palinkas asserted. “Should we just expect that the next Secretary at DHS will use the arguments we are hearing in the House to enact the next Deferred Action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty?”

Palinkas alleged that, under the Obama administration, USCIS has been riddled with nefarious activities. “At USCIS, our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics, and I hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the House,” he said.

He finished off his statement by listing several immigration issues he hoped House Republicans would address but have thus far not been willing to: “USCIS adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits. This includes the inability to conduct in-person interviews, the failure of our software system, the lack of training and office space, and pressure to rubber-stamp applications. We have become an approval machine,” “Failure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits,” “Administrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who, under law, are not properly eligible,” “Approval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them,” “A management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals, not US citizens and taxpayers, as the customer. We believe in treating all with respect and always will, but our agency’s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the American people.”

Goodlatte, Ryan, and Cantor are not the only Republicans still pushing to pass an immigration bill in the House of Representatives. According to the Miami Herald, Rep. Steve Southerland (R-FL) said about immigration: “We have to address it. It’s a moral issue.”

In addition, according to Politico, House GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said she thinks immigration should be a top priority for House Republicans this year.

This coming weekend on Univision, McMorris Rodgers will say that House Speaker John Boehner “over the last few weeks has continued to talk about the importance of the House moving forward on immigration reform. I believe that we have a window here between now and the end of the year and that this is a priority.”

McMorris Rodgers is the fourth highest-ranking member in the House GOP conference."

(CNN) —

The Obama administration finalized rules on Friday that allow religious-affiliated organizations opposing the use of contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control.

The mandates give women at nonprofit, religious-based organizations, like certain hospitals and universities, the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge.

The rules, which were first proposed in February and then open for comment through April, have undergone only minor changes. Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, deputy director for policy and regulations at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a call with reporters that the rules were “very similar” to the administration’s original proposal.

One of the few noticeable changes is the process by which insurance companies reimburse nonprofit religious organizations – such as nonprofit religious hospitals and institutions of higher education – that object to contraceptive coverage. This process, officials from HHS said, has provided more distance between the groups that disapprove of contraceptive use and the insurance companies that will be supplying contraceptives to their employees at no cost.

These slight changes, said one HHS representative, came after hearing from stakeholders during a public comment period this year. In total, more than 400,000 comments were sent to the department on the rule.

Objecting organizations and insurers will have until January 1, 2014, to comply with the new rules. This date was extended from August 1, 2013.

“The health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost,” Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a Friday news release. “Today’s announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other non-profit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage, while helping to ensure that women get the care they need, regardless of where they work.”

Since Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, administration officials have said the administration has attempted to work out how nonprofit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty.

In a news release about the finalized plans, administration officials say these final rules “strike the appropriate” balance.

In February, the health agency said that while it could not provide a final cost of the plan, offering free coverage would lower expenses over the long term, partly because of improvements in women’s health and fewer childbirths.

As part of the new rules, groups that are insured – such as with student health plans at religious colleges – would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage.

Because the insurer would be covering the costs, the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it.

Although many religious groups applauded the compromise, not everyone heralded it as a success.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said in February that it does not support the Obama administration’s proposals because they fall short of addressing concerns about religious freedom.

“Because the stakes are so high, we will not cease from our effort to assure that health care for all does not mean freedom for few,” Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the conference, said in a February statement. “We will continue to stand united with brother bishops, religious institutions, and individual citizens who seek redress in the courts for as long as this is necessary.”

Those calls of disapproval continued after Friday’s finalization of the contraceptive plans.

“This latest rule shows the administration is tone-deaf to religious freedom,” said Anna Higgins, director at the Family Research Council. “Family Research Council strongly opposes the latest regulation that continues to mandate that life-ending drugs and contraceptive services be covered, with no copay, by health plans of businesses and organizations that have serious moral and religious objections.”

Michael Hash, director of the Office of Health Reform for HHS, said the changes that were made took into account suggestions from religious organizations that objected to the rules.

“I think there is a much brighter line, simpler line, and we think that responds to the good many comments that we got,” he said.

An original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal health care law spearheaded by President Obama, the Affordable Care Act. It required that insurers provide, at no cost to those insured, all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Houses of worship were exempt immediately, and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations, like universities and hospitals.

That still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths – many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong – covered by the mandate. They denounced it as an infringement on religious liberty. A group of 43 Catholic organizations challenged the rules in federal court in May.

The administration had long defended the mandate, saying that it did not violate religious liberties.

The finalized proposal also clarified the definition of a religious employer.

Instead of using a multipart test that required an employer to show “religious values as its purpose” and to “employ persons who share its religious tenets,” the proposal followed the Internal Revenue Code’s definition that includes “churches, other houses of worship, and their affiliated organizations.”

After an uproar among religious institutions that didn’t want to pay for contraceptives, the Obama administration offered several alternatives in March 2012. These plans are a continuation of those efforts.

The issue of Obama’s health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot-button political issue during last year’s presidential race.

In August 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney released a television ad that attacked the Obama administration.

“President Obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion, forcing religious institutions to go against their faith,” the ad said. “Mitt Romney believes that is wrong.”

Although the ad did not specifically mention the contraception rule, a news release that accompanied the ad justified the “war on religion” claim using an editorial published in the San Antonio Express-News in February about the health care law’s rule on providing contraception.

The Guardian, via Reuters, file

Microsoft worked with the National Security Agency and the FBI to provide the agencies with the encryption workarounds they needed for access to Skype video calls, Outlook Web chats and email, and information stored on Microsoft's cloud-based SkyDrive, according to new information shared by NSA leaker Edward Snowden with the Guardian newspaper.

In the latest round of disclosures about data-gathering practices of law enforcement in a program known as ""Prism,"" Microsoft ""has collaborated closely with U.S. intelligence services to allow users' communications to be intercepted, including helping the National Security Agency to circumvent the company's own encryption, according to top-secret documents obtained by the Guardian,"" the newspaper reported Thursday.

The new files ""provided by Edward Snowden illustrate the scale of cooperation between Silicon Valley and the intelligence agencies over the last three years,"" the Guardian said.

Microsoft, in a statement to NBC News, did not address the encryption workaround specifically, but said, ""We only ever comply with orders about specific accounts or identifiers, and we would not respond to the kind of blanket orders discussed in the press over the past few weeks, as the volumes documented in our most recent disclosure clearly illustrate.

""To be clear, Microsoft does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to SkyDrive, Outlook.com, Skype or any Microsoft product.""

The company said when it upgrades or updates products, ""legal obligations may in some circumstances require that we maintain the ability to provide information in response to a law enforcement or national security request. There are aspects of this debate that we wish we were able to discuss more freely. That's why we've argued for additional transparency that would help everyone understand and debate these important issues.""

ACLU principal technologist Chris Soghoian told NBC News that the new revelations show that ""time and time again, companies that specifically advertise their services as privacy protecting have been forced to circumvent those privacy protections to enable the government to spy on their customers.""

Microsoft isn't the only technology company believed to be cooperating with the government to share data, but it is the first to have more details revealed since the initial disclosures last month by Snowden.

At that time, he said that Microsoft and other technology companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo and AOL were allowing the FBI and NSA to look at Americans' video, audio, photos, emails and other data files under what is known as the Prism program. Most of the companies, including Microsoft, have since requested government permission to share the information requests that have been made to them.

According to the information shared by Snowden with the Guardian, Microsoft ""helped the NSA to circumvent its encryption to address concerns that the agency would be able to intercept Web chats on the new Outlook.com portal.""

Microsoft completed the transfer of its 300 million Hotmail users to Outlook.com, a more modern webmail experience, in May. The NSA ""already had pre-encryption stage access to email on Outlook.com, including Hotmail,"" the Guardian said.

The Redmond, Wash.-based company ""also worked with the FBI's Data Intercept Unit to 'understand' potential issues with a feature in Outlook.com that allows users to create email aliases,"" the newspaper said.

Video-chat service Skype ""worked with intelligence agencies last year to allow Prism to collect video of conversations as well as audio,"" the Guardian said.

There have been concerns since Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 about what data the Redmond company is sharing with law enforcement. Last January, dozens of organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Digital Rights Foundation, sent an open letter to Microsoft asking how, when and why the popular video chatting program complies with government requests for information.

In March, Microsoft published a transparency report about Skype, and other of its services.

""Microsoft and Skype received a total of 75,378 law enforcement requests,"" the company said in the report. ""Those requests potentially impacted 137,424 accounts.

Chụp lại hình ảnh, Lon Snowden (bên phải) và luật sư của ông đã nói chuyện với các nhà báo

Luật sư cho hay ông Lon Snowden, cha của Edward Snowden, đã nhận được visa và sẽ sớm đi Nga thăm con trai.

Ông Snowden cha nói với kênh truyền thông ABC của Mỹ rằng ông mong muốn con mình trở về Mỹ với điều kiện hệ thống pháp lý được bảo đảm công minh trong trường hợp này.

Ông nói thêm rằng con trai ông ""đã nói lên sự thật"" và hy sinh nhiều thứ.

Edward Snowden đã được Nga cho tỵ nạn mặc dù Mỹ yêu cầu dẫn độ ông về nước để xử lý.

Lon Snowden đã xuất hiện với luật sư của ông là Bruce Fein trên kênh ABC.

Luật sư Fein nói về kế hoạch đi Moscow: ""Chúng tôi đã có visa, đã có ngày tháng nhưng chúng tôi không muốn tiết lộ vì sợ bị săn đuổi"".

Edward Snowden tới Moscow ngày 23/6 từ Hong Kong, sau khi rò rỉ thông tin về chương trình do thám mật của Mỹ cho báo chí.

Sau đó ông đã trải qua hơn 5 tuần ở khu quá cảnh sân bay Sheremetyevo, Moscow. Ông rời sân bay hồi tuần trước sau khi được Nga cho quy chế tỵ nạn tạm thời.

Luật sư Fein cho hay đã nói chuyện với luật sư Nga của Edward Snowden, Anatoly Kucherena, và được biết là ông Snowden vẫn an toàn.

""Tất nhiên anh ấy mệt mỏi. Anh ấy cần một thời gian để hồi phục và suy nghĩ xem anh ấy muốn làm gì.""

Xét xử công minh

Ông Lon Snowden thì nói rằng với tư cách một người cha, ông muốn con mình được về nhà, nhưng lo ngại liệu sẽ có một phiên tòa công minh hay không.

Ông nói: ""Vào thời điểm này, khi mà xem xét các phát biểu mà lãnh đạo chúng ta đưa ra... thì thấy là họ hoàn toàn vô trách nhiệm"".

Vụ Snowden đã gây ra hậu quả ngoại giao khá nặng nề, và Hoa Kỳ đã hủy cuộc gặp thượng đỉnh với Nga mà theo dự tính sẽ diễn ra vào tháng Chín này.

Quyết định của Nga cho Snowden tỵ nạn bị cho là đã làm tổn hại quan hệ vốn đã căng thẳng giữa hai bên.

Tuy nhiên, giới ngoại giao hai nước vẫn gặp nhau hôm thứ Sáu tuần trước để thảo luận một số vấn đề khác.

Edward Snowden là cựu nhân viên một công ty làm thầu cho Cơ quan An ninh Quốc gia Mỹ (NSA), và ông cũng từng làm việc cho CIA.

Hồi tháng Sáu, ông rò rỉ thông tin cho các báo Guardian và Washington Post về chương trình thu thập dữ liệu các cuộc gọi điện thoại và email của NSA."

USA TODAY

Justice's delay isn't necessarily justice denied for Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite entangled in the scandal that toppled former CIA director David Petraeus.

The Justice Department has asked for a 30-day extension, until Sept. 4, to respond to her lawsuit against the government for violating her family's privacy, rifling through her e-mails and leaking confidential information about her.

And Kelley is fine with the extension, says her lawyer, Alan Raul. The government says it needs the time to sort through the allegations in the 65-page complaint. It doesn't help, Justice Department lawyers say, that Pentagon employees have been furloughed because of sequestration.

""We are pleased that the federal government appears to be taking this case seriously, and is taking extra time to conduct its internal inquiry in response to this lawsuit,"" Raul said in a statement.

Kelley had been an unpaid social liaison to the military and had hosted parties for military officials, including Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, at her home on Tampa's Bayshore Boulevard. The headquarters of Central Command, which oversees military action in the Middle East, is a few miles away.

Petraeus' extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, was exposed after Kelley complained to the FBI about harassing e-mails she had received. Broadwell was behind them.

Allen's name also popped up in Kelley's e-mails.

That prompted then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to call for an investigation of Allen's relationship with Kelley to determine if there had been ""professional misconduct"" on his part. Allen and Kelley say there was nothing inappropriate about their relationship. The Pentagon inspector general agreed, although the Defense Department refuses to release its findings. USA TODAY and other news organizations have filed multiple requests for the report but have been denied.

Allen and Kelley exchanged 3,000 e-mails from July 2010 to July 2012, according to Rep. Jackie Speier, the California Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. She was briefed by the inspector general on the report but not shown the document. Of those e-mails, 41 were reviewed more thoroughly, Speier was told.

Speier wants Allen to divulge e-mails from his private account to Kelley. He refused to provide them to the inspector general, Speier said.

Kelley and her husband, Scott, want an apology and unspecified damages for what they say were willful leaks by federal officials of false and damaging information about them. Those officials should have been protecting them and their privacy, they say in their lawsuit.

""The Kelleys are trying to deter the government from violating the privacy rights of other Americans by calling attention to the government's profound over-collection of private e-mails and egregious leaking of confidential investigative material,"" Raul said."

Racism?,"











The following irresponsible police action reported by KHOU’s Rucks Russell should scare many. Here is the story as reported.

A young 13 year old dancer, Landry Thompson, came to Houston from Oklahoma. She travelled with her two dance instructors over the weekend. The intent of their visit was to train all weekend with some of the best in dance industry.

When they left the studio Saturday night they stopped at a gas station very exhausted as they searched for their lodging. They were trying to locate their hotel on the GPS. Out of nowhere they were surrounded by the Houston police.

The Houston police dragged them out of the car and handcuffed them all.

“I was kind of freaked out and surprised by it,” said Landry Thompson.

“They just pulled us out of the car. Put our hands behind out backs like we were criminals,” said Landry’s dance instructor Emmanuel Hurd. “He asked me; who is the girl? She is my student. I said I have a notarized letter from her parents stating that I have full guardianship over her while we are here.”

Landry Thompson and the instructors said they pleaded with the police and told the police their story repeatedly. It did not matter to the Houston police. Landry Thompson said, “They still put handcuffs on me. And it really scared me. And they put me in the back of the cop car. I was terrified.” Landry Thompson was taken to Protective Services.

“I was horrified. She was with the people I wanted her to be with. She was with people who were safe who I knew would take care of her,” said Her mother, Destiny Thompson. “Yet they had taken her away from those people and now she was in a shelter, wherever she was with people I didn’t know.”

Protective Services told Destiny Thompson that she would have to fly to Houston to get her daughter. After many phone calls with various officials, Landry Thompson was released back into the custody of her dance instructors.

“I would love an apology,” said Landry Thompson’s mother. “They owe her an apology.”

Soon after, the trio was back at the dance studio. They intend to leave Houston on Monday afternoon.

The Houston police (HPD) has not been responding to inquiries as to what happened.

Were Landry Thompson and dance instructors victims of stereotyping and racism?

Why did the Houston police believe they had to react as they did? Does it have anything to do with the young dancer being a young white girl and the two dance instructors being young black males? If the two instructors were white males would the police officers have reacted in the same manner? The dance instructors had notarized document detailing that they were the young girl’s guardian. What else were they expected to do to ensure they would not be treated like common criminals but the productive human beings they are?

Peters'],Senate Confirms Sri Srinivasan for Court Seat,"An alternative possibility is that a bipartisan group of senators could try to reach a deal on the filibuster themselves, that way averting a confrontation that would further strain the already distrustful relationship between the two parties.

Republicans have threatened to filibuster several Obama appointees. Among them: Gina McCarthy, the president’s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, on the ground that she was not forthcoming in responding to their written questions. (They sent her nearly 1,100.) The nomination of Thomas E. Perez for labor secretary is in peril because Republicans view his work as head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division as too political. They have vowed to block Mr. Obama’s pick to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, because they object on principle to the existence of such a bureau. And nominees to the National Labor Relations Board are meeting similar obstacles.

“There may be some that we really have a fight over,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, saying a drawn-out argument over nominations could do considerable harm to the Senate. “So that’s when we have to think this thing through,” he added, saying he would support reopening talks with Democrats over changing the rules on filibusters. “If it becomes a problem and we get hung up over cabinet nominees, yes, I’d be willing to.”

There does appear to be one bright spot for the administration: the nomination of Penny Pritzker as commerce secretary. Ms. Pritzker, a Chicago businesswoman who was a top fund-raiser for Mr. Obama, appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday and met little resistance from Republicans.

But even a relatively gentle confirmation process for Ms. Pritzker is unlikely to resolve the bigger differences between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans point out that they have approved the majority of Mr. Obama’s nominees. But the new lengths to which they have gone to slow down confirmation — including the first-ever filibuster of a defense secretary nominee and requests that nominees respond to hundreds of written questions — have made the process highly contentious.

Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said that after the Senate voted on immigration changes she would support efforts to broker a compromise on the use of the filibuster."

Thousands of Delta Sigma Theta sorority members descended on Washington for an annual convention. The sorority’s members including leading lights in the nation’s political, academic, business and entertainment sectors. Here are a few prominent Deltas.

President Obama has invited the president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority to the White House for a Tuesday afternoon meeting, ending months of hope and speculation by leaders of the nation’s largest African American sorority who have been gathered in Washington this past week for their 100th anniversary celebration.

White House spokesman Kevin Lewis confirmed that Obama will meet with Cynthia Butler-McIntyre. The conversation will come about two hours before an appearance at the convention by former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will speak during the second-to-last day of the convention, which has brought more than 40,000 members to the District.

Although sorority leaders said they are pleased that Obama will meet with Butler-McIntyre, many members had hoped that Obama would visit one of the largest conventions in D.C.’s history. Many members of the sorority expressed disappointment that neither the president nor first lady Michelle Obama would be making an official appearance.

On Monday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. spoke to the Deltas. In addition to talking about the recent Supreme Court ruling striking down parts of the Voting Rights Act, Holder spoke about the shooting of Trayvon Martin and subsequent trial and acquittal of the shooter, George Zimmerman.

“They suffered a pain that no parent should endure,” Holder said of Martin’s parents. Holder said the Justice Department has already launched an investigation as to whether or not Martin’s civil rights were violated.

The Rev. Al Sharpton and group of pastors from across the country held a news conference outside the Justice Department on Monday to announce that Florida will be the “battleground,” for a new civil rights movement.

The Deltas’ conference began last week and will continue through Wednesday. Events have included a step show, an ecumenical service, a social-action luncheon, a gospel concert and the dedication of a stained-glass window — depicting African American women — at Howard University’s Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel."

Gun control and gun rights advocates “talking past each other.”

Emanating from different cultures, incapable of agreeing on how to make us all safer from firearms.

Their opposite views were in full voice last week in the Legislature during a marathon 10-hour committee hearing — longest anyone could remember — on gun bills.

Unlike in Washington, where gun control forces couldn’t muster enough strength in the U.S. Senate to pass legislation expanding background checks, a state Senate committee in Sacramento approved eight bills to strengthen California’s already stringent firearms regulations.

Unfortunately, without universal background checks nationwide — not only in gun stores, which already is the law, but at gun shows and via the Internet — California is vulnerable to Wild-West dealing in other states.

Criminals and mental misfits can buy virtually any weapon they want at a Nevada or Arizona gun show and cart it into California, circumventing this state’s tough background checks.

Advertisement

Actually, in Washington there was solid majority support for expanding background checks — 55 Senate votes. But because of that chamber’s arcane rules born of undemocratic filibusters, the bill needed 60, or a 60% supermajority.

In Sacramento, where Democrats overwhelmingly rule, most gun legislation can be passed on a simple majority vote.

One exception is a bill to speed up the confiscation of guns from Californians who bought them legally, but later were disqualified because of a violent crime, a restraining order or mental illness. There are roughly 20,000 people possessing around 40,000 firearms who aren’t supposed to have them.

The bill, SB 140 by Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), requires a two-thirds vote in each legislative house. It would appropriate $24 million to hire enough agents to seize the weapons.

But despite opposition by the gun lobby — it objects to using money from background check fees paid by gun buyers — the measure has been sailing through the Legislature. It passed the Assembly 57-10 last week, with only Republicans voting “no.”

This bill, however, offers a clear example of political polarization in the Capitol.

Advertisement

Republicans proposed a perfectly sensible amendment that would have required all the illegal weapons to be confiscated in one year, rather than over three as mandated by the bill. Democrats quickly tabled the amendment, cutting off debate.

“If we’re going to be serious about dealing with felons with guns, then we need to take advantage of the money and make it a priority,” Assemblyman Donald Wagner (R-Irvine), the amendment’s author, told me.

“A lot of folks on my [GOP] side want to do something. They don’t want to just be saying ‘no.’ But they didn’t even let us debate….

“I won’t say it’s impossible to come together. And I won’t say one side is entirely right and the other is entirely wrong. But both sides need to get beyond their hardened positions of the past.”

Advertisement

Hardened positions, however, dominated the long meeting of the Senate Public Safety Committee. Republicans followed the gun lobby in opposing every measure. Democrats passed all of them on party-line 5-to-2 votes.

“There’s a difference between opposing every bill and your saying, ‘We would support it if you did this or that,’ ” Steinberg, a Democrat from Sacramento, finally vented to gun lobbyists. “It would help your credibility.”

The committee approved bills to:

•Prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles that hold detachable magazines. SB 374, Steinberg. The senator called them “mass killing machines.”

Advertisement

• Ban even the possession of magazines holding more than 10 rounds. They’re already illegal to buy. SB 396, Sen. Loni Hancock (D-Berkeley).

• Require ammunition buyers to pass a background check and obtain a license. SB 53, Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles).

Advertisement

• Add repeated alcohol and drug offenses as reasons for denying gun ownership. SB 755, Sen. Lois Wolk (D-Davis).

• Require long gun purchasers to pass a written safety test. That’s already required for handgun buyers. SB 683, Sen. Marty Block (D-San Diego).

Advertisement

These and other bills passed by the committee perhaps could use some expert tweaking — even gutting — and the gun lobbyists are experts. But they’re such inflexible hard-liners that Democrats ignore them.

Just as intransigent were scores of citizens who lined up to emotionally argue for gun rights. They repeatedly voiced two familiar mantras: Gun control laws are unconstitutional because of the 2nd Amendment. And the laws don’t stop gun violence, they only harass innocent law-abiding citizens.

Advertisement

“My rights are protected by the United States Constitution and not affected by an L.A. Times poll,” protested one tea party member, referring to a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll that found overwhelming support for stricter gun controls.

Countering the constitutional argument, Steinberg quoted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in a 2008 opinion that affirmed the right of individuals to own firearms. “Like most rights,” Scalia wrote, “the right secured by the 2nd Amendment is not unlimited….

Advertisement

“The right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”

As for badgering law-abiding citizens, Steinberg noted that four killers in the last five mass shootings had no prior criminal records. And the fifth had been guilty only of a minor offense.

Murderers often are law-abiders until they’re not — until they shoot their wife or get fired and mow down former co-workers.

Also testifying were long lines of gun control advocates, including trauma surgeons and mothers, some of whom had lost children to gun fire.

Yes, these gun combatants are living in parallel universes. And so are Sacramento and Washington. Too bad they can’t figure out how to fire in sync at the same enemy: gun violence.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back Tuesday against calls to put out more information on the committee's investigation into the controversy, sparked after a Treasury Department Inspector General report revealed the IRS had singled out tea party groups applying for nonprofit status for extra scrutiny. Responding specifically to criticism from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democratic member of the committee, Issa said that releasing full interviews conducted with IRS employees would hurt the ongoing investigation.

""Your decision to publicly announce that the investigation should wrap up was irresponsible, but not surprising,"" said Issa, in a letter to Cummings. ""However, your push to release entire transcripts from witness interviews while the investigation remains active was reckless and threatened to undermine the integrity of the Committee’s investigation.""

The position is a tenuous one for Issa, who during an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" just over a week ago promised that the full transcripts would be released. On that same program, Issa revealed several partial transcripts that suggested the directive to screen tea party groups came from officials in Washington.

Since then, The Huffington Post has sent four emails asking Issa's office when the full transcripts would be made public. Not one was returned. When asked why Issa's release of a partial transcript was fine but he opposed releasing the transcripts in full, a spokesman for the congressman referred HuffPost to another statement.

“Limited releases of testimony may also serve to empower other witnesses to become whistleblowers and serve to vindicate individuals who have been subjected to criticism or retaliation at the hands of their managers,"" said Issa, in that statement. ""On the other hand, if a full transcript were released, it would serve as a roadmap of the Committee’s investigation.""

It could take weeks, if not months, to see the full transcripts should the committee wait to release them until the investigation is completed. According to a Democratic aide on the committee, investigators have interviewed five IRS employees so far and have 18 more to go. In addition, investigators are hoping to look through hundred of thousands of documents that could shed light on the tax agency's controversial screening practices.

Unwilling to allow the partial transcripts Issa released to be the only evidence in the public record, Cummings this week also released segments of interviews. In a Sunday memo to his colleagues on the oversight committee, the congressman said that a manager in the IRS Cincinnati office who oversaw the nonprofit screening said that no one in Washington ordered him to employ the practice of targeting tea party groups.

""Although the Committee interviewed a self-identified ‘conservative Republican’ who denied any White House involvement or any political motivation for screening Tea Party cases, Chairman Issa now appears to be going back on his promise to release the full interview transcripts of IRS employees,"" said Cummings, in a statement. ""Chairman Issa changes his mind so fast that even when I agree with him, we’re not on the same page. I fully support responsible oversight, but cherry picking transcript excerpts to fuel partisan and unsubstantiated claims is not a credible or effective way to investigate.""

On Tuesday, an aide to Cummings said the congressman would release the full transcripts of the already completed interviews by the end of the week, if Issa did not do so himself -- though the aide also cautioned that those plans could change.

The squabbling between the chairman and ranking member of the oversight committee has made the conversation surrounding the scandal far more contentious. When news first broke that the IRS had targeted conservative groups, there was near bipartisan condemnation of the agency.

Over time, however, politics has entered the debate, and Issa's handling of the committee's investigation has been criticized as a poorly disguised attempt to tie the issue to the president.

When Issa called White House Press Secretary Jay Carney a ""paid liar"" earlier this month, he was criticized publicly by Democrats and privately by his own party. More recently, Republicans have been more open in their concerns about where the investigation is heading.

As Politico reported on Tuesday:

Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana, a senior Ways and Means Republican who chairs the panel’s Oversight subcommittee, criticized Issa’s tactics, saying the release of partial transcripts could “adversely alter our ability to get future information from other IRS employees.” “Just simply from a process standpoint, you don’t want to do that and alter what others might say,” Boustany told POLITICO. “I really am concerned that it could tip this into the political realm rather than a true detailed investigation to get the facts out.” He added: “A lot of this has to be done quietly, obviously, as we piece together what has happened, and once we piece it together and get the firm proof, then you can come out” and say what happened.

Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) suggested Sunday that the IRS' targeting of conservative groups during the 2012 presidential campaign undermines the election's credibility, accusing President Barack Obama's administration of ""blatantly lying to the American people"" and questioning whether the agency would ""deny"" health care coverage for conservatives.

“We learned that during an election, [Obama] interfered with the First Amendment rights of conservatives and tea party members by intimidating and harassing these organizations,” Bachmann, who unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, said in an interview with conservative website World Net Daily. “Once again, it appears the Obama administration is blatantly lying to the American people... People can right ask questions [about] the credibility of the elections.""

On Friday, the IRS admitted to engaging in ""inappropriate"" targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election. Agents singled out groups with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status, as well as organizations that took issue with ""how the country is being run.""

Bachmann said agency claims that no high-level officials were involved with developing the criteria for extra scrutiny are ""laughable.""

“The Obama administration wants us to believe low-level functionaries are the ones responsible for making this decision,” she said. “That is impossible, laughable. I can tell you within the IRS, the agency is very sensitive of jurisdictional authority.""

The Republican congresswoman pointed to the IRS' role in the implementation of Obama's signature health care reform law as another potential area for concern, claiming that it is ""reasonable"" to ask whether the agency will ""will deny or delay access to health care"" for conservatives.

""We learned to our horror in Benghazi it appears that every move that was made was based on politics,"" she said. “Now it appears the president was willing to use the most feared agency in the U.S. for his own political purposes.""

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) also tied the IRS scandal to the Affordable Care Act.

""[Obama] has a huge problem, because Obamacare relies very heavily on the IRS,"" Gingrich said during a Monday appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""Why would you trust the bureaucracy with your health if you can't trust the bureaucracy with your politics?"""

It now appears likely that the response, offering the committee any factual corrections or broader judgments, will be delayed until Mr. Brennan’s arrival.

Because Mr. Obama famously said he preferred to look forward, not back at his predecessor’s counterterrorism programs, the Senate report is by far the most thorough examination of how the United States came to use nudity, cold, sleep deprivation, stress positions, wall-slamming and waterboarding, methods it had long condemned as abuse or torture.

Mr. Brennan will have to decide whether to support making a redacted version of the interrogation report public, as the committee is likely to support after the C.I.A. completes its review and as a United Nations human rights adviser urged this week. Several Democratic senators and at least one Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was tortured as a prisoner in North Vietnam, have said that a declassified version must be released, and Mr. Brennan said he would give the request “serious consideration.”

He will have to decide whether to convene what the agency calls an accountability board to recommend punishment for current or former officials accused of mismanaging or misrepresenting the interrogation program. If he tries to keep the peace by dismissing the dispute as history and a distraction from the agency’s current challenges, he will face strong resistance from the Senate committee’s Democratic majority and Mr. McCain.

But Emile A. Nakhleh, a former top C.I.A. analyst on political Islam who once worked for him, said Mr. Brennan’s work as Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, intimate knowledge of the agency and blunt style equip him well to handle the task.

“It will be challenging, but if there’s any person who can take this on, it’s Brennan,” Mr. Nakhleh said. “He may say some harsh things about the program, and some people won’t like it. But the institution will benefit.”"

The ""quid pro quo,"" according to the report, potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million.

The allegations are highly unusual, though are already being disputed by congressional Democrats. Perez is not a favorite of congressional Republicans, and the charges could impact his pending confirmation hearing -- scheduled for this Thursday.

The report, obtained in advance by Fox News, claimed Perez in February 2012 ""manipulated"" federal law as assistant attorney general and ""pushed the limits of justice to make this deal happen.""

Both cases involved the city of St. Paul. The 67-page report states that the Justice Department's decision to opt out of the whistleblower cases potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million -- the amount the government could have won had it pursued damages in the case.

More On This...

But, according to the report, the Justice Department stayed away from that case in order to get the city to drop an appeal to the Supreme Court on another matter. The department was allegedly concerned that the high court, in the course of reviewing that case, would strike down a major element of civil rights enforcement.

""Perez simply could not allow the Court to rule,"" the report said. ""Perez sought leverage to stop the city from pressing its appeal.""

The case the Justice Department was allegedly concerned about was St. Paul's appeal to the Supreme Court, on a case in which property owners said the city made extraordinary efforts, through strict code enforcement, to condemn their properties.

The owners said reducing the amount of affordable housing for minorities violated the federal Fair Housing Act -- by what is known as ""disparate impact.""

Perez appeared to think the Supreme Court overturning the case would have been a severe blow to civil rights enforcement, the report concluded.

The ""disparate impact"" provision, which the report described as legally questionable, prohibits housing policies that end up discriminating against certain groups even if those policies are not blatantly discriminatory.

""Perez sought, facilitated, and consummated this deal because he feared that the Court would find disparate impact unsupported by the text of the Fair Housing Act,"" the report said.

The other end of the alleged deal was for the Justice Department not to get involved in cases against the city of St. Paul that alleged the city received millions in Department of Housing and Urban Development funds -- including stimulus money -- but failed to file the requisite paperwork regarding the hiring of low-income workers.

In that case, which also involved the city of Minneapolis, plaintiff Thomas Newell got neither the backing of the agency nor the Justice Department and lost the case, which if won would likely have resulted in the cities repaying tens of millions in damages.

The Obama administration has acknowledged that senior Justice Department attorneys recommended intervening in the case and characterized the False Claims Act infractions reported by Newell as ""particularly egregious.""

However, they thought the case would be ""quite weak and never should have been a serious candidate for intervention,"" according to the report.

The Justice Department claims everything was above board -- and that the department held three staff briefings, heard 24 hours of additional testimony and reviewed 1,400 pages of documents before deciding not to intervene.

""The litigation decisions made by the department were in the best interests of the United States and were consistent with the department's legal, ethical, and professional responsibility obligations,"" the department said in a statement.

Former Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler also questioned the use of the term ""quid pro quo"" to describe what happened.

""It's such a loaded term,"" she said. ""I think in fact you have almost everybody agreeing nothing inappropriate happened.""

The report -- subtitled ""How Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez manipulated Justice and Ignored Rule of Law"" -- was a joint effort by minority leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Republican-led House's Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees.

""The facts surrounding this quid pro quo show that Perez may have exceeded the scope of the ethics and professional-responsibility opinions he received from the department and thereby violated his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to the United States. Perez also misled senior Justice Department officials about the quid pro quo,"" the report states.

But congressional Democrats put out a statement and memo of their own late Sunday refuting the details.

The statement said the ""overwhelming evidence"" indicates Perez and others ""acted professionally to advance the interests of civil rights and effectively combat the scourge of discrimination in housing."" They said the decision not to intervene in the suit against St. Paul was based on expert recommendations.

""Instead of identifying inappropriate conduct by Mr. Perez, it appears that the accusations against him are part of a broader political campaign to undermine the legal safeguards against discrimination that Mr. Perez was protecting,"" they said."

WASHINGTON -- Moderate Democrats working to gather support from Republicans for comprehensive immigration reform sent an ultimatum Friday to Speaker John Boehner: introduce a bill by Sept. 30 or they'll introduce their own.

""[W]e are frustrated that there was not a bipartisan immigration reform bill introduced prior to the August recess,"" reads the letter from 39 members of the New Democrat Coalition, a 53-member group, including co-chairmen Reps. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.).

""Therefore, we write to inform you that if a bipartisan immigration reform package is not introduced in the House of Representatives -- one that includes a pathway to citizenship, helps grow American jobs, and fixes our immigration system once and for all -- by September 30th, we as New Democrats will consider introducing a comprehensive immigration reform bill,"" the letter continues. Read the letter here.

Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has said he will not bring up any immigration bill -- particularly the one that passed the Senate in June -- unless a majority of House Republicans support it. Democrats and pro-reform activists think they could get the 218 votes needed for passage of comprehensive immigration reform, if Boehner would allow for a vote, by keeping most Democrats and winning over some Republicans.

Members of Congress leave town Friday for the August recess, a month-long break during which they will hear from constituents. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking closer to primaries and the 2014 election year.

Democrats have said immigration reform should include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but many Republicans have said it's a no-go. Instead, House Republicans are pursuing a number of smaller bills, such as border security legislation. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) are working on a bill to legalize undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children, but there aren't GOP-led efforts to deal with their parents. A seven-member bipartisan group in the House is working on comprehensive legislation with a path to citizenship, though it has not yet come to a final agreement on legislative language.

The New Democrat Coalition letter says Boehner ""can rely on"" its members for support if he brings up a bill with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

“We have the support of the American people,"" it concludes. ""We hope we can count on your support."""

(CNN) —

Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to President Barack Obama for putting him in a tough position that led to Obama’s announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage, senior administration officials said Thursday.

Obama said in an interview that aired Thursday on ABC that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after Biden’s weekend remark that he was “absolutely comfortable” with letting gays and lesbians marry.

Two senior administration officials said Biden and Obama met Wednesday morning, and Biden apologized for putting Obama in a tough spot. Obama responded by saying that he knew Biden was speaking from the heart, said the officials, who didn’t want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president.

Biden’s remarks on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday launched a controversy that led to Obama announcing that his position on same-sex marriage, which he had previously called “evolving,” had shifted to support. When Obama’s full interview aired Thursday, he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of Biden’s comments.

“I had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention,” Obama said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Biden “probably got out a little bit over his skis, but out of generosity of spirit,” he said.

He added that he would have “preferred to have done this in my own way, on my own terms,” but “all’s well that ends well.”

Separately, Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said Obama “has been the leader on this issue from day one, and the vice president never intended to distract from that.”

Once Biden’s comments drew attention to the issue, Obama made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the ABC talk show “The View,” a senior administration official said Thursday. The president and his advisers knew Obama would be asked about the issue in the wake of Biden’s NBC interview, said the official, who didn’t want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions.

Ultimately, they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the ABC interview at the White House, the official said. And a top Democrat told CNN that Obama knew the issue would come up at the convention, partly because of a push for support for same-sex marriage to be included in the Democratic Party platform, and in debates.

Multiple top Democrats told CNN the president’s senior aides are annoyed with Biden for forcing the conversation on same-sex marriage now. One source said Biden has, in the past, counseled the president against coming out for same-sex marriage, making this move that much more frustrating.

But the sources said they don’t believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders. Biden is known to go off-script, something Obama knew when he selected his vice president.

In explaining to ABC how his position has evolved, Obama noted that his daughters Malia and Sasha have “friends whose parents are same-sex couples. It wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be treated differently. And frankly that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective, not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law.”

Asked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year, Obama said it would “be hard to argue that somehow this is something that I’d be doing for political advantage. Because frankly, you know, the politics – it’s not clear how they cut.”

The interview aired the same day Obama attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles, where support for same-sex marriage is strong. Movie star George Clooney hosted the event, which is raking in $15 million, according to a top Democratic source. And on Monday, openly gay singer Ricky Martin is hosting a fundraising event for Obama in New York.

But some in the African-American community have expressed strong disapproval of Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage. A Democratic official said the White House has been actively reaching out to African-American community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president’s decision, but the official noted that even the president’s base won’t always agree with him on everything. “There are going to be issues you don’t agree on,” the official said.

And Obama told ABC he won’t spend much time talking about the issue, because he’s focused on the economy. The announcement puts Obama squarely at odds with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has since reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage.

“And I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,” Romney said during a Wednesday visit to Fort Lupton, Colorado. “My view is the domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate, but that the others are not.”

The issue is a divisive one in American politics, but it’s uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth.

A Gallup Poll released Tuesday indicated 50% of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid, with 48% saying such marriages should not be legal – a dramatic shift from a few years ago. A Gallup poll in 2009 found 40% supported same-sex marriage and 57% were opposed.

But a CNN/ORC International poll, taken in late March, indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people’s opinions of the most-important issues facing the country.

Obama said he supports states deciding the issue on their own, but added that he was “disappointed” by Tuesday’s vote on the issue in North Carolina, where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the constitution. Obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians, a spokesman said earlier Wednesday.

Six states – Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York – and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union.

In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June, but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state’s same-sex couples to wed as of January 1, and state residents may vote to affirm such a law.

Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina, while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice, one from California and another from Massachusetts, could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/01/21/Why-Bibi-Is-Not-Intimidated-by-Obama,2013-01-21 00:00:00,['Shmuley Boteach'],Why Bibi Is Not Intimidated by Obama,"I’m sure Jeffrey Goldberg got it right. Whatever the reason the President leaked his unhappiness with Bibi to Goldberg just a few days before the Israeli election–whether in an effort to influence the vote against Bibi, serve payback to Bibi for a perceived preference for Romney, or because the President could simply no longer suppress his dissatisfaction–it must indeed be unnerving to be the most powerful man on earth and have the elected leader of a tiny Middle Eastern country defy you. Especially when that country, in your opinion, owes you so much!

You are their only reliable friend who watches helplessly as that little nation continues to isolate itself through its self-destructive policies. According to Goldberg, Obama has “become inured to what he sees as self-defeating policies of his Israeli counterpart…Obama said privately and repeatedly, “Israel doesn’t know what its own best interests are… Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.”

If only Israel would recognize the President’s genius. If only it would stop building in Jerusalem and E1 and allow the President to sprinkle his magic peace dust, then Hamas would beat its rockets into ploughshares and Hezbollah would turn its bombs into pruning hooks. But no. Ungrateful to the last, Bibi insists on disobeying the President and claiming all of Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capitol.

No doubt the President is likewise mystified at the Israeli people as well. How could the polls show that they will this week re-elect the intransigent Prime Minister who is doing so much to harm their country? The most powerful man on earth is reduced to watching from the sidelines and complaining to journalists that he knows how to protect Israel far better than the Israelis themselves.

Such an ungrateful nation.

And yet, perhaps the Israelis have finally figured out that they are a sovereign people whom, while immensely grateful to America for its friendship and support, are still best qualified to judge their security needs better than anyone else. Perhaps they have come to understand that another Democratic president named Bill Clinton, whom noone would argue has a sincere love of the Jewish people and a Jewish son-in-law, still pushed Israel into the Oslo agreements that left a thousand Israeli civilians blown to bits. Perhaps they have come to understand that if Chuck Hagel, President Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, was correct that, as a legislator from Nebraska he was “not an Israeli senator. I’m a United States senator,” then the Prime Minister of Israel is the likewise the leader of the Jewish state who must put the security of the Israeli people even before a nod of approval from the President of the United States.

Over the past four years Bibi has grown into one of Israel’s greatest ever leaders. The country is booming economically and in terms of security. Cranes dot the skyline of expanding Israeli cities, terror incidents are negligible compared to the Clinton era, and unlike the anemic American economy, Israel is humming along at about four percent annual growth. And if President Obama is right that, in spite of this prosperity, Israel is isolated in world opinion, then it is arguably no more so than it has been in the past, and, besides, what is better, a popular Israel riddled with dead Jews or an unpopular Israel filled with living ones?

But what President Obama does not understand about Netanyahu is that the inflexibility he accuses him of is born not of a narrow-minded obstinacy but rather of a confident Jewish pride and deep-seated conviction that has been Bibi’s lifelong hallmark.

In my desire in 1990 to launch a robust response to anti-Israel speeches at the Oxford Union, I booked Netanyahu to lecture at the University. Bibi, just 41 years old, had already electrified the world as Israel’s most capable defender at the UN. Bibi agreed to come with a single stipulation: “If I’m already making the trip, then work me like a horse.”

We obliged.

We picked him up in a special branch police car and as we drove through the grandeur of Oxford’s ancient center, he commented on the majesty of British academia and its incongruence with some of the petty anti-Israel sentiment that is often expressed within its halls. Arriving at St. Antony’s College for a private forum with Oxford Middle East experts, Bibi put one foot on a chair and for the next 90 minutes held forth on the justice of Israel’s cause, surrounded as it was by nation’s sworn to its destruction. As he finished, the attacks came in fast and furious in what had to be one of the most hostile audiences he ever addressed. He did not blink, he did not flinch, he did not bend. When the last question ended, he turned to me to ask what next. After two more speeches, we took him to my home where we had arranged a dinner with Rhodes Scholars, many of them Jewish, most critical of Israeli policy. This time Bibi was softer in presentation but just as firm in conviction. Israel was a righteous nation, focused on maintaining democracy and human rights while facing existential threats on nearly every border. He spoke to the students of their responsibility to be proud defenders of their people and never bend in the face of opposition. The climax of the day was a lecture at the Union itself. Palestinian and Jewish protesters rallied outside in their hundreds with the rallying cry: “Net-an-ya-hu you should know, we support the P-L-O.” Bibi left his security bubble and walked over to the protesters. “Come inside and listen. Then you can protest. I’ll answer every question you ask.”

Many left their barricades and joined the large crowd inside. What followed was one of the great speeches I have heard, a mesmerizing presentation of the need for democracy across the Middle East and the liberalization of Arab governments that deny their citizens their God-given human rights. At its high point Bibi said, “Many of us in Israel have buried children and lost brothers, in fulfillment of a simple dream for Jews to finally live and prosper in a country of their own in peace.” He did not have to mention whom he was referring to as even his detractors knew of Entebbe and the hero-brother he had lost.

Again he was bombarded with hostile questions. He responded patiently but forcefully. When he finished he was given a standing ovation by most of the students in the hall. It was a night few of us would forget.

No Israeli Prime Minister has ever been as American as Bibi. And yet no Prime Minister has so successfully resisted the pressure from the leader of a country he loves so much for a country he loves even more. And the Israeli people, in supporting Bibi regardless of the absence of a stamp of approval from President Obama, are finally realizing that Israel cannot ultimately be protected from Washington but Jerusalem, especially when the current American Administration is not in step with the strong sympathy of the American people for a tiny and just nation fighting for its life.

Inquiry, With Eye on White House","WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans, not resting with the Internal Revenue Service scandal, are moving to broaden the matter to an array of tax malfeasances and “intimidation tactics” they hope will ensnare the White House.

Republican charges range from clearly questionable actions to seemingly specious allegations, and they grow by the day. On Friday, lawmakers sought to tie the I.R.S. matter to the carrying out of President Obama’s health care law, which will rely heavily on the agency. Whether they succeed holds significant ramifications for Mr. Obama, who will soon know if he is dealing with a late spring thunderstorm that may soon blow over or a consuming squall that will leave lasting damage.

Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, the usually mild-mannered chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, set the tone Friday at Congress’s first hearing on the targeting of conservative groups by the I.R.S., laying out details, from the alleged threatening of donors to conservative nonprofit groups to the leaking of confidential I.R.S. documents.

In that context, he said, the screening of Tea Party groups for special scrutiny was not the scandal itself but “just the latest example of a culture of cover-ups — and political intimidation — in this administration.”"

She Has Written Two Books', 'Demon Fish', 'Travels Through The Hidden World Of Sharks', 'Fight Club Politics']","IRS targeted groups critical of government, documents from agency probe show","At various points over the past two years, Internal Revenue Service officials singled out for scrutiny not only groups with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names but also nonprofit groups that criticized the government and sought to educate Americans about the U.S. Constitution, according to documents in an audit conducted by the agency’s inspector general.

The documents, obtained by The Washington Post from a congressional aide with knowledge of the findings, show that the IRS field office in charge of evaluating applications for tax-exempt status decided to focus on groups making statements that “criticize how the country is being run” and those that were involved in educating Americans “on the Constitution and Bill of Rights.”

The staffers in the Cincinnati field office were making high-level decisions on how to evaluate the groups because a decade ago the IRS assigned all applications to that unit. The IRS also eliminated an automatic after-the-fact review process Washington used to conduct such determinations.

Marcus Owens, who oversaw tax-exempt groups at the IRS between 1990 and 1999, said that delegation “carries with it a risk” because the Cincinnati office “isn’t as plugged into what’s [politically] sensitive as Washington.”

Owens, now with the firm Caplin & Drysdale, said that before the agency’s most recent reorganization, it had a series of “tripwires in place” that could catch unfair targeting, including the fact that the IRS identified its criteria for special scrutiny in a public manual.

View Graphic A report due this week says the IRS targeted groups with names containing “tea party” and “patriot.”

“There’s no longer that safety valve, and as a result, the IRS has been rolling the dice ever since,” said Owens, who worked at the agency for nearly a quarter-century and now represents some organizations seeking tax-exempt status.

The IRS came under withering attack from GOP lawmakers Sunday. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican, described the practice as “absolutely chilling” and called on President Obama to condemn the effort.

“This is truly outrageous,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” adding that even though White House spokesman Jay Carney has said the matter deserves an investigation, “the president needs to make crystal clear that this is totally unacceptable in America.”

In March 2012, then-IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, told Congress that the agency was not targeting conservative groups. On Sunday, the agency declined to answer questions about whether senior officials asked IRS exempt organizations division chief Lois G. Lerner and her staff in Cincinnati about this heightened scrutiny before testifying it did not take place.

“There has to be accountability for the people who did it,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” adding: “And, quite frankly, up until a few days ago, there’s got to be accountability for people who were telling lies about it being done.”

The appendix of the inspector general’s report — which was requested by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and has yet to be publicly released — chronicles the extent to which the IRS’s exempt organizations division kept redefining what sort of “social welfare” groups it should single out for extra attention since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. That decision allowed corporations and labor unions to raise and spend unlimited sums on elections as well as register for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, as long as their “primary purpose” was not targeting electoral candidates.

The number of political groups applying for tax-exempt status more than doubled in the wake of the Citizens United ruling, forcing agency officials to make a slew of determinations despite uncertainty about the category’s ambiguous definition.

Of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny, according to the congressional aide, 72 had “tea party” in their title, 13 had “patriot” and 11 had “9/12.” Lerner, who apologized Friday for the targeting of such groups, described it as a misguided effort to deal with a flood of applications for tax-exempt status. She did not release the names of the groups.

On June 29, 2011, according to the documents, IRS staffers held a briefing with Lerner in which they described giving special attention to instances where “statements in the case file criticize how the country is being run.” She raised an objection, and the agency adopted a more general set of standards. Lerner, who is a Democrat, is not a political appointee.

But six months later, the IRS applied a new political test to social welfare groups, the document says. On Jan. 15, 2012, the agency decided to look at “political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding Government, educating on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, social economic reform movement,” according to the appendix in the IG’s report.

The agency did not appear to adopt a more neutral test for 501(c)(4) groups until May 17, 2012, according to the timeline in the report. At that point, the IRS again updated its criteria to focus on “organizations with indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention (raising questions as to exempt purpose and/or excess private benefit.)”

Campaign reform groups have been pressing the IRS for several years to conduct greater oversight of nonprofits formed in the wake of the Citizens United case, given that many have become heavily involved in elections. “But this isn’t the type of enforcement we want,” said Paul Ryan, a senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center. “We want nonpartisan, non-biased enforcement.”

Loyola Law School professor Ellen Aprill, who specializes in tax law, said any groups that have applied for tax-exempt status has “opened themselves up to scrutiny” by the IRS. “It’s part of their job to look for organizations that may be more likely to have too much campaign intervention,” she said. “But it is important to try to make these criteria as politically neutral as possible.”

Aprill said one of the problems is the agency’s top officials have not provided clear enough guidelines on what constitutes too much political activity for a social welfare group because it’s been “a hot potato,” and that now with this new controversy, “it’s going to make it even more difficult to do so.”

Toby Marie Walker, president of the Waco Tea Party, said the IRS subjected her group to a series of unreasonable requests after it applied for tax-exempt status in June 2010. The requests came in early 2012, Walker said, after being initially informed by an official in the Cincinnati field office that he was “sitting on a stack of tea party applications and they were awaiting word from higher-ups as to how to process them.”

The agency asked the group’s treasurer to supply information on its “close relationship” with current candidates and elected officials as well as future candidates, along with detailed information about its contributors and members. It also asked for transcripts of any radio interviews its officials had done and hard copies of any news articles mentioning them.

“That would take me years to do,” Walker said, noting that in some cases, Chinese media outlets referred to her organization. “Am I responsible for every news article across the globe?”

The group had even more difficulty providing transcripts and details of speakers at its events, since they hosted informal gatherings such as “rant contests” where anyone could come and express their views.

While the IRS awarded the Waco Tea Party tax-exempt status about six weeks ago, Walker said the group was now considering suing the agency since the process not only consumed time and effort but prompted the group to scale back its 2012 get-out-the-vote operation. “We were afraid to do it and get in trouble,” she said.

Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Tea Party Express, said that even though the agency’s actions intimidated tea party adherents, he gives the IRS “credit for standing up and admitting” it targeted them. And while only two of the agency’s officials — the commissioner and the chief counsel — are political appointees, Russo said the administration needs to conduct better oversight.

“The culture is set at the top,” Russo said. “Obviously you can’t control what every employee does. But you have to set a standard, particularly with the IRS, to be squeaky clean.”

The result may be an already embattled IRS that faces even more criticism, and an inspector general risking a compromised reputation.

J. Russell George’s May report about the IRS’s treatment of conservative groups led to public outrage, agency apologies, congressional hearings, a Justice Department probe and several dismissals, including the forced resignation of acting commissioner Steven Miller by the White House.

But Democrats are now questioning the Treasury inspector general’s audit in light of the new IRS documents, which show that terms such as “progressive,” “health care legislation” and “medical marijuana” appeared on a multipart “Be on the Lookout” list, or BOLO, that helped agents determine which groups deserved additional screening.

In a June 26 letter to the inspector general, Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.) said: “There is increasing evidence that the May 14, 2013 audit was fundamentally flawed and that your handling of it has failed to meet the necessary test of objectivity and forthrightness.”

George’s spokeswoman, Karen Kraushaar, fueled that notion when she told the Hill newspaper that the office of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) asked the inspector general to “narrowly focus on tea party organizations.”

Issa’s office has denied it made such a request.

Kraushaar has walked back her remarks, telling The Washington Post, “The statements attributed to me in The Hill are not accurate.” She did not say the article misquoted her.

“Several members of Congress shared their concerns about tea party organizations” with the inspector general’s office, Kraushaar said in an e-mail. “However, the focus of our audit was on the IRS’s consistency in its identification and review of applications for tax-exempt status involving potential political advocacy issues.”

George, appointed to his position in 2006 by President George W. Bush, said in a letter to Levin that his office “reviewed all cases that the IRS identified as potential political cases and did not limit our audit to allegations related to the Tea Party.”

The inspector general testified before Congress last month that his office was unable to determine whether any cases in the audit involved progressive groups. He said the names “in many instances were neutral, in that you couldn’t necessarily attribute it to one particular affiliation or another.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), whose questioning prompted that response, said in a recent letter to George that his testimony was “at best incomplete, if not misleading.” He also suggested that George should appear again before the House Oversight Committee to “explain himself.”

There is little doubt that the IRS erred in its review of tax-exemption applications.

Acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel, whom President Obama appointed to lead the agency after Miller’s resignation, said in a conference call with reporters last week that the screening methods were inappropriate.

But, Werfel added, his agency’s 30-day internal review had “not found evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the IRS or involvement in these matters by anyone outside the IRS.”

The BOLO could still be problematic for the IRS. The list’s “emerging issues” category included only conservative-associated terms at the outset, raising questions about why the IRS prioritized conservative groups but not those from the political left.

The term “progressive” appeared in a separate part of the BOLO, and questions remain about when and how that term was used, as well as whether those separate BOLO categories were even relevant to the audit. The IRS and George’s office have said they’re still looking into those matters.

The BOLO also directed agents to flag tea party cases for further review while allowing processors to approve other types of groups “on merit if applicable.”

George’s audit focused primarily on the “emerging issues” category as part of an effort to help identify groups involved in possible campaign intervention — something that can potentially disqualify an organization from tax-exempt status.

George has said the IRS did not use progressive criteria to identify groups involved in campaign intervention.

“We are reviewing whether these criteria led to expanded scrutiny for other reasons and why these criteria were implemented,” his office said in a statement last week.

Republicans have downplayed the recent revelations about “progressive” search criteria.

“Our Democratic colleagues should stop trying to derail the investigation by defending IRS officials with distorted claims equating the systematic scrutiny of Tea Party groups with the more routine screening progressive groups received,” Issa said.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) said the IRS controversy goes beyond the issue of search terms to the inappropriate questions agents asked of conservative groups and alleged leaks of private taxpayer information.

“At this point, the evidence shows us that conservative groups were not only flagged, but targeted and abused by the IRS,” said Camp spokeswoman Sarah Swinehart. “As we gather the facts, we will follow them wherever they lead us.”"

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/19/karl-rove-irs_n_3302754.html,2013-05-19 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],"Karl Rove Talks IRS Scandal, Compares His Group To NAACP","WASHINGTON -- Karl Rove on Sunday defended his group Crossroads GPS, a 501(c)4 non-profit organization, against charges that it improperly benefited from a tax exemption intended for social welfare organizations.

Rove said liberal organizations had first exploited the loophole, which has garnered attention in the wake of news the IRS scrutinized applications for tax-exempt status from small tea party groups.

""501(c)4s have been around for a long time and the Democrats and the left have used these for years to do some politics and a lot of social welfare,"" Rove said on ""Fox News Sunday,"" listing the NAACP, the Sierra Club and Planned Parenthood as groups that serve a social welfare function and still engage in political activity. ""You have to spend a majority of your money on social welfare and a minority of your resources on political activity.""

Rove, a career political strategist, raised hundreds of millions of dollars during the 2012 election and spent them on political advertisements designed to influence the presidential and congressional races. Rove's Crossroads GPS is one of hundreds of essentially political organizations that receive tax-exempt status designed for ""social welfare"" groups.

While many have called for reforms to the law allowing such groups to receive tax breaks, Rove insisted that the exemption is justified, and that organizations that support the Democratic Party have been working the statute longer.

""What happened is the Democrats had this for decades, for literally decades, and no criticism at all. Then Republicans began in 2010 to say, wait a minute, if it's good enough for them, we'll duplicate that structure as well. Then suddenly we get what we get, which is a huge bunch of activity aimed at conservative groups.""

The Bush administration probed the NAACP's tax-exempt status between 2004 and 2006, and ultimately allowed the group to maintain its classification.

Rove's organizations do not provide the counseling, legal assistance and other support functions that the NAACP provides on civil rights.

Federal agencies frequently target smaller players who may be abusing the system to avoid lengthy legal battles with more prominent companies or organizations. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) on Sunday criticized the IRS for targeting small Tea Party groups while allowing bigger fish, like Rove's Crossroads GPS, to pass through with little scrutiny.



""It's outrageous that the IRS went after these small tea party groups when Karl Rove is out there saying that he wants to use these groups to change the outcome of the election,"" Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said on ABC's ""This Week."""
http://news.yahoo.com/surveillance-critics-face-obama-oval-office-234633724.html,,[],Surveillance critics face Obama in Oval Office,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Struggling to salvage a massive surveillance program, President Barack Obama faced congressional critics of the National Security Agency's collection of Americans' telephone records Thursday as snowballing concerns made new limitations on the intelligence effort appear increasingly likely.

Obama and Vice President Joe Biden joined lawmakers on both sides of the issue for an Oval Office meeting designed to stem the bleeding of public support and show Obama was serious about engaging. Among the participants were the NSA's most vigorous congressional supporters — the top Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate intelligence panels — alongside its most stern critics, including Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado.

The lawmakers departed the rainy White House grounds without speaking to reporters. But in interviews later, they said there was a consensus that the surveillance efforts are suffering from perception problems that have undercut trust among the American people.

""There is openness to making changes,"" said Rep. C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, top Republican on the Senate's intelligence panel and a strong NSA defender, said Obama and the lawmakers didn't agree to take specific steps but brought up a number of proposals that will be fleshed out over the August congressional recess.

""A lot of ideas were thrown out,"" Chambliss told The Associated Press. ""Nothing was concluded.""

Wyden, in an interview, said he and Udall had sought to convince Obama of the urgency of addressing rising concerns. He said he proposed strengthening the government's ability to get emergency authorization to collect an individual's phone records, so that pre-emptive collection of everyone's records would no longer be necessary.

""I felt that the president was open to ideas — and we're going to make sure he has some,"" Wyden said after returning to Capitol Hill.

Story continues

Wyden and two Senate colleagues also unveiled legislation Thursday to overhaul the secret federal court that oversees the programs, which critics decry as largely a rubber stamp. The senators aim to make the court created under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, more adversarial by creating a special advocate who could argue for privacy during closed-door proceedings and appeal decisions. A companion bill would diversify the court's bench by ending the chief justice's sole authority to pick its judges.

""These bills do not compromise national security, but they put a necessary opposing view in the FISA court and assure ideological diversity of judges,"" said Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. Another of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the Obama administration was receptive to the ideas, although White House officials declined to comment.

Debate over the line between counterterrorism and invasion of privacy has been heating up since former government contract systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked classified documents exposing the NSA's monumental capability to sweep up data about phone and Internet use, including programs that store years of phone records on virtually every American. Snowden's revelations have prompted a national rethinking over government surveillance powers that have grown since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Russia decided on Thursday to grant temporary asylum to Snowden, who has been in a Moscow airport hotel for more than a month, despite America's insistence that the fugitive be sent home to face prosecution on espionage charges.

In Washington, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he stressed to Obama the role Congress must play in ensuring that U.S. spying isn't infringing on Congress' intent or on civil liberties. He said his committee would further probe the issue, including in a classified hearing he's hoping to hold in September.

Extending its efforts to defend the programs to the public, the White House pledged to help Americans understand as much as possible about how they work, even as it staunchly defended their efficacy in keeping a post-9/11 America safe.

""That process will continue,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""But I don't think that we can sensibly say that programs designed to protect us from terrorist attack are not necessary in this day and age.""

The more information about the programs the government has released, the more it has fed even greater concerns about the scope of the surveillance and whether Obama's national security team has been truthful in describing it publicly in the past.

After the administration on Wednesday declassified more documents about an email mining program, Wyden said they showed the government had ""repeatedly made inaccurate statements to Congress"" about the effectiveness in countering terrorism. And new details released about the phone records program created new fodder for critics by confirming for the first time that, when investigating one suspected terrorist, the government can also examine records of people who called people who called the targeted individual — netting millions of people's records in a single request.

Meanwhile, the head of the NSA openly clashed with lawmakers including Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., over the agency's statements that telephone and email data collection helped foil 54 terror plots.

Rising tensions have stoked concern at the White House that surveillance programs Obama considers crucial will soon be undermined or even dismantled — despite the fact that many Democrats and Republicans in Congress have come to the NSA's defense.

Leahy, the Judiciary Committee chairman, has threatened to seek to end the phone records program if it's not proven effective. And Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., signaled Thursday that unless an agreement is reached on releasing more of the secret court's opinions, he would push Congress to use its ""power of the purse"" to compel their disclosure by withholding funding for certain programs.

Even some staunch advocates for a tough national security stance have become outspoken critics, including Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who helped write the USA Patriot Act but now says the phone records collection goes far beyond what he envisioned and may not be renewed. Sensenbrenner was among the lawmakers who shared concerns in the session Thursday with Obama and top officials, including Biden, National Security Advisory Susan Rice and White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler.

The White House also was spooked by a House vote last week to dismantle the program, which failed by a narrow 217-205 margin.

On Tuesday, the presidential inaugural committee announced that it had invited the Rev. Louie Giglio, head pastor of Passion City Church in Atlanta, to participate in the Jan. 21 ceremony. Soon afterward, the liberal website ThinkProgress posted excerpts and an audio file of a sermon Giglio gave in the mid-1990s, in which he criticizes homosexuality as profoundly antithetical to Christianity.

“You come to only one conclusion: Homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation,” Giglio said in the sermon. “It is less than God’s best for us, and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us is sin. That’s God’s voice.”

After having courted the gay and lesbian community during his first term with efforts like the elimination of the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, the president’s inclusion of Giglio, 54, in the inauguration quickly proved awkward. The Obama administration is already fending off criticism from some on the left over negative remarks made by secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel in 1998 about a gay diplomat.

No one answered the phone Thursday at Passion City Church, whose ministry focuses on young people. But on the church’s website, Giglio wrote that after discussions between his team and the administration, he had decided to withdraw from the inauguration so as not to become a distraction.

“The issue of homosexuality (which a particular message of mine some 20 years ago addressed) is one of the most difficult our nation will navigate,” Giglio wrote. “However, individuals’ rights of freedom, and the collective right to hold differing views on any subject is a critical balance we, as a people, must recover and preserve.”

Typically, clergy members asked to participate in presidential events undergo rigorous vetting, but mistakes occasionally occur, said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.

The Obama inauguration committee appeared to acknowledge the slip. “We were not aware of Pastor Giglio’s past comments at the time of his selection and they don’t reflect our desire to celebrate the strength and diversity of our country at this inaugural,” said spokeswoman Addie Whisenant. “Pastor Giglio was asked to deliver the benediction in large part for his leadership in combating human trafficking around the world.”

Gay rights activists praised Giglio’s departure. Evangelical groups condemned it. A rising star in the evangelical community, Giglio did not disavow the sermon, which represents the way many conservative Christians view homosexuality. For the last two decades, American Christianity has been divided, sometimes acrimoniously, over growing societal acceptance of gays and lesbians and what certain Old Testament verses say about same-sex interactions.

The country’s increased religious diversity, Green said, can make choosing clergy for an event like the inauguration exceedingly delicate.

“The symbolism is very important when clergy are involved in a presidential ceremony,” Green said. “Different kinds of clergy are invited to show that the president has support from and supports the religious diversity of America. You have to assemble a good program now that might not offend somebody. But because we have faith-based disagreements in America, that’s not easy to do.”

Over Memorial Day weekend that all changed.

It is fairly obvious that the media used the three-day weekend to gather themselves, talk to the White House, and coordinate talking points with one another. The result of this coordination has been apparent in the words “overreach,” “McCarthyism,” “disarray,” and “no GOP agenda” — all being uttered simultaneously across media platforms that are supposed to compete, not coordinate, with one another.

The idea is for the media to revert to form. Rather than seek the truth, the media will go back to attacking those seeking the truth. Obama’s approval rating is going down, his left-wing agenda and legacy are in jeopardy, and the bleeding must be stopped.

Another piece of coordination between media and Democrats reared its ugly head today in the most expected of places: Politico. No one takes more glee in savaging private citizens who dare not support Obama than Obama’s bullying thugs at Politico.

During Tuesday’s testimony, Congressional Democrats attacked the private citizens brought before them to tell their individual horror stories. The witnesses were Tea Party groups and other conservative groups put through months of paralyzing harassment by an IRS that had intentionally singled them out based on their political beliefs.

Democrats, however, did not care about the fact that these groups had been targeted, and they kept insinuating that these groups deserved the IRS scrutiny due to their political activity.

Well, that is not the point and everyone knows it. Had the IRS put the same number of left-leaning groups through the same hyper-scrutiny as they did right-leaning groups, none of this would be happening. There would be no scandal.

But the idea here is to change the subject from the fact that the IRS singled out Obama’s political foes for paralyzing scrutiny in the run-up to Obama’s re-election campaign, to the supposed abuse of a tax exempt status by conservative political groups.

The thinking goes that if Democrats can make the Tea Party look like tax cheats it will take the heat off of Obama and further damage his opponents.

Well, right on cue, Politico arrives this morning like the cavalry with an appallingly dishonest (but expected) piece of reporting that falls right in line with what Congressional Democrats did yesterday. It is as pure a piece of coordination and left-wing propaganda as you will ever read.

And this is the only kind of investigative reporting Politico ever does. Imagine if Politico poured these same resources into investigating the IRS’s connections to the White House or the shaping of the IRS talking points by the State Department.

But today’s Politico piece is all about changing the subject. All it looks at is the political activity of yesterday’s Tea Party witnesses in order to make a case that they deserved scrutiny from the IRS.

The Politico piece, however, intentionally ignores the fact that this is not the point of the scandal. The point is that these groups were singled out for harassment by their own government.

The Politico piece intentionally ignores and chooses not to report on all the political activity of tax-exempt left-leaning groups (like Obama’s Organizing for America) — groups approved by the IRS, that are every bit as political as those on the right who were paralyzed by lengthy and intrusive questionnaires and threats of perjury-those who had their information leaked to the media.

Working directly with the Democrats, Politico is now putting in overtime to desperately steer subject away from and distract from partisan horrors committed by the IRS.

The actual crime is no longer the story, according to Politico. No, the story is that the victims had it coming.

Miller. However, Miller’s term as acting IRS Commissioner was up in a couple of weeks, and it is presently unclear whether he was forced to resign or was simply granting notice that his term was up.

Obama will face reporters on Thursday to answer questions about the IRS scandal that placed nearly 500 conservative organizations in the IRS’s crosshairs during the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Beyond the classic question, “What did the Administration know and when did it know it?”, a myriad of questions remain unanswered. Here are just a few:

Who inside the IRS hatched the plan to target conservatives and what, if any, connections do they, their associates, or superiors have to the Obama White House, campaign team, or other political organizations? Who at the IRS leaked confidential tax documents to the progressive-leaning journalism group ProPublica, an action which the IRS official manual says can result in up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000? Who are the two “rogue” individuals disgraced former IRS Commissioner Stevens said went “off the reservation” and acted “overly aggressive” and what, if any, connections do they have politically? If, as the Inspector General report alleges, political motivations were not driving the targeting of conservatives, then what was? Also, what “discipline” did the two rogue agents receive? Did IRS agents coordinate with Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) or his staff to “go after them [conservative groups],” as he told the New York Times, following Levin’s letters to then-IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman and Director Lois Lerner? Did Sen. Max Baucus (D-MO) or his staff communicate or coordinate with IRS agents after Baucus wrote this September 28, 2010 letter instructing then-Commissioner Douglas Shulman to have his “agency survey major 401(c)(4), (c)(5) and (c)(6) organizations to determine whether they are acting as conduits for major donors advancing their own private interests”? What communications took place between IRS agents and the following senators and their staffs following the delivery of this jointly written letter demanding the IRS crack down on “abuse of the tax code by political groups focused on federal election activities”: Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO ), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Sen. Al Franken (D-MN)? What communications existed between Obama reelection campaign co-chair Joe Solomonese, whom the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) alleges received its confidential tax returns, and IRS agents? What portion of Obama’s 79% increase in audits of charities were of conservative groups? If political motivations were not driving the selective targeting of 500 conservative organizations, then why were a similar number of liberal groups not harassed? What role did IRS Rulings and Agreements Division Director Holly Paz, who in 2008 donated $2,000 to Obama, play in ratcheting up IRS investigations, as she promised she would in June 2012?

Whether reporters will ask and Obama will answer the critical questions that must be resolved remains to be seen."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/21/fbi-under-pressure-to-explain-drone-use-as-obama-names-new-director/,2013-06-21 00:00:00,[],"FBI under pressure to explain drone use, as Obama names new director","As President Obama nominates a new FBI director, the bureau is coming under rising pressure from lawmakers to explain the limits of its recently disclosed drone fleet.

Civil liberties-minded senators on both sides of the aisle have fired off sharply worded letters and statements in recent days criticizing the FBI for deploying surveillance drones without clear guidance on how to protect privacy rights.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the latest to scrutinize the bureau, sending a letter on Thursday to outgoing Director Robert Mueller asking a string of questions about his agency's drone use.

""I am disturbed by the revelation that the FBI has unilaterally decided to begin using drone surveillance technology without a governance policy, and thus without the requisite assurances that the constitutional rights of Americans are being protected,"" Paul wrote.

Mueller acknowledged Wednesday, during a Senate hearing, that the bureau has a limited number of drones that it uses for surveillance on U.S. soil. He stressed they are used in a ""very, very minimal way and very seldom."" Newly released documents show that the FBI has sought and received permission from the FAA at least four times to fly surveillance drones inside the U.S. since 2010.

The use of non-lethal drones for surveillance purposes is rapidly getting off the ground among local law enforcement agencies and other groups. Mueller, in acknowledging that the FBI, too, has obtained surveillance drones, said the bureau is in the ""initial stages"" of drafting rules and regulations for their use.

Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., took umbrage at that fact, saying that while drones have the potential to help law enforcement agencies, constitutional rights must come first.

""I am concerned the FBI is deploying drone technology while only being in the 'initial stages' of developing guidelines to protect Americans' privacy rights. I look forward to learning more about this program and will do everything in my power to hold the FBI accountable and ensure its actions respect the U.S. Constitution,"" he said in a statement.

The FBI clarified on Friday that its drone use is governed by existing bureau regulations and FAA rules. It confirmed that the specific drone model is the PUMA AE, manufactured by California firm AeroVironment. The model is hand-launched, battery-powered and can send live color and thermal video to its operator, according to the company. It is designed to respond to disasters and other incidents.

The issue is likely to follow Obama's new nominee to lead the FBI, Jim Comey. Obama nominated the former federal prosecutor on Friday.

Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who originally asked Mueller about the drone program, also wrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday seeking ""clarification"" regarding a prior response from the department that did not disclose the FBI's drones. He, too, asked Holder to explain when the FBI began using them, what checks are in place for the program and whether any are capable of being armed.

FBI spokesman Paul Bresson clarified earlier this week that the aircraft are only used in ""very limited circumstances to support operations where there was a specific operational need.""

He cited an example of a hostage situation in Alabama earlier this year where a drone helped law enforcement. He said they are only used to conduct surveillance ""on stationary subjects."" And the bureau must obtain FAA approval first."

Senate GOP leader holds up targeting of Tea Party groups by IRS as example

He blames Obama administration for pitting bureaucrats vs. Americans

Remarks made in speech to American Enterprise Institute

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who accused the Obama administration of Nixon-style dirty tricks last year, said Friday that the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups is part of a broader government assault on free speech.

McConnell, R-Ky., seized on the spate of controversies besetting the White House, saying Americans are recognizing a pattern of attack on First Amendment rights across government agencies, the administration, President Obama's congressional allies, left-wing groups and public-employee unions.

""As serious as the IRS scandal is, what we're dealing with here is larger than the actions of one agency or any group of employees,"" McConnell, who is up for re-election next year, said in a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""This administration has institutionalized the practice of pitting bureaucrats against the very people they're supposed to be serving, and it needs to stop.""

Speaking to the same organization last year, McConnell accused the administration and Obama's re-election campaign of leaking tax information and maintaining an enemies list in a chilling style reminiscent of President Richard Nixon, the Republican who resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal.

In the first six months of Obama's second term, the administration's problems have produced an assortment of political targets for Republicans. One is the IRS affair, which has resulted in resignations and departures from the agency. No evidence has come to light that anyone in the Obama administration outside the IRS was involved in targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.

Other issues facing the Obama administration this year include government surveillance of phone and Internet records; its handling of last year's terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans; the Justice Department's seizure of phone records of journalists at the Associated Press and, in another case, reading the e-mails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

McConnell referred to the IRS episode with a bit of I-told-you-so.

""When I warned about all this last year, I got slammed by the usual suspects on the left. They said I was full of it,"" he said. ""But even some of them now seem to realize that just because McConnell is the one pulling the alarm doesn't mean there isn't a fire. The IRS scandal has reminded people of the temptations to abuse that big government, and its political patrons, are prone to. People are waking up to a pattern here.""

In comments certain to appeal to Republican voters, McConnell described public sector unions as power hungry and able to expand their reach with the help of congressional friends. He said the unions no longer serve the public's interest but rather the government's.

""There's no better illustration of this than the announcement this week that in the midst of congressional hearings into their activities, unionized employees at the IRS are about to get $70 million in bonuses,"" McConnell said.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said this week that the IRS plans to hand out $70 million in bonuses to employees. Under a contract with the employees' union, IRS workers can receive individual performance bonuses of up to $3,500 a year.

In response to Grassley's criticism, the agency said it's under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union. The agency and the union say they are in negotiations over the matter.

McConnell used the speech to deliver a forceful defense of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, which lifted many restrictions on corporate spending in political elections."
http://news.yahoo.com/snowden-mass-surveillance-making-us-less-safe-124458045.html,,[],Snowden: mass surveillance making us less safe,"MOSCOW (AP) — Former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden says surveillance programs used by the United States to tap into phone and Internet connections around the world are making people less safe.

In short video clips posted by the WikiLeaks website on Friday, Snowden said the NSA mass surveillance he revealed before fleeing to Russia ""puts us at risk of coming into conflict with our own government.""

Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the U.S. over the leak, described the techniques as ""dragnet mass surveillance that puts entire populations under sort of an eye that sees everything even when it's not needed.""

""They hurt our economy. They hurt our country. They limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and to associate freely,"" Snowden said.

The videos are the first of Snowden speaking since July 12, when he was shown at a Moscow airport pleading with Russian authorities to grant him asylum, which they did on Aug. 1.

That decision has strained the relations between the U.S. and Russia. President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Vladimir Putin at a summit hosted by Russia in September.

Snowden said the U.S. government was ""unwilling to prosecute high officials who lied to Congress and the country on camera, but they'll stop at nothing to persecute someone who told them the truth.""

In a note accompanying the videos, WikiLeaks said Snowden spoke on Wednesday in Moscow as he accepted the Sam Adams Award, given annually by a group of retired U.S. national security officers and named for a CIA analyst during the Vietnam War who accused the U.S. military of deliberately underestimating the enemy's strength for political purposes.

Four former U.S. government officials who were at the ceremony told The Associated Press on Thursday that Snowden is adjusting to life in Russia and said they saw no evidence that he was under the control of local security services. They refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living."

Prior To That', 'She Ran Coverage Of Local Politics In D.C.', 'State Politics In Virginia. As A Reporter', 'She Covered A Range Of Local', 'National Beats']",Sarah Palin lampoons D.C. at Faith and Freedom Coalition conference,"Before an adoring crowd of religious conservatives, Sarah Palin mocked recent scandals swirling around the Obama administration, performing her own version of a “Saturday Night Live” parody.

“They have this skit where they do this fake newscast, and they read this completely absurd news report and finish it with an incredulous ‘Really?’ ” Palin told the audience Saturday afternoon at the JW Marriott in downtown Washington. “As in, our government spied on every single one of your phone calls but it couldn’t find two pot-smoking, deadbeat Bostonians with a hotline to Terrorist Central in Chechnya.

“The IRS says it can’t figure out how it managed to spend more than $4 million on training conferences because it didn’t keep its receipts,” she said to uproarious laughter. “Really?”

“We’re gathering in a town that is awash in scandal,” said Palin, the closing speaker at the annual meeting of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. “In other words, just another Saturday afternoon in Washington, D.C.”

The Faith and Freedom Coalition, a 501(c)(4) organization, was founded in 2009 by Ralph Reed as a way to join together tea party activists and religious conservatives. The theme of the three-day conference was “Road to Majority” and featured a lineup of conservatives from Sen. Marco Rubio to Grover G. Norquist to Herman Cain.

Palin criticized Obama’s leadership, including his foreign policy efforts, and argued that the United States should not intervene in Syria, but instead “let Allah sort it out.”

“Where is our commander in chief?” she said. “We’re talking now more new interventions. I say until we know what we’re doing, until we have a commander in chief who knows what he’s doing, well, let these radical Islamic countries who aren’t even respecting basic human rights, where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line, ‘Allah Akbar,’ I say until we have someone who knows what they’re doing, I say let Allah sort it out.”

The line drew laughter from the audience.

Speaker after speaker offered strategies for conservatives to win control of Congress and the White House.

Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza who cut short his bid for the GOP nomination after he was accused of sexual harassment and having an extramarital affair, said he had a formula for winning. “ETA,” said Cain, with the flair of a man who became known for his “9-9-9” tax plan. He said the phrase was shorthand for “enthusiasm, targeted races and activists.”

Conservatives need to target races and cultivate fresh faces, he said. “We have got to stop sending nearly 90 percent of the people in D.C. back to D.C.,” said Cain, who has a radio talk show. “We should expand what we’ve already been doing. Create a groundswell of activists, and citizens and patriots.”

Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another former Republican presidential candidate, told the conference that conservative activists have “a long way to go” to make an impact on national politics and advised them to shift their tone.

“We stand for the principles that made America great,” Perry said. “We should exude those principals with joy. Smile when you disagree with a liberal. As Ronald Reagan said, liberals know so much that isn’t so. Our conservative convictions will win this country back if our tone shows we’re comfortable with our own ideals.”

Among the speakers who brought attendees to their feet was E.W. Jackson, a Chesapeake minister who was a virtual political unknown until a month ago, when he clinched the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia. Since then, liberals and some national GOP figures have bemoaned controversial Jackson comments, including his belief that Planned Parenthood has harmed black Americans more than the Ku Klux Klan and that gays and lesbians are “very sick people.”

Jackson offered a fiery 10 minutes on how the left is assaulting religious freedom and trying to redefine liberty.

“Freedom doesn’t mean ‘Do whatever you want.’ It’s the pursuit of character, integrity, decency, honor. Now we’re being told freedom is license,” he said.

Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate and former Alaska governor, had some harsh words for some GOP leaders who have blamed far right candidates for the party’s recent national losses.

“To our Republican leadership, you don’t marginalize, discredit and dismiss everyday, hardworking Americans,” she said. She urged tea party activists to keep at it. “Start on a local level affecting change, as you work on the higher levels of politicos,” she said. “Or do both. Just do both.”

Americans need to “rededicate” the country to “our one true heavenly Father,” said Palin, who is writing a book about faith and Christmas and returns to the airwaves Monday as part of the “Fox & Friends” program on Fox News. “If we rededicate our land to our Lord, things will turn around.”

Nearly 17 years after voters in the state legalized medical marijuana, the court ruled unanimously in a legal challenge to a ban the city of Riverside enacted in 2010.

The advocacy group Americans for Safe Access estimates that another 200 jurisdictions statewide have similar prohibitions on retail pot sales. Many were enacted after the number of retail medical marijuana outlets boomed in Southern California after a 2009 memo from the U.S. Justice Department said prosecuting pot sales would be a low priority.

However, the rush to outlaw pot shops has slowed in the 21 months since the four federal prosecutors in California launched a coordinated crackdown on dispensaries by threatening to seize the property of landlords who lease space to the shops. Hundreds of dispensary operators have since been evicted or closed voluntarily.

Marijuana advocates have argued that allowing local government to bar dispensaries thwarts the intent of the state’s medical marijuana law — the nation’s first — to make the drug accessible to residents with doctor’s recommendations to use it.

The ruling came in the case filed after Riverside city lawmakers used zoning powers to declare storefront pot shops as public nuisances and ban the operations in 2010. The Inland Empire Patient’s Health and Wellness Center, part of the explosion of retail medical marijuana outlets, sued to stop the city from shutting it down.

A number of counties and cities were awaiting the Supreme Court ruling before moving forward with bans of their own.

A mid-level appeals court previously sided with the city of Riverside, but other courts have come to opposite conclusions. Last summer, a trial judge ruled that Riverside County could not close medical marijuana dispensaries in unincorporated areas because the move did not give the shops any room to operate legally under state law.

Meanwhile, an appeals court in Southern California struck down Los Angeles County’s 2-year-old ban on dispensaries, ruling state law allows cooperatives and collectives to grow, store and distribute pot."

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Rep. Steve King’s rotten tomatoes,"Now the immigration debate is really getting juicy.

Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, has always been a bit of a melon head, but he outdid himself in an interview that came to light this week in which he described “DREAMers” — people brought to this country illegally as children — as misshapen drug mules. “For every one who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there that — they weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” the honorable gentleman said.

Cantaloupe calves? This was a rotten tomato tossed at Latinos, who were already suspicious of Republicans before the insult was added to the injury of House conservatives such as King blocking action on bipartisan immigration legislation.

“Hateful,” said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).

“Inexcusable,” said Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).

King kept on throwing. “It’s not something that I’m making up,” he told Radio Iowa on Tuesday evening, hours after a Democrat who had discovered the recent interview with Newsmax read the offending comments aloud at a congressional hearing. “We have people that are mules, that are drug mules, that are hauling drugs across the border and you can tell by their physical characteristics what they’ve been doing for months, going through the desert with 75 pounds of drugs on their back. And if those who advocate for the DREAM Act, if they choose to characterize this about valedictorians, I gave them a different image.”

King certainly gave his colleagues a different image: that of a Republican Party driven into extinction in coming decades because it antagonized what is becoming the most important voting bloc. Even his usual conservative partners moved to isolate him.

“Irresponsible and reprehensible,” Rep. Raul Labrador (Idaho) said at a luncheon gathering with reporters called Conversations with Conservatives. “I think what he said was out of touch with the [GOP] conference.”

In lieu of a defense of King, Labrador scolded the assembled journalists for their reporting on King’s out-of-his-gourd remark but not the favorable things other Republicans say about immigrants. “Shame on you. Shame on the media,” he lectured. “Make sure that your article talks about what every Republican said,” Labrador proposed, “not what one outlier said.”

This is similar to scolding the media for focusing on the one plane that crashes and not giving equal attention to all the planes that land safely. More to the point, it’s not at all clear that King is such an outlier.

Certainly, his zany remarks are low-hanging fruit for journalists. Just last week, he got into a heated exchange with a Univision host who asked about a speech in which King likened immigrants to a litter of puppies. “You want a good bird dog?” he asked. “Pick the one that’s the friskiest. . . . You get the pick of the litter and you got yourself a pretty good bird dog. Well, we’ve got the pick of every donor civilization on the planet.”

But if Republicans think King is a fruitcake, they don’t show it on the House floor, where last month they approved, along party lines, an amendment King offered that would force the Obama administration to resume deportation of the DREAMers who immigrated as children. “If this position holds, no amnesty will reach the president’s desk,” the congressman said in a celebratory statement after the vote.

And King’s position is holding. Boehner, responding to House conservatives, is refusing to take up the Senate legislation. Because he has chosen a strategy of passing legislation through the House without Democratic votes, the speaker can’t afford to lose more than a handful of Republicans. This empowers “outliers” such as King.

“The reason we’re in a bottleneck here in Congress is because of a few like him,” Rep. Rubén Hinojosa (D-Tex.), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told me Wednesday afternoon at a caucus event outside the Capitol. “Evidently there’s enough to be able to force the speaker of the House to stall and not be able to do this immigration reform.”

Republicans say their objections to the immigration bill have nothing to do with racial or ethnic discrimination, and that’s surely the case for most of them. But King makes it easy for Democrats to tar the Republicans with sinister motives. Rep. Ben Luján (D-N.M.), one of several speakers denouncing King on the House floor Wednesday, said his slur shows why “the American people continue to see House Republicans as out of touch.”

That’s not quite fair. But when one of their own is talking about cantaloupe calves, Republicans aren’t in a strong position to complain about cherry-picking.

Each inmate has been imprisoned for at least 15 years, and six were sentenced to life in prison.

It was the first time retroactive relief was provided to a group of inmates who would most likely have received significantly shorter terms if they had been sentenced under current drug laws, sentencing rules and charging policies. Most will be released in 120 days. The commutations opened a major new front in the administration’s efforts to curb soaring taxpayer spending on prisons and to help correct what it has portrayed as inequality in the justice system.

In a statement, Mr. Obama said that each of the eight men and women had been sentenced under what is now recognized as an “unfair system,” including a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses that was significantly reduced by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.

“If they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society,” Mr. Obama said. “Instead, because of a disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust, they remain in prison, separated from their families and their communities, at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year.”"

Instead of treating 100 grams of cocaine the same as 1 gram of crack for sentencing purposes, the law cut the ratio to 18 to 1. Initially, the law applied only to future offenders, but, a year later, the United States Sentencing Commission voted to apply it retroactively. Republicans raged, charging that crime would go up and that prisoners would overwhelm the courts with frivolous demands for sentence reductions. Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said the commission was pursuing “a liberal agenda at all costs.”

This week, we began to learn that there are no costs, only benefits. According to a preliminary report released by the commission, more than 7,300 federal prisoners have had their sentences shortened under the law. The average reduction is 29 months, meaning that over all, offenders are serving roughly 16,000 years fewer than they otherwise would have. And since the federal government spends about $30,000 per year to house an inmate, this reduction alone is worth nearly half-a-billion dollars — big money for a Bureau of Prisons with a $7 billion budget. In addition, the commission found no significant difference in recidivism rates between those prisoners who were released early and those who served their full sentences.

Federal judges nationwide have long expressed vigorous disagreement with both the sentencing disparity and the mandatory minimum sentences they are forced to impose, both of which have been drivers of our bloated federal prison system. But two bipartisan bills in Congress now propose a cheaper and more humane approach. It would include reducing mandatory minimums, giving judges more flexibility to sentence below those minimums, and making more inmates eligible for reductions to their sentences under the new ratio.

But 18 to 1 is still out of whack. The ratio was always based on faulty science and misguided assumptions, and it still disproportionately punishes blacks, who make up more than 80 percent of those prosecuted for federal crack offenses. The commission and the Obama administration have called for a 1-to-1 ratio. The question is not whether we can afford to do it, but whether we can afford not to."

She Has Covered Six Presidential Elections', 'Served As Bureau Chief In San Francisco']",Yakama tribe just says no to Washington state’s legal pot market,"TOPPENISH, Wash. — The Yakama Nation sits in the fertile heart of illegal marijuana country — Washington state’s answer to Mendocino County, minus the tie-dye.

The soil is rich. The growing season is long. And one of the biggest illegal pot grows in state history was seized here on sacred forested acres where the tribe hunts and gathers food in the shadow of Mt. Adams, also known as Pahto.

A year has passed since Washington voters legalized recreational marijuana use. State officials are poised to issue licenses to grow, process and sell what once was contraband. And the Yakama, after decades of battling substance abuse on their reservation, want no part of what will be one of the first legal recreational pot markets in America.

Which is why George Colby stepped up to the microphone during a raucous autumn meeting of the state Liquor Control Board and issued a stern warning to the officials who are creating the market and the would-be entrepreneurs who want to take part in it.

“I’m here to tell you that if you want to spend half a million dollars on growing marijuana in central Washington, I suggest you don’t do that,” the mild-mannered attorney admonished the crowd on behalf of his 10,000 clients and their 14 million or so acres east of the Cascade Mountains.

“Because we will come after you,” Colby promised. “The Yakama Nation will come after you. And under our treaty, all we have to do is pick up the phone and call the federal government and tell you to get off of our land.”

Local jurisdictions throughout Washington have considered measures to keep recreational marijuana out, at least temporarily, since voters passed Initiative 502 last year — 56% to 44% — legalizing pot and thrusting the Evergreen State into uncharted territory.

But few have arguments as powerful or needs as pressing as the Yakama Nation.

The tribe is ruled by a 158-year-old treaty prohibiting hard alcohol within its boundaries, and it runs one of the few dry casinos in America. Yet the harsh toll of drug and alcohol abuse scars nearly every family on the reservation, from Yakama Chairman Harry Smiskin’s on down.

“We do not want our people, or anyone else, to use, grow or sell marijuana on our lands,” Smiskin wrote in a recent opinion article on the seattlepi.com website. “We have had a long and unpleasant history with marijuana — just as we have had with alcohol. We fight them both on our lands.”

Concern about substance abuse dates from at least the 19th century, when the Yakama signed the Treaty of 1855 under great duress.

Today, the treaty is the tribe’s sole governing document. It protects the Yakama’s interests and is celebrated every summer with two parades, a powwow, a rodeo and a royal court.

Under the agreement, the Yakama reservation consists of just over a million acres; the tribe ceded more than 12 million acres to the federal government but retained the right to fish, hunt and gather traditional foods there.

The entire area is ruled by the treaty, the Yakama Law and Order Code and federal law. The first includes a ban on hard alcohol; no liquor stores exist within the reservation’s boundaries. The other two include bans on marijuana.

Alan E. Rathbun, licensing director for the state Liquor Control Board, said his agency would not issue marijuana business licenses on any federal land, including reservations.

But the Yakama Nation is “a little bit like a checkerboard,” he said, with several incorporated cities within its boundaries. The state has not assigned any of the 334 retail stores it plans to license to those cities — Toppenish, Wapato, and Harrah.

“The issue will be if an applicant chooses to seek a license in those areas” for a store, a grow operation or a processing plant, Rathbun said. “Our guess is the Yakama Nation will object. Then it will be up to the board to make a determination whether they want to issue a license there or not.”

The monthlong application period for marijuana business licenses ended Friday. Applicants have filled out the paperwork for production facilities and processing plants in Toppenish and Wapato. Applications also have been filed for pot operations just outside the border of the Yakama reservation in the tiny towns of Granger, Mabton and Zillah.

The tribe created its own database to monitor applications — not just on the reservation proper but also on the so-called ceded areas — in other words, the entire 14 million acres, more than 30% of the state.

And on Monday, “We’re going to be filing about 200 objections to applications in 10 counties that comprise the ceded and reserved areas of the Yakama Nation,” Colby said. “The citizens of the state of Washington don’t have the right to vote on what happens on tribal land.”

Every summer, Brian Frederickson soars above the reservation in a federal Drug Enforcement Administration helicopter — over forested lands closed to all but the Indians, crop rows as straight as a ruler, the small towns that dot the Yakima Valley floor.

A lieutenant with the Yakama Nation tribal police force, Frederickson is one of the most skilled “spotters” in a multiagency task force aimed at getting rid of illegal pot statewide. Each year the team has been more successful. Each year the job has become more difficult, as growers with ties to Mexican cartels go to greater lengths to hide their efforts.

“This is the different planting style they’re using now,” the burly lieutenant said as his computer screen filled with an aerial photograph showing a thick canopy of pine trees and a few pot plants peeking out beneath them. “In this grow they put a lot of effort into it. All the drip irrigation line was buried. You couldn’t see it from the air.”

Like most voters in and around the reservation, Frederickson said he opposed legalizing a substance he has worked so hard to get rid of.

“Alcohol has such an impact here,” Frederickson said. “I don’t see how anyone can logically think marijuana won’t have an impact. We went from one substance that’s legal. Now we have two to deal with.”

Eleanor Davis had a personal reason to vote against Initiative 502. A tribal elder with a deeply lined face, she spent 20 years at the Youth Treatment Center here, counseling young men and women with substance abuse problems.

Davis, 67, comes from “five or six generations of alcoholism.” She finds it easier to tally the sober members of her extended family than the ones who are still struggling.

Then there are the loved ones she lost, a list that includes the 23-year-old daughter who died of alcohol poisoning and the 21-year-old grandson — her dead daughter’s boy — who got drunk and got behind the wheel of his car after a party.

His Indian name was Kush-a. He has been gone for five years. A small white cross marks the place on the highway where he died.

“After he passed away, that’s when I thought about what my grandmother said,” recounted Davis, who has been sober for 27 years. “You have to go out in the community, and you have to let people know.”

About alcohol. And, now, about marijuana. Because once a joint is as easy to buy as a six-pack, “It’s just going to create more damage to our people,” she said.

“And they just don’t need that.”

Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a member of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight,” urged his Senate colleagues and members of the media at the immigration bill hearing to not tie the bill to the Boston terror attack bombings. After he made the request, he proceeded to do exactly what he asked others to not do.

“Before I get to the bill, I’d like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in Boston or try to conflate those events with this legislation,” Schumer said.

Schumer’s comments came after the committee’s Ranking GOP Member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) mentioned the Boston bombing earlier in the hearing. Schumer’s chastisement of his colleagues about mentioning the Boston attack appeared to be a response to Grassley.

“We also appreciate the opportunity to talk about immigration, particularly in light of all that’s happening in Massachusetts right now and over the last week,” Grassley said to open the hearing. “We are here trying to understand why these events have occurred. It’s hard to understand that there are people in this world that want to do Americans harm, so this hearing is an opportunity to refocus on the issues at hand and the importance of remaining vigilant and secure in our homeland.”"

Pew/Stateline Staff Writer

Some states are already embracing deep cuts to the food stamp program similar to those passed by House Republicans in Washington, ending the food subsidy for tens of thousands of low-income Americans regardless of what Congress does.

Spurred by the ballooning cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the GOP-dominated House voted Thursday 217-210 to cut $39 billion in the food assistance program over 10 years. Among the changes: Ending waivers for states that during the recession allowed as many as 4 million people to collect food stamps who otherwise would not have qualified.

The fate of the congressional legislation is uncertain. The Senate approved much smaller reductions, and the White House threatened to veto any large cuts to food stamps.

But in six states—Delaware, Kansas, New Hampshire, Utah, Vermont and Wyoming—similar reductions are already in place, or soon will be. Two more states will join them once their waivers expire, potentially taking away food stamps from tens of thousands of current recipients.

Republicans blame the program's ever-increasing rolls and cost on lax enrollment criteria rather than real need. Since before the recession, the price tag for food stamps has more than doubled, topping $82.5 billion in fiscal year 2013. Enrollment hit record highs, with 15 percent of Americans now collecting benefits. Many states have more than 20 percent of their population enrolled.

Costs have continued to spike as well, as Washington pays for the benefits and states administer them. A new Congressional Research Service report released this month showed fiscal year 2012 was the 12th year in a row a new historical high was reached for federal food and nutrition programs, the vast majority of which is food stamps. Since fiscal year 2000, the report said, spending on federal food assistance has more than tripled.

Put in a different context, the U.S. Census Bureau said food stamps lifted 4 million Americans out of poverty last year if the benefits were counted as income.

What states are doing

Kansas is the latest to embrace the cuts, ending a federal waiver on Oct. 1 that allows unemployed, non-elderly and able-bodied adults without children to remain on food stamps despite failing to meet certain work requirements. The change is expected to affect 20,000 Kansans. Wisconsin will let its waiver expire in July 2014, and Oklahoma will also let its waiver at the end of this month; 71,000 and 47,000 people, respectively, received benefits through the waiver in 2011, the latest year for which data is available.

The waivers, part of the 1996 welfare reform, were designed to give states flexibility in times of high unemployment. It suspends a requirement that limits benefits to three months unless recipients work 20 hours a week or spend a certain amount of time on work-related activities, such as job training.

Until this year, 45 states took advantage of the waiver during the recession, and two that did not – Vermont and New Hampshire – weren't eligible for statewide coverage, which is based on unemployment and job market data. Delaware and Utah chose not to request a waiver, while Wyoming wasn't eligible.

Many Republican-led states are trimming safety nets as the recession wanes. In addition, food stamp benefits for all recipients are set to fall Nov. 1 when federal stimulus money ends. Some states have changed welfare enrollment criteria. Others enacted unprecedented cuts in unemployment insurance, as Stateline previously reported.

Against that backdrop, supporters of the cuts see the work requirement as a prime opportunity to trim the rolls. Those possibly affected by ending the waivers comprise less than 5 percent of Americans collecting food stamps.

Republicans see the improving economy as a sign enrollment should be dropping anyway, with cuts to benefits a good way to push some people back into the labor market. Kansas made its case clear, calling the policy ""an effort to encourage employment over welfare dependency.""

""Employment is the most effective way to escape poverty,"" Kansas Department of Children and Families Secretary Phyllis Gilmore said in a statement announcing the move.

Those who support ending the waivers also promise robust job placement and training programs to help those affected meet work requirements, which could allow them to keep their benefits. Wisconsin, for example, is spending an additional $33 million on those efforts as its waiver expires.

Are cuts premature?

Others say the cuts are premature in the face of a weak job market— 11 states and the District of Columbia have unemployment rates measurably higher than the national 7.3 percent jobless rate. The waivers are designed to end once employment improves. Ending them sooner could strip flexibility to deal with lingering joblessness, which is expected to remain above normal for years.

""It's hard to imagine any state would want to lose the flexibility to use waivers to tailor the policy to meet local conditions,"" said Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Rosenbaum added that the work-requirement policy can have ""harsh effects on very poor individuals.""

Underlying the debate is the question of whether policies enacted during the recession have increased enrollment levels beyond actual need. Critics cite the outsized growth of food stamps compared with other safety net programs during the recession.

Projections paint a bleak picture. The Congressional Budget Office estimates more than 43 million will collect food stamp benefits in 2017, just 4 million fewer than today. By 2022, the CBO estimates enrollment will be 9 million more than pre-recession levels and total spending will be nearly $73 billion—more than double than it was in 2007.

http://news.yahoo.com/stores-free-rein-recoup-shoplifting-170838818.html,,[],Stores have free rein to recoup shoplifting losses,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Outside the view of paying customers, people accused of shoplifting at Macy's huge flagship store are escorted by security guards to cells in ""Room 140,"" where they can be held for hours, asked to sign an admission of guilt and pay hundreds in fines, sometimes without any conclusive proof they stole anything.

As shoppers jam stores ahead of the December holidays, claims of racial profiling at department stores in New York have helped expose the wide latitude that laws in at least 27 states give retailers to hold and fine shoplifting suspects, even if a person hasn't yet technically stolen anything, is wrongly accused or criminal charges are dropped.

""You must remember, these people are not police officers; they are store employees,"" said Faruk Usar, the attorney for a 62-year-old Turkish woman who sued Macy's, which some customers say bullied them into paying fines on the spot or harassed them with letters demanding payment. ""When they are detained, they are not yet even in a real jail.""

Industrywide, more than $12 billion is lost to shoplifting each year. The laws, which vary on strictness and fine amounts, allow stores to try to recoup some losses. Under New York's longstanding law, retailers may collect a penalty of five times the cost of the stolen merchandise, up to $500 per item, plus as much as $1,500 if the merchandise isn't in a condition to be sold. A conviction is not necessary to bring a civil claim.

Some customers say stores have harassed them into signing admissions of guilt in order to turn a profit — not just recoup a loss.

Retailers don't divulge how much money they recoup but use it in part to offset security costs, said Barbara Staib, spokeswoman for the National Association for Shoplifting Prevention. The total is a fraction of what they lose, she said.

""We tend to forget that retailers are the victims of crime when it comes to shoplifting,"" she said.

But at least nine customers at the Macy's store immortalized in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" say in lawsuits that the retailer is abusing the law, wrongly targeting minorities and holding customers for hours, years after it settled similar claims brought by the state attorney general by paying a $600,000 fine and changing practices. That agreement expired in 2008.

Story continues

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the new claims against retailers. Last week, New York state stores agreed to post a customer ""bill of rights"" on their websites explicitly prohibiting profiling and unreasonable searches.

Usar's client, Ayla Gursoy, was detained in 2010 after she carried two coats in her arms up several flights of stairs in the flagship store, according to her suit. Store security accused Gursoy, who speaks little English, of trying to steal. She was asked to sign a form admitting guilt and pay a fine. She refused, the police were called and she was arrested.

Gursoy and others say they were held for hours in Room 140, a bare room with two small, barred holding cells with wooden benches within the store.

Elina Kazan, a spokeswoman for Cincinnati-based Macy's, said the company's practices prohibit coercion when recovering fines.

""Our policy of exercising our right to pursue a civil recovery payment is consistent with common practice in the retail industry and within the parameters of the law,"" she said.

Many retailers detain suspected shoplifters, industry experts said, but few have dedicated jail cells and most don't ask for payments on the spot like Macy's.

Most of the accused receive letters in the mail demanding payment from a law firm like the one used by Macy's, Palmer, Reifler & Associates, of Orlando, Fla. That firm also represents Home Depot, Wal-Mart and many other stores and sends out about 115,000 letters per month.

""We are confident in our clients' training processes and procedures for evaluating and investigating theft matters,"" attorney Natt Reifler said.

Letters sent to Gursoy said that if she didn't pay, she would be sued. One said she owed $400; the next said she owed $675 — the increase unexplained.

""We believe the whole purpose of her detention was to get the signature, to get the payments,"" Usar said shortly before his client's suit was settled in court Dec. 4. The terms were not disclosed. Her criminal charge was dismissed after no witness could testify.

In San Leandro, Calif., Jimin Chen accused Home Depot in a federal lawsuit of abusing the laws by shaking down customers to make an extra profit.

He said he was stopped in September by a security guard there who falsely accused him of trying to steal work gloves worth $3.99 that he had taken off the shelves and worn to load lumber into his cart. He said he was detained until he signed an admission of guilt.

Later, he started receiving letters demanding money; $350, then $675. Home Depot disputes the claims and has asked for dismissal.

Lawyers say that retailers rarely actually sue for the money, and they often suggest letter recipients don't bother paying because refusing won't affect their credit.

Generally, industry experts say, the laws allowing retailers to hold and fine suspected shoplifters are applied correctly.

""Retailers do a really good job of identifying where actual theft cases have occurred, and intervening and conducting investigations,"" said Joseph LaRocca, who runs RetaiLPartners, an industry group aimed at building partnerships between retailers and law enforcement. ""There are always exceptions, but by and large, there are few mistakes here.""

The racial profiling allegations started in New York this fall with a different retailer, Barneys New York, after two black customers said they were stopped while buying expensive merchandise. The retailer has said it does not profile, and neither customer was asked to sign a confession or pay a fine.

But the allegations grew to include Macy's. Among those complaining was Rob Brown of the HBO show ""Treme,"" who said he was stopped after buying a $1,300 Movado watch for his mother this summer.

Brown, 29, said he too was taken to Room 140. There, he said in a federal suit filed by attorney Doug Wigdor, others being held were all ""individuals of color."" He was released, he said, when people realized he was a celebrity.

Kazan, of Macy's, said she couldn't comment on pending litigation.

Council approves ‘living wage’ bill over Wal-Mart ultimatum,"Opponents David Catania (left), Muriel Bowser and Tommy Wells confer as Vincent Orange (not pictured) defends the bill to force large retail stores to pay higher wages. Wal-Mart’s threat to withdraw three planned stores did not change any legislators’ minds. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

D.C. lawmakers gave final approval Wednesday to a bill requiring some large retailers to pay their employees a 50 percent premium over the city’s minimum wage, a day after Wal-Mart warned that the law would jeopardize its plans in the city.

The retail giant had linked the future of at least three planned stores in the District to the proposal. But its ultimatum did not change any legislators’ minds. The 8 to 5 roll call matched the outcome of an earlier vote on the matter, taken before Wal-Mart’s warning.

“The question here is a living wage; it’s not whether Wal-Mart comes or stays,” said council member Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), a lead backer of the legislation, who added that the city did not need to kowtow to threats. “We’re at a point where we don’t need retailers. Retailers need us.”

Whether or not Wal-Mart needs the District, it had spent the past three years wanting to enter the city in a way no other business had. Activists celebrated Wednesday’s vote, saying the company, which reported net income of $17 billion on sales of $470 billion in its most recent fiscal year, could afford to pay better wages. But the council action threatens to halt several developments anchored by Wal-Mart in neighborhoods long under­served.

“Nothing has changed from our perspective,” Wal-Mart spokesman Steven Restivo said in a statement after the vote, reiterating that the company will abandon plans for three unbuilt stores and “review the financial and legal implications” of not opening three others under construction.

The company’s strategy had to this point been calibrated to avoid political conflicts in a city of liberal sentiment, where the retailer’s earlier entreaties had been met with deep skepticism.

Well before it had any solid plans to open stores in the District, Wal-Mart joined the D.C. Chamber of Commerce and began making inroads with politicians, community groups and local charities that work on anti-hunger initiatives.

The campaign was matched with cash. Through its charitable foundation, Wal-Mart made $3.8 million in donations last year to city organizations including D.C. Central Kitchen and the Capitol Area Food Bank, according to a company spokesman. Meanwhile, it has kept a prominent local lobbyist, David W. Wilmot, on a $10,000-a-month retainer to smooth relations with elected officials.

The company has not disclosed what it has spent on plans and designs for its six D.C. stores, but development and retail experts say it is probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and possibly as high as $1 million per location. Some of the stores have undergone major design changes since they were first announced.

Should the bill be signed by Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) and pass a congressional review period, retailers with corporate sales of $1 billion or more and operating in spaces 75,000 square feet or larger would be required to pay employees no less than $12.50 an hour. The city’s minimum wage is $8.25, a dollar higher than the federal minimum wage.

The vote sets up a high-profile veto decision for Gray, who has supported Wal-Mart’s entry into the city, arguing that the company would bring badly needed jobs and retail stores to neighborhoods in need of both. The three stores that the company has pledged definitively not to pursue are all in the city’s eastern half, in areas largely devoid of quality retail.

Gray made a particular push to have Wal-Mart anchor a development at Skyland Town Center, a site along Alabama Avenue SE near the mayor’s home that has long been eyed by city leaders for renewal.

View Graphic D.C. lawmakers gave final approval Wednesday to a bill requiring certain large retailers to pay their employees a 50 percent premium over the city’s minimum wage, a day after Wal-Mart warned the law would jeopardize their plans in the city.

Gary D. Rappaport, the project’s developer, has said Wal-Mart’s withdrawal would put those plans on ice. “If there’s not a Wal-Mart at Skyland, then Skyland is not able to go forward at this time,” he said late Tuesday.

The mayor initially called Wal-Mart’s announcement of its ultimatum “immensely discouraging” and said much the same in a letter to council members delivered Wednesday morning. “It is clear that numerous issues remain unclear about the impact of the bill on the District’s current economic development renaissance,” he wrote.

Gray, who has met recently with Wal-Mart representatives, reiterated “serious concerns over the lost jobs and retail opportunities for District residents that the bill will cause,” in a statement released after the council vote.

Before this week, Wal-Mart had made statements opposing the bill but had not directly threatened to withdraw from its plans.

Seven years ago, when the retailer moved to open its first store in Chicago and the City Council there passed a similar “living-wage” measure, the company indicated then that the bill would cause it to scale back or entirely scrap its plans to open several stores, Mayor Richard M. Daley vetoed the bill, and the council failed to override it.

The debate over the living-wage bill has been highly pitched, echoing conflicts elsewhere in the country over similar measures targeting Wal-Mart and other “big box” retailers.

Several dozen pro-Wal-Mart protesters rallied on the front steps of the John A. Wilson Building on Wednesday, while inside a larger group of living-wage supporters walked from council office to council office hoping to pick up additional votes.

“If you allow a bully to bully you, it’s never going to end,” said the Rev. Graylan Hagler, the senior pastor of Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ and a leader of pro-living-wage group Respect DC. “There will be something else. There will always be another agenda.”

Hagler and union supporters hailed what they called the council’s resolve in the face of Wal-Mart’s warning but acknowledged that fending off a mayoral veto could prove difficult. “We’ve got some work to do,” he said.

Council member Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7) said the company’s threats were credible and constituted her “worst nightmare.” She moved unsuccessfully to table the bill Wednesday before voting against it.

“This legislation is a development killer,” she said. “This legislation is a jobs killer.”

Orange, early in the debate, said the “District has arrived” as a desirable place for major retailers to locate. But council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), a mayoral candidate, said that was not true throughout the city. “When I go to Skyland, we have not arrived,” she said. “That project has been some 20 years in the waiting.”

Voting in favor of the bill were Orange, Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), David Grosso (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) and Marion Barry (D-Ward 8). Voting against were Alexander, Bowser, David A. Catania (I-At Large), Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) and Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6).

Emails demonstrate that the targeting of Tea Party groups was orchestrated from the top.

The IRS shared information with the FEC%2C raising questions about how politicized both agencies were.

A poll shows that fewer Americans than ever trust the federal government.

With all the excitement over Syria last week -- we went from ""Assad is Hitler"" to ""we have achieved peace in our time"" almost overnight! -- you may have missed another big story. The IRS scandal, which has slumbered over the summer as Congress has been in recess, seems to be waking up.

It has now been over four months since the IRS admitted it was targeting conservative groups in the run-up to the 2012 election. The chief IRS official in charge of Exempt Organizations, Lois Lerner, has ""taken the Fifth"" -- invoking her right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying before Congress on what went on. Nonetheless, President Obama -- who himself ""joked"" about auditing his enemies -- has lumped the IRS misconduct in with what he calls ""phony scandals.""

But new emails have come out that make the IRS scandal look anything but phony. Emails recovered by the House Ways and Means Committee demonstrate that the targeting of Tea Party groups -- and of voter-integrity groups -- was orchestrated from the top of the agency. Rather than being conducted by a few rogue employees in the Cincinnati office of the IRS, the Tea Party targeting was regarded by Lerner as something ""very dangerous"" politically, and she observed that ""Cincy should probably NOT have these cases.""

The emails also reveal Lerner's concerns that the Democrats might lose their Senate majority, and her hopes that the Federal Election Commission might ""save the day"" by interfering with right-leaning grassroots activity. The IRS also shared information with the FEC, something not permitted by statute, raising questions about just how politicized both agencies were.

An editorial in Investor's Business Dailyobserves:

""Like the Internet video the Benghazi terrorist attack was blamed on, the only thing phony about the IRS scandal is the administration's cover story that a couple of rogue agents in the Cincinnati office concocted and executed this most blatant abuse of power by the most powerful and feared agency of government. Lerner's email further blows out of the water that discredited fiction. It also confirms a suspected reason for the planned intimidation and hamstringing of conservative opposition to the Obama administration's policies, saying that those Tea Party group applications for tax-exempt status could end up being the 'vehicle to go to court' to get more clarity on the 2010 Supreme Court ruling on campaign finance rules.""

That's right, and that's just another reason why we need to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal, which isn't the least bit ""phony."" It seems to me that there are two possible problems here. One is that this came from the Obama White House. The other is that the -- overwhelmingly Democratic -- career civil service at the IRS didn't need White House instructions to go after Tea Party groups it saw as enemies.

The first possibility is bad enough, but is presumably remediable with stricter rules. The second possibility, however, calls into question the possibility of a nonpartisan career civil service, and certainly the possibility of fair administration for something as complex, and involving as many discretionary decisions, as the Internal Revenue Code. Worse yet, given that overwhelming partisan identification with Democrats pervades the civil service as a whole, it calls into question the very possibility of a nonpartisan and politically neutral civil service.

I'm not ready to call for a return to the ""spoils system,"" but the fully politicized federal bureaucracy of our nation's first century or so did have two advantages: First, presidents couldn't hide behind the bureaucracy, as they were presumed responsible for the actions of government bureaus staffed with their supporters; and second, politicians were less inclined to trust the bureaucracy with enormous and discretionary power when they knew that it would sometimes be staffed by their political adversaries.

At any rate, it all boils down to trust. One reason for the resonance of not only the IRS scandals but also the NSA scandal, the Benghazi scandal, Fast and Furious, and so on is that fewer Americans than ever trust the federal government. It's a mess that needs to be cleaned up, and denying that the mess exists only exacerbates the lack of trust.

It's doubtful that Eric Holder's Justice Department -- which is even more partisan and politicized than the IRS -- will clean this mess up. Nor is Holder likely to appoint a special prosecutor. So it's up to congressional investigators to get to the bottom of it. Stay tuned.

They’ve been out of work since last week and were promised back pay once a budget is passed and the government reopens.

But for many rank-and-file employees who live paycheck to paycheck, the shutdown is proving to be a massive financial headache. Some say their savings have been wiped out after a three-year pay freeze and a previous round of furloughs during the summer.

The nation’s ideological battle over healthcare and spending is hitting these workers in the pocketbook. They’re falling behind on rent, car payments, credit-card debt and other bills.

“I am in survival mode,” said Timothy Maimone, a furloughed quality assurance specialist for the Department of Defense. “I am barely squeaking by right now.”

The 51-year-old Mission Viejo resident said he earns just enough to cover the mortgage on his house, pay bills and take care of his 7-year-old son. But the first government shutdown in nearly two decades has him stressed and angry about money.

A single dad with no savings, he’s prioritizing bills in case the shutdown goes on for weeks. He’s already missed his monthly credit card payment and is late on the mortgage. He’s stopped paying the trash bill and only shelled out the minimum to keep the water on. And he’s holding off on buying clothes for his son, Salvatore.

Workers like Maimone have been told their last paycheck from working before the shutdown could arrive soon. Even then, they’ll get paid only for the days they worked and not the furloughed days that will be settled up later. There won’t be another check until the government reopens.

The pain is also spreading to the private sector as many companies with government contracts begin sending workers home.

Aerospace Corp., based in El Segundo, furloughed about 2,000 workers. San Francisco engineering company URS Corp. has about 3,000 employees on furlough.

The furloughs are costing the economy at least $160 million per workday, according to market research firm IHS Inc. If the shutdown continues beyond three or four weeks, economic growth could be cut in half in the last quarter of the year, Moody’s Analytics said.

The federal government had about 2.15 million people, excluding postal workers unaffected by the shutdown, on its payroll in August, according to the government. California alone has about 243,000 federal employees.

“They are middle-class Americans,” said Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 150,000 federal workers. “They are frightened about what this means to their families. Many are the sole supporters of their families.”

Kelley’s union represents workers from 31 federal agencies and departments such as the Treasury and Homeland Security. She said about 40% of the union’s members take home a salary less than $50,000 a year.

“There are tens of thousands of workers who don’t have backup plans or a support system,” she said.

Even those who do have savings are counting their pennies.

Malcolm Gettmann, 59, and his wife have both been furloughed from their jobs at the Internal Revenue Service in San Diego. Like many other furloughed workers, the pair have filed for unemployment benefits and are scrambling to tighten their belts.

The couple, who have some savings, said they don’t plan to make big purchases any time soon. Instead, Gettmann said, they now meticulously plan meals and buy only those groceries that are on sale. There is just enough to cover their $1,600 mortgage payment and expenses until the third week of November.

He’s not at all impressed by a House bill passed Saturday that guarantees back pay to workers once the shutdown ends.

That pay is only approved “when the Senate passes it and the president signs it,” noted Gettmann, who also serves as the Treasury union’s chapter president for San Diego and Imperial counties. “Meanwhile, the mortgage is still due, the car payments are still due, everything is still due.”

However, government workers might be getting some relief on their bills.

Major banks such as Wells Fargo & Co. and PNC Bank say they’re working with customers individually. Others, such as TD Bank, are offering no-interest payday loans.

On its website, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it was ready to help on “financial challenges that might arise — much like we worked with our customers through Hurricane Sandy and tornadoes in Oklahoma.”

Many credit unions have gone even further to help.

Navy Federal Credit Union, the largest credit union in the U.S., is expediting approval on raising credit card limits and letting members withdraw from certificates of deposit without penalties. Financial services firm USAA is offering payment deferrals and refunding some fees on credit cards and other services.

Pacific Marine Credit Union in Oceanside, Calif., plans to post payrolls for all affected members with direct deposit Oct. 15. If the government doesn’t come through, the payments will come out of the union’s own cash reserves, said Brad Smith, the vice president of strategic development. Depending on how much is left in the coffers, the union will consider making another payment two weeks later if the shutdown continues.

“We want to provide that peace of mind,” Smith said.

Smith, who worked at another California credit union during the 26-day shutdown in 1995 and 1996, said workers are suffering more this time around.

“There was a much different environment during the Clinton era. Back then it was unprecedented,” he said. “Now the government has a track record with furloughs and the sequester. It seems like every time you turn around they want to run off the edge of a cliff.”

Valentine’s Day is also a day when people with crazy ex-boyfriends or -girlfriends are reminded of how thankful they are for anti-stalking laws.

Every state has made stalking a crime. These laws help protect people who might otherwise live in fear. Yet labor unions have successfully, and disconcertingly, lobbied to be exempt from anti-stalking laws in at least four states – California, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Nevada.

“The most glaring examples of union favoritism under state laws,” notes a 2012 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report, “tend to occur in criminal statutes and allow individuals who engage in truly objectionable behavior to avoid prosecution solely because they are participating in some form of labor activity.”

Pennsylvania unions now enjoy a loophole that the state’s anti-stalking law “shall not apply to conduct by a party to a labor dispute.” In Illinois, anti-stalking laws exempt “any controversy concerning wages, salaries, hours, working conditions or benefits … the making of collective bargaining agreements.”

These exemptions prove that organizing tactics used by unions can have something in common with those of stalkers – and can perhaps inflict similar emotional distress.

While a number of states have exemptions that have allowed union members to intimidate and harass, California is by far the worst actor. As in other states, it is a crime in California to interfere with a lawful business through physical obstruction or intimidation of workers or customers.

Yet California has exempted unions from this law. The negative effects were clear in 2008, when United Food and Commercial Workers Union members picketed a new Ralph’s grocery store in Fresno. They went beyond traditional picketing, harassing customers and instigating confrontations with employees on store property. When store workers finally called the police, authorities refused to come and put a stop to the union’s disruptive behavior.

With the nation’s highest income and sales tax rates, in addition to many costly regulations, California is already one of the most difficult places to do business. Its exemptions permitting such behavior on the part of unions – which would be considered criminal for you or me – makes the state an even more inhospitable place to do business.

California also has a host of exemptions that allow union members to violate the property rights of private citizens. The 2008 Researcher Protection Act makes entering the residences of academic researchers to interfere with their work a crime. Sounds reasonable. Yet this doesn’t apply to union members. They can invade a professor’s home in California and it’s not a crime – so long as the invader is “engaged in labor union activities.”

You might wonder why unions have lobbied to be exempt from laws against trespassing. The fact is that they have a long history of targeting private residences. In 2010 roughly 500 protesters from the Service Employees International Union showed up outside the home of a Bank of America deputy general counsel to protest the company’s policies. That bank official wasn’t home, but his teenage son was – and felt forced to barricade himself in a bathroom as union demonstrators surrounded his house and even came onto the front porch.

Unions can also invade your personal space if you’re riding public transit in California. The California Penal Code states “willfully blocking the free movement of another person” in a public transit system is a crime subject to up to 90 days in jail and a $400 fine. However, California legislators have passed a provision exempting unions. This means that union protesters can block the movement of people on public transit so long as it is related to collective bargaining efforts – something to keep in mind before getting on BART during your next visit to San Francisco.

Labor bosses have even deemed it necessary to get legislators to grant unions exemptions from laws against sabotage. Wisconsin’s state law against sabotage exempts unions, so as to not curtail their organizing activities. The fact that anti-sabotage laws might be construed as an impediment to union organizing says more about union organizing efforts than anything else.

Yet, in 2011, union members were alleged to have sabotaged equipment belonging to supporters of Governor Scott Walker’s labor reforms. In New York and New Jersey, during a labor dispute between Verizon and the Communications Workers of America, the telephone company contacted the FBI to investigate allegations of sabotage. The company reported equipment being stolen, fiber-optic lines cut and an office heating system tampered with.

During a union organizing effort in Ohio, the owner of one non-union electrical services company had his tires slashed and rocks thrown at his windows. One of his employees was assaulted. The owner was himself shot in the arm while confronting a person who was vandalizing his car on his property. Other owners of non-union shops experienced similar harassment and intimidation. When the Associated Builders and Contractors called on unions to halt such odious behavior, the unions responded that their actions were perfectly legal.

State lawmakers should oppose efforts to exempt unions from anti-stalking and anti-trespassing laws. Where such laws are already on the books, they should be repealed. For union bosses can be like those scary exes who insist they aren’t letting you break up with them.

Workers and employers deserve the freedom to tell unions, “I’m just not that into you.”

USA TODAY

1.3 million jobless workers could lose benefits by Jan. 1 and 850%2C000 more by March 31

Some struggling households already hit by food stamp cuts

Emergency benefits%27 expiration would detract from growth elsewhere in economy

About 1.3 million unemployed Americans are set to lose their extended jobless benefits by the end of December if Congress doesn't renew the program, delivering another blow to struggling households hit with recent cuts in food stamps.

Another 850,000 people would run out of unemployment insurance from January through March when their roughly 26 weeks of state benefits end, according to the National Employment Law Project.

""There's a view … that it would be too heavy a blow both to the economy and to struggling unemployed families to have both food stamp benefits and unemployment benefits all (be cut) within two months of each other,"" says Bob Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

On Nov. 1, a temporary increase in food stamp benefits was phased out, affecting more than 47 million Americans.

Some of those affected also receive jobless benefits, NELP says, though it had no specific data.

In 2008, in the middle of the recession, the federal government began providing up to a year or more of ""emergency"" unemployment benefits to supplement the typical 26 weeks of coverage that states provide.

In January, Congress renewed that program as part of the ""fiscal cliff"" deal on tax increases and spending cuts, but scaled it back. This year, the unemployed have received 14 to 47 weeks of emergency benefits, depending on their state's jobless rate, NELP figures show.

Those benefits are slated to end Dec. 28, abruptly cutting off payments to the 1.3 million people already receiving them and ensuring that another 850,000 will get no more checks when their 26 weeks of state benefits expire between January and March.

By some measures, the labor market has improved, with unemployment falling to 7.3% last month from a peak of 10% in October 2009. But long-term unemployment has come down only modestly, with 4.1 million Americans, or 36% of all the unemployed, out of work at least six months. They would be the most affected by a phaseout of emergency benefits.

""There's still a crisis of long-term unemployment,"" says NELP program director Maurice Emsellem.

The portion of the long-term unemployed receiving benefits has fallen to 34% from 45% a year ago, and would drop to 25% if the emergency program is shut down, NELP says.

The move also would reduce economic growth next year by 0.15 percentage points, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Each dollar the government pays out in benefits yields $1.42 in economic output because the unemployed tend to spend nearly all their payments, he says.

The economy has grown at a relatively weak annual rate of 2.1% in the first three quarters of this year.

Zandi says renewing the extended benefits program is somewhat less likely this year because there's no directly relevant bill, such as the fiscal cliff package, to which the measure could be attached.

Greenstein says it could be added to anticipated budget or Medicare legislation. The White House recently urged Congress to extend the program and last week Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee called for a hearing on the issue.

Candace Stewart, 58, says she would have to sell her townhouse if she lost her emergency benefits of about $400 week. Stewart, who was laid off from her job as a quality control inspector last April, has sent out nearly 200 résumés but gotten just two interviews.

""There's just nothing out there to get,"" she says."

Will you notice an immediate effect? Not likely.

For the most part, the ramifications would kick in over months, not several days or weeks.

""By [April], government agencies will execute reduced work schedules and the budget crunch will become more acute,"" Sean West, U.S. policy director for the Eurasia Group, explained in a research note. ""The pain will pick up speed from there.""

Of course, anyone directly affected will feel the cuts right away. But the general public's awareness may be delayed and uneven. Different cuts will create different domino effects, according to longtime budget expert Stan Collender.

For instance, a government worker facing a furlough may think twice about buying a new car, whereas a federal contractor getting less business from Uncle Sam may not make new hires. Summer travelers may be surprised to face reduced hours at national parks or increased delays at airports.

The exact timeline of how the so-called sequester will unfold is still unclear. And lawmakers may eventually agree to replace the cuts. But here's what we know now.

(Related: Obama order triggers cuts)

Friday, March 1 - Sequester goes into effect: The White House budget office will issue an official sequestration order that cancels $85 billion in spending authority for the seven months remaining in the fiscal year. It will also submit a report to Congress detailing the level of cuts each agency must make to its programs, projects and activities.

March 1 and beyond - Federal workers put on notice; grants and contracts curtailed: So far at least one federal agency -- the National Labor Relations Board -- has already issued a formal 30-day furlough notice to employees. The Department of Justice says it plans to do so by Friday.

And the bulk of federal agencies planning furloughs will follow suit sometime thereafter.

Agencies will also cut back on issuing new contracts and reduce federal grants to everything from schools to airports to states.

March 26 and on - Furloughs take effect: Federal workers subject to furloughs will start working fewer days. That may be when the public first notices delays in federal services -- from making decisions about disability benefits to processing visas to providing airport security -- as well cutbacks in the hours of national parks.

When furloughed, employees are prohibited from working for a set number of days for which they will not be paid. The furloughs will vary from agency to agency.

The Pentagon, for instance, has said workers would be furloughed for one day a week up to 22 weeks starting in April. But the Department of Housing and Urban Development is planning on furloughs of just seven days: May 10, May 24, June 14, July 5, July 22, Aug. 16 and Aug. 30, according to a document obtained by CNNMoney. HUD offices nationwide would be closed on those seven days. And the IRS won't start furloughs until summer.

March 27 - Funding for the government expires: Congress must pass a new bill setting funding levels for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends Sept. 30. If they don't, the government would shut down all but essential services. This is one legislative vehicle that could contain a sequester fix.

April 1 - Medicare docs take a hit: Medicare payments to health care providers, health care plans and drug plans will be reduced by 2%.

April and May - Budget negotiations: If lawmakers haven't agreed to a sequester fix by this point, they may try to do so during their annual budget negotiations for the next fiscal year.

Mid-May to August - Debt ceiling negotiations: Congress will need to raise the country's debt limit. This could provide another legislative vehicle for a sequester fix, if one hasn't been put in place already.

August and September - Back to school, but not for some: Teachers and school staff affected by education-related cuts may be laid off for the 2013-14 school year.

Still unknown - Smaller unemployment checks: Everyone collecting federal extended unemployment benefits will see their checks cut by 9.4% retroactive to March 1. Just when they would start seeing smaller checks depends on how quickly their state unemployment office makes the change, which will vary from state to state. But chances are good many collecting benefits would see smaller checks sometime in March.

By Dec. 31 - Fewer jobs created: The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the economy would produce 750,000 fewer full-time jobs as a result of the forced spending cuts if they remain in effect for the whole calendar year.

It is hard to understand anyone’s objection to it. A country cannot frown on citizen’s using public assistance if it does not create an economy that pays a living wage to all its citizens that are working.

The following snippet with the most relevant bullets from his New Rules segment on the minimum wage is on point.

Bill Maher’s New Rules Snippet On The Minimum Wage When it comes to raising the minimum wage Conservatives always say it is a non-starter because it cuts into profits. … You might think that paying people enough to live is so self-evident that even crazy people could understand it. But you would be wrong. … Michele Bachmann is not only against raising the minimum wage, she is against having one at all. She wants said “… if we took away the minimum wage … we could … virtually wipe out unemployment … because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.” … And naturally Ted Cruz agrees. Ted Cruz thinks it’s a good thing that when his Cuban father came to America he was paid fifty cents an hour to work as a dishwasher. … When did the American dream become this pathway to indentured servitude, this economic death spiral where workers get paid next to nothing, so they can only afford to buy next to nothing, so businesses are forced to sell cheaper and cheaper shit? Consider the fact that most fast food workers whose average age by the way is 29 … are on some form of public assistance which is not surprising. When even working people can’t make enough to live they take money from the government. This is the question the Right has to answer. Do you want smaller government with less handouts or do you want do you want a low minimum wage because you cannot have both. If Coronel Sanders isn’t going to pay the lady behind the counter enough to live on, then Uncle Sam has to. And I for one is getting a little tired of helping highly profitable companies pay their workers.

Bill Maher makes a very important statement. The average American citizens are subsidizing McDonald’s. Americans are subsidizing all companies that are paying below subsistence level wages.

The viral story of a McDonald’s employee calling a McDonald’s help line is probative. McDonald’s gave her information necessary to get government assistance and charity. This was a full time worker. What she really needs is an increase in the minimum wage. What she needs is the dignity of pay she can live on.

Bill Maher is late to the party. George Carlin figured out long time ago that the American Dream had become a pathway to indentured servitude. He laid it out in his “The American Dream” standup skit. The minimum wage is part of the problem. However, the problem of the poor and working middle class is much deeper.

The problem is income and wealth disparity that is getting worse. Income and growth is extracted from the poor and the middle class with policies to ensure the incessant steady growth of the wealth and income of a very few.

The president is psychologically predictable. He does not surprise. Having been abandoned as a boy by his father, and then his mother, only to then learn that his grandmother feared people of his race, he seems inherently to distrust individual initiative and intention and to place his trust only in the collective—i.e. the state. What benefits a burgeoning central authority is good for all. When a child’s guardians keep letting him down in profound ways, that child can grow up to want a lot of power himself and distrust the idea of giving anyone else very much.

Hence, the president wants to use tax increases to remove wealth from those who earned it, fair and square. Because, you see, wealth really does confer power on those who amass it, and giving that kind of authority to individuals, rather than the collective, is anathema to the President. It likely reawakens in him very closely held memories of what he got from his parents when most in need: Not much.

Individuals are also better off without guns, the president would have us believe. It is true, of course, that some capital crimes are committed with guns (but only the minority with automatic weapons, and lots with knives and explosives and by strangulation, too).

[pullquote]

More On This... Rubio trumps Obama as both men offer competing visions of America’s future

But guns also happen to empower tens of millions of American individuals, too. They promote in individuals the idea that they can take care of themselves and make their own decisions and take care of their families, including their children. And that’s what I believe is the president’s real problem with them. Because, as a boy, the independent decisions of the adults around him were, frankly, horribly traumatizing.

The president celebrates his Affordable Care Act. But the reality of ObamaCare is that, for the first time, ever, it earmarks American citizens’ after-tax income to be spent, by law, on a product that they might or might not want: health insurance. They have to buy it. The collective always knows best in Obama’s mind. Because individuals left him out in the cold, when he needed consistency and nurturance the most.

Many millions of young Americans listened to Barack Obama on Tuesday night, as they have listened to his core message for nearly five long years. And his message has remained remarkably consistent and remarkably toxic to their psychological well-being: Do not rely on yourself. Entitlement Nation will parent you, until you forget about growing up, period. Stay on your parents’ health insurance, even if you are 18 and in great health and would rather—wisely or not—use that money to start an Internet company in your basement. It’s okay to blame rich people if you can’t earn money. Just ignore the fact that government policy is now hostile to entrepreneurs who might otherwise decide it is worth the risk to staff up.

The government will even grade colleges and tell you which ones are worth attending. Really? Teenagers can’t even research that for themselves, anymore? Their parents can’t help them evaluate schools? The state, the collective—long known for the miserable educational system it has deployed—will decide which institutions of higher learning are worthy?

Welcome to the psychological projection of an abandoned boy’s vision of how much you can rely on other individuals and on yourself. The less, the better. When your mother and father take off on you as a kid, when your white grandmother seems to fear people of color, you probably figure putting any trust in individuals is crazy.

My 10-year-old son was watching last night. I was just glad that he got to see part of the Bruins’ game, too. Because he saw remarkable athletes find something inside themselves that they tapped to come back from being down three goals, to tie the game 3-3 (even though they eventually lost in a shootout). And when Brad Marchand scored that tying goal, with 42 seconds left, and no goalie in the Bruins’ net, I saw my son jump up, out of his chair and pump his fist in the air and yell, “Yes! He did it! He did it!”

“Yup,” I said, “He’s amazing.”

People—individual people—make things happen. Yes, they are part of a team. But celebrating their individual accomplishments and rewarding them for them isn’t bad. It’s good. Brad Marchand scored that goal. He did it. And people build their own businesses, too, Mr. President. Things did not go well for you at the hands of the individuals who were empowered to care for you. But individuals are not inherently bad."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/06/16/1216376/-About-Jan-Brewer,2013-06-16 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",About Jan Brewer...,"Let's be clear, Jan Brewer is not an idiot. She may have been the rising star and darling of the far right of the Arizona Republican Party, but she's not a Black Helicopter Republican. Consider the gold coin bill. This pile of arble-garble had two reasons behind it. There was the reason that the national press got - the need to give opportunities to gold savers to spend their gold (which defeats the purposes of gold saving). Then there was the actual reason that circulated on the ground. OBAMA was going to spend so much money that the dollar was just going to continue inflating so much it would be useless, and Arizona needed to be prepared! Prepared, I say!!

Nevermind that the facts dictate that neither inflation nor federal spending have exactly been rocketing into the sun, they know.

The Black Helicopter Caucus has given us the Agenda 21 ban, forced oaths of loyalty, a pee bill (not joking, and neither were they), and defended your right to hate. Granted, this has provided Arizona with some excellent political entertainment. But walk through the Governor's signatures of these bills. The Agenda 21 ban? Signed. Pee bill? Killed in the House (due to global outrage turning it completely toxic, thanks everybody). The gold coin bill? Vetoed for technical reasons. But what Jan Brewer cares about is Jan Brewer. That lovely religious anarchy bill? She wrote in a letter that she regretted vetoing it, but she shot that hostage (and four more) dead to get AHCCCS expansion.

Now, to someone who has lived here for years, I feel the need to inform all of you who have not of a simple truth. Arizona is not normal. I do not mean ""weird"" the way most out of state folk mean it. I do not mean crazy. I mean there's the way the rest of the South runs, then there's how the South runs, and then there's Arizona. Arizonans like the political theater. We're the state that produced both Sinema and McCain, both Brewer and Grijalva. We expect them to be colorful, energetic, full of ideas and brilliant speeches, and if they are anything less, we tend to just stay home and let the other guy win.

Now, in terms of colorful, Jan Brewer is a damn rainbow. The electoral issue for her is to whom her colors appeal. Arizona's demographics are shifting at a breathtaking pace. The state is rapidly turning younger and browner, the electorate is moving steadily leftward on high-visibility issues. Now, were Jan Brewer running for governor again, she'd've taken the Medicaid money and not moved on immigratiion. But Brewer can't run for Governor, she's term limited. She can, however, run for McCain's seat in 2016.

Consider McCain's behavior. He's back to work on his legacy issue - immigration. On immigration, he reality checked his own party. On drones he all but body checked Rand Paul. He's monkeying in Syria, rumored to be scuttling Russian-American talks on the subject. McCain is spending political capital like a sailor spends cash, which only makes sense for one reason: he's getting done. McCain will be 80 when his term ends. Generic old at this age usually raises the r-word, but lest we forget, the man valiantly served his country under what can only be described as the most harrowing of circumstances, and carries the physical scars that go with it. I may not always agree with his politics, but he's generally proved himself to be an upright man whose convictions are real. He's earned the right to shore up his reputation, settle some old scores, and live out his days in well-earned peace on his Cornville ranch. That said, in my opinion, all signs point to Brewer burnishing her legacy in the hopes that in 2016 she'll be remembered more for Medicaid expansion than for SB1070, for denying DREAMers their licenses, for selling the Capitol, and on and on the list goes. The reason is simple - she is gambling that by the 2016 Senate race, if she can run as the Governor that worked across the aisle, she can force the Democrat to run negative against her, and Democrats do not win when we run negative.

There's only one catch. This strategy relies on collective amnesia. We would do well to let that stop being a feature of the American electorate. She's no less extreme and calculating a politician after Medicaid than before it, and the media, especially the liberal media, should remember all of her tenure, from 2009 to 2014, not from January til now. So America, do Arizona a favor - stop white-washing Jan Brewer. She doesn't deserve it."

What it turns out he is covering up and scrubbing from his Internet presence is his work as Director of Governmental Relations and Community Affairs for GFI Development Company, beginning in July 2008. GFI Development is the real estate development branch of GFI Group, which according to the company website “has been at the forefront of credit derivative brokerage services, leadership that we are now leveraging to help establish an active, liquid Exotic Credit Derivative market.” Exotic credit derivatives, for those among us with short memories, are those quaint financial instruments that enable banks to make massive bets on the failure of loans, without having to actually own any of the underlying debt. Credit derivatives caused a minor kerfuffle in the markets in late 2008. GFI Group “handled as much as 40 percent of the credit-derivatives trades between the world's banks in 2007,” according to Bloomberg. Well, Corey Johnson had nothing to do with any of that, of course…he worked for the real estate development arm of GFI. And real estate development firms are wholesome, salubrious entities. Which must be why after I asked Johnson’s campaign manger about his work there, his speaker bio at the Gay Center website was scrubbed. (Compare here and here.) And his LinkedIn profile was closed.

To recap, not only is Kurland a fantastic candidate worthy of our support, but she's running against the recession era caricature of pure, unadulterated evil: a real estate lobbyist in Manhattan working for the leader in the 'exotic derivatives' industry. A starker choice could not be made.

Full disclosure: I don't live in Kurland's district but I love her. She got me out of jail when I was arrested for operating the Illuminator.

We know now those were all lies told repeatedly and never questioned by a media that is still looking the other way. Another promise Obama made was that ObamaCare would not fund abortions. LifeNews reports that this was also a lie:

The ObamaCare statute specifically requires the issuers of Exchange plans that cover abortion to “collect from each enrollee in the plan” a “separate payment” for the type of abortions for which funding is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment (which is all abortions other than in cases of life of the mother, rape, or incest) and a separate payment for all other services. [42 U.S.C. 18023(b)]. These separate payments are then to be deposited into separate accounts.

During the regulatory process, commenters questioned HHS on how this was to be implemented, and according to HHS, the commenters “recommended that HHS clarify . . . whether [Exchange plan] issuers may satisfy the separate payment provision by providing each enrollee with an itemized bill, and whether an enrollee’s coverage would be terminated for failure to comply with the separate payment provision.” Rather than doing so, HHS merely said that the comments would be taken into consideration in any future guidance. [77 Fed. Reg. 18430 (March 27, 2012)].

Now, despite the clear language of the ObamaCare statute, it appears that the separate check requirement is not going to be enforced by the Obama Administration. Gretchen Borchelt, director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center, told the Huffington Post that “we used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements, but that’s not the way it’s being implemented.” (Huffington Post, Sept. 3, 2013).

Likewise, a spokeswoman for Rhode Island’s Exchange told PolitiFact Rhode Island that “the customer is not billed a separate fee.” (Politifact, Oct. 2, 2013. The Rhode Island Exchange will handle the billing, not the plan issuers). As PolitiFact notes, “it turns out to be a hidden fee.”

There is nothing the media is willing to make Obama pay a political price for. Not even repeatedly lying to millions who are about to lose their insurance or forcing people to violate their conscience over the abomination of abortion.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/21/obama-2013_n_4482381.html,2013-12-21 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Editor'],"Everyone Knows Obama's 2013 Was Bad, The Tough Question Is Why","WASHINGTON -- The end of the year brings with it one of journalism's lazier crutches -- the annual list of winners and losers.

Whatever value there is in judging a politician's standings in late December, it's limited. In today's hyper-kinetic Washington politics, conventional wisdom changes -- and quickly. And yet, in talking with operatives, Capitol Hill aides, Washington observers, and others, one impression is more permanent than any other: President Barack Obama had a really bad, tough-to-spin 2013.

It was, as conceded by David Axelrod, the president's longtime adviser, a ""crappy year.""

It's not just the poor rollout of the Affordable Care Act. To review: Obama worked Congress hard on gun control measures. It failed. He was hands-off with Congress on immigration reform. It failed. He pushed to avert sequestration cuts. They were enacted. He argued for unemployment benefits to be extended. They weren't. Revelations of aggressive investigations into national security leaks led to a review of Justice Department activities. Revelations that the IRS had screened tea party groups led to a reworking of the tax agency's practices. Revelations of the National Security Agency's broad surveillance programs, endorsed by Obama, led to popular revulsion, a court rebuke, another review, and likely reforms.

That a government shutdown gave the president one of his better moments says something about the year. Shortly after the October standoff was resolved, with polls showing a majority blamed Republicans, the anti-Obama dam broke. The ACA rollout was a disaster, and a signature promise of the program that Obama made himself was proven hollow.

At his year-end press conference Friday, Obama declined to call it the worst year of his presidency.

""I have now been in office five years, close to five years, was running for president for two years before that, and for those who've covered me during that time, we have had ups and we have had downs,"" he said. ""I think this room has probably recorded at least 15 near-death experiences.""



As proof that his rumored demise may be premature, Obama noted recent legislative activity and the prospect of a continued thaw. Obama's defenders, meanwhile, argued that some 2013 setbacks should be placed in context. The IRS ""scandal"" lost fizz when it became clear that the agency had screened progressive groups, too. Sequestration relief was passed during the year-end budget deal. Even the stalled immigration reform effort has an upside.

""We actually aren’t quite as gloomy about this year,"" said Matt Bennett, senior vice president for public affairs and a co-founder of the centrist-Democratic group Third Way. ""Yes, the ACA rollout was very rocky. But if they get their act fully together on that, he may be in for a more productive year in 2014 than many expect. He got a really good immigration bill out of the Senate, and there is hope in the House once the primary filing deadlines pass. ... We actually made some headway on gun safety -- getting a vote on final passage and a handful of Republicans is nothing to sneeze at. So we see a few green shoots. Of course, we don’t yet know if they are flowers or weeds.""

But even when taking those green shoots into account, it's impossible to argue that Obama has been on a course he's enjoyed. The charts don't lie.

The more pertinent question (one whose answer has implications for the years ahead) is whether to blame personal missteps and mismanagement, or unforeseen events and structural problems with the political system?

For Axelrod, the president and his team aren't entirely blameless. Part of the damage was ""self-inflicted,"" including the ""atrocious rollout of the health care website,"" he said. But broader issues outside of Obama's control were more determinative.

""The fact is you start out wanting to talk about and work on one set of issues and then events drag you to other places,"" Axelrod said, pointing to the Newtown shootings and Syrian civil war as examples. ""That is really the story of this year. ... A lot of it has to do with random events and orchestrated subversion on the part of the opposition.""

Certainly, there were moments during the year when the president was forced off of his agenda. White House officials had planned a big jobs-related legislative push in January, for example, before the docket was overwhelmed by gun control. Other Democrats argued that the kinks of the political system did Obama in, with Republicans rewarded above all else for obstinacy.

""No White House is perfect and everyone makes mistakes, but I do think the structural problems overwhelmed everything else because it just became apparent that nothing could happen,"" said Bennett. ""The degree of dysfunction was historic. ... He could have been Lincoln in 1863 and he wouldn't have been able to do anything.""

But Republican obstruction isn't exactly new. Nor is the notion that the news cycle is unwieldy and difficult to control. Other Democrats were sympathetic to the president, but more inclined to say that Obama and his team were responsible for the mess.

Mike Lux, who served as Obama's liaison to the progressive community during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the administration since, argued that self-assuredness played a damaging role, preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon. When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination, the advice was heard, but not necessarily heeded.

""I feel like the White House goes it alone too much,"" said Lux. ""In advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem, it doesn't seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion in the party and with progressive allies.""

A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: ""These guys are stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn't smell, that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt them.""

As for policy, insularity has become the enemy of originality, Lux argued. That's led to an administration too comfortable with conventional wisdom. The president didn't challenge the intelligence community over the surveillance programs, and he made back room deals that complicated the health care law unnecessarily.

What's ironic, others said, is that Obama is more comfortable as president now than at any point since he was elected. Drew Westen, a professor at Emory University, famously criticized Obama in 2011 on the op-ed pages of The New York Times for acquiescing too much to his opponents and for uninspiring oratory.

Today, Westen praises Obama for increasingly relying on executive actions. If he were to grade Obama, he said he'd give him higher marks than ""in all his prior years."" Where Obama's administration has been tripped up, he argued, has been in a failure to elevate issues and messages that matter.

""There were people like me who at the end of 2009 were saying, 'You have got to start messaging in a coherent way about not only health care, but about what you are going to do about jobs and reigning in the power of banks, protecting consumers against predatory lending and credit practices that the average person was furious about,'"" said Westen ""That stuff was all clearly predictable by the end of 2009. Where I would fault him now is that I think he is doing the same thing again before this midterm election.""

A request for comment from the White House was not returned. But it seems clear already that Obama and his team see value in Westen's point. In recent weeks, the administration has begun focusing on income inequality, wage stagnation and the need to spur job growth. Aides stressed that one of the first orders of business in 2014 will be getting unemployment insurance renewed.

""The core issue of the 2012 campaign was strengthening economic security for the middle class,"" said one former White House official. ""The question is whether putting every other issue on the back burner and focusing on that out of the gate would have changed the outcomes. My answer: maybe not significantly, but somewhat.""

And then there is the Occam's razor view of what went wrong. Had the Affordable Care Act's rollout not been so badly botched, the year-end retrospective would have been kinder.

Howard Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Vermont governor, argued as much when asked for his assessment. Every president who wins a second term suffers setbacks during his fifth year in office, Dean noted. And in all cases, the problems confronting Obama had to do either with a policy that he pushed or a personal decision that he made.

""It wasn't a policy issue, it was a digital problem,"" Dean said. ""He is in trouble because of the website.""

And for that reason, there is hope for a bounce in 2014.

""I would argue that if he didn't have the website collapse, he wouldn't be subjected to the five-year curse as much,"" said Dean. ""All the other five-year curses were of the sitting president's own making. This one you may argue that three people down the line screwed up the website, not Obama. ... I do not think that he has been personally stained the way the other presidents were.""

http://news.yahoo.com/fast-food-strikes-return-amid-push-wage-hikes-114457533--finance.html,,[],Fast-food strikes return amid push for wage hikes,"NEW YORK (AP) — Fast-food workers and labor organizers are marching, waving signs and chanting in cities across the country Thursday amid a push for higher wages.

Organizers say walkouts are planned in 100 cities, with rallies set for another 100 cities. But it's not clear what the actual turnout will be, how many of the participants are workers and what impact they'll have on restaurant operations.

The actions would mark the largest showing yet in a push that began a year ago. At a time when there's growing national and international attention on economic disparities, labor unions, worker advocacy groups and Democrats are hoping to build public support to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25, or about $15,000 a year for full-time work.

Protesters are calling for pay of $15 an hour, but the figure is seen more as a rallying point than a near-term possibility.

In New York City, about 100 protesters blew whistles and beat drums while marching into a McDonald's at around 6:30 a.m.; one startled customer grabbed his food and fled as they flooded the restaurant, while another didn't look up from eating and reading amid their chants of ""We can't survive on $7.25!""

Community leaders took turns giving speeches for about 15 minutes until the police arrived and ordered protesters out of the store. The crowd continued to demonstrate outside for about 45 minutes. A McDonald's manager declined to be interviewed and asked that the handful of customers in the store not be bothered.

In Detroit, about 50 demonstrators turned out for a pre-dawn rally in front of a McDonald's. A handful of employees walked off the job, but the restaurant stayed open as a manager and other employees worked the front counter and drive-thru window.

Julius Waters, a 29-year-old McDonald's maintenance worker who was among the protesters, said it's hard making ends meet on his wage of $7.40 an hour.

""I need a better wage for myself, because, right now, I'm relying on aid, and $7.40 is not able to help me maintain taking care of my son. I'm a single parent,"" Waters said.

Story continues

In Atlanta, about 40 demonstrators rallied at a Burger King; another demonstration was planned later in the day.

The push for higher pay in the fast-food industry faces an uphill battle. The industry competes aggressively on value offerings and companies have warned that they would need to raise prices if wages were hiked. Most fast-food locations are also owned and operated by franchisees, which lets companies such as McDonald's Corp., Burger King Worldwide Inc. and Yum Brands Inc. say that they don't control worker pay.

However, labor advocates have pointed out that companies control many other aspects of restaurant operations through their franchise agreements, including menus, suppliers and equipment.

Fast-food workers have historically been seen as difficult to unionize, given the industry's high turnover rates. But the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million workers in health care, janitorial and other industries, has been providing considerable organizational and financial support to the push for higher pay over the past year.

Berlin Rosen, a political consulting and public relations firm based in New York City, also has been coordinating communications efforts and connecting organizers with media outlets.

The National Restaurant Association, an industry lobbying group, said most those protesting were union workers and that ""relatively few"" workers have participated in past actions. It called the demonstrations a ""campaign engineered by national labor groups.""

McDonald's said in a statement that it's ""committed to providing our employees with opportunities to succeed."" The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said it offers employees advancement opportunities, competitive pay and benefits.

In the meantime, the protests are getting some high-powered support from the White House. In an economic policy speech Wednesday, President Barack Obama specifically mentioned fast-food and retail workers ""who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty"" in his call for raising the federal minimum wage.

Labor Secretary Thomas Perez also offered words of support for the protesters on the agency's blog.

""We see momentum gathering and a consensus emerging around the idea that we need to increase the federal minimum wage, to give these workers and millions like them a fair day's pay for a fair day's work,"" Perez said in the statement.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has promised a vote on the wage hike by the end of the year. But the measure is not expected to gain traction in the House, where Republican leaders oppose it.

Supporters of wage hikes have been more successful at the state and local level. California, Connecticut and Rhode Island raised their minimum wages this year. Last month, voters in New Jersey approved an increase in the minimum to $8.25 an hour, up from $7.25 an hour.

USA TODAY

President Obama said Friday he likes the proposed congressional budget deal, but Congress should also extend soon-to-expire unemployment insurance.

""You've potentially 1.3 million people who, during Christmastime, are going to lose their unemployment benefits, at a time when it's still very difficult for a lot of folks to find a job,"" Obama said before meeting with a group of newly elected mayors from across the country.

""That's not just bad for those individuals and for those families, that's bad for our economy and that's bad for our cities,"" Obama said.

The House approved a two-year budget agreement on Thursday, and the Senate is expected to vote next week.

The two-year plan would avoid ""the constant brinksmanship and crisis governance that we've seen up on Capitol Hill that impedes growth and makes businesses and investors less certain about wanting to put their money in,"" Obama said.

The budget, he said, is something the federal government can do to help mayors create jobs, the topic of Obama's meeting with the mayors.

The president also again advocated an increase in the minimum wage, saying ""that could have a tremendous boost in a lot of the cities where there are a lot of service workers.""

After the meeting, some of the participating mayors said they also discussed income inequality, early childhood education, the Detroit bankruptcy, and other issues specific to their cities.

""It's very clear the president is focused on wages and benefits,"" said Bill de Blasio, the mayor-elect of New York City.

Senator says immigration stats show welfare rules not enforced,"Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is accusing the Obama administration of failing to enforce a century-old law meant to prevent immigrants from taking root in the U.S. only to live on the government dole -- after the administration reported it did not cite anyone for this last year.

""Virtually no one one is being examined before they enter the country on whether or not they'll ... immediately begin to depend on government welfare,"" Sessions, R-Ala., top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, told Fox News.

As Congress weighs new immigration legislation, Sessions said any reform package ""has got to end that.""

Sessions turned up new statistics from the Department of Homeland Security last week showing what he describes as a startling trend. DHS reported how relatively few immigrants are being turned away on the grounds that they are likely to become a ""public charge"" -- or individuals who depend on welfare programs -- despite a 100-year-old law that's supposed to prevent this.

The department, blaming ""data entry quality,"" said it did not have complete information on how many immigrants became public charges. But the department did a case-by-case review for the bulk of fiscal 2012, and found just one where that claim was leveled at an immigrant. ""However, the charge was later withdrawn,"" DHS reported.

Further, the department reported that just a tiny fraction of people are rejected on these grounds when seeking entry under a program that allows admission for 90 days for travelers from certain countries. Between fiscal 2005 and most of fiscal 2012, a total of 9,796 were denied -- a fraction of a percent of those admitted. State Department figures for visa applications showed a similar trend, with just .068 percent of visa applications denied on those grounds in fiscal 2011.

Sessions has been hammering this issue for months. He and other Republican senators earlier wrote to the departments of Homeland Security and State arguing that a bedrock principle of immigration law is that ""those who seek citizenship in this country ought to be financially self-sufficient.""

The senator suggests the immigration system has produced a lopsided result in which high-skill immigrants are turned away while those who end up absorbing more taxpayer dollars than they contribute stay.

Recent studies show welfare spending on immigrant-headed households is relatively high. A Center for Immigration Studies report found that 36 percent of these households were using ""at least one major welfare program"" in 2010 -- compared with 23 percent of other households.

Sessions' office says the number of non-citizens on food stamps has skyrocketed in recent years. And the conservative Heritage Foundation claims low-skill immigrant households take in roughly $20,000 more in government benefits every year than they pay in taxes.

Sessions suggests the government is fueling this trend. He earlier made a stink over long-running U.S. Department of Agriculture radio ""novelas"" that depicted people being pressured into going on food stamps. The ads were later discontinued. The senator also is drawing attention to the WelcomeToUSA.gov site that provides information on a host of taxpayer assistance programs for immigrants, including Medicare, food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and others."

Congress went home for the holidays without approving a federally funded extension of jobless benefits for about 1.3 million Americans who have been out of work six months or longer. And Republicans, who control the House, are showing little inclination to take up the measure when lawmakers return Jan. 7.

For unemployed Californians, the cutoff caps a year made more difficult by the state’s Employment Development Department, which has been struggling since September with a botched upgrade of its aging computer systems. Payments to tens of thousands of unemployed workers have been delayed, sometimes for months. EDD workers are still processing many claims by hand, reducing the staff available to answer phone calls from frustrated clients.

As if those troubles weren’t enough, the state’s unemployment insurance fund is broke and there’s no solid plan to fund it. California owes the federal government $9 billion it borrowed to pay benefits during the recession. So far, politicians in Sacramento haven’t reached an agreement on how to repay those funds. Options include raising taxes on employers, cutting benefits to the unemployed or some combination of both.

“It’s been the most challenging year in decades,” said Maurice Emsellem, the co-policy director for the National Employment Law Project in Oakland, which advocates for the poor and working poor. “And the irony is that claims are down. Fewer workers are collecting benefits, but [EDD workers] are having a harder time processing claims. People are falling through the cracks and having a harder time than ever getting through to the system.”

Currently, about 712,000 Californians are receiving unemployment benefits, down from 1.5 million at the peak of the recession. The jobless rate, now at 8.5%, has been falling as the economy picks up steam and California companies add jobs.

But California has about 400,000 fewer jobs than it did before the downturn, and times are still tough for many of the state’s long-term unemployed.

Kaitlyn Smith, 24, of Twentynine Palms will lose her $450-a-week benefit when the federal extension expires this weekend. A Marine Corps veteran and the mother of two young children, Smith says she has been searching for work, but it’s hard to come by in the high desert. The family can’t move because her husband, a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, must remain near the combat center until he’s discharged from the Marines in July.

The loss of her benefits will cut deeply into the couple’s income. Smith said the family is already skimping on basics, including heat, because the EDD has been behind on her payments.

“I have to keep the house at 55 degrees even though I have two little girls, ages 21/2 and 11/2,” Smith said. She said she has placed hundreds of calls to the EDD in the last few months, reaching an agent only once.

Unemployment benefits differ from state to state. In California, the state provides 26 weeks of assistance paid from employer taxes. Maximum weekly benefits are $450 in California, and the average payment is $305 a week. To be eligible, recipients have to regularly show proof that they are seeking employment.

After that, the federal government kicks in for the long-term jobless, who recently have been eligible to receive 37 weeks of benefits on top of the initial state help. These are being cut off Saturday.

According to the EDD, 28% of the state’s unemployed have been out of work for one year or more. Many are older workers, who often have difficulty getting rehired.

Robert Rowe, 55, is hoping to buck the odds. The Westlake Village resident has been unemployed since October, when he lost his job as an aerospace welder. He has been looking for work in construction and as a substance abuse counselor, but he hasn’t turned up anything so far.

Rowe said many employers “consider age, healthcare costs and longevity” when deciding to hire, putting veteran workers such as himself at a disadvantage. Still, he’s looking to a strengthening economy to help him land something after the holidays.

“It’s a little bit rougher,” Rowe said. “It’s not fun, but I’m persevering.”

Since June 2008, Congress has approved 11 extensions of unemployment benefits. At one point, the combination of state and federal assistance reached a maximum of 99 weeks in California.

The federal cutoff could have dire consequences for California’s slowly healing economy, Gov. Jerry Brown said this month. It “will have a ripple effect on the broader economy,” he warned in a Dec. 12 letter to congressional leaders.

The Employment Law Project estimated that the elimination of federal unemployment assistance would remove $4 billion from California’s economy next year.

Despite pressure from President Obama and top congressional Democrats, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives refused to extend federally funded assistance when it passed a $1-trillion budget bill Dec. 12. The Senate approved the same legislation six days later.

Republicans have cited a variety of reasons for not renewing the federal unemployment benefits. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told NBC News this week that providing benefits to the long-term unemployed hurts their chances of getting rehired. He also said that Democrats should be willing to raise taxes to pay for continuing benefits instead of adding to the size of the federal budget deficit.

But supporters of additional long-term jobless benefits haven’t given up. Members in both houses have introduced measures that could be considered early next year to extend the federal unemployment program through the end of 2014.

In the meantime, the EDD has sent out letters to recipients of the federal aid, alerting them to Saturday’s cutoff and advising them to check the department’s website for updates at edd.ca.gov

The letters also highlighted a network of available job centers at americasjobcenter.ca.gov and a variety of other government and private social services.

The EDD, meanwhile, has been under attack for its failure to provide timely services to jobless Californians. Last month, the Assembly Insurance Committee took top agency officials to task during an oversight hearing. Unemployed workers testified that it was nearly impossible to reach an operator or caseworker, despite an expensive EDD upgrade of the telephone system.

EDD spokeswoman Loree Levy acknowledged that “we are not able to answer the phones the way we would like and our customers deserve.” She blamed the difficulty on federal budget cuts and staff reductions.

That’s little consolation to jobless Californians who are struggling to pay their bills.

Ted James LaDuca, an out-of-work graphic artist from San Francisco, said he qualified for unemployment benefits in early November. As of last week, he said he had received only two payments.

“Like so many others, I can’t seem to get in touch with anyone from EDD,” LaDuca said. “I feel so completely lost and hopeless over this.”

Despite the many differences I had with former President George W. Bush on a range of public policy issues, or as he called them, “decision points,” I found common ground with him in one area, simply because we decided to put aside partisanship and do something good.

But rather than rehash all that went wrong, I want to share what I believe to have been President Bush’s determination to follow up on commitments, and the intense, personal, dedicated efforts he made to revive and restore people’s futures. I know what I’m talking about.

Bush 43: ‘History will ultimately judge’

Kathleen Blanco, Louisiana’s governor in 2005, asked me to serve on the state’s commission overseeing the long-term recovery from the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. I’ve kept a close watch over the last eight years.

Hurricane Katrina wasn’t one natural disaster: It was a triple whammy of water, winds and lawlessness. An Army Corps engineer on CBS talked this week about Midwest flooding: “Water is the perfect instrument of destruction,” he said. He is so right: Katrina’s waters laid waste to an area the size of Great Britain. Its winds reached 174 mph and, together, they took 1,833 lives.

Every member of my family was displaced by Katrina. Last year, I lost both my father and sister. But I had them with me that much longer because they were rescued from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. My father, Lionel, left New Orleans only two times in his life. The first was to serve his country in Korea. The second was when FEMA evacuated him to San Antonio, Texas.

How will history remember George W. Bush?

My older sister, Sheila – people sometimes thought we were twins, we looked so much alike – was in an assisted care home. Sheila developed a brain tumor in childhood. Brain surgery left her needing help, although she still managed to finish high school and college. When FEMA officials told me it might be weeks before we found Sheila, I was furious.

CNN’s Wolf Blitzer made a public plea for nearby citizens to see if the residents had survived. Eddie Rodriguez of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and our cousin, Keith, a cop, rescued her from the building’s rooftop. Most other residents had left before her. Sheila wouldn’t leave until she saw someone she knew. Like so many others, she was relocated to Baton Rouge.

Bitterness can corrode the soul. A grudge is like the chains on Marley’s ghost. Donna Brazile

My 92-year-old great uncle Henry, a WWII vet, was plucked from another rooftop and transported to Roswell, Georgia, only to suffer a heart attack. All seven of my remaining siblings, my father, uncle, aunts, and other relatives, lost everything in Katrina. I was upset – mad as hell – and disappointed But, I made a decision not to act out – act against Bush – but rather to turn to his administration for help, and to offer my help.

“Mr. President,” I said, “how can I help you?”

“Civility,” he said.

Opinion: Jury is still out on Bush

Bitterness can corrode the soul. A grudge is like the chains on Marley’s ghost. We can carry these chains in life and they weigh us down. President Obama and former President Bush have been working for eight years to change the atmosphere in Washington, to get Congress to move beyond pride and party.

So far, not even disasters or tragedies that have united the American people – Hurricane Sandy, Sandy Hook, and Boston – have moved the politicians. Not enough, anyway.

Bush understood the need for civility. I joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger-pointing and blame-making. Donna Brazile

Bush understood the need for civility. I joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger-pointing and blame-making. He flew to New Orleans and addressed the nation: “Tonight I also offer this pledge to the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives.”

Glimpse at a White House before everything changed

George W. Bush was good as his word. He visited the Gulf states 17 times; went 13 times to New Orleans. Laura Bush made 24 trips. Bush saw that $126 billion in aid was sent to the Gulf’s residents, as some members of his own party in Congress balked.

Bush put a special emphasis on rebuilding schools and universities. He didn’t forget African-Americans: Bush provided $400 million to the historically black colleges, now integrated, that remain a pride, and magnet for African-American students. Laura Bush, a librarian, saw to it that thousands of books ruined by the floods were replaced. To this day, there are many local libraries with tributes devoted to her efforts.

It was a team effort. I’m glad to report the commission I served on went out-of-business in 2010. I’m also grateful and proud to report that President Bush was one of the leaders, and a very important member, of that team. Our recovery can be credited to the civility and tireless efforts of President Bush and other Americans, who united and worked together to help rebuild the Gulf and the place of my birth, New Orleans.

Carter', 'Susanna Capelouto']","Report: NSA among worst offenders of mass surveillance, Snowden says","Story highlights NEW: Edward Snowden purportedly writes that his actions have prompted debate NEW: U.S. lawmakers says he does not deserve clemency and should answer for his actions The letter was published by Der Spiegel, and it is titled ""A Manifesto for the Truth"" Snowden is wanted in the United States on espionage charges

(CNN) —

Leaked classified documents show the U.S. National Security Agency and its British counterpart are among the “worst offenders” of mass surveillance without oversight, according to an open letter purportedly written by Edward Snowden and published Sunday by the German magazine Der Spiegel.

The publication of the letter, titled “A Manifesto for the Truth,” comes as leaks by the former NSA contract analyst have roiled U.S.-European relations amid allegations that the NSA and the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters monitored the communication data of some world leaders.

“The world has learned a lot in a short amount of time about irresponsibly operated security agencies and, at times, criminal surveillance programs. Sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls,” Snowden wrote, according to the news magazine.

“While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders – at least according to the documents that are currently public – we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution.”

The letter, published in German by Der Spiegel, was written on Friday in Moscow and provided to Der Spiegel through a “locked channel,” the news magazine said. It was published in German and has been translated by CNN.

Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges.

A recent report by Der Spiegel, citing documents provided by Snowden, alleged the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens.

The allegations have prompted some European countries to call for investigations. It also has prompted congressional hearings in the United States, where some are calling for more transparency and more oversight of American spy programs.

Opinion: Don’t underestimate risks of government spying

’Witch hunt’

The letter also accused governments of trying to squash debate about mass surveillance “with a never before seen witch hunt” that threatens journalists and criminalizes the publication of details about the programs.

In the letter, Snowden purportedly writes that his actions were bringing about change.

“The debate they wanted to avoid is now taking place in countries around the world,” the letter said.

“And instead of causing damage, the use of this new public knowledge is causing society to push for political reforms, oversight and new laws.”

Snowden has been in Moscow since June after fleeing from Hong Kong. In August, Russia granted him asylum for one year.

Snowden gets website job in Russia

The release of the open letter is the second in a matter of days from Snowden, who released a letter to German authorities through an intermediary.

Last week, Hans-Christian Stroebele, a member of Germany’s parliament, met with Snowden in Russia. Stroebele returned from the meeting with a letter from Snowden to German authorities, which was distributed to the media.

In it, Snowden said he is confident that with international support, the United States would abandon its efforts to “treat dissent as defection” and “criminalize political speech with felony charges.”

“I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of fact regarding reports in the media, particularly in regard to the truth and authenticity of documents, as appropriate and in accordance with the law,” he wrote.

Report: Snowden’s Russia asylum not breached by NSA spying reports

’Face justice’

The White House did not immediately respond to Snowden’s claims in the letter.

But earlier Sunday, White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC’s “This Week” that there has been no discussion of granting Snowden clemency.

“Mr. Snowden violated U.S. law,” Pfeiffer said. “And our belief has always been that he should return to the U.S. and face justice.”

It was a sentiment echoed by the heads of the House and Senate intelligence committees.

“He had an opportunity – if what he was, was a whistle-blower – to pick up the phone and call the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and say, ‘I have some information,’” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said Snowden has to “own up with what he’s done.”

“If he wants to come back and open up to the responsibility of the fact that he took and stole information, he violated his oath, he disclosed classified information – that by the way has allowed three different terrorist organizations, affiliates of al Qaeda to change the way they communicate – I’d be happy to have that discussion with him,” Rogers said on “Face the Nation.”

http://news.yahoo.com/audit-usda-paid-millions-in-federal-aid-to-dead-farmers-172308601.html,,[],Audit: USDA paid millions in federal aid to dead farmers,"More than $30 million in federal aid has been doled out to deceased farmers in recent years because of lax oversight by U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, according to a government audit.

An inspection by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office revealed that the USDA’s conservation and crop insurance programs failed to match subsidy claims against the Social Security Administration’s file of deceased individuals. The payouts went to about 4,500 farmers between 2008 and 2012.

According to estimates in the report, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) made $10.6 million in payments to 1,103 deceased individuals for a year or more after their deaths. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) made $22 million in subsidies and allowances to 3,434 program policyholders for two or more years after death.

This is a drop in the bucket given the $20 billion the USDA spends yearly to help more than 1 million participants, says Bob Young, chief economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.

“In the overall grand scheme of things, it was not a whole heck of a lot of money,” Young told Yahoo News. “Any dollar that is not spent properly is an issue, admittedly. But, wow, in terms of overall percentages of money that were put out of whatever, I thought it was kind of amazing that it was as small as it was.”

The USDA’s written response to the audit stated it “generally agrees with the report’s findings and recommendations” but defended the agencies by pointing out that the programs had close working relationships with participants and imposed yearly reporting.

“Although NRCS and RMA can identify some deceased participants during their normal operations, we do not believe that identifying deceased individuals during normal operations is a reliable substitute for having a systematic process,” federal auditors wrote.

Young says he doubts very few farming families tried to deliberately fraud the government.

“Sometimes you’ll end up with some time between when a person passes away and the time the estate gets restructured or whatever, and you’ll get a payment that gets caught in the middle,” Young says.

Story continues

The RMA, the report notes, put a computer system in place and started checking claims against the government’s list of deceased persons in May.

The GAO’s fraud findings come at time when Washington is squabbling over the cost of the current farm bill, which expires in two months.

In its report to Congress, federal auditors said their findings “may call into question whether these safety net programs are benefiting the agriculture sector as intended.”"

Why is there more anger, vituperation, and political polarization now than even during Joe McCarthy's anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s, the tempestuous struggle for civil rights in the 1960s, the divisive Vietnam war, or the Watergate scandal?

If anything, you'd think this would be an era of relative calm. The Soviet Union has disappeared and the Cold War is over. The Civil Rights struggle continues, but at least we now have a black middle class and even a black president. While the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been controversial, the all-volunteer army means young Americans aren't being dragged off to war against their will. And although politicians continue to generate scandals, the transgressions don't threaten the integrity of our government as did Watergate.

And yet, by almost every measure, Americans are angrier today. They're more contemptuous of almost every major institution -- government, business, the media. They're more convinced the nation is on the wrong track. And they are far more polarized.

Political scientists say the gap between the median Republican voter and the median Democrat is wider today on a whole host of issues than it's been since the 1920s.

Undoubedly, social media play a part -- allowing people to pop off without bearing much responsibility for what they say. And most of us can cocoon within virtual or real communities whose members confirm all our biases and assumptions.

Meanwhile, cable news and yell radio compete for viewers and listeners by being ever more strident. Not long ago I debated a Republican economic advisor on a cable TV program. During the brief station-break, the show's producer told me to ""be angrier."" I told her I didn't want to be angrier. ""You have to,"" she said. ""Viewers are surfing through hundreds of channels and will stop for a gladiator contest.""

Within this cacophony, we've lost trusted arbiters of truth -- the Edward Murrows and Walter Cronkites who could explain what was happening in ways most Americans found convincing.

We've also lost most living memory of an era in which we were all in it together -- the Great Depression and World War II -- when we succeeded or failed together. In those years we were palpably dependent on one another, and understood how much we owed each other as members of the same society.

But I think the deeper explanation for what has happened has economic roots. From the end of World War II through the late 1970s, the economy doubled in size -- as did almost everyone's income. Almost all Americans grew together. In fact, those in the bottom fifth of the income ladder saw their incomes more than double. Americans experienced upward mobility on a grand scale.

Yet for the last three and a half decades, the middle class has been losing ground. The median wage of male workers is now lower than it was in 1980, adjusted for inflation.

In addition, all the mechanisms we've used over the last three decades to minimize the effects of this descent -- young mothers streaming into paid work in the late 1970s and 1980s, everyone working longer hours in the 1990s, and then borrowing against the rising values of our homes -- are now exhausted. And wages are still dropping -- the median is now 4 percent below what it was at the start of the so-called recovery.

Meanwhile, income, wealth, and power have become more concentrated at the top than they've been in ninety years.

As a result, many have come to believe that the deck is stacked against them. Importantly, both the Tea Party and the Occupier movements began with the bailouts of Wall Street -- when both groups concluded that big government and big finance had plotted against the rest of us. The former blamed government; the latter blamed Wall Street.

Political scientists have also discovered a high correlationbetween inequality and political divisiveness.

The last time America was this bitterly divided was in the 1920s, which was the last time income, wealth, and power were this concentrated.

When average people feel the game is rigged, they get angry. And that anger can easily find its way into deep resentments -- of the poor, of blacks, of immigrants, of unions, of the well-educated, of government.

This shouldn't be surprising. Demagogues throughout history have used anger to target scapegoats -- thereby dividing and conquering, and distracting people from the real sources of their frustrations.

Make no mistake: The savage inequality America is experiencing today is deeply dangerous.

Let's compare labor's share of income to the S&P 500 since 2000.

Two things to note - the stock market is going up while labor's share is going down. I don't think is a a real surprise, but the graph shows the cause pretty well. But there is a second point I want to make as well. In addition to a lack of demand, a world where the rich have too much money is a world that is going to be subject to asset bubbles. If the rich don't spend their money it is going to go somewhere. That somewhere is in part various financial markets. But because financial markets are prone to panic, I think you can predict that we will see more bubbles build and then burst.

The graph suggests at least in part that my second point is true is well.

There are many conclusions you can draw on this. Some here will say that this is a house of cards that will all come crashing down. I don't think this is really right for a variety of reasons. But I DO think that until something happens to change the balance of power between labor and capital, the economy will not perform as it could, and the fruits of that economy will be very unequally distributed.

I close with Marriner Eccles' (the head of the Fed under FDR) famous explanation of the cause of the Great Depression. His words ring true today:



As mass production has to be accompanied by mass consumption, mass consumption, in turn, implies a distribution of wealth -- not of existing wealth, but of wealth as it is currently produced -- to provide men with buying power equal to the amount of goods and services offered by the nation's economic machinery. [Emphasis in original.] Instead of achieving that kind of distribution, a giant suction pump had by 1929-30 drawn into a few hands an increasing portion of currently produced wealth. This served them as capital accumulations. But by taking purchasing power out of the hands of mass consumers, the savers denied to themselves the kind of effective demand for their products that would justify a reinvestment of their capital accumulations in new plants. In consequence, as in a poker game where the chips were concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, the other fellows could stay in the game only by borrowing. When their credit ran out, the game stopped.

Since this is on the reclist, I thought I would point people to a very wonkish - but still important piece by Brad Delong this morning. Delong is pretty much required reading if you want to understand the economy - he was one of the leaders of the attacks on Reinhart and Rogoff.

He notes in part about the incredible gap between corporate profits and the Treasury rate:""Right now the profit share in the US economy is at levels far and away higher than I at least ever imagined I would see. And, given the high profit share and the extremely low return on Treasury notes the stock market is far and away lower than I at least ever imagined I would see. With downward pressure on real wages from elevated unemployment making it more likely that profits will grow faster than the economy rather than shrink, the 9% point gap between the S&P earnings yield of 7% and the Treasury note real yield of -2%--I never thought I would see anything like this in my lifetime."""

Unanimous ruling protects biotechnology entrepreneurs from predators

Justices gave little credence to Indiana farmer%27s argument

Ruling does not settle all future cases involving self-replicating products

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court usually isn't friendly toward questionable patents, but it came down overwhelmingly on the side of agribusiness giant Monsanto Monday in a case that's bound to resonate throughout the biotechnology industry.

The court ruled unanimously that an Indiana farmer violated Monsanto's patent on genetically modified soybeans when he culled some from a grain elevator and used them to replant his own crop in future years.

""If simple copying were a protected use, a patent would plummet in value after the first sale of the first item containing the invention,"" Justice Elena Kagan ruled in a short 10-page opinion. ""The undiluted patent monopoly, it might be said, would extend not for 20 years as the Patent Act promises, but for only one transaction. And that would result in less incentive for innovation than Congress wanted.""

Who it helps: Inventors and entrepreneurs who have patents on products that can be self-replicated, from computer software to cell lines. While Kagan's decision is limited to the Monsanto case, it bolsters the argument that self-replicating products can be protected from patent infringement even if their challengers go through third parties.

Who it hurts: Consumers paying high prices. The Center for Food Safety released a report in February that showed three corporations control much of the global commercial seed market. It found that from 1995-2011, the average cost to plant 1 acre of soybeans rose 325%.

What's to come: Still pending is a decision on whether human genes can be patented. That case tests a company's patent on the genes that can identify an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. During oral arguments in April, the justices seemed far more skeptical of the merits of that patent.

Monsanto's soybeans represent the cream of the crop because they are resistant to the weed killer Roundup. Farmers must pay Monsanto's price to plant the beans themselves.

That's not what Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman did. After one year of going through Monsanto, he bought his second crop from a grain elevator. Then he used his own soybeans that resisted Roundup in future years -- in essence, the court said, making copies of a patented invention.

Bowman's attorney, Mark Walters, had argued that the Monsanto seeds were acquired innocently enough from the grain elevator, and that Bowman's little operation never would threaten the company's monopoly.

Two lower federal courts weren't impressed with Bowman's case, ruling in favor of Monsanto. And that argument carried little weight with the justices when the case was argued in February. They noted that Monsanto had spent hundreds of millions of dollars over more than a decade to perfect its soybeans -- something it would not have done if others could so easily replicate them.

Bowman contended the soybeans were ""self-replicating,"" but Kagan said that ""blame-the-bean defense"" wasn't worthy.

""Bowman was not a passive observer of his soybeans' multiplication,"" she said. ""Or, put another way, the seeds he purchased, miraculous though they might be in other respects, did not spontaneously create eight successive soybean crops.

""It was Bowman, and not the bean, who controlled the reproduction (unto the eighth generation) of Monsanto's patented invention,"" Kagan said.

Monsanto officials applauded the decision, not just for the company but for innovators of all shapes and sizes.

""The court's ruling today ensures that longstanding principles of patent law apply to breakthrough 21st century technologies that are central to meeting the growing demands of our planet and its people,"" said David F. Snively, the company's executive vice president. ""The ruling also provides assurance to all inventors throughout the public and private sectors that they can and should continue to invest in innovation that feeds people, improves lives, creates jobs, and allows America to keep its competitive edge.""

Jim Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said the ruling will benefit all forms of biotechnology, ""as well as the patients, farmers and consumers who benefit from biotechnology's help in healing, feeding and fueling the world.""

But Center for Food Safety executive director Andrew Kimbrell called the ruling a setback for farmers. ""The court chose to protect Monsanto over farmers,"" he said. ""The court's ruling is contrary to logic and to agronomics, because it improperly attributes seeds' reproduction to farmers, rather than nature.""

Fordham University School of Law professor Mark Patterson noted the decision stops short of determining how self-reproducing inventions should be handled in all cases.

""Justice Kagan, in the last paragraph of the opinion, noted that 'such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse,'"" Patterson said. ""Either the court or Congress will have to address them again soon.""

It is hard to understand anyone’s objection to it. A country cannot frown on citizen’s using public assistance if it does not create an economy that pays a living wage to all its citizens that are working.

The following snippet with the most relevant bullets from his New Rules segment on the minimum wage is on point.

Bill Maher’s New Rules Snippet On The Minimum Wage When it comes to raising the minimum wage Conservatives always say it is a non-starter because it cuts into profits. … You might think that paying people enough to live is so self-evident that even crazy people could understand it. But you would be wrong. … Michele Bachmann is not only against raising the minimum wage, she is against having one at all. She wants said “… if we took away the minimum wage … we could … virtually wipe out unemployment … because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.” … And naturally Ted Cruz agrees. Ted Cruz thinks it’s a good thing that when his Cuban father came to America he was paid fifty cents an hour to work as a dishwasher. … When did the American dream become this pathway to indentured servitude, this economic death spiral where workers get paid next to nothing, so they can only afford to buy next to nothing, so businesses are forced to sell cheaper and cheaper shit? Consider the fact that most fast food workers whose average age by the way is 29 … are on some form of public assistance which is not surprising. When even working people can’t make enough to live they take money from the government. This is the question the Right has to answer. Do you want smaller government with less handouts or do you want do you want a low minimum wage because you cannot have both. If Coronel Sanders isn’t going to pay the lady behind the counter enough to live on, then Uncle Sam has to. And I for one is getting a little tired of helping highly profitable companies pay their workers.

Bill Maher makes a very important statement. The average American citizens are subsidizing McDonald’s. Americans are subsidizing all companies that are paying below subsistence level wages.

The viral story of a McDonald’s employee calling a McDonald’s help line is probative. McDonald’s gave her information necessary to get government assistance and charity. This was a full time worker. What she really needs is an increase in the minimum wage. What she needs is the dignity of pay she can live on.

Bill Maher is late to the party. George Carlin figured out long time ago that the American Dream had become a pathway to indentured servitude. He laid it out in his “The American Dream” standup skit. The minimum wage is part of the problem. However, the problem of the poor and working middle class is much deeper.

The problem is income and wealth disparity that is getting worse. Income and growth is extracted from the poor and the middle class with policies to ensure the incessant steady growth of the wealth and income of a very few.

But I guess we must.

So: Food stamp usage has indeed soared in recent years, with the percentage of the population receiving stamps rising from 8.7 in 2007 to 15.2 in the most recent data. There is, however, no mystery here. SNAP is supposed to help families in distress, and lately a lot of families have been in distress.

In fact, SNAP usage tends to track broad measures of unemployment, like U6, which includes the underemployed and workers who have temporarily given up active job search. And U6 more than doubled in the crisis, from about 8 percent before the Great Recession to 17 percent in early 2010. It’s true that broad unemployment has since declined slightly, while food stamp numbers have continued to rise — but there’s normally some lag in the relationship, and it’s probably also true that some families have been forced to take food stamps by sharp cuts in unemployment benefits.

What about the theory, common on the right, that it’s the other way around — that we have so much unemployment thanks to government programs that, in effect, pay people not to work? (Soup kitchens caused the Great Depression!) The basic answer is, you have to be kidding. Do you really believe that Americans are living lives of leisure on $134 a month, the average SNAP benefit?

Still, let’s pretend to take this seriously. If employment is down because government aid is inducing people to stay home, reducing the labor force, then the law of supply and demand should apply: withdrawing all those workers should be causing labor shortages and rising wages, especially among the low-paid workers most likely to receive aid. In reality, of course, wages are stagnant or declining — and that’s especially true for the groups that benefit most from food stamps.

So what’s going on here? Is it just racism? No doubt the old racist canards — like Ronald Reagan’s image of the “strapping young buck” using food stamps to buy a T-bone steak — still have some traction. But these days almost half of food stamp recipients are non-Hispanic whites; in Tennessee, home of the Bible-quoting Mr. Fincher, the number is 63 percent. So it’s not all about race.

What is it about, then? Somehow, one of our nation’s two great parties has become infected by an almost pathological meanspiritedness, a contempt for what CNBC’s Rick Santelli, in the famous rant that launched the Tea Party, called “losers.” If you’re an American, and you’re down on your luck, these people don’t want to help; they want to give you an extra kick.

The move in this city of 100,000 people, which is troubled by crime and high unemployment, is part of a growing national trend that supporters say is designed to improve the community's employment prospects amid wider incarceration.

[pullquote]

Under the ordinance, approved by the City Council in a 6-1 vote and set to take effect in September, private companies that have city contracts and that employ more than nine people won't be able to ask anything about an applicant's criminal record; otherwise they would lose their city contracts. The ordinance is one of the nation's strictest ""ban-the-box"" laws, which are so called because many job applications contain a box to check if one has a criminal record.

[summary]

""Once we pay our debt, I think the playing field should be fair,"" said Andres Abarra of Richmond, who was released from San Quentin State Prison in 2006 after serving 16 months for selling heroin. Abarra, 60 years old, said he lost his first job out of prison, at a warehouse, about a month after a temporary agency hired him. The agency ran a background check and ""let me go on the spot,"" he said. He now works for an advocacy group called Safe Return that campaigned for the ordinance.

Others say the laws potentially endanger both employers and the public. ""We have a responsibility to protect our customers, protect other employees and then the company itself"" from potential crime, said Kelly Knott, senior director for government relations of the National Retail Federation, an industry group in Washington, D.C., which hasn't taken a position on ban-the-box laws but has cautioned against federal guidance that could limit how employers use background checks.

Richmond, with a population of about 100,000, joins 51 other municipalities that have passed similar ordinances, many in the past five years. Last year, Newark, N.J., barred private employers and the city government from inquiring into a job applicant's criminal history until they have made a conditional offer of employment, and employers can only take into consideration certain offenses committed within the past five to eight years.

Murder, voluntary manslaughter and sex offenses requiring registry can be inquired about no matter how much time has passed.

Ten states also have enacted ban-the-box legislation, according to the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for the laws. Many of those laws don't apply to job applications for ""sensitive"" positions, such as those involving work with children.

Michelle Rodriguez, a NELP staff attorney, said tougher sentencing laws in recent decades, particularly for drug crimes, have sent more people to prison, making post-incarceration unemployment a broader problem. ""It really could be anybody who has a criminal record now—your co-worker, your neighbor,"" Ms. Rodriguez said. ""And it doesn't mean they're a criminal. It means they had a run-in with the law.""

Homes sit smoldering after Hurricane Sandy in the Far Rockaway area of New York.

Here are the 36 votes against Sandy relief, a $50.5 billion emergency spending bill to aid victims of super storm Sandy. It passed in a 62-36 vote in the Senate Monday evening,Steve Benen did a little math with these votes. In the House,voted against emergency aid. In the Senate, those 36 votes represent. The overwhelming majority of Republicans, well more than three-quarters, now approach natural disasters as political fodder, another opportunity to push deficit hysteria and to force massive cuts to other domestic spending. Tax cuts to the wealthy? Those pay for themselves. Rebuilding destroyed communities populated by millions of Americans? Only if you cut other government programs. In other words, the vast majority of Republicans are assholes.

But the king of the assholes, at least on this vote, is Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, number three on that list up there of votes against Sandy relief. Let's rewind to May 2011.



ST. LOUIS (KMOX) - Missouri Senator Roy Blunt says he’s asking the federal government to reimburse 100 percent of the cost to local governments dealing with the Joplin tornado aftermath. [...] “I’m asking for 100 percent federal reimbursement to local governments,” Blunt said, “They’ve agreed to 75. I think they have to come to a better number than that, and the right number, I think, would be 100 percent.”

Those food stamps were a lifeline for us. I do now know what we would have done otherwise.""

Sen. Patty Murray: ""When my father was diagnosed with MS and to stop working, it was food stamps that helped my family keep our heads above the water and put food on the table while my mom looked for work.""

Rep. Barbara Lee: ""When I was a young, single mother, I was on public assistance. It was a bridge over troubled water, and without it, I wouldn't be where I am today.""

Former Rep. Joe Baca: ""As a young Veteran, food stamps helped me feed my family.""

Politicians not the kind of dreamer you respect? Fear not! People go on from food stamps to all kinds of achievement.

Music: Moby says ""food stamps enabled my mom and I to eat without having to ask for hand-outs.""

Acting: Tobey Maguire recalled how ""Me and my Mom would go into a grocery store and get groceries and pay for them with food stamps, and I would run out of the store embarrassed.""

Sports: Baseball's father-son legacy of Cecil Fielder and Prince Fielder relied on food stamps early in Cecil's career. WNBA center Ruth Riley has been outspoken about how free school lunches ""gave me the energy I needed to learn in school and participate in sports.""

And of course, given the sheer number of people who've participated in nutrition programs over the years, there are millions of everyday successful adults—teachers, lawyers, writers, chefs, executives—who would say things similar to what politicians, actors, musicians and athletes say about how food stamps helped them get through tough times.

Of course, not everyone who needs food stamps at some point in their lives goes on to lavish success. But, as with so many other things about government assistance, that's more about poverty than it is about assistance. This is, after all, a nation where rich kids with low test scores are more likely to graduate from college than poor kids with high test scores and where, in big parts of the country, a kid raised in the bottom fifth of the income scale has less than a 10 percent chance of rising to the top fifth. And Paul Ryan's policies would make those outcomes worse, at the same time he's trying to rid himself of the stench of Mitt Romney by claiming to be some kind of anti-poverty crusader.

Anyway, Paul Ryan's own dreams apparently weren't killed by the Social Security survivor benefits he collected after his father died."

Helderman', 'Reporter Focusing On Political Enterprise Stories']",Inside the immigration bill: E-Verify expansion draws fire,"The new system will rely more heavily on ""photo-matching."" The E-Verify system will contain a vast database of photographs, and workers applying for jobs would need to present identification with photographs that match those in the database to prove they are who they say they are and that they are in the country legally.

For non-citizens, that would mean showing a work authorization or green card with a photo. Citizens could show passports or driver's licenses, where states have agreed to provide license information to the E-Verify system. To encourage states to turn over the information, he bill includes $250 million in new funding to reimburse states that choose to take part.

Photo-matching is less expensive for employers — and potentially less invasive-feeling for workers — than finger-printing, which had been considered by senators during their extensive negotiations.

Still, the process already has its critics, which say it amounts to the creation of a new national ID.

""If you take a step back and think about what that means, when this reaches fruition and is completed, you'll have an Internet-accessible system that has everyone’s photo and identifying information in it,"" said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel with the ACLU. ""You can easily imagine E-Verify becoming the national ID system.""

That the system will now be required for employers, even small businesses that might have trouble shouldering the cost, is also a concern, he said. ""That's a fundamental shift,"" he said from the current system, which is largely voluntary.

Jim Harper, director of information studies at the Cato Institute, said photographs are the weakest form of biometric identification. He predicted that a system that is launched using photos would later be expanded to include other identifiers people might see as more problematic including iris scans and fingerprints. But he said the ""knitting together"" of available sources of photographs into a single database is itself a concern.

""I’m standing down on the horizon, waving my arms saying , 'Hey, hey this is a national ID system!"" he said. ""It's big government at it's worst.""

Still, many immigration advocates have shelved their long-time opposition to E-Verify, believing it one piece of a necessary compromise that will also allow a path to citizenship for those now in the country illegally. The system, they believe, is necessary to convince wary conservatives that the nation will not face a new flood of illegal immigrants once a path to citizenship is provided for many who are already here.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, said a new system to reduce incentives for employers to hire illegal immigrants — and make it harder for them to do so — is a key piece of any broad-based overhaul of the system.

""It's the essential trade-off: legalization and a path to citizenship, for employer verification,"" he said. ""That is really the heart of every comprehensive immigration reform package ever put together."""

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)

With little more than a week to go before a potential government shutdown, Washington feels like a car without a driver on a road without a guardrail.

As it hurtles toward the edge, no one — conservatives, GOP leadership, congressional Democrats, the White House — seems to have a way to stop it.

Lurching from near-calamity to near-catastrophe has become a way of life in the capital, which has stood at the edge of a financial precipice at least four times since the end of 2010.

What makes these crises all the more exasperating is that none of them seem to resolve the political and ideological disputes that cause them. All they do is put both sides on a course toward the next disaster zone.

The one immediately ahead arises from the fact that the fiscal year will end on Sept. 30 without Congress having passed any of the spending bills needed to keep the government in operation going into 2014.

The Post's Jackie Kucinich discusses the battle between the House and the Senate as a government shutdown nears. (The Washington Post)

Without at least a stopgap funding bill, most nonessential federal operations will come to a halt.

Benefits payments, such as Social Security checks, would still go out, and critical functions such as national security would continue. But military pay would probably be delayed, hundreds of thousands of federal employees would be furloughed and attractions such as national parks would close.

“After five years spent digging out of crisis, the last thing we need is for Washington to manufacture another,” President Obama said in his weekly address Saturday, noting the fragility of the economic recovery. “But that’s what will happen in the next few weeks if Congress doesn’t meet two deadlines.”

The most pressing issue is a demand by conservative groups and tea party lawmakers that any spending measure include a provision that would strip funding for the health-care overhaul, which is set to kick into gear on Oct. 1.

The Republican-led House has passed a bill that would accomplish that, but it stands no chance in the Senate, which is virtually certain to send it back “clean,” meaning with full funding for the law that is known as Obamacare.

Even if they figure a way around this stalemate and keep the government open, a graver crisis is coming up quickly on its heels as the government hits the limit of its borrowing authority some time in mid- to late October. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling, it could force the nation into default and the global financial markets into chaos.

Conservatives and tea party activists insist that Republicans will be rewarded for going to the barricades to stop the health-care law.

And just about every poll shows that, three years after its passage, Obamacare remains unpopular with voters. In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, 52 percent said they disapprove of the law; only 42 percent said they support it.

But Americans are even less enchanted with the idea of bringing the government to a halt as a means of blocking Obamacare.

The Republicans’ own numbers show that. In a recent survey conducted by David Winston, a pollster who advises the House GOP, 71 percent said they opposed “shutting down the government as a way to defund the President’s health care law.” Only 23 percent approved.

In an interview, Winston said that even the Republicans who were surveyed said a shutdown is a bad idea, 53 percent to 37 percent.

“I know when you get led into a box canyon what that means,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), evoking imagery of an infamous method by which buffalo were slaughtered in the Old West. “Box canyon, here we come.”

Democrats are convinced they have the upper hand. The president has maintained that he will not negotiate with Republicans on the funding bill or the debt ceiling — a point he repeated to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in a telephone call Friday night. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) plans to ensure that no bill defunding the health-care law reaches Obama’s desk.

From time to time, the fiscal year has brought partial, temporary shutdowns — nine of them, for instance, between fiscal 1981 and fiscal 1995. But they were over relatively narrow disputes, and none lasted more than three days.

Then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) was the first to engineer one as a strategy to wage a broader policy battle, with President Bill Clinton in 1995.

Gingrich and his forces had many advantages in 1995 that today’s Republicans do not. Their party’s standing with voters was stronger, they controlled both houses of Congress, and they were far more united than Republicans are today.

When he began laying plans for a year-end government shutdown, he was still at the height of his influence, after having led the House Republicans through an election that produced their first majority in four decades.

“This is the heart of the revolution,” Gingrich told Time magazine in June 1995.

“He can run the parts of government that are left, or he can run no government,” Gingrich said of Clinton. “Which of the two of us do you think worries more about the government not showing up?”

That year actually produced two shutdowns — one in November lasting five days and a second from mid-December to early January that went on for 21 days.

In the current telling of some conservative groups, the Republicans won that showdown.

That is not a widely held view among those who actually lived through it. They note that the 1995-96 shutdown helped resurrect Clinton’s presidency and put him on the way to a landslide reelection over GOP nominee Bob Dole.

“Prior to the shutdown, it looked as though the Republican nominee was going to be able to defeat Clinton handily. After the shutdown, Dole was clearly behind and struggling,” said Winston, who worked as an aide to Gingrich in the late 1990s. “Looking at any of the survey numbers, the shutdown was clearly a negative for Republicans.”

Nor did it do much to change the trajectory of federal spending, as the Republicans had promised it would.

“We gained almost nothing. It was a rounding error,” said Steve Bell of the Bipartisan Policy Center, who was a longtime top Republican staffer on the Senate Budget Committee. “It was subsumed by the next year’s economic forecast.”

But fewer than one in five of those now serving in the House were around for that earlier standoff.

One of them is Boehner, Bell noted. “I know the speaker, who went through that, knows who has the bully pulpit and who is going to get blamed,” he said.

Newer GOP members have come to power in a more unbending political culture, partly because of the rise of the tea party movement and partly because of the way their district lines are drawn.

An analysis this past week by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics found that 94 of the House’s 233 Republicans come from districts in which GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney got 60 percent or more of the vote. Practically speaking, that means they come from areas so conservative that they have more to fear from a primary challenger on the right than they do from a Democrat in a general election.

The Senate, on the other hand, is a vastly different political landscape.

Although firebrands led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) have been egging on their party for a showdown, other Republicans in the Senate fear that overreaching now could squander their chance of regaining a majority in next year’s midterm elections.

Besides that, it won’t work.

“We would be telling people that we’re defunding Obamacare when we really aren’t — so little of it is contained in annual appropriations,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who has strong credentials on the right. “We’re held in low-enough regard without telling people we’re doing something when we really aren’t.”

Nor will a bill that defunds the health-care law survive the Senate — a fact Cruz conceded after the House passed the measure he had pushed for so strenuously.

Under the Senate rules, Reid needs only 51 votes to defeat the Cruz-backed amendment that would eliminate spending for the health-care law. With 54 members in his caucus, it is a cinch he can get them.

So the only option left for Cruz to obstruct passage of a stopgap spending measure sets up a truly perverse situation — he can filibuster the House-passed bill when it comes to the Senate, even though that means blocking the very Obamacare-defunding measure that he and his allies worked so hard to get the House to approve.

On Saturday, the conservative organization Heritage Action for America sent out a bulletin urging senators to do just that. But the whole thing has left flummoxed Senate Republicans wondering what kind of double somersault it would take to explain all of this to their constituents back home.

Meanwhile, back in the House, Boehner and his forces are struggling to figure out an endgame. They will have to scramble, because Reid is expected to wait until the last minute to return a Senate-passed bill to their chamber.

In other words, the week ahead promises yet another installment of cliffhanger legislating, Washington’s new normal. And then, it’s on to the next crisis."
http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/25/19062348-disabled-workers-paid-just-pennies-an-hour-and-its-legal,2013-06-25 00:00:00,"['Anna Schecter', 'Producer', 'Nbc News']",Disabled workers paid just pennies an hour – and it's legal,"One of the nation's best-known charities is paying disabled workers as little as 22 cents an hour, thanks to a 75-year-old legal loophole that critics say needs to be closed.

Goodwill Industries, a multibillion-dollar company whose executives make six-figure salaries, is among the nonprofit groups permitted to pay thousands of disabled workers far less than minimum wage because of a federal law known as Section 14 (c). Labor Department records show that some Goodwill workers in Pennsylvania earned wages as low as 22, 38 and 41 cents per hour in 2009.

""If they really do pay the CEO of Goodwill three-quarters of a million dollars, they certainly can pay me more than they're paying,"" said Harold Leigland, who is legally blind and hangs clothes at a Goodwill in Great Falls, Montana for less than minimum wage.

""It's a question of civil rights,"" added his wife, Sheila, blind from birth, who quit her job at the same Goodwill store when her already low wage was cut further. ""I feel like a second-class citizen. And I hate it.""

Section 14 (c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which was passed in 1938, allows employers to obtain special minimum wage certificates from the Department of Labor. The certificates give employers the right to pay disabled workers according to their abilities, with no bottom limit to the wage.

Most, but not all, special wage certificates are held by nonprofit organizations like Goodwill that then set up their own so-called ""sheltered workshops"" for disabled employees, where employees typically perform manual tasks like hanging clothes.

The non-profit certificate holders can also place employees in outside, for-profit workplaces including restaurants, retail stores, hospitals and even Internal Revenue Service centers. Between the sheltered workshops and the outside businesses, more than 216,000 workers are eligible to earn less than minimum wage because of Section 14 (c), though many end up earning the full federal minimum wage of $7.25.

When a non-profit provides Section 14 (c) workers to an outside business, it sets the salary and pays the wages. For example, the Helen Keller National Center, a New York school for the blind and deaf, has a special wage certificate and has placed students in a Westbury, N.Y., Applebee's franchise. The employees' pay ranged from $3.97 per hour to $5.96 per hour in 2010. The franchise told NBC News it has also hired workers at minimum wage from Helen Keller. A spokesperson for Applebee's declined to comment on Section 14 (c).

Helen Keller also placed several students at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Manhasset, N.Y., in 2010, where they earned $3.80 and $4.85 an hour. A Barnes & Noble spokeswoman defended the Section 14 (c) program as providing jobs to ""people who would otherwise not have [the opportunity to work].""

Most Section 14 (c) workers are employed directly by nonprofits. In 2001, the most recent year for which numbers are available, the GAO estimated that more than 90 percent of Section 14 (c) workers were employed at nonprofit work centers.

Critics of Section 14 (c) have focused much of their ire on the nonprofits, where wages can be just pennies an hour even as some of the groups receive funding from the government. At one workplace in Florida run by a nonprofit, some employees earned one cent per hour in 2011.

""People are profiting from exploiting disabled workers,"" said Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. ""It is clearly and unquestionably exploitation.""

Defenders of Section 14 (c) say that without it, disabled workers would have few options. A Department of Labor spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News that Section 14 (c) ""provides workers with disabilities the opportunity to be given meaningful work and receive an income.""

Terry Farmer, CEO of ACCSES, a trade group that calls itself the ""voice of disability service providers,"" said scrapping the provision could ""force [disabled workers] to stay at home,"" enter rehabilitation, ""or otherwise engage in unproductive and unsatisfactory activities.""

Harold Leigland, however, said he feels that Goodwill can pay him a low wage because the company knows he has few other places to go. ""We are trapped,"" he said. ""Everybody who works at Goodwill is trapped.""

Leigland, a 66-year-old former massage therapist with a college degree, currently earns $5.46 per hour in Great Falls.

His wages have risen and fallen based on ""time studies,"" the method nonprofits use to calculate the salaries of Section 14 (c) workers. Staff members use a stopwatch to determine how long it takes a disabled worker to complete a task. That time is compared with how long it would take a person without a disability to do the same task. The nonprofit then uses a formula to calculate a salary, which may be equal to or less than minimum wage. The tests are repeated every six months.

Leigland's pay has been higher than $5.46, but it has also dropped down to $4.37 per hour, based on the time-study results.

He said he believes Goodwill makes the time studies harder when they want his wage to be lower.

""Sometimes the test is easier than others. It depends on if, as near as I can figure, they want your wage to go up or down. It's that simple,"" he said.

His wife, Sheila, 58, spent four years hanging clothes at the Great Falls Goodwill for about $3.50 an hour. She said the time study was one of the most degrading and stressful parts about her job. ""You never know how it's going to come out. It stressed me out a lot,"" she said.

She quit last summer when she returned to work after knee surgery and found that her wage had been lowered to $2.75 per hour, a training rate.

""At $2.75 it would barely cover my cost of getting to work. I wouldn't make any money,"" she said.

Harold said he believes Goodwill can afford to pay him minimum wage, based on the salaries paid to Goodwill executives. While according to the company's own figures about 4,000 of the 30,000 disabled workers Goodwill employs at 69 franchises are currently paid below minimum wage, salaries for the CEOs of those franchises that hold special minimum wage certificates totaled almost $20 million in 2011.

In 2011 the CEO of Goodwill Industries of Southern California took home $1.1 million in salary and deferred compensation. His counterpart in Portland, Oregon, made more than $500,000. Salaries for CEOs of the roughly 150 Goodwill franchises across America total more than $30 million.

Goodwill International CEO Jim Gibbons, who was awarded $729,000 in salary and deferred compensation in 2011, defended the executive pay.

""These leaders are having a great impact in terms of new solutions, in terms of innovation, and in terms of job creation,"" he said.

Gibbons also defended time studies, and the whole Section 14 (c) approach. He said that for many people who make less than minimum wage, the experience of work is more important than the pay.

""It's typically not about their livelihood. It's about their fulfillment. It's about being a part of something. And it's probably a small part of their overall program,"" he said.

And Goodwill and the organizations that run the sheltered workshops are not alone in their support for Section 14 (c). In many cases, the families of the workers who have severe disabilities say their loved ones enjoy the work experience, enjoy getting a paycheck, and the amount is of no consequence.

""I feel really good about it. I don't have to worry so much about him,"" said Fran Davidson, whose son Jeremy has worked at Goodwill in Great Falls, Montana, for more than a decade. ""I know he's not getting picked on, and he's in a safe place. He enjoys what he's doing, and he's happy, and that's what we like for our kids."" Jeremy started out working for a sub-minimum wage but did well on his last time study and is currently earning $7.80 an hour, Montana's minimum wage.

But foes of Section 14 (c) have hopes for a new bill that's now before Congress that would repeal Section 14 (c) and make sub-minimum wages illegal across the board.

""Meaningful work deserves fair pay,"" the sponsor of the bill, Rep. Gregg Harper, R.-Miss., told NBC News. ""This dated provision unjustly prohibits workers with disabilities from reaching their full potential.""

The bill is opposed by trade associations for the employers of the disabled, and past attempts to change the law have failed. But Marc Maurer, president of the National Federation of the Blind and a foe of the sheltered workshop system, is cautiously optimistic that this time the bill will pass, and end what he called a ""two-tiered system.""

That system, explained Maurer, says ""'Americans who have disabilities aren't as valuable as other people,' and that's wrong. These folks have value. We should recognize that value.""

Those cuts would accompany deep reductions in defense spending - including stalling maintenance on Navy ships - that are also poised to trigger March 1.



In detailed reports for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, President Barack Obama's budget office spelled out how the cuts - which are the result of a stalemate between Congressional Republicans and the White House over reducing the federal deficit - will affect localities, putting the stakes of the budget debate in stark terms as Congress returns to Washington after a week-long break.

But some Republicans question whether the Obama administration is simply crafting a doomsday scenario for the indiscriminate cuts to force Congressional Republicans into accepting a deal that includes more tax increases for wealthy Americans, which GOP leaders say is unacceptable. They would rather cut spending on entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security, which they say are the real drivers of the country's debt.

Nationwide, the White House said, 70,000 children would no longer have access to Head Start early education programs, and 10,000 teacher jobs would be at risk, consequences that Education Secretary Arne Duncan detailed Sunday.

""It creates tremendous instability,"" Duncan said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""And there are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips, who are getting notices that they can't come back this fall.""

Reduced federal funding for vaccines would mean children would go without shots that prevent measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough, influenza and hepatitis B. The report indicated 2,100 fewer food inspections would occur, and medical research would be stalled.

Hundreds of thousands of ""seriously mentally ill adults and seriously emotionally disturbed children"" could go without treatment for their ailments, according to the White House, which could lead to higher rates of hospitalization and incarceration.

And the Federal Aviation Administration would be forced to cut $600 million from its budget, which the agency's boss said Sunday would result in furloughs - or forced leave - for nearly all of the FAA's 47,000 employees.

""We're going to try and cut as much as we possibly can out of contracts and other things that we do,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said. ""But in the end, there has to be some kind of furlough of air traffic controllers, and that will also begin to curtail or eliminate the opportunity for them to guide planes in and out of airports.""

All told, non-defense programs would be forced to reduce their spending by 9%, the White House said, while defense programs would have to cut 13%.

Cuts to the military would include calling off maintenance on 11 ships in Norfolk, Virginia, home of the world's largest naval base. Air Force operations in the Commonwealth could be cut by $8 million. In San Diego, maintenance on five ships would be canceled. In Jacksonville, Florida, funding to maintain an aircraft depot would disappear.

The state-by-state analysis by the White House is a continuation of the administration's attempt to demonstrate in stark terms how the forced spending cuts would affect Americans - and to pin the blame on the GOP. That effort has been met with some skepticism from Republicans.

""Rather than issuing last-minute press releases on cuts to first responders or troop training or airport security, [Obama] should propose smarter ways to cut Washington spending. After all, Washington spending, even with the sequester, is bigger than it was when he got here,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in response to the White House's detailing of the cuts.

“There are smarter ways to reduce the size of government. And with the national debt well over $16 trillion dollars, it’s time for the White House to stop spending all its time campaigning, and start finding smarter ways to reduce the deficit,"" McConnell continued.

Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said ""The White House needs to spend less time explaining to the press how bad the sequester will be and more time actually working to stop it.""

Some Republicans argue the White House is exaggerating how much Americans would feel the effects of the cuts.

""The American people, we see all these claims about what a tragedy it's going to be,"" Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said on ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointing to statements from LaHood and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.

""They have plenty of flexibility in terms of discretion on how they spend money,"" Coburn said. ""There are easy ways to cut this money that the American people will never feel. What you hear is an outrage because nobody wants to cut spending.""

Another Republican, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, called the dire warnings from Obama administration officials merely ""great political theater about how cutting less than 3% of the federal budget can cause all these awful consequences.""

""Here is (Obama's) chance to say, 'Here is how we can do it better.' The reality is, the federal budget, even after the cuts, will be larger than last year's budget,"" Jindal said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to the president, denied that the White House was overstating the effects of the cuts, saying that it's Obama's ""responsibility to make sure the American people understand what's at stake here in this debate.""

""This is going to have a very real impact on people's lives and on communities, and people need to know why that is,"" Pfeiffer said. ""Are all these things going to go into effect on the first day? No. But there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who are working today who will lose their jobs as a consequence of this Republican decision."""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/31/labor-big-business-agree-on-key-part-immigration-reform-but-final-deal-still/,2013-03-31 00:00:00,[],"Labor, big business agree on key part of immigration reform, but final deal still faces hurdles","Organized labor and big business have reached a deal on a new, low-skilled workers program that will help clear the way for Capitol Hill immigration reform, but President Obama and a leading Republican senator maintain cautious optimism about a final deal.

The deal was reached during a Friday night phone call between AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief executive Tom Donohue, according to several news organizations and confirmed by Fox News.

The deal was brokered by New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who also was on the phone call and is one of eight senators working on bipartisan reform legislation.

""This issue has always been the dealbreaker on immigration reform, but not this time,"" Schumer said.

""The strength of the consensus across America for just reform has afforded us the momentum needed to forge an agreement in principle to develop a new type of employer visa system,"" Trumka said in a statement late Saturday. ""We expect that this new program, which benefits not just business, but everyone, will promote long overdue reforms by raising the bar for existing programs.""

Despite the breakthrough, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s office cautioned Saturday that Congress still has a long way to go before passing legislation in the Democrat-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House.

Rubio sent a letter Saturday to Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., calling for a deliberate hearing process on the new legislation and cautioning against a ""rush to legislate.""

“Senate negotiators are making good progress on immigration reform, but we're not done yet,” Rubio press secretary Alex Conant tweeted Saturday.

White House spokesman Clark Stevens said Obama continues to be encouraged by the progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators.

“We look forward to seeing language once it is introduced and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible,” he said.



A source told The Associated Press, on the condition of anonymity, the deal resolves disagreements over wages for new, low-income workers and which industries would be included.

All members of the so-called Gang of Eight are expected to sign off on the agreement.

The remaining big hurdles to passage are securing the U.S. borders, cracking down on employers who hire illegally and creating a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country.

The bipartisan group is expected to introduce the bill officially the week of April 8, after Congress returns from a two-week recess.

The AFL-CIO and the Chamber had been fighting over wages for tens of thousands of low-skilled workers who would be brought in under the new program to fill jobs in construction, hotels and resorts, nursing homes and restaurants and other industries.

On Friday, officials from both sides said there was basic agreement on the wage issue, and Schumer said a final deal on the worker dispute was very close.

""We're feeling very optimistic on immigration: Aspiring Americans will receive the road map to citizenship they deserve and we can modernize `future flow' without reducing wages for any local workers, regardless of what papers they carry,"" AFL-CIO spokesman Jeff Hauser said in a statement earlier this week. ""Future flow"" refers to future arrivals of legal immigrants.

Under the emerging agreement between business and labor, a new ""W"" visa program would bring tens of thousands of lower-skilled workers a year to the country. The program would be capped at 200,000 a year, but the number of visas would fluctuate, depending on unemployment rates, job openings, employer demand and data collected by a new federal bureau pushed by the labor movement as an objective monitor of the market.

The workers would be able to change jobs and could seek permanent residency. Under current temporary worker programs, personnel can't move from employer to employer and have no path to permanent U.S. residence and citizenship. And currently there's no good way for employers to bring many low-skilled workers to the U.S. An existing visa program for low-wage nonagricultural workers is capped at 66,000 per year and is supposed to apply only to seasonal or temporary jobs.

The Chamber of Commerce said workers would earn actual wages paid to American workers or the prevailing wages for the industry they're working in, whichever is higher. The Labor Department determines prevailing wage based on customary rates in specific localities, so that it varies from city to city.

The low-skilled worker issue had loomed for weeks as perhaps the toughest matter to settle in months-long, closed-door talks on immigration among the senators, including Republicans John McCain, Arizona, and Rubio.

The issue helped sink the last major attempt at immigration overhaul in 2007, when the legislation foundered on the Senate floor after an amendment was added to end a temporary worker program after five years, threatening a key priority of the business community.

The amendment passed by just one vote, 49-48. Obama, a senator at the time, joined in the narrow majority voting to end the program after five years.

The president, who won roughly 71 percent of the Hispanic vote during his November re-election, has made immigration reform a key part of his second term. And Republicans are attempting to improve their relationship with Hispanics, the fasting growing segment of the U.S. populations.

The sex education amendment to the budget bill, introduced by Rep. Lynn Wachtmann (R), encourages schools to teach abstinence-only education and bans sexual education that condones ""any gateway sexual activity or health message that encourages students to experiment with sexual activity."" The amendment also prohibits teachers from distributing contraceptive materials and bans public schools from using the services of any individual or organization who “endorses student nonabstinence from sexual activity as an appropriate or acceptable behavior, or if that individual or organization promotes, endorses, advocates, or condones gateway sexual activity.”

Instructors who violate the law could be sued in court for up to $5,000.

State Democratic Chairman Chris Redfern told the Toledo Blade that Republicans are “bent on outlawing sexuality and reverting to the Dark Ages.""

""If this legislature focused on what really mattered, we could get a lot done. Instead, too many of my colleagues have this bizarre attraction to these extreme issues,"" he said.

Wachtmann did not immediately return HuffPost's calls for comment.

Another provision of the House budget bill would redirect about $1.4 million in state family planning funds from Planned Parenthood to other local health providers and crisis pregnancy centers, which are Christian-owned organizations whose mission is to convince women not to have abortions. Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio provides health and family planning services to about 100,000 women each year at 27 clinics across the state. If the bill passes, all of the Planned Parenthood clinics would be moved to the bottom of the priority list for state funding because three of them provide abortions.

All abortions provided at Planned Parenthood clinics are paid for privately by the patient, because the Hyde Amendment prohibits any federal dollars from being used to fund the procedure. But Republicans have long argued that Planned Parenthood indirectly uses public grants to pay for all of its services, including abortions.

State Rep. Ron Maag (R-Lebanon) said at a hearing on the bill last week that if Planned Parenthood wants to receive more federal funds, it should stop providing abortions at all of its clinics. “If the hang-up is abortion, and you only have three clinics that are doing it, and there are other places women could go, why do you persist in having those clinics when it is putting your good work in jeopardy?” he asked Stephanie Kight, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.

Kight said the thousands of Ohio women who use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider can attest to the fact that it is not a bottom-tier provider. “It’s interesting that they would introduce a bill that would require us to be something that we’re not, while we’re the most-trusted provider for women’s health care"" in the state, she said."

In both films hints of excess in service to virtue are readily cheered and all opposition made to look corrupt and worse.

But this vision of heroism does not do full historical justice to either the Civil War or Lincoln. We may like our heroes unchained, prepared to transcend ordinary restrictions, but history is another matter. What were the ends sought? How were they pursued? And what effects did that have? The Library of Congress exhibition tries to see the conflict from different perspectives. Its displays of over 200 items, we are told, “attest to the valor, sacrifices, emotions and accomplishments of those in both the North and South whose lives were affected by the bitter conflict of 1861-65.”

The war, it explains, “unfolds between two opposing ideologies,” with the Union opposed by a “confederacy of slaveholding states true to their own interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.” It is as if this show, presented by a national institution in the nation’s capital (with Cheryl Regan as exhibition director), wants to avoid — even after 150 years — any hint of partisanship.

At first it seems as if the exhibition will try to seesaw between sides, creating a kind of symmetry. The American Civil War Center in Richmond, Va., does something like that, shading the conflict with hints of relativism. And there remain important differences between Northern narratives and those of many Southern museums. But at the Library of Congress the lineaments remain clear."

U.S. Circuit Court Judge Wallace Tashima on Friday found most of the law that bans public schools from teaching certain race-related courses, such as Mexican American studies, constitutional with one small exception. Tashima ruled that the portion of the law that prohibits courses designed for certain ethnic groups was unconstitutionally vague.

Tashima ruled that the provision’s wording was “broad and ambiguous,” raising serious constitutional concerns that threaten “to chill the teaching of legitimate and objective ethnic studies courses.”

Still, Arizona Atty. Gen. Tom Horne this week called the ruling on HB 2281 a “victory for ensuring that public education is not held captive to radical, political elements and that students treat each other as individuals — not on the basis of the race they were born into.”

Horne, who wrote the law, and those who support it said the Mexican American Studies Program in the Tucson school system promoted resentment toward a race or a class of people and advocated ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of people as individuals.

Defenders of the program rejected that characterization and said it taught often neglected aspects of U.S. history and inspired Latino students to excel in school.

Trustees of the Tucson Unified School District discontinued the program in January 2012 after state officials determined the program violated the new law.

The Save Ethnic Studies group, based in Tucson, declared the case “not over.” Richard Martinez, an attorney who filed suit against the law, acknowledged Tuesday that the legal road ahead would probably be long and steep.

Still, he said the group would forge ahead.

“Too much is at stake. The right of every student to learn and teacher to teach the history, literature and culture of Latinos in Arizona is currently prohibited,” the group said in a statement Monday. “Mexican American Studies proved to be a valuable educational program.”

In his ruling, Tashima stated that the arguments made against the law “do not meet the high threshold needed to establish a constitutional violation.”

Although the judge said the program’s defenders failed to show discriminatory intent, he found that several aspects of the law and the public debate about it “may be viewed to spark suspicion that the Latino population has been improperly targeted.”

“This single-minded focus on terminating the [Mexican American studies] program, along with Horne’s decision not to issue findings against other ethnic studies programs, is at least suggestive of discriminatory intent,” Tashima wrote.

Several students and teachers in the district challenged the law on several grounds, including that it violated free speech and is unconstitutionally vague.

The ruling dealt a blow to supporters of the suspended classes, who had hoped the courts would overturn a 2010 law championed by Arizona conservatives determined to shut down the unconventional courses.

“I was really surprised at the decision,” Jose Gonzalez, a former teacher of Tucson's suspended Mexican-American Studies classes, told The Huffington Post. “But as a student and teacher of history, I know in civil rights cases like this there’s always setbacks.”

The experimental Tucson curriculum was offered to students in different forms in some of the local elementary, middle and high schools. It emphasized critical thinking and focused on Mexican-American literature and perspectives. Supporters lauded the program, pointing to increased graduation rates, high student achievement and a state-commissioned independent audit that recommended expanding the classes.

But conservative opponents accused the teachers of encouraging students to adopt left-wing ideas and resent white people, a charge the teachers deny. Aiming squarely at Tucson’s Mexican-American Studies program, the Arizona legislature passed HB 2281 -- a law banning courses that promote the overthrow of the U.S. government, foster racial resentment, are designed for students of a particular ethnic group or that advocate ethnic solidarity.

Federal Judge Wallace Tashima said the plaintiffs failed to show the law was too vague, broad or discriminatory, or that it violated students’ first amendment rights.

The news wasn’t all bad for supporters of the suspended classes. Tashima ruled that the section of the law prohibiting courses tailored to serve students of a particular ethnicity was unconstitutional.

Originally filed in October of 2010 on behalf of the program's former teachers, who lost standing because they are public employees, the case is currently brought by former Mexican-American Studies student Nicholas Dominguez and his mother Margarita Dominguez. They will likely appeal the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals within the next 30 days, their lawyer Richard Martinez told The Huffington Post.

“This case is not over,” Martinez said. “It’s not only important to Arizona, but to the country as a whole that this statute be addressed.”

Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne began a campaign to eliminate the Mexican-American Studies program from Tucson Unified School District in 2006, when he was serving as the state’s Superintendent of Public Education.

Angered that Mexican-American civil rights leader Dolores Huerta had said that “Republicans hate Latinos” in a speech to Tucson students, Horne sent Deputy Superintendent Margaret Dugan, a Latina Republican, to give an alternate view. But the intellectual exercise turned confrontational when students, who said they were not allowed to ask Dugan questions, sealed their mouths with tape and walked out of the assembly room.

“As superintendent of schools, I have visited over 1,000 schools and I’ve never seen students be disrespectful to a teacher in that way,” Horne said in an interview last year.

The final product of his efforts was House Bill 2281, which then-State Sen. John Huppenthal (R) helped pilot through the Arizona legislature. Huppenthal, who succeeded Horne as state superintendent of schools, then found Tucson out of compliance with the new law and ordered the district to shut Mexican-American Studies down or lose 10 percent of its annual funding -- some $14 million over the fiscal year. In January of 2012, the school board complied, voting 4 to 1 to discontinue the classes.

The decision drew national attention as administrators plucked Latino literature that once belonged to the curriculum from classrooms, explicitly banning seven titles from instruction.

Tashima wrote in Friday’s ruling that Horne’s anti-Mexican-American Studies zeal bordered on discrimination.

“This single-minded focus on terminating the MAS (Mexican-American Studies) program, along with Horne’s decision not to issue findings against other ethnic studies programs, is at least suggestive of discriminatory intent,” Tashima wrote.

But the federal judge stopped short of invalidating the law on those grounds.

""Although some aspects of the record may be viewed to spark suspicion that the Latino population has been improperly targeted, on the whole, the evidence indicates that Defendants targeted the MAS program, not Latino students, teachers or community members who participated in the program,"" the judge wrote in the ruling.

Not everyone agrees.

Writer and activist Tony Diaz -- who along with independent journalist Liana Lopez and multimedia artist Bryan Parras launched a “librotraficante” caravan to “smuggle” books banned from Tucson classrooms into Arizona -- said the court had “failed our youth, our culture and freedom of speech” by upholding the Arizona ethnic studies law.

“But we remain inspired by the youth of Tucson, the teachers, the families, the activists who will appeal this unjust ruling and continue the struggle to the Supreme Court,” Diaz said."

Julian Whittington, the sheriff of Bossier Parish, LA, told Fox News that Obama’s Justice Office of Civil Rights de-funded the Young Marines chapter and another youth program over mentions of religion. In the case of the Young Marine program, chartered in 1965, the funding was cut off because the group features an oath that mentions “God.” In the other case, it was because a program for at-risk youth featured a voluntary, student-led prayer session as one of its activities.

Sheriff Whittington says that the DOJ withdrew a combined $30,000 from the programs because the groups refused to remove God from their activities. The sheriff said this was evidence of the government’s “aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms.”

Whittington told Fox, “We were informed that these are unacceptable, inherently religious activities and the Department of Justice would not be able to fund the programs if it continued. They wanted a letter from me stating that I would no longer have voluntary prayer and I would also have to remove ‘God’ from the Young Marine’s oath.”

The oath from the Young Marine organization reads:

From this day forward, I sincerely promise, I will set an example for all other youth to follow and I shall never do anything that would bring disgrace or dishonor upon God, my Country and its flag, my parents, myself or the Young Marines. These I will honor and respect in a manner that will reflect credit upon them and myself. Semper Fidelis

Both the U.S. Army enlistment oath and its commissioning oath end with “so help me God.”

As to the at-risk youth program, Whittington said,”We’re not promoting any specific religion, this is just voluntary prayer, mention of God, how offensive and bad can that be?”

In response to the DOJ’s message insisting that he sign the anti-God pledge, Sheriff Whittington sent a letter of his own to LA Governor Bobby Jindal.

“As a Christian, Sheriff and American citizen, I am writing to express my frustration and concern over the persistent aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms which have been imposed upon the law enforcement grant programs, specifically related to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement,” wrote the Sheriff.

In cutting off the funding, the DOJ claimed it was a violation of Church and State rules for the government to fund any group that mentions God.

Fox’s Todd Starnes says that, “Both youth programs have been hailed as a successful way to reach at-risk young people. Since 2002 more than 1,000 young people have graduated from the program, directed by a Bossier Parish deputy who is a former U.S. Marine.”

Like Sheriff Whittington, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) was troubled by the DOJ’s actions.

“There is a very wide effort coming out of the administration that seeks to stamp out freedom of expressions – particularly religion and especially freedom of Christian expression,” Fleming said. “They are willing to throw the youth overboard and remove the funding just in the name of making this an atheist, agnostic, secular organization.” “They (DOJ) don’t want anything to have any sort of religious support – even down to prayer,” Fleming said. “It’s sad and it’s inconsistent with the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.”

Sheriff Whittington is not taking this lying down. “When something is not right and you know it’s not right and you keep bowing down, nothing is ever going to change,” he said."

It emphasized critical thinking and focused on Mexican-American literature and perspectives. Supporters lauded the program, pointing to increased graduation rates, high student achievement and a state-commissioned independent audit that recommended expanding the classes.

But conservative opponents accused the teachers of encouraging students to adopt left-wing ideas and resent white people, a charge the teachers deny. Aiming squarely at Tucson’s Mexican-American Studies program, the Arizona legislature passed HB 2281 -- a law banning courses that promote the overthrow of the U.S. government, foster racial resentment, are designed for students of a particular ethnic group or that advocate ethnic solidarity.

Federal Judge Wallace Tashima said the plaintiffs failed to show the law was too vague, broad or discriminatory, or that it violated students’ first amendment rights.

The news wasn’t all bad for supporters of the suspended classes. Tashima ruled that the section of the law prohibiting courses tailored to serve students of a particular ethnicity was unconstitutional.

Originally filed in October of 2010 on behalf of the program's former teachers, who lost standing because they are public employees, the case is currently brought by former Mexican-American Studies student Nicholas Dominguez and his mother Margarita Dominguez. They will likely appeal the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals within the next 30 days, their lawyer Richard Martinez told The Huffington Post.

“This case is not over,” Martinez said. “It’s not only important to Arizona, but to the country as a whole that this statute be addressed.”

Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne began a campaign to eliminate the Mexican-American Studies program from Tucson Unified School District in 2006, when he was serving as the state’s Superintendent of Public Education.

Angered that Mexican-American civil rights leader Dolores Huerta had said that “Republicans hate Latinos” in a speech to Tucson students, Horne sent Deputy Superintendent Margaret Dugan, a Latina Republican, to give an alternate view. But the intellectual exercise turned confrontational when students, who said they were not allowed to ask Dugan questions, sealed their mouths with tape and walked out of the assembly room.

“As superintendent of schools, I have visited over 1,000 schools and I’ve never seen students be disrespectful to a teacher in that way,” Horne said in an interview last year.

The final product of his efforts was House Bill 2281, which then-State Sen. John Huppenthal (R) helped pilot through the Arizona legislature. Huppenthal, who succeeded Horne as state superintendent of schools, then found Tucson out of compliance with the new law and ordered the district to shut Mexican-American Studies down or lose 10 percent of its annual funding -- some $14 million over the fiscal year. In January of 2012, the school board complied, voting 4 to 1 to discontinue the classes.

The decision drew national attention as administrators plucked Latino literature that once belonged to the curriculum from classrooms, explicitly banning seven titles from instruction.

Tashima wrote in Friday’s ruling that Horne’s anti-Mexican-American Studies zeal bordered on discrimination.

“This single-minded focus on terminating the MAS (Mexican-American Studies) program, along with Horne’s decision not to issue findings against other ethnic studies programs, is at least suggestive of discriminatory intent,” Tashima wrote.

But the federal judge stopped short of invalidating the law on those grounds.

""Although some aspects of the record may be viewed to spark suspicion that the Latino population has been improperly targeted, on the whole, the evidence indicates that Defendants targeted the MAS program, not Latino students, teachers or community members who participated in the program,"" the judge wrote in the ruling.

Not everyone agrees.

Writer and activist Tony Diaz -- who along with independent journalist Liana Lopez and multimedia artist Bryan Parras launched a “librotraficante” caravan to “smuggle” books banned from Tucson classrooms into Arizona -- said the court had “failed our youth, our culture and freedom of speech” by upholding the Arizona ethnic studies law.

“But we remain inspired by the youth of Tucson, the teachers, the families, the activists who will appeal this unjust ruling and continue the struggle to the Supreme Court,” Diaz said."

A three-judge panel unanimously decided Stacie Halas, 32, was unfit for the classroom. Halas was fired in April from her job as a science teacher at Haydock Intermediate School in Oxnard after online videos of her in porn were discovered by students and teachers.

""Although (Halas') pornography career has concluded, the ongoing availability of her pornographic materials on the Internet will continue to impede her from being an effective teacher and respected colleague,"" Judge Julie Cabos-Owen wrote in a 46-page decision issued Friday by the Commission on Professional Competence.

Halas was continually deceitful about her nine-month career in porn before she went to work at the school, the decision said.

Her lawyer Richard Schwab said Halas had tried to be honest but was embarrassed by her previous experience in the adult industry.

""Miss Halas is more than just an individual fighting for her job as a teacher,"" he said Tuesday. ""I think she's representative of a lot of people who may have a past that may not involve anything illegal or anything that hurts anybody.""

Halas has been on administrative leave since the video surfaced in March.

Student claims that the teacher was moonlighting as a porn star were initially dismissed after school officials said they couldn't find any images of her on the Internet — but they were using the school's computers, which don't allow access to porn.

Teachers then showed administrators downloads of Halas' sex videos from their smartphones.

In hearings, former assistant principal Wayne Saddler testified that at the start of a sex video, Halas talked about being a teacher and he felt her effectiveness in the classroom had been compromised.

After rumors of her performance surfaced, profanity was etched on Halas' classroom window, a teacher testified.

Schwab has said Halas did not star in pornographic movies while teaching in any district. He said she took parts only during an eight-month period from 2005 to 2006 because of financial problems after her boyfriend abandoned her.

District superintendent Jeff Chancer applauded the commission's ruling.

Halas' decision to ""engage in pornography was incompatible with her responsibilities as a role model for students and would present an insurmountable, recurring disruption to our schools should she be allowed to remain as a teacher,"" Chancer said in a statement."

Pollak'],Obama Tells Morehouse Graduates of 'Special Obligation' of Black Men,"In a commencement address in Atlanta on Sunday to graduating seniors at Morehouse College, President Barack Obama told graduates to fulfill the “special obligation I felt, as a black man like you.” The all-male, historically black liberal arts college was also the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., among other famous graduates.

The president told the graduating students that their background meant they had a duty “to create greater justice both in your own community, but also across our country. To make sure everyone has a voice; everyone gets a seat at the table; to make sure that everyone – no matter what they look like or where they come from, or who they love – gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they want it bad enough.”

Obama cited his own life as an example several times during his speech, touting his success as a father while also acknowledging some “bad choices” he made in his youth–a veiled reference to his admitted past drug use, which Obama has often acknowledged in books, speeches and debates.

He also admonished Morehouse graduates who aimed to join the professions that they ought to serve the poor:

So yes, go get that law degree. But ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and powerful, or if you can also find time to defend the powerless. Yes, go get your MBA, or start that business. But ask yourself what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood….Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too.

(Here, the president did not mention his own rather unique career path as an attorney, which included defending landlords in large urban housing developments who had evicted tenants in winter or failed to provide necessary services.)

In one portion of his speech, the president touted Obamacare–and encouraged the graduates to sign up for the new health insurance exchanges created by his signature legislation.

Obama seems to have been carrying out the advice of Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, brother of Obama’s former chief of staff, who argued recently in the Wall Street Journal that young Americans would have to be targeted by a propaganda campaign if the system were not to be dangerously underfunded: “Every commencement address by an administration official should encourage young graduates to get health insurance,” Dr. Emanuel wrote.

Obama advised the graduating class that racism could no longer be leaned upon as a reason for failure: “We’ve got no time for excuses,” he said. He also acknowledged that the U.S. had become tolerant enough to elect a black president. And yet Obama described a nation in which discrimination is still rampant:

See, as Morehouse Men, many of you know what it’s like to be an outsider; to be marginalized; to feel the sting of discrimination. That’s an experience that so many other Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when someone asks where they come from or tells them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they’re stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work – she sure feels it.

The premise of Obama’s claim is at odds with recent global survey data, which indicates that the U.S. is among the least racist countries in the world. It is also at odds with the record of his own political career. In the recent past, President Obama has been guilty of many of the sins described above–touting deportations of illegal immigrants; opposing gay marriage until a year ago; moving Muslims out of campaign photographs for fear of arousing prejudice; and, most notoriously, paying women less than men in both his Senate and White House offices.

Overall, President Obama’s remarks repeated a pattern of recent graduation speeches in which he minimized individual achievement in favor of collective obligation.

Curiously, he barely mentioned government, which he has been at great pains to defend in some recent addresses–speeches that have drawn wider criticism in the wake of recent scandals involving abuses of government power.

The word “government” appeared five times in his recent Ohio State commencement speech but not once in the Morehouse address, where the only mentions of government careers were his own presidency and the Atlanta mayoralty of Maynard Jackson.

Obama’s emphasis at Morehouse was on voluntary service to the community–a theme closer to the American philosophical tradition, albeit reformulated to suit the policies and prerogatives of the administration and the Democratic Party."

The group is connected to Hollywood actress Eva Longoria, a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama’s political campaigns.

Gold notes that the Soros adviser and a network of about 30 other left-wing “donors, fundraisers and union leaders” met on Friday to develop “a strategy to make the [immigration] issue central in next year’s midterm elections if Congress does not pass a bill, identifying 10 House Republicans who would be vulnerable to pressure from Latino constituents.”

“The meeting was attended by officials from several labor unions, including the National Education Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, as well as representatives of deep-pocketed backers of liberal causes, including a political adviser to billionaire George Soros,” Gold added.

The 10 Republicans they are targeting are Reps. Jeff Denham (R-CA), Buck McKeon (R-CA), Gary Miller (R-CA), David Valadao (R-CA), Daniel Webster (R-FL), Mike Coffman (R-CO), Scott Tipton (R-CA), Joe Heck (R-NV), Steve Pearce (R-NM), and Randy Weber (R-TX). These representatives are largely split on immigration efforts.

Pearce, for instance, does not support the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” bill or anything like it. “You can’t get control of the borders if you tell people you can come here illegally and you can work until you work your way to the front of the line,” Pearce said in an interview with the New York Times‘ Ashley Parker in August. “The whole world would want to do it that way. Who would want to wait and do it properly?”

Weber, who represents the district of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), spoke at an anti-amnesty rally on Capitol Hill in June alongside Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and Steve King (R-TX). “The president has the authority to secure our border,” Weber said at the event. “He should do it today. In fact he should have done it yesterday.”

Denham, on the other hand, supports amnesty, at one point issuing verbal support for the Senate bill but backtracking after immense pressure from conservatives and constituents over the course of August. Since the congressional recess, Denham has come out to publicly endorse House Democrats’ amnesty plan, which was introduced by House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) earlier this month. Denham has also publicly claimed that House Speaker John Boehner promised that in the next “month or so” there would be a vote on immigration legislation in the House of Representatives.

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel has not confirmed or denied these claims.

The group of left-wing donors that Soros’ top political aide attended was borne out of a fundraising committee called the Futuro Fund, which raised more than $30 million for Obama’s re-election campaing. “Led by actress Eva Longoria, Puerto Rico lawyer Andres Lopez and San Antonio businessman Henry R. Muñoz III, the fund represented the most robust demonstration yet of the Latino community’s ability to amass cash for U.S. political campaigns,” Gold wrote.

Cristobal Alex, a former program officer at the Ford Foundation, left his position there to lead the Latino Victory Project as the new group’s president. “What we want to do with the Latino Victory Project is build political power in the Latino community, so that the faces of Latinos are reflected not just in every level of government but in the policies that drive the country forward,” Alex said.

Moving forward, the Post noted, the group will agree to spend anywhere from $1 million to $2 million per target district. “The effort will begin in coming weeks with a campaign aimed at persuading the lawmakers to back an immigration measure this year,” Gold wrote. “If that fails, the group plans to run a barrage of radio and TV ads against them next year.”

The AFL-CIO’s immigration campaign manager, Tom Snyder, said each of these GOP lawmakers has a target on their backs. “There was agreement in the room that if we don’t see action in the House, we know who we’re going after,” Snyder said. “There’s a realization that we have to get back to basics. We’re at the point where if you don’t act, we’re going to have to make you pay at the ballot box.”

Amalia Perea Mahoney, a Chicago-area art gallery owner who the Los Angeles Times reported raked in between $200,000 and $500,000 for Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, said the group is “all very united” in its purpose. “I think it’s a pivotal moment,” she said. Mahoney is also an Obama appointee to an federal arts board.

Soros has spent $100 million since 1997 backing what his Open Society Foundation calls “immigrant rights” groups and projects. Some of those projects, like Soros’ National Immigration Forum-backed Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT), were meant to create the illusion of grassroots support for amnesty where there was none. Recent polling data released by NumbersUSA, conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, shows that Evangelical Republican likely voters disagree with the push for amnesty despite the Soros group’s claims there is grassroots support among Evangelicals for the policy.

Recently, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID), a supporter of immigration reform, withdrew from the House’s version of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” and announced his public opposition to negotiating with Obama and the Senate on immigration, saying such negotiations would be “crazy” for House GOP leadership to enter into. Labrador said House GOP leadership would not be smart to deal with these people because they are trying to “destroy” the Republican Party."

At various points, some of the participants even got a little testy.

Basketball legend Magic Johnson backed Greuel, saying that he selected the city controller because of her broad range of experience in the public and private sectors, her longtime ties to the African American community and the historic nature of her candidacy to be the city’s first female mayor.

“We love this woman because she loves us. We love this woman because she’s been in our community many, many years and the fact that she’s going to get the job done,” Johnson said, standing alongside a broad cross-section of religious, civic and elected leaders at a church on Crenshaw Boulevard.

“Wendy, I am in your campaign ready to go door-to-door with you,” he said. “We want to make sure you are the next mayor. We’re going to make history like we did for President Obama.”

Garcetti, meanwhile, picked up the backing of City Councilwoman Jan Perry, who said she chose her fellow council member because of his track record — and to send a message to special interests that spent millions of dollars supporting Greuel in the primary.

“There has been and there will be a tremendous amount of money donated to one candidate in this race from various special interests and I believe that we need to take a stand to let everyone know that the city of Los Angeles cannot be bought,” said Perry, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor this year.

Although Perry did not mention Greuel by name in her remarks, she could not hide her disdain for the controller as she took questions from reporters. During the primary, Greuel slashed at Perry’s personal financial background in the closing days of the race. Greuel called her after the primary, and Perry said she did not return the call. She paraphrased poet Maya Angelou in explaining why: “Dr. Angelou says, ‘Thank you for letting me know who you are.’ So I’m clear. I understand. I got the memo. It was clear to me that I didn’t need to engage in any false pretenses because that’s not who I am,” Perry said.

“The memo says I do not respect you and that I respect you so little that I would delve into your personal background and then mischaracterize it to boot and then buy time with my own campaign money and put it on websites all over the country,” Perry said. “Instead of dealing with substance, she went to the personal. That was not necessary.”

Greuel brushed off the criticism.

“We are public figures. Everything we are doing is [an] open book as people are making choices about the future,” she told reporters after her news conference. “I received a lot of blows during this campaign, during the beginning. This is for the public to decide.”

Earlier, while thanking Johnson for his endorsement, she flubbed the sport played by the former Lakers point guard who is now part-owner of the Dodgers.

“It is so important to me be endorsed by Magic Johnson, who has been giving back to this community all his life,” she said. “We know a lot of celebrities come and go. This celebrity, this leader has been a person who has stayed in this community and given back.”

“I grew up, Magic, watching you play baseball,” Greuel said, as the crowd interrupted to correct her that Johnson had played basketball.

“You did everything right, I thought baseball too. See, I was thinking Dodgers today. Yay Dodgers!” she said, clapping her hands. “He can do everything. So five NBA championships, new ownership for the Dodgers, millions invested in our community, and an inspiration for Angelenos all across Los Angeles on dealing with the issue of AIDS. And [he has] been an amazing friend, particularly here in South Los Angeles. You have never forgotten.”

Garcetti said he was “so very proud” to receive Perry’s nod, saying that the councilwoman brought a strong independent voice to the mayoral primary and the two shared a passion for revitalizing communities block by block.

“There’s a clear difference in this race. While others are running on rhetoric, we’re a campaign of results. Voters can see the results themselves,” Garcetti said. “No matter how many attacks people made against Jan or me, just walk the streets of our districts, just see the jobs on the streets, the cranes downtown, the cranes in Hollywood…. That’s what Jan Perry and I are going to do together when I am mayor … in South Los Angeles and citywide.”

Perry came in fourth in the primary, receiving nearly 16% of the vote with heavy support among African American voters in South Los Angeles. If those supporters vote as a bloc in the runoff, it could place Garcetti or Greuel within grasp of victory.

Since the March 5 primary, the candidates have been heavily competing to roll out endorsements, with Greuel snagging former President Bill Clinton on Monday. Garcetti and Perry on Thursday questioned the value of Greuel’s big-name endorsers such as Clinton and Johnson, questioning what kind of influence they have with city voters — church groups, neighborhood councils and the like — as they make a decision.

“I admire Magic Johnson very much. He’s a great role model, he’s a tremendous athlete, he’s a great businessman, he’s a very wealthy man, a member of the Guggenheim organization. And, you know, I don’t know if I’d call that grass-roots, but it’s OK,” Perry said. “And I’m happy that he’s wealthy. I have a lot of love for him.”

Johnson bristled at this remark, saying that he has deep, long-standing ties to South Los Angeles.

“I’m not a celebrity. I’m a man of this community, and a businessman, and so people know that,” he told reporters. “I’m the one who started all this business. When you look on Crenshaw, I started that, with that Starbucks down there.”

“I’m the one who started redevelopment in South Los Angeles, not Jan Perry. I did it,” he said. “I love Jan. She’s a good person and she did a wonderful job with what she did downtown, but in L.A., South L.A., I’m the one.”

Late in the day, primary contender Kevin James — who finished third just ahead of Perry — emailed his backers asking them to recommend whom, if anyone, he should endorse.

Hours after voting rights advocates were hailing Monday’s Supreme Court decision, officials indicated that Arizona will take advantage of a provision in the ruling allowing the state to seek to continue requiring the added documentation while it appeals to a federal agency. In effect, the Supreme Court’s ruling, which was viewed as a step forward in national voter registration law, could have a less of an immediate impact within the state.

“The next step is going to the EAC,” Arizona Atty. Gen. Tom Horne said of the federal Elections Assistance Commission, the agency that developed the federal form. After that agency, the state can go back to the courts where the state believes it can win and get to keep the requirement of added documentation on citizenship, Horne said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times.

“The state form will not change, only the federal form,” Matthew Roberts, director of communications for Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett, said in a telephone interview. Roberts said officials will continue distributing the Arizona form, which is used for about 95% of all voter registration. Only about 5% of the registrations come via the federal form, he said.

The decision by state officials was expected since Arizona has been fighting for the tougher requirements for years. Local advocates, however, had earlier said they hoped to work with the state to revise the Arizona registration form in light of the Supreme Court ruling.

“We certainly hope our election officials would not continue to fight this,” said Sam Wercinski, executive director of the Arizona Advocacy network, one of the groups involved in seeking to overturn the Arizona citizenship requirements. “This is a very clear decision,” he said in a conference call by several groups involved in the case.

Earlier Monday, the Supreme Court announced that it had had thrown out Arizona’s requirement that a prospective voter show proof of citizenship. It ruled against Arizona, 7-2, in Arizona vs. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona Inc. The court said that the state policy, approved by voters as Proposition 200 in 2004, was at odds with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, also known as the “motor voter” law.

The federal law was designed to increase participation, particularly among minorities, by making it more convenient for people to sign up to vote by filling out a form when getting a driver’s license, for example. On the federal form, the applicant has to swear that he is a citizen under penalty of perjury. But Arizona went one step further, requiring proof of citizenship such as a passport or birth certificate.

Advocates sued, arguing that the federal form didn’t require such documentation and should be the standard. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that National Voter Registration Act is the controlling law rather than Proposition 200. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court.

Federal law “precludes Arizona from requiring a federal form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself,” Justice Antonia Scalia wrote for the court’s majority. In his ruling, however, Scalia said the state could continue to make a case before the federal agency and depending on that ruling, again appeal to the courts.

“I think the court has given us a clear path to victory,” Atty. Gen. Horne said. He argued that the court affirmed the right of states to set their own standards for voting.

Opponents of the Arizona law said they see it as an effort to limit participation by minorities and immigrants. In the conference call, they said more than 31,000 potential voters were blocked from registering. Voter registration through community-based drives dropped by 44% in Arizona’s largest county, Maricopa, according to Maldef, the Latino civil rights group.

“We don’t think it will be successful,” Nina Perales, Maldef’s vice president for litigation, said of Arizona’s continuing effort to fight for its law. She argued that the state had a chance to provide documentation that the added requirements were needed, but had failed to do so.

“Proposition 200 was a new starting point in the war on voters in Arizona,” Wercinski said.

“Individuals want to register and vote,” he said during the conference call. “Opponents have tried to increase barriers over and over again.... When people register they will vote.”

For groups opposed to the Arizona law, including the ACLU and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Monday’s ruling was major step forward.

“Today’s decision is a significant victory for U.S. citizens and their ability to register to vote without burdensome requirements,” said Wade Henderson, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “In our democracy, if you don’t vote, you don’t count, and the Arizona law was a blatant effort to keep some citizens from making their voice heard in our elections.”

That is because, as Talking Points Memo says, “Obama voters would have received almost exactly 3/5 of the electoral vote compared to their actual population — 30.7 percent of the electoral vote over 51 percent of the popular vote.” This is not where we should be in 2013, debating whether to pass bills to reduce urban voters to a fraction of the value of other voters and hoping that someone with the power to stop it thinks it’s a “bad idea.”

The bill will not become law in Virginia. A key Republican state senator opposes it, so it might not even get out of committee in the state senate; the Lt. Gov opposes it, and since he has already said he will not break 20-20 ties that are strictly partisan (and the senate is split 20-20 between the two parties) even if it reached the floor he seems committed to killing it; and the Governor opposes it, so even were it to reach his desk he seems committed to vetoing it.

It is worth noting that unlike the two states that now distribute electoral votes by Congressional district (Maine which has never split, and Nebraska which in 2008 gave on e EV to OBama) and as far as I know ALL other current proposals, rather than giving the two EV votes equivalent to the two senators to the candidate winning the statewide total, the Virginia proposal would award the final two EVS to the candidate winning the majority of the Congressional districts, not the majority of the state's votes. Those districts were heavily gerrymandered, because in 2008 the Dems had won 6 of the state's electoral votes, and even though Glenn Nye and Tom Perriello and Rick Boucher were defeated in 2010, the Republicans were taking no chances and redrew the CDs to make them more Republican friendly. Obama actually won one CD represented by a Republican.

The proposal came from a state senator whose intention seems racist - he wants rural (for which you can read ""white"") voters not to be outvoted by urban (for which you can read ""black"" and to a lesser degree ""Hispanic"") voters.

Although there was plenty of discussion during the 2012 presidential campaign about the Hispanic vote and how intense black turnout would be, the press was preoccupied with the white vote: the white working class, white women and upscale whites.

Largely missing from daily news stories were references to research on how racial attitudes have changed under Obama, the nation’s first black president. In fact, there has been an interesting exploration of this subject among academics, but before getting to that, let’s look back at some election results.

In the 16 presidential elections between 1952 and 2012, only one Democratic candidate, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, won a majority of the white vote. There have been nine Democratic presidential nominees who received a smaller percentage of the white vote than Obama did in 2008 (43 percent) and four who received less white support than Obama did in 2012 (39 percent).



In 2012, Obama won 39 percent of the white electorate. Four decades earlier, in 1972, George McGovern received a record-setting low of the ballots cast by whites, 31 percent. In 1968, Hubert Humphrey won 36 percent of the white vote; in 1980, Jimmy Carter got 33 percent; in 1984, Walter Mondale took 35 percent of the ballots cast by whites. As far back as 1956, Adlai Stevenson tied Obama’s 39 percent, and in 1952, Stevenson received 40 percent – both times running against Dwight D. Eisenhower. Two Democratic nominees from Massachusetts, Michael Dukakis in 1988 (40 percent) and John Kerry in 2004 (41 percent), got white margins only slightly higher than Obama’s in 2012 — and worse than Obama’s 43 percent in 2008. In other words, Obama’s track record with white voters is not very different from that of other Democratic candidates.

Ballots cast for House candidates provide another measure of white partisanship. These contests have been tracked in exit polls from 1980 onward. Between 1980 and 1992, the white vote for Democratic House candidates averaged 49.6 percent. It dropped sharply in 1994 when Newt Gingrich orchestrated the Republican take-over of the House, averaging just 42.7 percent from 1994 through 2004. White support for Democrats rose to an average of 46.7 percent in 2006 and 2008 as public disapproval of George W. Bush and of Republicans in Congress sharply increased.

How can the percentage of people holding anti-black attitudes have increased from 2006 to 2008 at a time when Obama performed better among white voters than the two previous white Democratic nominees, and then again from 2008 to 2012 when Obama won a second term?

In the aftermath of Obama’s election, white support for Congressional Democrats collapsed to its lowest level in the history of House exit polling, 38 percent in 2010 — at once driving and driven by the emerging Tea Party. In 2012, white Democratic support for House candidates remained weak at 39 percent.

Despite how controversial it has been to talk about race, researchers have gathered a substantial amount of information on the opinions of white American voters.

The political scientists Michael Tesler of Brown University and David O. Sears of UCLA have published several studies on this theme and they have also written a book, “Obama’s Race: The 2008 Election and the Dream of a Post-Racial America,” that analyzes changes in racial attitudes since Obama became the Democratic nominee in 2008.

In their 2010 paper, “President Obama and the Growing Polarization of Partisan Attachments by Racial Attitudes and Race,” Tesler and Sears argue that the

evidence strongly suggests that party attachments have become increasingly polarized by both racial attitudes and race as a result of Obama’s rise to prominence within the Democratic Party.

Specifically, Tesler and Sears found that voters high on a racial-resentment scale moved one notch toward intensification of partisanship within the Republican Party on a seven-point scale from strong Democrat through independent to strong Republican.

To measure racial resentment, which Tesler and Sears describe as “subtle hostility towards African-Americans,” the authors used data from the American National Election Studies and the General Social Survey, an extensive collection of polling data maintained at the University of Chicago.

In the case of A.N.E.S. data, Tesler and Sears write:

The scale was constructed from how strongly respondents agreed or disagreed with the following assertions: 1) Irish, Italian, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. 2) Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class. 3) Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve. 4) It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.

The General Social Survey included questions asking respondents to rate competing causes of racial discrimination and inequality:

The scale was constructed from responses to the following 4 items: 1) Irish, Italian, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. 2) A 3-category variable indicating whether respondents said lack of motivation is or is not a reason for racial inequality. 3) A 3-category variable indicating whether respondents said discrimination is or is not a reason for racial inequality. 4) A three-category variable indicating whether respondents rated whites more, less or equally hardworking than blacks on 7 point stereotype scales.

Supporting the Tesler-Sears findings, Josh Pasek, a professor in the communication studies department at the University of Michigan, Jon A. Krosnick, a political scientist at Stanford, and Trevor Tompson, the director of the Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, use responses from three different surveys in their analysis of “The Impact of Anti-Black Racism on Approval of Barack Obama’s Job Performance and on Voting in the 2012 Presidential Election.”

Pasek and his collaborators found a statistically significant increase from 2008 to 2012 in “explicit anti-black attitudes” – a measure based on questions very similar those used by Tesler and Sears for their racial-resentment scale. The percentage of voters with explicit anti-black attitudes rose from 47.6 in 2008 and 47.3 percent in 2010 to 50.9 percent in 2012.

Crucially, Pasek found that Republicans drove the change: “People who identified themselves as Republicans in 2012 expressed anti-Black attitudes more often than did Republican identifiers in 2008.”

In 2008, Pasek and his collaborators note, the proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes was 31 percent among Democrats, 49 percent among independents, and 71 percent among Republicans. By 2012, the numbers had gone up. “The proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes,” they write, “was 32 percent among Democrats, 48 percent among independents, and 79 percent among Republicans.”

At the moment, the population of the United States (314 million) is heading towards a majority-minority status in 2042.

The American electorate, on the other hand (126 million) is currently 72 percent white, based on the voters who cast ballots last November.

Obama’s ascendency to the presidency means that, on race, the Rubicon has been crossed (2008) and re-crossed (2012).

What are we to make of these developments? Is the country more or less racist? How can the percentage of people holding anti-black attitudes have increased from 2006 to 2008 at a time when Obama performed better among white voters than the two previous white Democratic nominees, and then again from 2008 to 2012 when Obama won a second term?

In fact, the shifts described by Tesler and Pasek are an integral aspect of the intensifying conservatism within the right wing of the Republican Party. Many voters voicing stronger anti-black affect were already Republican. Thus, in 2012, shifts in their attitudes, while they contributed to a 4 percentage point reduction in Obama’s white support, did not result in a Romney victory.

Some Republican strategists believe the party’s deepening conservatism is scaring away voters.

“We have a choice: we can become a shrinking regional party of middle-aged and older white men, or we can fight to become a national governing party,” John Weaver, a consultant to the 2008 McCain campaign, said after Obama’s re-election. Mark McKinnon, an adviser to former President George W. Bush, made a similar point: “The party needs more tolerance, more diversity and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class.”

Not only is the right risking marginalization as its views on race have become more extreme, it is veering out of the mainstream on contraception and abortion, positions that fueled an 11 point gender gap in 2012 and a 13 point gap in 2008.

Given that a majority of the electorate will remain white for a number of years, the hurdle that the Republican Party faces is building the party’s white margins by 2 to 3 points. For Romney to have won, he needed 62 percent of the white vote, not the 59 percent he got.

Working directly against this goal is what Time Magazine recently described as the Republican “brand identity that has emerged from the stars of the conservative media ecosystem: Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly, Ann Coulter, and others.”

It is not so much Latino and black voters that the Republican Party needs. To win the White House again, it must assuage the social conscience of mainstream, moderate white voters among whom an ethos of tolerance has become normal. These voters are concerned with fairness and diversity, even as they stand to the right of center. It is there that the upcoming political battles — on the gamut of issues from race to rights — will be fought."

Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office. (The Washington Post)

President Barack Obama was sworn in for his second term at a White House ceremony on Sunday. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office. (The Washington Post)

President Obama’s historic election in 2008 and his reelection last year proved decisively that race is no longer an insurmountable hurdle to high political office in the United States.

But the current pool of possible candidates suggests that the next black president will not be taking the oath of office anytime soon.

“In the shadow of Barack Obama, there’s not been a lot of growth,” Cornell Belcher, a pollster who was involved in the president’s 2008 campaign, said. “It is really hard for minorities to get elected at the statewide level, and before you start talking about president, frankly, you have to get elected to statewide office.”

The notion of a post-Obama reformation of black politics has not been borne out at the ballot box, as black politicians continue to struggle to win the statewide offices that are the traditional paths to the presidency.

While the election of the first black president marked a significant break from the country’s history of racial prejudice, race still matters: The vast majority of black elected officials are put into office by black voters. Even Obama needed large numbers of black and Latino votes to win, particularly last year, when a majority of whites voters voted for someone else.

Ashley Bell, a former county official in Georgia who switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party with an eye on a future run for statewide office, said that Obama “did convince a lot of young black politicians that they can aspire to crossover offices. We may not live in a post-racial America, but I think we do live in a new era of politics where, on either side of the aisle, everyone knows that a good political candidate is one with crossover appeal, be they white or black or Latino.”

While the country’s changing demographics will favor political leaders of color in the future, the current landscape remains challenging for minority candidates seeking statewide office, particularly governorships and U.S. Senate seats, the typical steppingstones to presidential bids.

Deval L. Patrick (D-Mass.) currently is the nation’s only black governor, and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is the only black member of the Senate, having recently been appointed to fill a vacancy.

Patrick, 56, is often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, but he has said he has no plans to run in 2016. No other black politicians’ names have come up on the short list of credible contenders for the next national election.

On the GOP side of the aisle, former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice has been mentioned as a possible candidate but has steadfastly denied any interest. Colin Powell, who preceded Rice as President George W. Bush’s secretary of state, was once a favored GOP prospect, but he also declined to run.

Most recently, Herman Cain, a black Georgia businessman, was briefly a hit among Republican grass-roots activists in the run-up to the primaries, but he dropped his candidacy after a woman revealed a longtime extramarital affair and other women accused him of sexual harassment.

Obama’s political trajectory was extraordinary for any political figure. He rocketed to the top tier of national politics after a stirring speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, where he used his personal story and oratorical skills to call for uniting a country long divided by race and partisan politics. His election that year to the Senate was helped by the implosion of his strongest opponents in the primary and general elections.

Obama was the third African American to be elected to the Senate since Reconstruction when he won the seat from Illinois seat in 2004; Patrick is only the second black governor elected since that period.

Black politicians seeking to build cross-racial coalitions must make sure they don’t alienate black voters with their appeals to white and others. Former Washington mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), whose name was often included in the list of black political leaders who, like Obama, crossed the old lines of racial politics, lost his bid for a second term after African American voters deemed him more concerned with pleasing the city’s growing white professional class.

Newark Mayor Cory Booker (D), whose name is still on the A-list of nouveau black pols, struggled to overcome the skepticism of African American voters in his first, unsuccessful mayoral campaign.

Booker, a Rhodes Scholar who grew up in Harrington Park, N.J., an upscale suburb of Newark, lost in 2002 to longtime former mayor Sharpe James (D), who said Booker was “not black enough.”

The 43-year-old Booker, now in his second term as mayor, filed papers this month to form a campaign committee for a Senate run in 2014. He also is mentioned as a potential future presidential candidate. Booker’s office did not make him available for an interview.

Scott’s performance in South Carolina’s 2014 Senate race, if he decides to seek a full term, will add to the debate about how much racial politics have changed. Black residents make up 28 percent of South Carolina’s population and are solidly Democratic. The state’s Republican governor, Nikki Haley, is Indian American, and both she and the 48-year-old Scott launched their political careers in predominantly white districts.

Artur Davis, a former House member from Alabama, worked hard to present himself as a crossover candidate when he set out to become the first black governor of his state.

But he turned off black voters by distancing himself from Obama and Alabama’s black leadership and, failing to pick up significant white support, made a surprisingly poor showing in the Democratic primary.

Davis, who has since joined the Republican Party and moved to Northern Virginia, acknowledged the challenge faced by black politicians striving to break barriers. But he said that each contest is unique.

“Political breakthroughs depend more on the circumstance of one person than some magic alchemy of timing,” Davis wrote in an e-mail. “If a black with sufficient political skills, a fundraising base, and a record that appeals to the voters in his or her party emerges, that person will be taken seriously in a way that would not have been possible for my parents’ generation.”

Davis predicted that “within the Democratic Party, the internal pressure to nominate a white female will be far greater than any impetus to elevate a Deval Patrick or Cory Booker in the near future.”

A Hispanic might also have a better shot at the White House before another African American. There are five Hispanic governors and senators, most of them Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who at 41 is being touted as presidential timber.

Many post-civil rights and Generation X black political leaders have demonstrated the political and cultural dexterity to move up to statewide office, sometimes in states that have very small black populations, such as Colorado, where 4.3 percent of the residents are black.

Two years ago, Kamala Harris, who is of African-American and Indian-American descent, was elected attorney general of California, a first in a statewide race. Blacks make up only 6.6 percent of state’s population. She is often talked about as a future gubernatorial candidate.

But in Alabama, where black residents make up 26.5 percent of the population, Davis lost his primary for governor in 2010. Similarly, Thurbert Baker lost in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in Georgia, where nearly a third of the residents are black. Baker had been elected state attorney general three times.

For those who manage to win their party’s nominations, general elections have proven to be be extreme long shots.

Johnny DuPree won the Mississippi Democratic primary for governor in 2011, the first African American to do so in recent history. DuPree, 59, the first black mayor of Hattiesburg, lost to his Republican opponent in the general election by 20 percentage points.

Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, said black candidates in the South, most of who are Democrats, are disadvantaged as much by their party as by their race.

“Georgia and Alabama don’t have any Democrats in statewide office. None,” said Bullock said. “If you’re running statewide and you’re a Democrat, regardless of your ethnicity or your gender, you’re going to lose.”

More than half of the country’s African Americans live in the South, and continued demographic changes could upend its politics over the next two decades. Several states are projected to have populations mostly comprised of people of color.

Already there are signs. Bullock said that in 1996, whites cast 78 percent of all votes; in 2008, the percentage was down to 64 percent.

Bullock said voter rolls show that whites made up less than 60 percent of registered voters in Georgia last year.

Those nonwhite voters will most likely back Democrats, Bullock said. “Unless the Republicans come up with a broader, more encompassing message, all they will succeed in getting is white voters, but they will ultimately run out of white voters.”

“The demographics are changing in favor of minority candidates,” said Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center. In addition to population growth among Latinos and Asians, Kohut pointed to a generational change in attitudes about race.

“It’s simple: Generational demographics really favor minority candidates,” he said."

That is because, as Talking Points Memo says, “Obama voters would have received almost exactly 3/5 of the electoral vote compared to their actual population — 30.7 percent of the electoral vote over 51 percent of the popular vote.” This is not where we should be in 2013, debating whether to pass bills to reduce urban voters to a fraction of the value of other voters and hoping that someone with the power to stop it thinks it’s a “bad idea.”

The bill will not become law in Virginia. A key Republican state senator opposes it, so it might not even get out of committee in the state senate; the Lt. Gov opposes it, and since he has already said he will not break 20-20 ties that are strictly partisan (and the senate is split 20-20 between the two parties) even if it reached the floor he seems committed to killing it; and the Governor opposes it, so even were it to reach his desk he seems committed to vetoing it.

It is worth noting that unlike the two states that now distribute electoral votes by Congressional district (Maine which has never split, and Nebraska which in 2008 gave on e EV to OBama) and as far as I know ALL other current proposals, rather than giving the two EV votes equivalent to the two senators to the candidate winning the statewide total, the Virginia proposal would award the final two EVS to the candidate winning the majority of the Congressional districts, not the majority of the state's votes. Those districts were heavily gerrymandered, because in 2008 the Dems had won 6 of the state's electoral votes, and even though Glenn Nye and Tom Perriello and Rick Boucher were defeated in 2010, the Republicans were taking no chances and redrew the CDs to make them more Republican friendly. Obama actually won one CD represented by a Republican.

The proposal came from a state senator whose intention seems racist - he wants rural (for which you can read ""white"") voters not to be outvoted by urban (for which you can read ""black"" and to a lesser degree ""Hispanic"") voters.

It will not go anywhere.

It is ironic that the vote distribution turned out to so closely match the ratio of the 3/5 Compromise.

But then, part of the pushback against Obama has from the beginning been because he was Black.

This case could also set an important precedent for lawsuits recently filed against similar laws in Texas and North Carolina.

The Wisconsin law, which is now on hold, is among the strictest in the country. It requires a voter to show poll workers government-issued photo identification, like a driver’s license or passport.

The law’s challengers, which include the A.C.L.U., the League of United Latin American Citizens, the League of Young Voters and several private citizens, sued under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That section, which survived the Supreme Court’s ruling, prohibits state and local governments from imposing any “voting qualification or prerequisite to voting” that has a racially discriminatory effect. The test is whether a law causes minority voters to have “less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process.”

The plaintiffs presented substantial evidence that the Wisconsin statute had precisely that effect.

For example, a political scientist testified that it is likely that more than 63,000 residents of Milwaukee do not have the required photo ID, and that black residents are 40 percent more likely than whites not to have such ID. In addition, one-third of those without a photo ID do not have the underlying documents, like a birth certificate, needed to get one. The court heard testimony from several such witnesses, including Lorene Hutchins, a 93-year-old black woman who was born at home in Mississippi at a time when the state’s hospitals refused to accept black patients."

Oh no. It's about not allowing DEMOCRATS to vote. White Democrats too.

From their brief:

DOJ’s accusations of racial discrimination are baseless. In 2011, both houses of the Texas Legislature were controlled by large Republican majorities, and their redistricting decisions were designed to increase the Republican Party’s electoral prospects at the expense of the Democrats....The redistricting decisions of which DOJ complains were motivated by partisan rather than racial considerations, and the plaintiffs and DOJ have zero evidence to prove the contrary. It is perfectly constitutional for a Republican-controlled legislature to make partisan districting decisions, even if there are incidental effects on minority voters who support Democratic candidates.

Translation:

""So, basically, we just want to fuck over all Democrats, and if the Black and Brown people are also hurt, well, they shouldn't vote for Democrats, should they? It's only collateral damage""

You know, having them actually come right out and say it--that they don't want Democrats to vote--is somehow not surprising. But it's good that they're doing it at last.

But wait! There's more. To address the actual accusations of racial bias and discrimination, Texas is using the argument that ""Yeah, there may be an isolated incident or two, but it's NOTHING like it was in 1965"".

From the article, which says it better than I can:

Furthermore, the state claims, even if Texas did discriminate, and the state stresses that it did not, it was nothing as bad as “the ‘pervasive,’ ‘flagrant,’ ‘widespread,’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination that originally justified preclearance in 1965.” So as long as Texas skies aren’t alight with flames from burning crosses, what’s the big whoop?

So, according to this, Texas is arguing that Section 2, and in fact the entire reasons for preclearance are all based on conditions in 1965. And that since ""things are better than in 1965"" then Section 2 is null and void.

I think the fact that Texas is second only to Mississippi in Section 2 lawsuits is the basis for this particular argument.

However, there is a danger here. Texas is arguing that ONLY conditions that existed in 1965 would justify Federal supervision of the elections process. Sort of like an ""originalism to the extreme"" argument.

And that can be dangerous because there are those on the Supreme Court that would like nothing more than the total eradication of the Voting Rights Act.

Not to mention the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments, but that's another story."

And one of the biggest ways that has happened, is the Wisconsin republican answer to seeing THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN, as long as they're in power. They have made endless laws to make sure of that. And now, what happened in Texas last night, will be very difficult for Wisconsin to match. It's crazy. Possible in Texas, almost impossible in Wisconsin.

Those of us caught up on the new laws and restrictions regarding what is allowable in the state house, and who can be there, and under what conditions, know how fast after the loss of the recall the GOP clamped down on seeing to it that nothing like the anti Walker uprising would happen again on their watch. I could go on for many paragraphs here telling you how specific and restrictive those new laws are. I could roll your socks back as to the totalitarian and successful cap the Wisconsin GOP has put on anything like what happened in Texas yesterday, and what happened in Wisconsin, week after week, at one time not so long ago.

Recently, the Republican Wisconsin legislature voted to pass a law similar to what was at stake in Texas. The ""gallery"" was highly restricted. Women w/tape over their mouths---to signify protest to the new rules of their being there---were told to remove the tape or be arrested. They removed the tape and covered their mouths w/their hands. Some Democrats in the chamber tried to shout their way into their right to be heard.

But in the end, Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling everyone to shut the fuck up, they would NOT be heard. This disgraceful behavior was shown here a bit on video, and God bless her, on Rachel Maddow's show. Other than that, crickets. The nation has left the story of Wisconsin behind. We tried, we lost, and journalism is not about losers.

I CHEER what happened in Texas yesterday with all my heart. BUT, beware of the media story on your side today. Because it can be gone tomorrow. And don't underestimate the response of republicans when they have been so challenged. I'll bet you the little money I have in the bank, that Texas too will soon have a bunch of laws that make it impossible for what happened yesterday to happen again. The only reason they aren't there now in Texas, is because what happened surprised the hell out of them. Don't doubt for a minute that they're gathered in back rooms as I write this, figuring out to make sure it never happens to them again.

I cheer every minute of attention Texas gets w/this, and I cheer Wendy Davis. I don't want it to go away. But I know it will. My message here is not about cynicism, or about ""don't bother."" IT. IS. NOT.

My message is that we are on the brink of so much in this country, and we have to find a way to stop letting them get away with this. And that means in Wisconsin too, no matter how gerrymandered it is. I frankly don't know how to do this. But I do know the answer is NOT to bow out from the fight in a heap of disappointment and anger. And I don't for a minute suggest that's what Wisconsin Democrats are doing. BUT, everything is so much harder for them now.

Wisconsin must find a way to rise again, and Texas must find a way to hold on to this win. And part of that is seeing what's coming. And I'm telling you what's coming in Texas. Somehow, some way, we must stop this. And that means we have to decide our priorities as Democrats. And there in lies the rub. And I have no answer for it."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/world/europe/women-finding-their-way-in-german-politics.html,2013-03-08 00:00:00,['Melissa Eddy'],Women Finding Their Way in German Politics,"During the 11 years she spent as labor minister in her state, Ms. Dreyer — a trained lawyer who served as a state prosecutor in Bad Kreuznach before entering politics, as the mayor of that same city — became known for tackling problems at the source. She held roundtable meetings to discuss the issue of caring for the elderly in nursing homes so that workers could participate. Her own experiences as the mother of a patchwork family with three children and resident of a publicly sponsored social living project have contributed to her image of being straightforward and someone to whom average people can relate.

Bettina Munimus, a researcher with the European Academy for Women in Politics and Economics, based in Berlin, said that Ms. Dreyer’s more consensus-oriented approach is indicative of an overall shift, visible in the other states where women are now in charge — including the biggest, North Rhine-Westphalia, as well as Saarland and Thuringia.

“In the previous generation, the old male politicians used the ‘basta’ style of politics to outwardly demonstrate power and the need for the final word,” Ms. Munimus said. Not so the female governors. “They know that power is needed to bring about policy, but along the way, it is important to cooperate, to create policy with others. That is the identifying factor of this style.”

Since 2010, another Social Democrat, Hannelore Kraft, has governed North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state and one known for decades as much for its old boys’ political network as for its heavy industry.

Ms. Kraft was forced to settle right after her election for a minority government that relied on the support of political foes to pass legislation. Together with the deputy governor, Sylvia Löhrmann from the Greens, Ms. Kraft dubbed her government the “invitation coalition” and got to work.

Two years later, her fragile constellation collapsed, and Ms. Kraft faced off against a former minister from Ms. Merkel’s conservative party in fresh elections last May. Not only did Ms. Kraft retain her governorship; she won a clear majority in the state legislature for government with the Greens.

Many Germans would have liked to see Ms. Kraft run as the Social Democratic candidate, challenging Ms. Merkel for the chancellorship, in September elections. A recent survey by Statista pollsters showed the 51-year-old the third most popular politician in the country, after Ms. Merkel and Joachim Gauck, the German president."

He Previously Covered State', 'National Politics', 'Including The Presidential Campaign.']","Garcetti and Greuel vie for black Democrats, white Republicans","The day after Eric Garcetti won a spot in the May runoff for Los Angeles mayor, the city councilman turned his focus to African Americans in South Los Angeles, campaigning in Leimert Park with comedian D.L. Hughley.

“In too many of our communities, especially communities of color, we still have way too much crime,” Garcetti told the audience. “We still have too many gunshots, too few opportunities for our young people.”

A day later, Garcetti rival Wendy Greuel, the city controller, announced that one of the city’s premier black clergymen, Rev. Cecil “Chip” Murray, was backing her. “Chip Murray has redefined what it means to be a faith leader in Los Angeles,” she said of the former pastor of First African Methodist Episcopal Church.

So began the 11-week battle over the tens of thousands of Los Angeles voters who shunned both Garcetti and Greuel in last week’s primary. Many of them fall into two groups: black Democrats in South L.A. and white Republicans in the San Fernando Valley.

As Garcetti and Greuel each clamber to gain support among these dissimilar voters — concentrated on opposite sides of the city, focused on disparate needs — it is something close to an even match, at least for now.

For both, the math of building a winning coalition is difficult. In Tuesday’s primary, Greuel, who lives in Studio City, established her dominance in the Valley and Harbor areas but won few neighborhoods in the vast urban stretch in between. Garcetti, who lives in Silver Lake, swept the Eastside, central city and Westside. Garcetti finished first with 33%, followed by Greuel at 29%.

Greuel had hoped to win extra support citywide among women by stressing that she would be the city’s first female mayor. A poll last month by USC and The Times found no sign of success for that strategy, but Greuel’s campaign team is still counting on the potential barrier-breaching to motivate women to vote in the May 21 runoff.

“I think where the historic nature of Wendy’s candidacy will make a difference is in turnout,” Greuel campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski said.

Garcetti, whose paternal ancestry is Mexican, had tried — with mixed results — to win outsized support among Latinos, roughly a quarter of the vote in Los Angeles. He did win the city’s most heavily Latino neighborhoods but by narrower margins than he would probably need in the second round.

One of Garcetti’s main challenges now is to spur some of the potential supporters who declined to vote in the low-turnout primary — such as young Latinos — to cast ballots in the runoff. Lending a hand will be an independent committee that has hired operatives of President Obama’s reelection campaign to comb voter data to find those most amenable to backing Garcetti and prod them to the polls. Daniel Wagner, the Obama campaign’s “chief analytics officer,” is one of those hired.

“The only job we have is to produce more votes for Eric Garcetti than Eric Garcetti would,” said Rick Jacobs, a co-founder of the committee, the optimistically named Lots of People Who Support Eric Garcetti for Mayor.

In South L.A., the key for both Garcetti and Greuel is to capture the votes of African Americans who overwhelmingly favored City Councilwoman Jan Perry in last week’s election.

For months, Garcetti and Greuel have been making frequent visits to black churches — on one Sunday, the same churches.

Garcetti highlights his early support of Obama, reminding crowds he was California co-chair of Obama’s historic 2008 campaign. In Greuel’s case, a staple of her South L.A. speeches is a tribute to former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley and recollections of her work as one of his aides.

In the runoff, endorsements will be particularly valuable in South L.A., said Mike Shimpock, a veteran Democratic campaign consultant.

“South L.A. has a lot of needs that have historically been ignored — parks, public safety, economic development,” he said. “So I think one of the reasons you see third-party validators being more important is because people don’t necessarily trust government to do the right thing.”

Greuel and Garcetti are indeed competing for the support of black political leaders, including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas. “They both have very strong followings,” said Jewett Walker, a campaign strategist who has long worked for Democrats in the area.

Also in play is Perry’s support. On Friday, she sharply criticized Greuel, who had attacked Perry over her personal finances during the primary, but stopped short of endorsing Garcetti.

In the duel for Republicans, Garcetti and Greuel are looking to pick up support from those who backed former radio talk-show host Kevin James in the primary. The lone Republican in the race, James ran strongest in Porter Ranch, Chatsworth and other conservative parts of the West Valley but also picked up thousands of votes on the Westside.

From the start, Greuel has framed her candidacy with Republicans as a major target audience. She often calls herself a tough fiscal watchdog with a record of combating waste, fraud and abuse at City Hall.

“Fiscal watchdog: That’s an expression Republicans love,” said Garrett Biggs, a Republican campaign consultant in Woodland Hills.

But Garcetti, like Greuel a Democrat, is making a play for Republicans too, citing the economic rebound of Hollywood and other parts of his council district, his service in the Navy Reserve, his plan to abolish the city business tax, and his votes for layoffs and furloughs of city workers when cash was running short.

Advertisement

“We’re going to spend a lot of time talking to those voters,” Garcetti strategist Bill Carrick said.

Greuel’s alliance with public employee unions has complicated her positioning as a conservative. The unions spent more than $2 million on her behalf, drawing relentless attacks from Garcetti, Perry and James. All three have suggested that Greuel would sell out to the unions’ demands for raises and benefit protections when the city struggles with budget shortfalls on the next mayor’s watch.

“Her courting of the labor vote may make her look less appealing to those Valley conservatives,” said political scientist Tom Hogen-Esch of Cal State Northridge.

Greuel, a Republican until 1992, has denied she would show favoritism to the unions.

Advertisement

Greuel has also promoted her pro-business agenda. She too supports elimination of the business tax, and she often tells crowds about her experience with her family’s building supply company in North Hollywood.

The day after the primary, Greuel’s first stop was WET Design, a Sun Valley firm. When the company sought to expand in 2008, she said, she cut red tape. Greuel planned to spend Sunday morning at church on the opposite side of town, joining Baptist worshipers in Historic South Central.

Garcetti staged his own business event Thursday, promoting tech jobs at a start-up in Venice. By Saturday, he was back in South L.A., greeting guests at a block party in West Adams.

The judge’s findings come a month after the U.S. Justice Department accused Palmdale, Lancaster and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department of a systematic effort to discriminate against minorities who received low-income subsidized housing. Federal officials said deputies conducted widespread unlawful searches of homes, performed improper detentions and used unreasonable force that specifically targeted blacks and Latinos.

The Palmdale voting rights case has been watched closely by minority activists in the Antelope Valley. V. Jesse Smith, president of the Antelope Valley Chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, lauded the judge’s decision.

“A lot of us [minorities] have been locked out of the process,” said Smith, who unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Palmdale City Council in 2009. “There’s a great deal of the old boys’ club there.”

In an opinion released this week, L.A. County Superior Court Judge Mark V. Mooney concluded that Palmdale’s at-large voting system violated state law because the city has “racially polarized voting” and minorities have less influence over the outcomes of elections.

Palmdale is 54.4% Latino and nearly 15% black, yet it has elected only one Latino City Council member and never a black council member in its history, said plaintiff Juan Jauregui’s attorney, R. Rex Parris.

Parris and others argue that minorities would have a better shot at being elected if Palmdale were divided into council districts.

Parris is also the mayor of neighboring Lancaster, which also holds at-large, or citywide, elections. But voters in Lancaster have elected multiple black and Latino council members.

Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said the city plans to appeal the decision. He called the lawsuit a “money grab” by outsiders and trial lawyers trying to meddle in the community. The California Voting Rights Act, he said, is “poorly written” and unfairly holds cities responsible for the choices of their voters and the quality of their candidates.

“This is not a voter rights lawsuit. This is not about black or white, it’s about green,” Ledford said.

About 15 to 20 cities, school districts and other government entities have been sued under the California Voting Rights Act since the law was enacted in 2002, according to Robert Rubin, an attorney who helped write the act and is representing the American Civil Liberties Union in an ongoing lawsuit over Anaheim’s election system. The act forbids the use of at-large elections to dilute the power of minority voters.

The Palmdale case is the first that has been decided at trial. All the previous cases have settled, some after protracted — and expensive — battles.

The city of Modesto appealed the constitutionality of California’s voting rights law to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case. In the end, the city settled a voting rights case against it for $3 million and switched to by-district elections.

The city of Compton fought a voting rights case filed in 2010 by a group of Latino residents for more than a year before agreeing to a settlement under which the city put a measure on the ballot asking voters whether they wanted to switch to by-district elections. Voters approved the measure, and the city’s first Latino councilman was elected last month.

Rubin, who also represented the plaintiffs in the Modesto case, said Palmdale’s loss at trial may send a signal to other agencies to voluntarily adopt by-district elections or risk facing expensive lawsuits.

Often, said Rod Pacheco, a former Riverside County district attorney who now specializes in voting rights cases, elected officials appeared to be trying to drag out the case despite knowing that they probably would lose and that taxpayers would be stuck with the bill.

“The City Council of Palmdale, which made the decision to fight this and expend those funds, didn’t spend their own money,” Pacheco said. Officials often seem primarily concerned about hanging on to their jobs, he said: “The tack that many of these cities take is to get to the next election.”

Ledford said he has endorsed multiple black and Latino candidates for Palmdale’s City Council over the years and “can’t explain” why the council does not reflect the diversity of the population.

“We go for the best and the brightest,” Ledford said. “I can’t speak for the message of the candidates or their ability to raise the funds to run.”

He also said Parris seems to have a personal vendetta against Palmdale — an accusation Parris denies.

Henry Hearns became the first black elected official in the Antelope Valley when he won a seat on Lancaster’s City Council in 1990, and he recalls receiving death threats during the campaign. He said the city of Palmdale should do everything it can to give blacks and Latinos a fair opportunity to be elected.

“I would hope that that the citizenry in Palmdale would not just elect anyone based on race or culture,” Hearns said. “I would hope that they would vote for the most qualified candidate.”

http://news.yahoo.com/ted-cruz-natural-born-citizen-eligible-serve-president-100207138--politics.html,,[],Is Ted Cruz a natural-born citizen eligible to serve as president?,"Sarah Helene Duggin from the Catholic University of America looks at potential foreign-born presidential candidates like Ted Cruz and a possible emerging consensus among scholars about their eligibility for the White House.

The 2016 presidential election is more than three years away, but potential candidates and their supporters are already contemplating the next campaign. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas—now well-known for his role in the recent federal shutdown—and California’s celebrity former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger are among those whose names are circulating. But neither Cruz nor Schwarzenegger was born in the United States, and the Constitution provides that “[n]o person except a natural born citizen, or a Citizen at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President.”

Cruz640

For Cruz, Schwarzenegger, and a number of other potential candidates, the Natural Born Citizenship Clause raises a critical question: Is anyone born outside the United States constitutionally eligible to serve as president?

Senator John McCain, who was born in the Panama Canal Zone, faced the same question with respect to his natural-born citizenship status in his 2008 presidential bid, and purported concerns about President Obama’s constitutional qualifications led “birthers” to file lawsuits challenging his natural-born credentials on the basis of a variety of far-fetched theories during the last several years. A new natural-born citizenship debate is already simmering, and it seems likely to heat up a great deal before the 2016 election takes place.

The Constitution does not define the term natural born citizen. Even so, Governor Schwarzenegger is clearly out of the running. Given that he was born in Austria to Austrian parents, there is no basis for arguing that he is a natural-born citizen of the United States.

For Senator Cruz—who was born in Calgary, Alberta, to an American mother and a Cuban father—the question is more complicated. There is a strong argument that anyone who acquires United States citizenship at birth, whether by virtue of the 14th Amendment or by operation of federal statute, qualifies as natural born. The Supreme Court, however, has never ruled on the meaning of the natural-born citizenship requirement. In the absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling—or a constitutional amendment—the parameters of the clause remain uncertain.

Story continues

The origins of the Natural Born Citizenship Clause date back to a letter John Jay (who later authored several of the Federalist Papers and served as our first chief justice) wrote to George Washington, then president of the Constitutional Convention, on July 25, 1787. At the time, as Justice Joseph Story later explained in his influential Commentaries on the Constitution, many of the framers worried about “ambitious foreigners who might otherwise be intriguing for the office.”

“Permit me to hint, whether it would not be wise & seasonable to provide a strong check to the admission of Foreigners into the administration of our national Government; and to declare expressly that the Command in chief of the American army shall not be given to nor devolve on, any but a natural born Citizen,” Jay wrote.

Washington thanked Jay for his hints in a reply dated September 2, 1787. Shortly thereafter, the natural-born citizenship language appeared in the draft Constitution the Committee of Eleven presented to the Convention. There is no record of any debate on the clause.

While it is possible to trace the origins of the Natural Born Citizenship Clause, it is harder to determine its intended scope—who did the framers mean to exclude from the presidency by this language? The Naturalization Act of 1790 probably constitutes the most significant evidence available. Congress enacted this legislation just three years after the drafting of the Constitution, and many of those who voted on it had participated in the Constitutional Convention. The act provided that “children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond the sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural-born citizens.”

There is no record of discussion of the term natural born citizen, but it is reasonable to conclude that the drafters believed that foreign-born children of American parents who acquired citizenship at birth could and should be deemed natural born citizens.

Although subsequent naturalization acts dropped the natural born language, members of later Congresses proposed many bills and resolutions designed to clarify, limit, or eliminate the Natural Born Citizenship Clause; none succeeded. In April 2008, however, amid challenges to Senator McCain’s eligibility to serve as president, the Senate passed a resolution declaring that “John Sidney McCain, III, is a ‘natural born Citizen” under Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution of the United States.”

The resolution—co-sponsored by a number of McCain’s Senate colleagues, including rival presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama—undoubtedly offered Senator McCain some comfort, but it had no real constitutional significance.

Challenges to presidential qualifications are not new. In 1964, for example, questions arose as to the natural-born credentials of Republican nominee Senator Barry Goldwater, because he was born in Arizona prior to statehood. In 1968, legal actions were threatened against former Michigan Governor George Romney, who was born to American parents in Mexico, when he sought the Republican nomination.

Despite the shadow that lawsuits may cast over a presidential bid, the obstacles to successful litigation of natural-born citizenship challenges are formidable. These matters raise a wide array of justiciability concerns. Standing issues led to the dismissal of lawsuits filed in federal courts in New Hampshire and California challenging Senator McCain’s natural-born status in 2008 (Hollander v. McCain, Robinson v. Bowen), as well as to the dismissal of claims brought by a Guyana-born naturalized citizen who argued that the Fifth and 14th Amendments effectively repealed the natural born citizenship clause (Hassan v. Federal Election Committee).

Standing is not the only obstacle to adjudication of natural-born citizenship issues. Claims that a candidate lacks the requisite natural-born citizenship credentials are unlikely to ripen until a nominee is chosen, or perhaps even elected, and federal courts may be reluctant to delve into the merits of challenges to a candidate’s natural-born citizenship status on political question grounds.

What can we expect if Senator Cruz or another similarly situated candidate runs for president in 2016? Undoubtedly, the controversy will continue with passionate advocates on both sides of the issue. A scholarly consensus is emerging, however, that anyone who acquires citizenship at birth is natural born for purposes of Article II.

This consensus rests on firm foundations. First, given Jay’s letter and the language of the 1790 naturalization act, it seems evident that the framers were worried about foreign princes, not children born to American citizens living abroad. Second, the 14-year residency requirement Article II also imposes as a presidential prerequisite ensures that, regardless of their place of birth, would-be presidents must spend a significant time living in the United States before they can run for office.

Finally, the natural born citizenship clause is both an anomaly and an anachronism. The way in which the clause differentiates among United States citizens is contrary to the overall spirit of the Constitution; the risk that foreign nobility will infiltrate our government is long past; and place of birth is a poor surrogate for loyalty to one’s homeland in our increasingly mobile society and our ever more interconnected world. The best solution would be to amend the Constitution, as many legislators on both sides of the aisle have proposed over the years. In the absence of an amendment, the clause should be narrowly interpreted.

Sarah Helene Duggin is Professor of Law and Director of the Law and Public Policy Program for the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America. She has authored several academic articles on the natural-born citizenship proviso.

Bratton to return as the city’s police commissioner Thursday, selecting the former LAPD police chief to head a department praised for overseeing a drop in crime but criticized for its use of racially charged stop-and-frisk tactics.

Bratton had been expected to get the job, which has been held since 2002 by Raymond Kelly. De Blasio, who will take office in January at the end of Michael Bloomberg’s third and final term, was a harsh critic of Kelly and vowed to replace him if elected.

In a statement issued prior to a news conference announcing the appointment Thursday, De Blasio called Bratton a “proven crime-fighter.”

“He knows what it takes to keep the city safe,” the mayor-elect said.

For his part, Bratton said in a statement that “De Blasio’s priorities are my priorities.”

People familiar with the decision had already begun reacting to it before the news briefing.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, an activist in the African American community, said he spoke with De Blasio on Tuesday about his selection of Bratton, who also served under New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the 1990s.

Sharpton said he had a “very distant and adversarial relationship” with Bratton when he served in New York, but that their relations improved as Bratton served in Los Angeles and the two worked together on gang violence and police misconduct issues.

“Mr. Bratton knows my concerns and the concerns of others about racial profiling in stop and frisk policing, but at the same time is aware of our desire to continue the decrease of violence and crime in our community,” Sharpton said in a statement.

Bratton’s time as NYPD’s top cop made him an international figure, so by the time he came to Los Angeles in 2002, he was already a law enforcement superstar who had appeared on the cover of Time magazine in the ‘90s for his success in New York. He served as LAPD chief until 2009.

Shelby County, Ala., is making the case against the voting law. Section 5 of the act empowers the federal government to negate new local and state voting rules if they would lead to discrimination against minority voters. It has been enforced primarily in Southern states that had a long, dismal history of preventing African Americans from voting. Shelby County contends that the problem has been remedied and so Section 5 is no longer justified.

Rep. John Lewis of Georgia begs to differ. Lewis was severely beaten in Selma during the 1965 “Bloody Sunday” police riot directed against peaceful civil rights marchers. The horror of that scene as it played out on America’s television screens led directly to congressional approval of the Voting Rights Act.

In an interview with USA Today, Lewis talked about the methods used to bar blacks from voting back in 1965, and insisted that more subtle impediments still are being employed to undercut voting rights today.

“You may not have what we had, such as the literacy tests or asking people to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap or the number of jelly beans in a jar,” Lewis said. “It may not be the overt acts of violence that we had and witnessed during the ‘60s. But the result is the same.”

As recently as 2006, both houses of Congress agreed with Lewis. After extensive testimony, lawmakers determined that a long list of problems still exists and they renewed the Voting Rights Act for an additional 25 years. The vote was overwhelming in the House unanimous in the Senate and was hailed by President George W. Bush as a victory for American democracy.

In court on Wednesday, however, Scalia mocked that vote. He said the Senate’s unanimity simply proved the law had not been given serious consideration. The senators were afraid, he said, to cast a vote against a law with a “wonderful” name. He went on to assert that the reauthorization of the act was merely “a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement.”

That sort of legal reasoning may be good enough for someone sitting on a bar stool well into his third pint, but it is not good enough for the highest court in the land. Scalia makes self-serving assumptions about what was on the minds of senators in 2006 -- afraid, not serious, enamored with a name -- with no facts to back up his barbs.

Tossing actual statistics back at Scalia, Justice Elena Kagan cited a string of continued voting-rights violations. As to the state of mind of the senators, she said the unanimous vote was pretty good proof that the evidence of contemporary abuses was convincing, even to conservative Southerners.

“It was clear to 98 senators, including every senator from a covered state, who decided that there was a continuing need for this piece of legislation,” Kagan said.

Undeterred, Scalia opined that a law governing voting rights is “not the kind of question you can leave to Congress.” Oh, really? The right to vote is the core of our constitutional democracy. It is not, as Scalia says, “a racial entitlement,” it is an American entitlement. It seems that might be a very useful thing for Congress to watch over and protect. It was eminently important in 1965 and remains important today.

One need only consider the outrageous voter suppression measures attempted in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and other states in the 2012 election cycle to see that the right to vote is still something certain Americans must fight for. It is true that impediments put in the way of black and Latino voters now are not so much about racial animosity as they are about the fact that those racial groups overwhelmingly vote for Democrats, but the effect, as Lewis says, is the same.

Given the weirdness of his comments, it might not be wrong to assume Scalia’s true concern is less about “racial entitlement” than it is about making sure his fellow Republicans are entitled. Entitled, that is, to manipulate elections when they can no longer win fair and square."

In the debate over the future of the Voting Rights Act , it sometimes becomes apparent that certain members of the Supreme Court are either oblivious to our nation’s recent history or willfully ignore it. Justice Antonin Scalia made this abundantly clear in his comments during the Feb. 27 oral argument in Shelby County v. Holder , statements that he repeated in a speech on April 15.

To Scalia, the Voting Rights Act — especially Section 5, which requires covered states to submit any changes in voting practices to the Justice Department or a Washington court for approval — is a “racial entitlement” and a violation of state sovereignty. In his view, it unfairly and unnecessarily treats seven Southern states, plus Alaska, Arizona and parts of six others, differently from states not covered by the act. This month, according to the Wall Street Journal, he called the act a form of “racial preferment” that affected only African Americans while ignoring the white population.

Such statements indicate that Scalia is woefully ignorant of the legislation’s history. Because of our nation’s painful legacy of racial injustice, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has often been used to safeguard black voters specifically, but its protections extend to all Americans regardless of skin color, as was vividly demonstrated in the period after its passage.

Enactment of the Voting Rights Act also led to the abolition of the poll tax. So in May 1966, African Americans were able to vote freely for the first time in an off-year primary election. Across the South, many blacks sought a host of elected offices, from county sheriff to seats in state legislatures. In Alabama, a Democratic candidate for governor, Attorney General Richmond Flowers, vigorously campaigned for black votes. If elected, he promised, he would appoint blacks to positions in his administration — men and women active in the civil rights movement, he pledged, not “just a few Uncle Toms.”

The favorite to win in Alabama, however, was Flowers’s opponent, Lurleen Wallace, a stand-in for her husband, George, the gubernatorial incumbent who was ineligible to run because of term limits. A vote for the Wallace ticket would be a vote for segregation; George Wallace had been the scourge of the civil rights movement in Alabama and had actively incited racial hatred to obtain the support of white voters.

On Election Day, the turnout was extraordinary. In Selma, the polls opened at 8 a.m., but black voters started lining up hours before. In Birmingham, a blistering sun caused one older man to faint, but when an ambulance arrived, he refused to go to the hospital until he had cast his ballot. “This is the first time I’m voting,” he said. “It might be my last.”

Voting continued far into the night. In Montgomery, the polls were supposed to close at 6 p.m. But at 8:30, 1,100 African Americans were still waiting at the polls and refused to leave before they had voted. At that same hour in Birmingham, 700 voters had waited patiently for more than five hours. “It made me think I was sort of somebody,” Willie Bolden, the 81-year-old grandson of slaves, told a reporter.

For African Americans, the outcome was disappointing. Few black candidates were elected, and Mrs. Wallace won a resounding victory with 399,024 votes, nearly twice as many as her husband had won four years earlier. Few had doubted that Wallace would win, but the size of her victory was what was truly surprising. And it was due, in part, to the Voting Rights Act.

Analysts later discovered that, while their projections had accounted for the historic enfranchisement of Alabama’s blacks, they had missed an equally important development: the even greater expansion of the white vote. By eliminating the literacy tests and other impediments such as the poll tax, the Voting Rights Act gave many poor whites the opportunity to register and cast ballots. A skillful get-out-the-vote campaign by Wallace’s staff added 110,000 new voters to the white majority, decreasing black influence even as the number of black voters grew. Nor was this phenomenon limited to Alabama. Throughout the South, many of the new registrants were white.

This election indicates that Scalia is wrong when he calls the Voting Rights Act “a racial preferment” that provides no protection for white voters. The act protects all voters, especially in the states and districts covered by Section 5, from any obstacles that might be put in their way. That was true in 1966 and remains true today as efforts to suppress the minority vote continue. Scalia needs to do his homework before the court determines the act’s future."

A record number of women and racial minorities were elected to the 113th Congress, which was sworn in Thursday. Among them was the first Buddhist to join the Senate, as well as the first Hindu and the first openly bisexual woman in the House.

House Democrats became the first caucus in the history of either chamber not to have a majority of white men. It was a watershed moment for the Democratic Party, which has adopted diversity as one of its chief selling points and has marketed itself as the party that looks more like a fast-changing United States.

“It was a decision,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in an interview about boosting the number of Democratic women in Congress. “We made a decision a long time ago that we were going to try to expand the number. We made a decision for women to help women, and also for the Democrats as a party to help recruit women and help fund campaigns.”

The overwhelming majority of lawmakers sworn in Thursday were white men. But the new Congress, while still lagging behind the nation as whole in diversity, reflects national demographic changes that hold significant implications for American politics.

Democrats think those changes­ give them a distinct political advantage in a nation in which whites make up a smaller part of the electorate. It also opens new avenues of fundraising to support their campaigns.

Republicans, too, see the value of diversity and have sought to highlight changes in the GOP. When Jim DeMint (S.C.) recently stepped down from the Senate, for instance, he was replaced by Tim Scott, giving Republicans a chance to claim the only African American in the Senate. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), a Cuban American, also became an instant star among Republicans when he was elected.

Overall, though, Republicans have struggled to diversify their ranks, and the party was criticized after the presidential election for mainly appealing to an older, whiter coalition. Whether the GOP will adjust its positions to lure more votes from an increasingly diverse electorate is a key question likely to play out in the new Congress.

The Democratic diversity was on display Thursday during the vote for House speaker. Pelosi beamed as dozens of women and minorities called out her name as their choice over Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who was narrowly elected by the Republican majority. Twice, her name was read aloud in Spanish.

For Pelosi, the moment probably paled in comparison to the day six years ago when she, in her words, “broke the marble ceiling” and was elected the nation’s first female speaker.

But for Pelosi, 72, who was one of 23 female lawmakers when she was first elected 25 years ago, Thursday had different rewards. Maybe no Democrat has been more central to the party’s diversity push than she has.

The House has 81 women, 61 of them Democrats. The Senate includes 20 women — still just a fifth of the chamber but an achievement striking enough that ABC News gathered the group together for a joint interview that aired on Thursday night.

The contrast between the two parties has been stark in recent weeks.

A look at the 113th Congress (Sources: Staff reports)

When Republicans first circulated a list of their committee chairmen for the 113th Congress, showing that every committee would be headed by a white man, Pelosi’s office quickly followed up with a flier with photos of the ranking Democrats on the panels.

Half of top Democrats on committees are minorities or women. In the debate that followed, Boehner named Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) to chair the House Administration Committee, a panel on which she had not served.

“The more diversity of opinion at the table, the more consensus you can build, the more sustainability of the solutions, and the more respect it commands,” Pelosi said of her efforts to advance women and minorities into leadership.

There will be now be 42 African Americans in the House and one in the Senate — Scott, the first black Republican in the Senate since 1979.

Two of the Senate’s three Hispanics will be Republicans (Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida). Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.) is a Democrat.

But of the 29 Latinos in the House, 24 are Democrats. In opening-day speeches to the House by Pelosi and Boehner, only the Democratic leader mentioned the need for comprehensive immigration reform, to a standing ovation from Democrats and temperate applause from a handful of Republicans.

Democrats see tangible political advantages in their diversity.

“Part of our happiness is that we know the wind’s behind us,” said Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (Ariz.), explaining enthusiasm from Democrats on Thursday. “Obama’s victory is owed to that demographic, and you see more of that happening here, especially in our party. And you’re going to see more of it going forward.”

Meanwhile, the spirit among Republicans — who are still smarting from a divisive vote late Tuesday for legislation that will allow taxes to rise for the wealthiest Americans — was more muted.

For Pelosi, the growing number of female lawmakers has been a source of particular pride. The gains came in a year when Democrats campaigned aggressively on women’s issues.

“We’re a little past the time where people are pioneers,” Pelosi said. “We’re not just going out there and saying we want women to vote for us. We’re saying we want to give women a seat at the table, and you know what? A seat at the head of the table.”

Half of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “red to blue” candidates, recruited to run in competitive districts that Republicans held, were women. Pelosi hosted women’s fundraising lunches nationwide and ultimately saw the number of Democratic women expand, even in a year when Republican numbers dropped from 24 to 20.

“She was tireless. She would do four events in a day,” said newly elected Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), an Iraq war veteran who took a position of honor next to Pelosi during a class photo of Democratic women taken on the Capitol steps on Thursday. “We were working hard. But she was working just as hard around the country for us.”

The women say their increased numbers could inject civility into a bitter and gridlocked process.

“By and large, they understand that extremism — whether it’s on women’s issues or fiscal issues — we’re not going to make progress if they’re on the far ends, the fringe,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who was reelected in November after her Republican opponent claimed that pregnancies rarely result from “legitimate rape.”

“We’ve got to find that middle where we can all be a little unhappy, but we can actually get something done,” she said.

The suit, which follows similar litigation against Texas, is the latest effort by the department to go after voting discrimination in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in June striking down part of the Voting Rights Act.

Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. called the North Carolina law “an intentional attempt to break a system that was working,” and he said that it was clearly intended to discriminate on the basis of race.

But North Carolina and Texas represent only one front in the continuing battle to protect voting rights. Twenty years after Congress passed the “motor voter” law to make it easier for Americans to register to vote, numerous states keep trying to make it harder, relying on vague and dubious claims of voter fraud to push through misguided and harmful legislation.

The 1993 law, formally known as the National Voter Registration Act, established a uniform federal form that requires only that voters attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens. The form, which states must “accept and use” when people apply for a driver’s license, has helped millions of Americans register to vote."

But after the difficulty he had this weekend getting a proper ID card, Wright, 90, expressed concern that such problems could deter others from voting and stifle turnout. After spending much of his life fighting to make it easier to vote, the Democratic Party icon said he is troubled by what he’s seeing happen under the state’s new voter ID law. “I earnestly hope these unduly stringent requirements on voters won’t dramatically reduce the number of people who vote,” Wright told the Star-Telegram. “I think they will reduce the number to some extent.” Wright and his assistant, Norma Ritchson, went to the DPS office on Woodway Drive to get a State of Texas Election Identification Certificate. Wright said he realized earlier in the week that the photo identifications he had — a Texas driver’s license that expired in 2010 and a TCU faculty ID — do not satisfy requirements of the voter ID law, enacted in 2011 by the Legislature. DPS officials concurred.

We want to make sure that every eligible Texan who wants to cast a ballot can,” Pierce said. “We want to help any Texan who needs additional information."" Wright, who said he has voted in every election since 1944, lamented that such help is called for. “From my youth I have tried to expand the elections,” Wright said. “I pushed to abolish the poll tax. I was the first to come out for lowering the voting age to 18.”

Not everyone will have the resources, or knowledge, that Wright has to overcome these obstacles. And Wright puts it very well:The state put up these obstacles in the first place- now they are 'concerned' to make sure everyone can overcome them. They have 'solved' non-existent voter fraud problems by creating actual problems.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to the city to open the party's African-American Engagement Office. But if anything, the launch event put into stark relief just how much work the GOP has to do, when a largely white audience turned out to hear the senator speak.

Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus has said that attracting more minorities to the GOP is crucial for the party's future. He visited Michigan last month, hired radio personality Wayne Bradley to head the African-American Engagement effort in the state and launched the Michigan Black Advisory Council.

In the 2012 election, President Barack Obama earned the support of 90 percent of the black voters who turned out at the polls.

Paul initially spoke at the new African-American Engagement Office on Livernois Avenue in Detroit for about four minutes on Friday. According to the progressive site Eclectablog, ""The seats in the tiny space were filled with well-dressed supporters, most of whom were African-American.""

“Today’s opening of this office is the beginning of a new Republican Party,” Paul said. “This is going to be a Republican Party that is in big cities and small cities, in the countryside, in the city. It’s going to be about bringing a message that is popular no matter where you’re from, whether you're rich or poor, whether you’re black, white or brown.”

Paul then went to a larger grassroots event at the Grace Bible Chapel, where there were protesters from the civil rights group National Action Network outside. The online invitation said the event was intended to ""celebrate the opening of our African-American Engagement Office in Detroit.""

Tracking footage from the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, however, shows an overwhelmingly white audience ended up turning out:

Detroit is approximately 83 percent African-American.

Paul also spoke Friday at the Detroit Economic Club, where he proposed a plan to revitalize U.S. cities through the creation of ""economic freedom zones,"" which would cut federal taxes in communities that have an unemployment rate of 12 percent or higher.

The Michigan Democratic Party rejected Paul's advice for Detroit.

""Sen. Paul was a vocal opponent of the auto rescue, which saved over a million jobs, and led the Republican effort to shut down the government, costing Michigan's economy hundreds of millions,"" said party spokesman Joshua Pugh. ""His special interest tax handout plan is nothing new. Here in Michigan, Rick Snyder gave $1.8 billion to wealthy special interests, and paid for it with billions in devastating cuts to our local communities and public schools. It's time for our elected leaders to stop the tax giveaways, invest in communities and improve education.""

Paul has been trying to do more minority outreach in recent months. In April, Paul spoke at the historically black Howard University, becoming the first Republican elected official to speak on campus in years.

Still, he continues to generate skepticism, in part due to his criticism of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 2010, he said, ""I think it’s a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant, but, at the same time, I do believe in private ownership.""

On Sunday, Paul said he opposed extending long-term unemployment benefits, because doing so would be a ""disservice"" to workers. African-Americans have consistently had a significantly higher unemployment rate than whites.

Neither Paul nor the Michigan GOP returned a request for comment.

But behind closed doors in a room off the Senate floor, some of the newer Democratic senators couldn’t help themselves, gathering for a quick party to congratulate one another. They were the ones largely responsible for pushing the veteran Nevada lawmaker to pull the trigger on ending filibusters against most presidential nominations.

The partisan revelers were part of a new breed of Democrats emerging in the Senate. Mostly elected after 2006, these relative newcomers have only known a Democratic-controlled Senate and have little experience with successful bipartisan cooperation, due largely to the tea party’s grip on the Republican Party.

Now they are hoping to become a new power center in the party, nudging the old guard to adopt more aggressive tactics in pursuit of legislative goals and largely brushing aside Republican threats of retaliation and obstruction. They see the rules and traditions of the Senate as having stifled the will of the majority and stalled President Obama’s agenda.

“The Senate is a graveyard for good ideas,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), who along with Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon led the filibuster reform effort and won over veteran colleagues in a body where seniority was once the most valuable currency.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

This newer class of Democrats came to Washington, not unlike the tea party Republicans, with a strong commitment to their ideals and policy goals. But while the tea party rule in the House has been characterized by attempts to stifle the president’s agenda, Democrats see their goal as helping to implement it.

Thursday’s action to limit the use of filibusters — seen as so drastic it was termed the “nuclear option” — shows they are willing to carve out a different path to get there.

“There’s a time to reach across the aisle and there’s a time to hold the line,” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), the body’s youngest member at 40, who was elected in 2012. “And I think so far this year Democrats in the Senate have done a very good job of mixing across-the-aisle compromise with some heretofore unseen spine-stiffening.”

The time has come for Democrats to take a harder stance against the tea party Republicans, he said.

“These folks have come to Washington to destroy government from within and will use any tool at their disposal,” Murphy said. “To the extent that we have the ability to take tools away from the tea party, we should do it. And one of the tools was the filibuster. Another was the belief that Democrats would cave in the face of another shutdown or debt default.”

For Murphy, the failure of the Senate gun control bill earlier this year was the final straw. He took on the issue of gun violence after the Newtown school shooting in his state in 2012. A bipartisan bill crafted by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) had 55 votes but failed to advance.

“I was a proponent of filibuster reform coming into the Senate, but I became a revolutionary on this issue when we lost the gun bill,” Murphy said.

The group also includes Elizabeth Warren, elected last fall in Massachusetts. Her firebrand style and unabashed liberalism have energized the party’s left wing.

The senators’ influence has already been seen in other fights, most recently in the 16-day shutdown, when new Democrats lobbied party leaders to stand up to Republicans — a tactic that seemed to shock many on the other side of the aisle, who were betting that Democrats would blink first.

Next on their agenda is extending the filibuster rule change from presidential appointments to legislation, which would enable the Senate to move on issues including gun control and climate change.

At times, their advocacy has presented challenges to the administration. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), elected in 2006, circulated a letter among his colleagues urging the president to appoint Janet Yellen — not Lawrence H. Summers — as Federal Reserve chair because Summers’ banking policies were viewed as having contributed to the financial meltdown. About a third of the party, including Merkley and Warren, signed it. Yellen is now on track to take the post after advancing this week from the Senate Banking Committee, with Brown and Warren’s support.

And Senate confirmation is virtually assured, thanks to the new rule change against filibusters.

“The Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party definitely are showing that they have growing influence in the caucus, and in government in general,” said Matt Wall of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group that works to promote progressive candidates and issues in Democratic primaries. On Friday, Warren circulated a fundraising letter to supporters on behalf of Merkley and Udall, thanking them for their role in changing the rule. Both men face reelection in 2014.

The changing Democratic tactics may reflect a generational shift occurring in the Senate. It’s almost certain that by the start of the next Congress in 2015, more than half of the Democratic caucus will have been elected since 2008, when gridlock reached new heights. But nine of the new Senate Democrats are former Congress members, all of whom served at least part of their time under Republican majorities. Three were governors who served with Republican legislatures.

The shift among Democrats has at times confounded Republicans, particularly on the filibuster issue. Aides to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the third-longest-serving Republican, said they had felt that Reid’s most recent moves telegraphing the nuclear option were a bluff.

Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday railed against the actions of “uninitiated newcomers in the Democratic caucus,” reminding them they had never served in the minority in the Senate. Those who have a longer memory “should know better,” he added.

Six-term Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan was the only Democrat to speak out against his party’s move, citing the late institutionalist Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and Robert C. Byrd in arguing against tinkering with long-standing rules.

“Before we discard the uniqueness of this great institution, let us use the current rules and precedents of the Senate to end the abuse of the filibuster,” said Levin, who will retire after next year.

But those pushing for the rule change won over one Democratic stalwart.

“There are many of us that really wanted to keep things the way they were, because that’s the way they were,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). “One thing I know: that you learn from history. And right now we can’t let the present be the future. So you’ve got to make the change, or this becomes a body that doesn’t mutate.”

Reid’s thinking has also evolved. When Merkley, as a prospective candidate, first met with Reid ahead of the 2008 election, he told the leader that filibuster reform was one of his top priorities. Reid put his head in his hands, a Merkley aide recalled. “It’s not about the filibuster,” Reid admonished the younger man. “It’s about the culture. We’ve got to change the culture.”

Six years later, the culture is the same and the filibuster is gone.

""I'm trying to understand how come there's no black people here. I'm trying to figure out why the outreach of the GOP and especially CPAC is not working with black citizens and I have yet to find an answer, only I get, all I've gotten is abrasive attitudes and people yelling because I guess I ask the tough question, just ask the simple question, where's the inclusion? Where are the black people? I don't know why that is so offensive?""



I disagree with the gentleman who was asked to leave, no 'outreach' is every going to work with this broken farce of a GOP. The GOP can not astroturf minorities on stage and think that will win them minority voters in the ballot box because they are still selling them same product Mitt Romney couldn't sell with all the money in the world behind him, and even if they did, wouldn't GOP efforts to make voting harder for those same minorities negate that? There is a reason the GOP or CPAC or any of the other wingnut outfits can't win over anyone other than screaming white guys who cheered George W Bush on and suddenly got pissed off when President Obama was first inaugurated. The incestuous amplification of white Republicans telling white Republicans that race no longer matters only works on white Republicans, the root of the problem is that the entire GOP as a structure is rooted around demonizing everyone who isn't white or privileged, and that by nature excludes everyone else. I mean, it's hard to put 'Mr. Obama is a Kenyan Trump' on stage and then wonder why you can't win black people.

I guess you don't have to be a poor demented honky to vote Republican, but it helps.

The floor is now yours . . .

Surprise, the white guy screaming in this video is a Brietbart hack, check out the diary posted by bluebarnstormer http://www.dailykos.com/...

Another note, Republicans have convinced themselves that there is no racism for the same reasons they claim there is no such thing as Global warming, or that the problem is that we don't have enough guns on the street, Republicans pretend these problems don't exist and take offense if you claim they do because Conservatives and their wealthy financial backers are the chief beneficiaries of racism and pollution and the flooding of America with high power war rifles. Saying racism doesn't exist then allows you to turn a blind eye to it, because of course it doesn't exist, so what's the problem. That is why Republicans tell themselves that black people would only vote GOP if they really knew what the GOP was about. As if that isn't insulting.

If they admit the problem exists they have to offer a solution, so they don't. Instead they insist that the problem of racism, pollution and other things don't exist at all, unlike socialism.

And there you have it. Republicans can't admit racism exists because they are the sole beneficiaries of it, keeping poor white people voting for rich white people is only possible if the strawman of the Sherriff is black.

And the media will never state that because they are owned by the corporations who stand to gain the most if Republican racism remains the Elephant in the Room, pardon the pun.

Magical thinking doesn't fix these problems. And magical thinking is all the GOP has left, that and fear.

The Tennessean

Vote on Amendment 1 is Nov. 4%2C 2014

In 2000%2C the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled women have a fundamental right to abortion in the state

Duggar family%2C of %2219 Kids and Counting%22 fame%2C lend their support to Amendment 1

NASHVILLE -- The next general election may be exactly one year away, but the upcoming battle over the future of abortion in Tennessee is getting started Monday.

Reality television show stars Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, along with their 19 children and three grandchildren, will visit a Madison, Tenn., church Monday night to encourage an expected audience of 3,000 to vote in favor of Amendment 1 on Nov. 4, 2014. The proposed constitutional amendment would give lawmakers more authority to regulate and restrict abortions.

At a separate event Monday night, Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, a Republican from Blountville, will launch the ""Yes on 1"" campaign with a reception and dinner. The campaign has just hired an experienced political fundraiser and a veteran campaign manager and expects to raise more than $250,000 at the kickoff event.

""Now that our time has come, we're not going to take anything for granted,"" said Brian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life, which worked for more than a decade to get the measure on the 2014 ballot. ""We're going to do the utmost to see that this amendment is passed.""

The preparation over Amendment 1 in Tennessee comes as a recent Texas abortion ruling could lead to a national fight in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. Texas' new law -- which went into effect Friday -- is one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws.

It will be up to Tennessee voters to decide whether the state's constitution will, for the first time, specifically address abortion. The referendum would add this language: ""Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion.""

The wording could pave the way for lawmakers to enact abortion restrictions that have been previously ruled out of bounds under the constitution's strong privacy protections.

""I think it's going to be a fight, that's for sure,"" said Jeff Teague, the president of Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee, one of the chief organizers of the yet-to-be-launched campaign against the measure. ""The fact that the other side is already kicking off their effort so early is a (recognition) on their part (that) it's going to be a fight.""

The effort to defeat the measure, however, has not been dormant. Planned Parenthood affiliates in Tennessee and the American Civil Liberties Union have conducted polling and focus groups, secured commitments for donations and begun working with local and national groups to get organized and develop a plan.

The two groups were behind the original lawsuit challenging abortion regulations in Tennessee in the 1990s. At the time, Tennessee had some of the strictest abortion rules in the country. They included a requirement that doctors use materials created by the state to counsel women seeking abortions, a mandatory two-day waiting period after the counseling and a requirement that second-trimester abortions be performed in hospitals rather than outpatient clinics.

In 2000, the Tennessee Supreme Court struck down those regulations and ruled that women have a fundamental right to abortion in Tennessee.

""A woman's right to terminate her pregnancy is a vital part of the right to privacy guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution,"" the opinion said.

Trenches set up

Proponents view the upcoming year as critical to defending those hard-won abortion rights.

""The clear goal of this ballot initiative is to make abortion difficult to access or unavailable in Tennessee,"" said Hedy Weinberg, executive director of ACLU Tennessee. ""We're confident when the public understands what this ballot initiative is about, they will vote no. Tennesseans want their privacy and understand that this ballot initiative takes away that privacy.""

Since the state Supreme Court decision, those who oppose abortion have been working to get the proposed amendment before voters. To get a referendum on the state ballot, the groups first had to wait until the Legislature had enough supportive lawmakers in office.Then, according to state rules, the measure had to be approved twice in separate years, which eventually happened in 2009 and 2011.

Jim Bob Duggar and his family — stars of the reality TLC network program 19 Kids and Counting — will perform a concert, sign books and speak about their support of Amendment 1 when they visit Cornerstone Church in Madison. Joining them will be Alveda King, niece of the late Martin Luther King Jr., an outspoken opponent of abortion.

""I really believe a lot of Christians have sat on the sidelines and not gotten involved in politics in the past and not bothered to vote,"" said Duggar, a former Arkansas state representative. ""There is a whole sleeping giant of Christians out there. A lot of people in Tennessee don't realize that because of the Supreme Court decision back in 2000, they wiped out almost every regulation and state law that regulated abortions.""

Tennessee's power debated

That message — that Tennessee lawmakers lack the ability to regulate abortion — is disputed by abortion rights advocates, who point to a series of existing state abortion restrictions.

Among them: Tennessee requires minors to obtain the consent of one parent before having an abortion and requires abortion clinic waiting rooms to post signs ""in 40 pt. Arial font"" informing patients that it is illegal for anyone to coerce a woman into an abortion. Last year, lawmakers passed the ""Life Defense Act of 2012,"" which requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital — a law that one Knoxville, Tenn., abortion clinic cited as forcing its closure. In addition, Tennessee halted funding for Planned Parenthood last year, redirecting it to other clinics.

""It's just false to say our legislature cannot pass laws,"" Weinberg said. ""It's misleading and not true. Proponents of the amendment have attempted to hide the true nature of this initiative by couching it in language, saying there are no state laws regulating abortion when the reality is the Tennessee Legislature is able to pass legislation as they have for some years, and right now there are numerous laws on the books regulating abortion in Tennessee.""

An open invitation?

While abortion restrictions do exist, the Tennessee constitution bars other laws that neighboring states have enacted, including waiting periods, bans on later trimester abortions and required ultrasounds.

Those added restrictions have led more women from other states to come to Tennessee to have abortions, a Tennessean special report in May 2012 found. More than 1 in 4 abortions in Tennessee were sought by women from out of state, according to an analysis of abortion data.

Opponents of abortion say that voters don't want Tennessee to be known for its lack of abortion regulations. The Yes on 1 campaign website posts a large illustration of a highway welcome sign with the words ""The Volunteer State welcomes you"" inside the state map. Underneath, it says ""an abortion destination?""

Text of Amendment 1

""Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion. The people retain the right through their elected state representatives and state senators to enact, amend, or repeal statutes regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother."""

The judge’s findings come a month after the U.S. Justice Department accused Palmdale, Lancaster and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department of a systematic effort to discriminate against minorities who received low-income subsidized housing. Federal officials said deputies conducted widespread unlawful searches of homes, performed improper detentions and used unreasonable force that specifically targeted blacks and Latinos.

The Palmdale voting rights case has been watched closely by minority activists in the Antelope Valley. V. Jesse Smith, president of the Antelope Valley Chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, lauded the judge’s decision.

“A lot of us [minorities] have been locked out of the process,” said Smith, who unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Palmdale City Council in 2009. “There’s a great deal of the old boys’ club there.”

In an opinion released this week, L.A. County Superior Court Judge Mark V. Mooney concluded that Palmdale’s at-large voting system violated state law because the city has “racially polarized voting” and minorities have less influence over the outcomes of elections.

Palmdale is 54.4% Latino and nearly 15% black, yet it has elected only one Latino City Council member and never a black council member in its history, said plaintiff Juan Jauregui’s attorney, R. Rex Parris.

Parris and others argue that minorities would have a better shot at being elected if Palmdale were divided into council districts.

Parris is also the mayor of neighboring Lancaster, which also holds at-large, or citywide, elections. But voters in Lancaster have elected multiple black and Latino council members.

Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said the city plans to appeal the decision. He called the lawsuit a “money grab” by outsiders and trial lawyers trying to meddle in the community. The California Voting Rights Act, he said, is “poorly written” and unfairly holds cities responsible for the choices of their voters and the quality of their candidates.

“This is not a voter rights lawsuit. This is not about black or white, it’s about green,” Ledford said.

About 15 to 20 cities, school districts and other government entities have been sued under the California Voting Rights Act since the law was enacted in 2002, according to Robert Rubin, an attorney who helped write the act and is representing the American Civil Liberties Union in an ongoing lawsuit over Anaheim’s election system. The act forbids the use of at-large elections to dilute the power of minority voters.

The Palmdale case is the first that has been decided at trial. All the previous cases have settled, some after protracted — and expensive — battles.

The city of Modesto appealed the constitutionality of California’s voting rights law to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case. In the end, the city settled a voting rights case against it for $3 million and switched to by-district elections.

The city of Compton fought a voting rights case filed in 2010 by a group of Latino residents for more than a year before agreeing to a settlement under which the city put a measure on the ballot asking voters whether they wanted to switch to by-district elections. Voters approved the measure, and the city’s first Latino councilman was elected last month.

Rubin, who also represented the plaintiffs in the Modesto case, said Palmdale’s loss at trial may send a signal to other agencies to voluntarily adopt by-district elections or risk facing expensive lawsuits.

Often, said Rod Pacheco, a former Riverside County district attorney who now specializes in voting rights cases, elected officials appeared to be trying to drag out the case despite knowing that they probably would lose and that taxpayers would be stuck with the bill.

“The City Council of Palmdale, which made the decision to fight this and expend those funds, didn’t spend their own money,” Pacheco said. Officials often seem primarily concerned about hanging on to their jobs, he said: “The tack that many of these cities take is to get to the next election.”

Ledford said he has endorsed multiple black and Latino candidates for Palmdale’s City Council over the years and “can’t explain” why the council does not reflect the diversity of the population.

“We go for the best and the brightest,” Ledford said. “I can’t speak for the message of the candidates or their ability to raise the funds to run.”

He also said Parris seems to have a personal vendetta against Palmdale — an accusation Parris denies.

Henry Hearns became the first black elected official in the Antelope Valley when he won a seat on Lancaster’s City Council in 1990, and he recalls receiving death threats during the campaign. He said the city of Palmdale should do everything it can to give blacks and Latinos a fair opportunity to be elected.

“I would hope that that the citizenry in Palmdale would not just elect anyone based on race or culture,” Hearns said. “I would hope that they would vote for the most qualified candidate.”

Just do it, Harry.

“I’m going to make sure he’s going to have a vote next week, and then we’ll see what happens after that,” Reid told a small group of reporters in his Capitol Hill suite Wednesday morning. [...] “I’m not going to do anything now, precipitously,” he said. “But I’m looking at this very closely…. We’re going to fill that job. Cordray is there now. He’s going to get a vote.” Reid wasn’t able to explain why he believes (or claims to believe) Cordray will ultimately be confirmed. But he alluded to the possibility that he may pursue a rules change mid-session. “Whether it’s Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton that’s the next president, I don’t think they should have to go through what we’ve gone through here,” Reid said. “People better watch.”

Does Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid mean it this time? Is he really setting the stage for doing filibuster reform mid-session? We've heard the threats plenty of times before, but he seems to be pushing a tiny bit more this time, by scheduling a vote on Richard Cordray's nomination to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for next week. This could be interpreted as his effort to make the case for going nuclear to his caucus.The Cordray nomination is a good one to use if Reid wants to make a point. It's the most high-profile and public and egregious of Republican filibusters. The vast majority of the GOP caucus, 43 senators, signed a letter to President Obama declaring that they would oppose any nominee he might put forward for the job because they don't think the agency should exist. With this filibuster, they are in essence nullifying a chunk of Dodd-Frank that they disagree with, that is nonetheless the law of the land.

That's a big deal, a very big deal. It should be enough to make 51 Democrats in the Senate say ""enough,"" and convince them to finally act.

Please send an email to your Democratic senator(s) telling them to re-open filibuster reform so that we can have a functioning Senate and government."

Republicans will face strong support%2C and opposition%2C to immigration bill when they return home

Supporters will use marches%2C rallies and political donations to persuade GOP to embrace citizenship

Critics feel they only have to maintain GOP opposition to %22amnesty%22 for undocumented immigrants

WASHINGTON — As they prepare to leave the Capitol for a month-long August recess, Republican members of the House of Representatives are taking with them legislative summaries and informational packets to tackle tough questions in their districts about immigration.

Supporters of a proposal to revamp the nation's immigration laws plan to use the recess to pressure House Republican members in their districts to pass a plan like that which passed the Senate in June.

Those in favor of granting citizenship to an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants say they will use rallies, marches, coordinated phone calls, social media campaigns and pressure from big-dollar donors.

""This is the beginning of a long, hot summer for the House of Representatives,"" said Eliseo Medina of the Service Employees International Union, a labor union that supports the Senate's immigration bill.

Republicans will also face pressure from Tea Party groups and other opponents of the Senate immigration bill.

Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, says his group, which advocates lower levels of legal and illegal immigration, hosted a teleconference with Reps. Steve King, R-Iowa, Steve Stockman, R-Texas, and Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., on Wednesday night to rally opponents to mobilize for the August recess.

Beck said there were 40,000 people on the call.

""Obviously, they've got all of this money and all of these organizations and everything else, but we've got over 2 million members. We're in every district,"" Beck said. ""And they've got a tough road to hoe. They've got to change representatives' minds. We're more in a situation of needing to hold people. It's always better to try to hold people to a position.""

GOP leaders said Republicans are looking forward to facing voters on the issue.

""Our members will be well-prepared to talk with constituents about this important issue,"" said Nate Hodson, a spokesman for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.

House committees have passed five immigration-related bills that focus on enhancing border security, providing visas for high-tech and agricultural workers and enhancing the ability of state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws.

The Senate bill allows the nation's unauthorized immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship, adds $46 billion to secure the border and revamps nearly every other portion of the nation's immigration laws.

Supporters of an overhaul of immigration laws say House Republicans are focusing too much on border security and not on a pathway to citizenship for the nation's undocumented immigrants, which is a focus of the Senate plan.

On Monday, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to give a pro-immigration speech at the premier of the film Documented, which was directed by Jose Antonio Vargas, an immigration activist. A group of religious leaders will take a bus tour through Republican districts in the Midwest.

Clarissa Martinez of the National Council of La Raza, which supports legalization of all unauthorized immigrants, said a coalition of groups will host 360 different events in 52 congressional districts around the country during the recess.

Meanwhile, some Republican donors and business groups will try to influence GOP members as well.

Republicans for Immigration Reform, a group formed by former GOP Commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez, sent a letter with other GOP donors this week to members of the House urging passage of a bill. Charlie Spies, a former fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said that was an attempt to add to the ""grass-roots"" approach by swaying members with their ""grasstops"" approach.

""We're going to focus on engagement with constituents and business leaders who have actual relationships with members,"" Spies said. ""You won't see us busing people in to town halls.""

Republicans such as King say the border must be secured first before people in the USA illegally are offered citizenship. And some Tea Party affiliates plan to make sure representatives hear from the opponents to what they say is an ""amnesty"" for people who broke the law to be here.

""It's not a battle that we picked,"" said Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, referring to her group's typical focus on government spending.

""It isn't an issue that was even on the front burner for us. But because of what the Senate has done and the House is now doing, it's something that we have to pay attention to.""

Martin said her group is working closely with NumbersUSA and others to hold rallies, attend town-hall-style forums and ensure that Republican members of Congress know the opposition they'll face if they support any kind of immigration reform they don't approve of.

""We've said all along that we're going to hold people accountable,"" Martin said. ""We're holding them accountable."""

FINAL JUDGMENT

This Court previously ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED:

that Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief was granted to the extent that Senate plan S100, the benchmark plan, violates the one-person, one-vote requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and will not be used for any further elections;

that Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief was granted such that Senate plan S148, the 2011 enacted plan, has been permanently enjoined from implementation and no elections have been or will be held thereunder; and

that Plan S172, which was reviewed under the standard set forth in Perry v. Perez and restored district 10 to near benchmark configuration and remedied the constitutional infirmities being asserted by Plaintiffs, was to be used for the 2012 election.

It is further ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED:

that because (1) Plan S148 has been repealed, (2) Plaintiffs agree that Plan S172 does not violate the Voting Rights Act or the Constitution, and (3) Plaintiffs do not seek any further relief with regard to Plan S148, Plaintiffs’ remaining claims under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution are DISMISSED AS MOOT; and

that, as prevailing parties, Plaintiffs are awarded their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said on NBC News's ""Meet The Press"" that she is ""concerned"" about the matter and that lawmakers ""have to take a good look at it.""

The soon-to-be-released inspector general's report is sure to raise questions about the timing of the IRS's Friday apology. The report was prepared for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which requested an audit in 2011, as some conservative groups were voicing concerns.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the chairman of the Oversight Committee, said that the IRS's apology doesn't appear to be forthright.

""One of the most offensive parts is my committee ... instigated this investigation, got the IG to do the investigation. Before the IG's report comes to the public or to Congress as required by law, it's leaked by the IRS to try to spin the output. This mea culpa's not an honest one,"" Issa said on ""Meet The Press.""

Issa said lawmakers need to review the report to ensure the IRS's targeting of certain groups doesn't happen again.

""This is something you have to institute changes to make sure it doesn't happen again. There has to be accountability for the people who did it. And quite frankly, up until a few days ago, there's got to be accountability for people who are telling lies about it being done,"" he said.

(CNN) —

Throughout Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio’s campaign for New York’s top political act, his backup band seemed to overshadow the headliner.

His son Dante, a sophomore at a public high school in Brooklyn, appeared prominently in campaign ads, his soaring Afro a topic of conversation in political circles. Daughter Chiara, a college freshman, out-danced the rest of the telegenic family at the West Indian Day Parade with a move they called “The Smackdown.”

Watch the de Blasios dance “The Smackdown”

A virtual unknown nationally despite 25 years in New York politics, de Blasio defied critics who questioned whether his experience as a city councilman from Brooklyn and, most recently, as public advocate – a sort of civic watchdog – sufficiently prepared him to run the Big Apple. He also ran Hillary Clinton’s first U.S. Senate campaign.

But his biracial family’s increasing visibility resonated with residents of a city coping with a 21% poverty rate and increasing racial divisiveness brought on by the controversial “stop-and-frisk” policy allowing police to search people in high-crime areas.

“His family, just because of the racial mix, represents a big and increasingly large part of the city and speaks to certain sensibilities,” said Harold Ickes, a veteran Democratic Party operative who advised the campaign and has known de Blasio for two decades. “The family is very important to Bill… From the outside, this family represents a part of the city not represented in city government.”

The de Blasio clan was featured prominently in commercials and campaign events. Dante, then 15, appeared in his own ad over the summer that highlighted his father’s stance against “stop-and-frisk.” Dante and his hair immediately became a social media sensation – and de Blasio began to surge in the polls.

In addition, Chirlane McCray, a political activist who once identified herself as lesbian before marrying de Blasio, emerged as a top campaign strategist.

5 things to know about New York’s new mayor

DeBlasio, 52, portrayed himself as the “unapologetically progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era,” saying that the current mayor’s polices favor the rich. He repeatedly used the Dickensian phrase “a tale of two cities” to describe New York City under billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The wealth inequality message appeared to have struck home with minority and low-income voters on Tuesday, giving de Blasio an advantage over Republican candidate Joe Lhota among black and Latino voters compared to white voters.

“The city is much more racially mixed than when Bloomberg took office,” Ickes said. “A lot of people having a hard time economically are black, Hispanic and Asian and Bill spoke elegantly to that.”

De Blasio’s critics accused him of dividing the city along economic and racial lines, and credited “stop-and-frisk” with a sharp crime reduction during Bloomberg’s tenure.

Appearing on CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper on Wednesday, Bloomberg said he had a meeting with de Blasio and vowed to help with the transition.

“Keep in mind, I have a big vested interest in making Bill de Blasio an even better mayor than I was,” Bloomberg said. “We built a lot. We’ve given them a lot to work with… But the bottom line is, I’m going to live in New York City and I want Bill de Blasio’s administration to be successful and our administration to do everything to transfer everything we’ve been doing over.”

De Blasio, who has a bachelor’s degree from New York University and a master’s in international and public affairs from Columbia University, met McCray while working in the administration of David Dinkins, the city’s first black mayor.

When de Blasio delivered his acceptance speech late on Election Day, he was surrounded, like most of the campaign, by his family.

The strapping politician, the first Democratic mayor in the largely-Democratic city in two decades, hugged son and daughter and planted a firm kiss on the lips of his wife before going on to thank the many people behind his triumph.

“The people I’m most grateful to and most grateful for are standing next to me,” he said amid cheers and applause. “My partner in life, my best friend in the world: she is brilliant and every bit as compassionate as she is tough, the love of my life Chirlane McCray.”

He added, “Of everything I have to feel fortunate about, I am most lucky, most blessed to be the father of two extraordinary children: Chiara and Dante. They make me proud every single day. And, my fellow New Yorkers, they are very stylish.”

De Blasio greeted his supporters in both Spanish and Italian. McCray introduced him: “From our family to your family, I give you the next mayor of New York City.”"

Peters'],Voter Waiting Time Disparities Draw Democrats’ Scrutiny,"WASHINGTON — With studies suggesting that long lines at the polls cost Democrats hundreds of thousands of votes in November, party leaders are beginning a push to make voting and voter registration easier, setting up a likely new conflict with Republicans over a deeply polarizing issue.

White House officials have told Congressional leaders that the president plans to press for action on Capitol Hill, and Democrats say they expect him to highlight the issue in his State of the Union address next week. Democrats in the House and Senate have already introduced bills that would require states to provide online voter registration and allow at least 15 days of early voting, among other things.

Fourteen states are also considering whether to expand early voting, including the battlegrounds of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, according to FairVote, a nonprofit group that advocates electoral change. Florida, New York, Texas and Washington are looking at whether to ease registration and establish preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds.

Several recent polls and studies suggest that long waiting times in some places depressed turnout in 2012 and that lines were longest in cities, where Democrats outnumber Republicans. In a New York Times/CBS News poll taken shortly after Election Day, 18 percent of Democrats said they waited at least a half-hour to vote, compared with 11 percent of independents and 9 percent of Republicans."

A lawsuit filed by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) and Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett (R) asks that the United States Election Assistance Commission include state-specific requirements for proof of citizenship on all federal voter registration forms in the two states, the Kansas City Star reported.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Arizona's law allowing proof of citizenship requirements on state forms unconstitutional since federal forms did not require it. But the court also said that states with proof of citizenship requirements could ask the federal government to note those requirements on federal registration forms distributed in their states.

The recent lawsuit comes days after the American Civil Liberties Union told Kobach that it intended to sue him over the state requirement, citing 15,000 voter registrations being held up due to lack of proof. But Kobach said his suit could preempt the ACLU suit since it addresses the ACLU's concerns, the Topeka Capitol-Journal reports.

Doug Bonney, the legal director for the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri, told The Huffington Post that Kobach and Bennett's lawsuit was expected. At the same time, Bonney said he disagrees with Kobach's analysis that this will end his group's lawsuit to overturn the Kansas law.

Bonney said that citizens are not able to register to vote because they cannot display proof of citizenship or because of bureaucratic issues. He said laws requiring people to attest to being citizens when registering to vote have worked well to prevent fraud.

""There is no proof of people fraudulently registering to vote,"" Bonney said. ""For scores of years, the attestation requirement has been perfectly find. This law makes it difficult for those who are citizens to vote because they cannot get properly registered.""

Kobach, a tea party favorite who has written controversial immigration laws in Arizona and Alabama, said that the citizenship proof is needed. ""Every time an alien votes, it effectively cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen,"" Kobach said at the press conference on Wednesday.

Opponents of the citizenship requirement told The Huffington Post that the suit is ""fear mongering"" and unnecessary. Former Kansas state Rep. Ann Mah (D-Topeka), Kobach's most vocal critic, said that she is not surprised by the suit. At the same time she stressed that every voter fraud investigation in Kansas has turned up minimal cases in the last decade. She said the real problem is the 15,000 voter registrations being held up.

""There is no evidence out there at all,"" Mah told HuffPost. ""Why do we have 15,000 Americans who can't vote because of the hoops they have to jump through?""

She said that since most voters register at state motor vehicle offices, which are not equipped to process birth certificates to meet the state law, voters would need to also visit an election office to complete the process.

Arizona state House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told HuffPost that he believes this is a way for Bennett to draw tea party votes for his 2014 Republican gubernatorial primary. Campbell, who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, agreed with Mah that there is no voter fraud in the state.

""We've gone down this road time and time again, we hear about all this supposed fraud from the tea party all the time,"" he said. ""Every analysis shows there is no voter fraud taking place. It is political grandstanding and fear mongering from the tea party movement."""

In it's letter of Secession, which was sent immediately after the Election of President Abraham Lincoln, even before he took Office, Texas stated the following:



We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. That in this free government all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states

It was merely theof a President from a Party that endorsed Abolition, even if that President at the time DID NOT make accomplishing that party of his platform or an agenda item of his administration - that drove the South in ato begin to dismantle the nation State by State.

And now today we see more and more Tea Partiers - while also overreacting to an election they lost - slowly endorsing the legitimacy of a new secession and further - of ABSOLUTE rights of the BUSINESS OWNER over their EMPLOYEES (as well as CLIENTS) in everything from denying them a living wage and working conditions to Dictating Whether they can have access to Preventive Services in their HealthCare, impose llfetime caps, and openly discriminate against those who had the temerity to previously GET SICK.

Apparently Modern Confederate Tea Partiers think the cruelty of that system is just ""Fine"".

Wither is Freedom then, eh?

In the last few years there have been a rising of Pro-Confederacy Groups who've written such amazing revisionist history such as this.



Southerners have less reason to be loyal to the collective enterprise that is the United States than does any group of citizens. The South was Invaded, laid waste, and conquered when it tried to uphold the original and correct meaning of the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution.

Yeah, right, the South was """" - so much for those pesky letters of Secesion and that little Ft Sumter thing. Sure.

And this happened merely because they felt they had the economic Right to continue practices such as this.



Slavery was Evil. It was pure Economic Evil. Human Cruelty for Wealth and Profit. The Confederates were trying to Protect and Continue that system of Cruelty, of The THEFT of Freedom, Free Will and Choice for their own enrichment.

But this is what they are, what they've always been. They know it in their hearts, and this is why they truly FEAR - deeply in their bones - an African American President such as Barack Obama. It is beyond their comprehension that he isn't racked with a deep desire for Vengence against Whites.

How could it not be?



It was this type of deep atavistic fear that even affected Barack Obama's own grandmother, Toot. In his book,he recounts how his grandmother while working in Texas following WWII had befriended a black janitor, Mr. Reed, who worked in the same building. They had a cordial friendship, yet another - white - secretary working in the building proceeded to angrily scold them both for their familiarity telling Toot she should never, ever ""call no'Mister'"".

Years later in Hawaii, when Barack was a boy living with his grandparents to attend High School in the U.S. while his mother worked overseas, his grandmother encountered a particularly aggressive beggar who frightened her. A black beggar. Despite knowing the character of Barack's father, and of Barack himself - she was still terrified of him because she knew and had seen in Texas the kind of cruel mis-treatment people like him had received. She had a understanding of the righteous anger that that person could potentially feel, and she feared it.

That beggar was not Mr. Reed. But another 20 years later, it very well could have been - and he would have be duly justified in his outrage. Gramps - Toot's husband - angrily scolded her for her reaction to the beggar, his feeling had always been the individuals are individuals not some collective mass of angst, not some open racial sore that refuses to be healed. For all of this, Barack had a ring-side seat. He witnessed both Yin and Yang.

Unlike Toot who was sympathetic to those who suffered from bigotry, identified with their outrage - and recognized it's legitimacy - what the Modern Tea Party-Confederate feels is something worse.

Guilt!

No, not their own personal guilt, but the collective guilt of centuries of cruelty. They constantly try to wipe it away, ignore it, deflect it, disguise it, but it continues to come right back because they in their own heart of hearts simply don't believe that any Nigger should ever, EVER be called ""Mr. President"".

It's fear driven by that guilt that also drove the Confederates, as it drives the Tea Party, and now- the Republican Party.

So of course, they have to Do Anything Necessary to prevent this cruel retribution from being inflicted on the Good White people... um, I mean the American People. They have to SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT, because that is the limited leverage they have with a majority in the House.

They have to rail that Obamacare is a Complete and Total Failure even as Hundreds of Thousands successfully send in their applications despite initial website glitches, and are finding they can get better care for far less than they were previously spending.

They have to DENY Reality, again and again and again.

Obama was never a Slave. None of his Ancestors, on his father's side, were Slaves. Most of what he knows about what it means to be historically ""Black In America"" came from his White Grandparents and their experiences during the 40's and the 50's as recounted to him. He has studied Langston Hughes and Baldwin and W.E.B. Debois to better understand the ""Black Experience"". He lived it within his own skin, in LA whlie attending Occidental College, in New York while working for a Non-Profit, in Chicago working with communities to help incrimentally improve their lives. He's seen it from just about every possible angle, and he's not racked with Anger

He's not driven to seek Devine Retribution against the Ills of the White Race.

ObamaCare is not Punishment for the Wickedness of Long Dead White People. Some of those White people, going all the way back to the Revolutionary War, are his own Ancestors.

Obama is not a Kenyan. Not a Socialist. Not a Muslim. Not a Mau Mau Anti-Colonialist. Not a Fist Pumping Black Power Enthusiast. He's not Mr. Reed, nor is he the Beggar.

He's our American President. He's doing the best he can, under his power, to improve the lives of All American Citizens. As did President Lincoln before him.

Some day the Tea Party-Confederates will learn that lesson. But apparently, not today.

Kincaid warns that a “group of radicals” in the “left-wing lobby in the U.S.” are trying to engineer the selection of Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson as Pope. Kincaid’s argument boils down to the fact that Turkson introduced a document on global financial policy which was endorsed by Stephen Schneck of Catholic University (along with Pope Benedict XVI) and attended one of Schneck’s conferences in 2011. Since Schneck supported Obama’s reelection and is tied to the group Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, naturally Kincaid has arrived at the conclusion that Soros is plotting to pick the next pope in order to “use the Vatican in a global campaign against capitalism.”

The entire conservative movement is nuts. Every damn one of them. When even the heads of their big, supposedly serious outlets spend their days doing little else but dreaming up new paranoid conspiracy theories (looking at you, Wayne LaPierre), there's just no conclusion other than the obvious one: Conservatism is just another name for batshit crazy Yep. The article is called “ Black Socialist Pope to Follow Black Socialist President? ”, which is the kind of headline someone like me would write in order to make them look crazy, but now they've decided not to outsource that part anymore. Now, I'm not exactly sure why George Soros (who used to run ACORN, before Agenda 21 installed manatees in all high-ranking ACORN positions) or anyone else would think of the good cardinal from Ghana as the ""progressive"" Catholic choice, much less the fellow who will oversee a systemic worldwide ruination of capitalism (again, you usually would pick someone from Wall Street for that job, or just call in Phil Gramm), but if any of this made sense then it wouldn't be movement conservatism. It just stands to reason that a guy who attended a conference held by a guy who liked Barack Obama better than Mitt Romney must be a secret socialist who Obama is planning in installing as pope using his secret cardinal-controlling Vatican Pope Drones. You'd be crazy to not think so.

Remember: There is absolutely nothing you can say or do that will discredit you in the eyes of the conservative movement. Absolutely nothing.

What the court got inarguably correct was that times have changed since the signature act of the civil rights era was passed in 1965. In the Southern states and the other jurisdictions whose voting practices were put under authority of the federal government, black Americans are no longer blatantly barred from exercising their constitutional right to cast a ballot to choose their leaders. In fact, blacks are holding more elected offices and voting in greater numbers than ever.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the conservative majority on the court reasoned that because the situation had changed so dramatically, there was no longer a justifiable need for the U.S. Justice Department to hold veto power over the way local and state officials in the affected jurisdictions set their rules for voting. To do so would be to discriminate against those states and localities.

What the court majority failed to recognize, or simply ignored, was what the court’s minority of liberals pointed out: There is discrimination at work, but it is not the state and local officials who are the victims of that discrimination; it is still minority voters.

It is a different type of discrimination, and it may be popping up in different places. Before 1965, black voters were kept from voting in many areas of the South and elsewhere simply because of the color of their skin — racism in its purest form. What is happening today is that black voters are having their influence on elections suppressed, not strictly because they are black, but because of the way black people vote: They are overwhelmingly Democrats.

As became evident during the 2012 election campaign, Republican officials in numerous states — not just in the South, but in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania as well — tried to employ various means to discourage blacks and Latinos from voting. New identification requirements were instituted, voting hours and days were curtailed and polling places in minority communities were hard to find, fewer in number and inadequately staffed.

A signature scene of the election was the picture of long lines stretching away from polls in black communities where voters had to wait hour after hour for their chance to vote. Such shamefully long lines were not in evidence in white neighborhoods — not because fewer white people were voting, but because whites were provided more places to vote.

Prior to all of that in states such as Texas, Republican legislatures passed redistricting plans with lines drawn to limit the influence of black and Latino voters and ensure a system that favors white Republican candidates.

All of this may not be pure racism, but it is certainly politically motivated discrimination. Thanks to the court decision, the federal government has lost one big weapon to fight such discrimination. And thanks to the way certain states and localities have manipulated voting rules and district lines, we have a U.S. House controlled by Republicans who have a vested interest in making sure no new voting rights measure ever becomes law."

Fletcher', 'May', 'Michael A. Fletcher Is A Senior Writer For Espn.']","In North Carolina, unimpeded GOP drives state hard to the right","Backed by throngs of chanting supporters, dozens of liberal demonstrators are subjecting themselves to arrest each Monday at the state legislature here to protest a flurry of bills that could transform North Carolina into a model of conservative governance.

The state’s hard turn to the right comes less than five years after people took to the streets here to celebrate the 2008 victory of Barack Obama, the first Democratic presidential candidate to capture the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976. The win prompted Obama’s supporters to crow about the growing influence of progressive and minority voters not only in North Carolina but across the South.

But that euphoria is now a distant memory. Since the recession hit, North Carolina has been saddled with one of the nation’s highest unemployment rates. The bad times helped prepare the way for a carefully executed strategy, with big financial support from a major conservative activist, that helped the GOP win control of both chambers of the state General Assembly in 2010.

Those victories were capped last year when Republican Pat McCrory was elected governor, giving the party control of all levers of state government for the first time since 1870.

The victories were aided by the strong financial support of Art Pope, a multimillionaire who spent heavily in support of the state’s GOP candidates. The Institute for Southern Studies, a North Carolina-based research organization, said Pope’s advocacy network spent $2.2 million on 22 legislative races, winning 18. Overall, conservative organizations largely supported by Pope accounted for three-fourths of the outside money spent in North Carolina legislative races in 2010, according to the institute.

One of McCrory’s first acts after being elected governor was to install Pope, a former legislator, as the state budget chief. (The governor’s office declined to make Pope available for an interview.) And now, GOP lawmakers are moving swiftly to enact a long list of legislation they say is largely aimed at limiting government debt and snapping the state’s economy out of a years-long malaise.

Legislators have slashed jobless benefits. They have also repealed a tax credit that supplemented the wages of low-income people, while moving to eliminate the estate tax. They have voted against expanding Medicaid to comply with the 2010 federal health-care law. The expansion would have added 500,000 poor North Carolinians to the Medicaid rolls.

“Before considering Medicaid expansion, we must reform the current system to make sure people currently enrolled receive the services they need and more taxpayer dollars are not put at risk,” McCrory said in a written statement after signing a bill blocking the expansion.

Lawmakers are also considering proposals to reduce and flatten income tax rates while expanding the sales tax, perhaps to even include groceries and prescription drugs — which some advocates see as a first step toward eliminating the state income tax.

“North Carolina is a high-income-tax state, and we’re suffering the consequences,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R). “Our unemployment rate is the fifth worst in the country, and our high tax rates are hindering economic growth and pushing jobs to our neighbors.”

There are also measures pending to require drug testing for low-income people applying for job training and welfare benefits.

Other GOP-controlled legislatures have passed or considered similar measures in the wake of the recession. Florida, Missouri and Michigan are among the states that have slashed jobless benefits. Texas, Louisiana and Wisconsin are among at least 15 states not participating in the Medicaid expansion called for in the Affordable Care Act. And West Virginia, Kansas and Texas are among the states where legislators have proposed bills requiring drug testing for welfare recipients.

The North Carolina House has passed a law requiring voters to have a government-issued identification card, and legislators are considering bills to roll back the state’s law allowing same-day voter registration and to sharply limit early voting — measures that supporters of the current law say were integral to the high turnout of minority voters in the past several elections.

“I don’t know that there is a state that has as many regressive policies on tap,” said Penda Hair, co-director of Advancement Project, a Washington-based civil rights group that is considering a lawsuit challenging changes to the state’s voting laws.

Liberals may be up in arms, but North Carolina conservatives are applauding the new direction of the General Assembly. After the state Senate unveiled its tax reform plan this month, the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity released a poll that it said showed widespread support across the state. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the state tax code is in need of reform, and nearly half backed moving to totally eliminate the personal income tax within four years.

“The poll results show a clear desire for bold tax relief and reform that gets North Carolina back in the game for jobs and business,” said Dallas Woodhouse, state director of Americans for Prosperity in North Carolina.

The legislative effort has mobilized liberals who see North Carolina as a laboratory for conservative ideas propelled nationwide by the money of a handful of key patrons. They note that many of the initiatives being pursued by legislators here have long been championed by a network of conservative organizations supported by Pope and billionaire activists Charles and David Koch, including Americans for Prosperity and the American Legislative Exchange Council.

“Most of the laws that take us backwards do not come out of Congress but out of state legislatures,” said the Rev. William J. Barber II, head of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP. “Conservative forces here have gone all out to implement these policies and to lock in their power by changing the voting laws.”

In an effort that resurrects some of the tactics of the civil rights movement, Barber has led a growing, multiracial campaign of civil disobedience intended to draw attention to the changes being pursued by legislators.

This past week, more than 600 demonstrators, some waving placards and singing freedom songs, gathered outside the North Carolina Legislative Building for the fourth “Moral Mondays” protest.

With the crowd behind them, 57 protesters walked inside the building and stood in front of the large brass doors leading to the Senate chamber. The demonstrators — pastors, students, college professors and senior citizens among them — were arrested and led away in plastic handcuffs. They joined a group of more than 100 North Carolina residents who had been arrested and jailed in three previous protests.

“This leadership wants to make our state a place of deeper stratification and inequality,” Barber said.

In the coming weeks, Barber plans to move the protests from the doorstep of the legislature to the home districts of the lawmakers through a series of 25 town meetings.

But, as it stands, there is very little opponents can do to alter the will of the governing majority — something many of the protesters acknowledge.

(CNN) —

Throughout Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio’s campaign for New York’s top political act, his backup band seemed to overshadow the headliner.

His son Dante, a sophomore at a public high school in Brooklyn, appeared prominently in campaign ads, his soaring Afro a topic of conversation in political circles. Daughter Chiara, a college freshman, out-danced the rest of the telegenic family at the West Indian Day Parade with a move they called “The Smackdown.”

Watch the de Blasios dance “The Smackdown”

A virtual unknown nationally despite 25 years in New York politics, de Blasio defied critics who questioned whether his experience as a city councilman from Brooklyn and, most recently, as public advocate – a sort of civic watchdog – sufficiently prepared him to run the Big Apple. He also ran Hillary Clinton’s first U.S. Senate campaign.

But his biracial family’s increasing visibility resonated with residents of a city coping with a 21% poverty rate and increasing racial divisiveness brought on by the controversial “stop-and-frisk” policy allowing police to search people in high-crime areas.

“His family, just because of the racial mix, represents a big and increasingly large part of the city and speaks to certain sensibilities,” said Harold Ickes, a veteran Democratic Party operative who advised the campaign and has known de Blasio for two decades. “The family is very important to Bill… From the outside, this family represents a part of the city not represented in city government.”

The de Blasio clan was featured prominently in commercials and campaign events. Dante, then 15, appeared in his own ad over the summer that highlighted his father’s stance against “stop-and-frisk.” Dante and his hair immediately became a social media sensation – and de Blasio began to surge in the polls.

In addition, Chirlane McCray, a political activist who once identified herself as lesbian before marrying de Blasio, emerged as a top campaign strategist.

5 things to know about New York’s new mayor

DeBlasio, 52, portrayed himself as the “unapologetically progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era,” saying that the current mayor’s polices favor the rich. He repeatedly used the Dickensian phrase “a tale of two cities” to describe New York City under billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The wealth inequality message appeared to have struck home with minority and low-income voters on Tuesday, giving de Blasio an advantage over Republican candidate Joe Lhota among black and Latino voters compared to white voters.

“The city is much more racially mixed than when Bloomberg took office,” Ickes said. “A lot of people having a hard time economically are black, Hispanic and Asian and Bill spoke elegantly to that.”

De Blasio’s critics accused him of dividing the city along economic and racial lines, and credited “stop-and-frisk” with a sharp crime reduction during Bloomberg’s tenure.

Appearing on CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper on Wednesday, Bloomberg said he had a meeting with de Blasio and vowed to help with the transition.

“Keep in mind, I have a big vested interest in making Bill de Blasio an even better mayor than I was,” Bloomberg said. “We built a lot. We’ve given them a lot to work with… But the bottom line is, I’m going to live in New York City and I want Bill de Blasio’s administration to be successful and our administration to do everything to transfer everything we’ve been doing over.”

De Blasio, who has a bachelor’s degree from New York University and a master’s in international and public affairs from Columbia University, met McCray while working in the administration of David Dinkins, the city’s first black mayor.

When de Blasio delivered his acceptance speech late on Election Day, he was surrounded, like most of the campaign, by his family.

The strapping politician, the first Democratic mayor in the largely-Democratic city in two decades, hugged son and daughter and planted a firm kiss on the lips of his wife before going on to thank the many people behind his triumph.

“The people I’m most grateful to and most grateful for are standing next to me,” he said amid cheers and applause. “My partner in life, my best friend in the world: she is brilliant and every bit as compassionate as she is tough, the love of my life Chirlane McCray.”

He added, “Of everything I have to feel fortunate about, I am most lucky, most blessed to be the father of two extraordinary children: Chiara and Dante. They make me proud every single day. And, my fellow New Yorkers, they are very stylish.”

De Blasio greeted his supporters in both Spanish and Italian. McCray introduced him: “From our family to your family, I give you the next mayor of New York City.”"

In fact, we seem to be increasingly becoming two countries under one flag: Liberal Land — coastal, urban and multicultural — separated by Conservative Country — Southern and Western, rural and racially homogeneous. (Other parts of the country are a bit of a mixed bag.)

This has led to incredible and disturbing concentrations of power.

As The New York Times reported after the election in November, more than two-thirds of the states are now under single-party control, meaning that one party has control of the governor’s office and has majorities in both legislative chambers.

This is the highest level of such control since 1952. And Republicans have single-party control in nearly twice as many states as Democrats.

This is having very real consequences on the ground, nowhere more clearly than on the subjects of voting rights and women’s reproductive rights."

The depth of the Republican deficit in the Electoral College was laid out in stark detail by independent analyst Rhodes Cook in his recent newsletter. Cook charts two eras in the modern history of presidential politics, one Republican and the other Democratic. Republicans dominated the period from 1968 until 1992. Democrats have been the dominant presidential party since then.

Even though candidates prize endorsements from labor unions, their value is hard to determine. In the past, many unions have sided with losing candidates, and in mayoral campaigns especially, union members may vote in accordance with their own political instincts, rather than hewing to the recommendations of their union. But this year, with all of the Democratic candidates vowing to participate in a public financing system with relatively low spending limits, labor’s support could be crucial.

The leaders of 1199 vowed to work harder than they have for any other local candidate in many years to help Mr. de Blasio win, and said they were considering participating in a “super PAC” to spend money on the race. “We wanted to send a strong signal: De Blasio was so far ahead of everyone else it was really a race to the bottom,” Mr. Gresham said.

Mr. Finnegan added, “We plan on a massive effort.”

News of the endorsement caps a strong week for Mr. de Blasio. He reported raising the maximum amount of money allowed for the primary under the city’s voluntary public matching funds program. He also picked up the endorsements of yet another celebrity (Russell Simmons) and progressive group (New York Communities for Change)."

http://news.yahoo.com/u-judge-orders-landmark-california-cross-taken-down-012849685.html,,[],U.S. judge orders landmark California cross taken down,"By Dan Whitcomb LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A massive cross that serves as part of a war memorial on a San Diego hilltop must be dismantled because it has been found to violate a constitutional ban on government endorsement of religion, a federal judge grudgingly ruled on Thursday. The decision by U.S. District Judge Larry Burns marks the latest development in a long-running legal battle over the 43-foot-tall cross, a local landmark that has stood on top of Mount Soledad since 1954 and is visible for miles. Burns stayed his order to give the Obama administration and the association that erected the cross, which have fought its removal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, a chance to file another appeal. Otherwise, he said, the monument must be taken down within 90 days. ""This is a victory for religious liberty,"" said Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's program on freedom of religion and belief who argued the matter for the plaintiffs in a hearing before Burns on Thursday. ""We firmly support the government's efforts to honor the service of those who fought and died for this country, but there are many ways to do that without playing favorites with religion,"" Mach said. The case hinged on whether it is legal for a religious symbol to be prominently displayed on public land and whether the cross violated the U.S. Constitution's requirement on separation of church and state. The Mount Soledad cross has been the subject of litigation since 1989, when two veterans sued San Diego to get it off city land. In 2006, Congress intervened in the dispute, resulting in the federal government taking ownership of the property. A group of plaintiffs, including the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, then sued. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals court ruled that the dominance of the cross conveyed a message of government endorsement of religion. The Obama administration and the Mount Soledad Memorial Association, which erected the cross, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, supported by 20 U.S. states and various veterans groups in arguing the cross should be allowed as part of the memorial. In June 2012, the Supreme Court declined to take the case, letting the Ninth Circuit's ruling stand. In ordering that the cross be taken down, Burns said on Thursday he did not agree with the Ninth Circuit's ruling but that his hands were tied. The cross, located between the Pacific Ocean and a major interstate highway, is surrounded by walls displaying granite plaques that commemorate veterans or veterans groups. Easter services were held annually at the cross from 1954 until at least 2000, according to court documents. The Mount Soledad Memorial Association, which erected the cross in place of another cross that had stood on that spot since 1913, could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday's ruling.

Americans urged to make cash donations to reputable charities

Help is on the way to areas of the Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development and humanitarian relief groups.

The Obama administration made an initial $100,000 available Saturday to provide basic health care, clean water and sanitation following the Philippines government's request for international assistance. That figure is likely to grow as damage and humanitarian needs are assessed.

At the request of the Philippine government, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel directed U.S. Pacific Command to deploy ships and aircraft to support search-and-rescue operations and airlift emergency supplies, according to a statement released by the Defense Department press office.

USAID, the lead agency for the international humanitarian response, deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team to the area to make those assessments. The team's early surveys in some of the country's hardest-hit areas found severe damage, particularly in the towns of Tacloban and Ormoc on the island of Leyte, which were virtually wiped out by the storm. One of the first supplies delivered was plastic sheeting to be used for emergency shelter.

""Today our hearts go out to the Filipino people,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""The United States can and must do everything in our power to assist our friend and ally in dealing with the devastating consequences of this storm, and to help meet the needs of the Filipino people in addressing this disaster.""

The American Red Cross deployed staff members to the area and activated its family tracing services for people seeking to locate missing family members. With phone lines down across the area, the agency urged people to be patient and keep trying to make contact.

Google has launched a person finder for survivors of Typhoon Haiyan, known as Yolanda in the Philippines, where friends and family can search for information on a loved one or enter information about a person's whereabouts so others know they are safe.

Private aid groups said there was an immediate need for rice, canned foods, clean water, medicine, clothes, shelter and blankets. But U.S. officials said that, just as in other disasters, the best thing Americans can do is donate cash to reputable humanitarian organizations.

Those seeking to send help can go to website for InterAction, a consortium of 180 non-government organizations involved in global assistance programs. Among the members are the American Red Cross, AmeriCares, CARE, Catholic Relief Services, Mercy Corps, Oxfam America, Save the Children, U.S. Fund for UNICEF and World Food Program USA.

In addition, USAID operates a Center for International Disaster Information, which helps prospective donors get the most bang for their bucks."

Washington (CNN) - Saying ""we will respond to the threat of climate change,"" President Barack Obama used his second inaugural address to put the divisive issue back on the front burner. But according to a new national survey, Americans are divided over whether global warming is a man made phenomenon.

The president also used his speech to highlight the controversial issue of illegal immigration, and a CNN/ORC International survey released Tuesday also indicates that a bare majority of the public says the main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents, rather than deporting them.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The president warned in his Monday address that failure to respond to climate change ""would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.""

According to the poll, which was conducted last week, 49% agree with the White House that global warming is a proven fact and is due to emissions from cars, power plants and factories. That's twice as high as the number who say that global warming has not been proven, as well as the 24% who say that it is a proven fact but is not due to manmade sources. But the 49% figure is down seven points from 2007.

There's an expected partisan divide on the question, with two-thirds of Democrats saying global warming is man made. That number drops to 48% among independent voters and is at 28% among Republicans.

The president tried and failed in his first term to get a climate change bill through Congress. The president also came up empty during his first four years in the White House in trying to pass comprehensive illegal immigration reform though Congress.

But Obama has put the issue on his to-do list this year, and in his inaugural address he said ""our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.""

By a 53%-43% margin, people questioned in the poll say that main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents, rather than deporting them.

That's a switch from 2011, when by a 55%-42% margin, Americans said that deporting undocumented residents and stopping more of them from coming into the country should be the main focus of U.S policy on illegal immigration.

As expected, the poll indicates a partisan divide on the issue, as well as a generational divide, with younger people saying allowing undocumented immigrants to become legal should be the top priority, and a slight plurality of those 50 and older saying the emphasis should be on deportation and border security.

One of the president's biggest domestic accomplishments in his first term was passing a sweeping health care bill through Congress in 2010. In his inauguration address, Obama acknowledged that there is still much work ahead on this issue, saying ""we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care.""

According to the poll, 51% favor all or most of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, the official name of what many people refer to as ""Obamacare,"" with 44% opposed to all or most of the provisions in the law.

""That's a switch from 2011, when a CNN poll indicated that a majority opposed all or most of the provisions in the health care bill,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

Minutes after his inauguration speech, the president signed documents making official his nominations for some top Cabinet posts, including former Sen. Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. The Nebraska Republican's nomination has been met with reservations, and even outright opposition, by some senators of both parties, who point to past positions he has taken on Israel, Iran and the war in Iraq.

According to the poll, 48% think the Senate should confirm Hagel.

""That's twice as high as the number who oppose his confirmation, but with three in ten uncertain of how they feel about the issue, the White House might breathe a little easier if support for Hagel were just over 50% rather than just under that mark,"" adds Holland.

The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International on Jan. 14-15, with 814 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."

Did someone say creepy and depressing?

In the months before the 2012 election, a group of high-powered consultants and political operatives prepared a secret report for candidate Mitt Romney, explaining how he should take over and restructure the federal government should he win the presidency. […] But now the secret is out. On May 29, the Romney Readiness Project, the Republican candidate’s transition organization known as R2P, published a 138-page report detailing how it prepared for a potential Romney victory.

“The White House staff is similar to a holding company” read one PowerPoint slide, which would have been presented to President-elect Romney as part of an expansive briefing on the morning after Election Day. It went on to list three main divisions of the metaphorical firm: “Care & Feeding Offices,” like speechwriting, “Policy Offices,” like the National Security Council, and “Packaging & Selling Offices,” like the office of the press secretary.

Among the recommendations for the Romney administration: • Corporate-style training seminars were planned for appointees and nominees before the inauguration to teach management skills.

• A plan to restructure White House operations to suit Romney’s corporate management style, with clear deliverables.

• Detailed flow charts delineating how information and decisions were disseminated through the administration to achieve “unity.”

Oh God, no. No, no, no. The actual document is horrifying. It's horrifying in exactly the way you'd expect it to be horrifying, coming from Mitt Freaking Romney's camp. It proposes treating the entire executive branch like a big financial firm, because THAT IS WHAT MITT ROMNEY KNOWS AND LOVES, PUNY FLESH-HUMANS.I see now how narrowly the satirists, comedians and other snarkish wags of America averted catastrophe last November. There is no way anyone with any sense of humor could have survived the first hundred days of a Mitt Romney ""let's treat the Oval Office like a big Wall Street firm"" presidency without dying outright. The true cynics would have been killed off within a week; the optimists, within a month. It was a cunning plan to murder comedy outright.Once you get past the inherent terror of someone trying to think of the White House as a ""holding company"" and whatnot, most of the supposed details of the plan seem simplistic at best, for something allegedly the product of a 500 person team—for example, a long series of slides explaining how the White House is organized, written with words like ""COO"" and ""Selling"" in an apparent attempt to explain these things to whatever executive business critters were going to be brought on board to run those things. The policy prescriptions are broad and consist almost entirely of the same one-sentence vows Romney was making in various campaign forums. (Given that more than a few tax dollars helped pay for them to come up with this stuff, charging the general public $24.95 to see the depressing end results seems a bit insulting.)

The White House as holding company, though–gonna be seeing that one in my nightmares. Now I know how the people in Russia felt when that meteor whizzed over their heads."

The justices sounded sharply divided as they considered Proposition 8, California’s ban on gay marriage, and wary of going too far, too fast. None of them spoke up for a sweeping ruling that would require every state to change its marriage laws.

But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who probably holds the deciding vote, said in the day’s most poignant moment that he was troubled by the effect of Proposition 8 on the nearly 40,000 children in the state being raised by same-sex couples. The court should hear “the voice of these children,” he said. “They want their parents to have full recognition and full status” that goes with marriage.

Kennedy, who has written two previous decisions in favor of gay rights, sounded anguished, admitting he was “wrestling” with whether to extend the same anti-discrimination protection to gays that the court gives to women but also expressed concern about taking the court “into unchartered waters” or over a “cliff.”

The court’s liberal justices more forcefully attacked the argument by Proposition 8 proponents that the purpose of marriage was for procreation, with Justice Elena Kagan asking at one point whether states could ban marriage between couples older than 55.

Charles J. Cooper, who argued for Proposition 8, said that would not be constitutional, adding that at least one member of an elderly couple would probably still be fertile, drawing laughter from the courtroom.

“Lots of people who get married can’t have children,” said Justice Stephen G. Breyer.

The arguments opened two days of hearings by the court on the controversial issue of same-sex marriage. On Wednesday, the justices will hear a constitutional challenge to the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which bans federal benefits for 130,000 legally married gay couples, including 18,000 couples in California.

The Obama administration and gay rights advocates say the provision is discriminatory and denies the married couples the “equal protection of the laws.” Appeals courts in Boston and New York have ruled it unconstitutional.

CHEAT SHEET: Your guide to Prop. 8 and DOMA

California’s voters approved Proposition 8 in 2008 to limit marriage to a man and a woman. However, the referendum was challenged in federal court in San Francisco and struck down by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last year on the grounds it took away from gays and lesbians a right to marry that they had won in the state courts.

If the Supreme Court had turned down the appeal in the California case, it would have had the effect of restoring gay marriage in California. Such a move would not have set a legal precedent nor would it have forced a change in the states that forbid gay marriage.

Kennedy’s comments, combined with those of the four liberal justices, suggest the five will combine to seek a narrow approach in the California case. They could reject the appeal from the sponsors of Proposition 8 on the grounds that they lack legal “standing” to speak for the state of California. They could dismiss the appeal and let stand the 9th Circuit’s ruling. Or they could write a limited opinion that finds the California ballot measure unconstitutional. All three options would have the effect of allowing gay marriage in California.

Tuesday’s arguments highlighted deep philosophical divisions between liberals and conservatives over the potential effects of extending the right to marry to same-sex couples.

On the court’s right wing, Justice Antonin Scalia jumped most forcefully to defend Proposition 8. “There’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what [are] the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not,” he said.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. questioned whether a court should change “this institution that’s been around since time immemorial.”

“When the institution of marriage developed historically,” Roberts said, it “didn’t include homosexual couples.”

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a third conservative member of the court, suggested it was too soon to make a decision, another point made by those backing the California ban.

“You want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cellphones or the Internet,” Alito told Theodore B. Olson, the attorney challenging California’s ban. “I mean we … do not have the ability to see the future.”

Joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, the most conservative justices appear to have four solid votes against any constitutional right for same-sex marriage.

But the court’s liberal justices repeatedly pressed Cooper to explain why committed gay couples should be denied the right to marry.

“What harm (do) you see happening?” Kagan asked at one point, demanding examples of “when and how and what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples” could come.

Cooper demurred, explaining that the more pertinent question was what benefit a state like California could derive from allowing gays and lesbians to marry.

Cooper has argued that traditional marriage has the benefit of fostering child-bearing, a purpose he warned could be subverted by same-sex marriage. “It will refocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of marriage away from the raising of children and to the emotional needs and desires of adults, of adult couples,” he said.

Despite the back and forth over the fundamental implications of gay marriage, much of the argument Tuesday focused on possible procedural flaws in the case.

Roberts and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned whether the sponsors of Proposition 8 had legal standing to defend it in the Supreme Court.

“Have we ever granted standing to the proponents of a ballot measure?” Ginsburg asked.

But Kennedy, a California native, said California law on ballot measures gave a special responsibility to the sponsors of initiatives. He said they could represent the people of the state when its officials refused to defend a measure approved by the voters.

This exchange suggested Kennedy was not looking for a way for the court to duck a ruling on California’s ban on gay marriage.

The justices meet behind closed doors later this week to vote on the two gay marriage cases. But what they decide is not likely to be known until late June.

But here are some of Chan's ""gems"" extracted by the San Antonio Express-News:



By the way, this is politically incorrect. I don’t think homosexual people should do adoption. They should be banned by adoption. You’re going to confuse those kids. They should be banned.

If you wanted to choose that lifestyle, we don’t want to discriminate you, but you shouldn’t affect the young people. How terrible. … They’re going to be confused. You see two men go into a bedroom. You see two women kissing. Is that not confusing? It’s confusing.

It is actually, what you call, suggestive, for the kids to be corrupt, which is against nature. I’m telling you, anything that is against nature is not right.

You know, to be quite honest, I know this is not politically correct. I never bought in that you are born, that you are born gay. I can’t imagine it.

When I say that it’s … behavioral preference, they say that, ""No, you’re born with it."" But I never bought into that.

I think it’s just disgusting just to even think about.

In strategizing on how to oppose the anti-discrimination ordinance, Chan decided to have her staff draft an op-ed to appear in a local paper. “Can you guys come up with a draft?” she asks her aides. “Come up with draft with all the good, those arguments we talk as a speaking point, in terms of we’re addressing an issue that is not an issue. This is national politics again at the council level. “This is another layer of bureaucracy, that we have not heard any discrimination,” she continues. “And then add in the family value in there. … Maybe I’ll use the industries, that we have a trend, that is, maybe I’ll use we have water rates and CPS rates to worry about.” “Maybe what we can do, can we maybe throw some questionable confusions like, OK, this ‘transgender,’ because the definition is so broad…”

Perhaps even more interesting is how far she's willing to go to cover up her obviously antiquated views from the public.Listen to the horrifying recording yourself:

Chan's then-chief of policy Jeff Bazan is the one on the recording who warns that we're on a slippery slope toward incest and bestiality (how original, right?) and tells Chan to be a ""culture warrior"" on the issue. Well, he's now working for pro-gay Democrat Ron Nirenberg, who was just elected to the City Council, as his chief of staff. Can somebody say awkward? Bazan released the following statement yesterday:



I was basically explaining the viewpoint that some people have on the gay marriage issue. What I said was wrong and I deeply regret it. I can say that those comments, which were intended to be purely political, do not reflect my heart. Councilman Nirenberg, whom I currently serve and support, has made it clear that discrimination is not negotiable, and I am proud to work for him.

Right.

As for Chan, she acted as if she didn't know Stevens at first when confronted about the recording. Then she had this to say:



I think that's in a private setting and I don't know if that's — I need to hear that recording to know. I'm not quite sure what you're talking about so maybe you can play that back to me. We talk a lot of things in the staff meetings, so I wanted to know also under what context.

There is apparently a rumor that Chan is planning a run for Mayor in 2015, which she wouldn't confirm or deny. Right. We'll see how that goes for her."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/29/justice/california-same-sex-marriage/index.html,2013-06-29 00:00:00,['Greg Botelho'],Challenge filed to stop resumption of same-sex marriages in California,"Story highlights Lawyers: Court shouldn't have lifted a stay on same-sex marriages in California They ask for ""an immediate order"" vacating that decision, after which weddings resumed A gay rights spokesman says the appeals court's actions were ""entirely proper"" U.S. Supreme Court paved the way for the appeals court's move with a ruling Wednesday

(CNN) —

Lawyers for groups opposed to same-sex marriage in California petitioned to reverse a federal appeals court order that OK’d the resumption of such unions – doing so a day after that ruling.

Attorneys applied Saturday to the U.S. Supreme Court for “an immediate order vacating” a decision Friday by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to copies of the document from ProtectMarriage.com and the Alliance Defending Freedom. That appeals court Friday lifted a previous injunction on same-sex marriages in California, “effective immediately.”

“Without the immediate relief requested by this Application, the Ninth Circuit will circumvent the proper rules and procedures established by this Court,” the application says.

Those on the other side of the debate, meanwhile, think the appeals court acted appropriately.

“The Ninth Circuit had broad discretion as to whether to stay the injunction pending appeal,” said Manny Rivera, a spokesman for the American Foundation for Equal Rights. “Now that the Supreme Court has decided that the injunction against Proposition 8 must stand, it was entirely appropriate for the Ninth Circuit to dissolve its stay of that injunction.”

California’s Supreme Court struck down the state’s ban on same-sex marriage in May 2008, ruling that the state’s constitution gives “this basic civil right to (marry to) all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples.”

But months later, 52% of voters backed Proposition 8 to once again restrict marriages so that they can only be between a man and a woman.

The measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold, though lawsuits followed.

State officials declined to stand behind Proposition 8 – and, thus, its prohibition on gay marriage – though private parties did step in and offer to do so.

A federal appeals court later ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in.

That happened in a 5-4 decision Wednesday, when the high court dismissed an appeal of that federal court ruling on jurisdictional grounds. That meant Friday’s news – the resumption of same-sex marriages in California – was expected, even though it wasn’t known when it would happen.

Supreme Court cases rest of citizens who sued, made history

ProtectMarriage.com and Alliance Defending Freedom say it shouldn’t have happened then, at the least.

In their emergency application, affiliated lawyers claimed the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals “lacked jurisdiction to issue its order purporting to dissolve the stay.” They reasoned that this appeals court wasn’t authorized to weigh in until the Supreme Court “sends a certified copy of the judgment to the Ninth Circuit.”

Among other arguments, the application also stated that “permitting the Ninth Circuit to prematurely dissolve its stay order would effectively deprive petitioners of a meaningful opportunity to exercise their right to petition for rehearing.”

Such petitions for the Supreme Court to reconsider a case must be filed within 25 days after a ruling has been made.

It’s unclear if and/or when the high court might consider this request. Justices recently began a recess after issuing a number of pivotal rulings last week.

And there’s no immediate indication it will have any impact on same-sex weddings taking place around California. Gov. Jerry Brown issued a directive on Friday telling authorities in “58 California counties that same-sex marriage is now legal in California and that marriage licenses must be issued to same-sex couples immediately.”

Attorney General Kamala Harris, in fact, performed one of the first such unions – between Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, who were one of the couples who sued to stop a voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage from taking effect – at San Francisco’s City Hall.

Process begins to allow federal benefits for same-sex spouses

Accomplishment: When your father Dick Cheney has to go on record saying you're a bigger jerk than he is.

This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public. Since it has, one thing should be clear. Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She has also treated her sister and her sister's family with love and respect, exactly as she should have done. Compassion is called for, even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter and Liz's many kindnesses shouldn't be used to distort her position.

Looks like there's trouble in the Cheney clan. Liz Cheney is running for something, and in the Republican party running for something means you're against gay marriage, even though her own sister is gay. Her father Dick is not running for anything anymore, which means he has been freed to have a non-scummy opinion on the subject—and really, when noted torture-of-prisoners advocate Dick Cheney is not a gigantic asshole about something, it stands out. So now we get to watch the spectacle of Dick and Lynne Cheney releasing a public statement distancing themselves from their campaigning daughter. I like how they preemptively defend Liz from the notion that she's just pretending to be an intolerant ass on the subject. Oh no, dear Republicans, we assure you Liz has always been an intolerant ass about this. For years! She just swallows her bile in front of her sister, most of the time, because family and whatnot.

Put this up as another reason you probably never want to eat dinner with the Cheney family on Thanksgiving. That is probably going to be one, er, interesting evening. (And I hope they're not going to be cooking anyone we know.)

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/08/24/churches-changing-bylaws-after-gay-marriage-ruling/,2013-08-24 00:00:00,[],Churches changing bylaws after gay marriage ruling,"Worried they could be sued by gay couples, some churches are changing their bylaws to reflect their view that the Bible allows only marriage between one man and one woman.

Although there have been suits against wedding industry businesses that refuse to serve gay couples, attorneys promoting the bylaw changes say they don't know of any lawsuits against churches.

Critics say the changes are unnecessary, but some churches fear that it's only a matter of time before one of them is sued.

""I thought marriage was always between one man and one woman, but the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision said no,"" said Gregory S. Erwin, an attorney for the Louisiana Baptist Convention, an association of Southern Baptist churches and one several groups advising churches to change their bylaws. ""I think it's better to be prepared because the law is changing. America is changing.""

In a June decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law. A second decision was more technical but essentially ushered in legal gay marriage in California.

Kevin Snider is an attorney with the Pacific Justice Institute, a nonprofit legal defense group that specializes in conservative Christian issues. His organization released a model marriage policy a few years ago in response to a statewide gay marriage fight in California. Snider said some religious leaders have been threatened with lawsuits for declining to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies.

Dean Inserra, head pastor of the 1,000-member City Church Tallahassee, based in Florida, said he does not want to be alarmist, but his church is looking into how best to address the issue.

Inserra said he already has had to say no to gay friends who wanted him to perform a wedding ceremony.

""We have some gay couples that attend our church. What happens when they ask us to do their wedding?"" Inserra said. ""What happens when we say no? Is it going to be treated like a civil rights thing?""

Critics, including some gay Christian leaders, argue that the changes amount to a solution looking for a problem.

""They seem to be under the impression that there is this huge movement with the goal of forcing them to perform ceremonies that violate their freedom of religion,"" said Justin Lee, executive director of the Gay Christian Network, a nonprofit that provides support for gay Christians and their friends and families and encourages churches to be more welcoming.

""If anyone tried to force a church to perform a ceremony against their will, I would be the first person to stand up in that church's defense.""

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia now recognize gay marriage.

Some Christian denominations, such as the United Church of Christ and the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, accept gay marriage. The Episcopal Church recently approved a blessing for same-sex couples, but each bishop must decide whether to allow the ceremony in his or her local diocese.

The majority of Christian denominations, however, view homosexual relationships as sinful. In more hierarchical denominations, like the Roman Catholic Church or the United Methodist Church, individual churches are bound by the policies of the larger denomination. But nondenominational churches and those loosely affiliated with more established groups often individually decide how to address social issues such as gay marriage.

Eric Rassbach is an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest legal group that defends the free expression rights of all faiths. He said it is unlikely the government would try to force a pastor to perform a same-sex marriage, but churches that rent out their facilities to the general public could face problems if they refuse to rent to gay couples.

Although his organization has not advocated it, he said it could strengthen a church's legal position to adopt a statement explaining its beliefs about marriage.

""A number of groups don't have a written doctrine,"" Rassbach said. ""Say a group like the Primitive Baptists -- they don't want a written-down credo, but the courts like written-down things.""

Rassbach said it was important for churches to get their beliefs in writing before a dispute arises, otherwise it can look to a court as if something was done after the fact as an attempt to cover up hostility to gays.

Airline Baptist Church Senior Pastor Chad Mills said members of the public use their facilities in is Bossier City, La., for many activities, including Zumba classes. In the past, anyone who could pay the fee was allowed to reserve the space. But recently, the church changed its rental policy to allow wedding-related events only for male-female couples.

Some denominations are less concerned about the Supreme Court rulings. The Assemblies of God, the group of churches comprising the world's largest Pentecostal denomination, sought legal advice after the rulings. An attorney for the group distributed a memo to ministers saying there was no reason to change their bylaws.

However, the memo also said that ""doing so is not inappropriate, and may be warranted based on future rulings by the Supreme Court and other state and federal courts.""

The bylaw changes are coming at a time when many churches are wrestling with gay marriage in general and are working hard to be more welcoming to gays and lesbians.

""It's probably one of the most difficult issues our churches are facing right now,"" said Doug Anderson, a national coordinator with the evangelical Vineyard Church. ""It's almost an impossible situation to reconcile what's going on in our culture, and our whole theology of welcoming and loving people, versus what it says in the Bible."""

Cupp told HuffPost Live host Abby Huntsman that while she has enjoyed her ""long and wonderful relationship"" with CPAC, she's skipping the conservative conference this year because it will continue to exclude gay Republican organizations like GOProud and Log Cabin Republicans.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

But the general trend of public opinion toward greater acceptance of same-sex couples is clear. And there’s one subset of the population that’s especially intriguing: people who say homosexuality violates their religious beliefs yet are nevertheless inclined to allow gay unions as a matter of civil law. Call them “libertarian traditionalists”: culturally conservative in their own lives, but upholding equal rights for those who don’t share their values.

How big is this group? Perhaps surprisingly, more than 1 in 4 Americans hold those seemingly conflicted opinions – at least when it comes to the general principle of equal rights for gay couples.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronology

In an invaluable series of recent polls, the Pew Research Center has not only tracked the sea change in public opinion on homosexuality, but has broken it down into constituent parts.

Pew polls in 2012 and 2013 found that 48% of Americans now favor allowing allowing gays and Lesbians to marry legally, compared to 43% who are opposed. (Surveys performed more recently find even higher numbers in favor. An ABC News-Washington Post poll last month, for example, found 58% supporting gay marriage.)

The value in the large-sample Pew surveys is the level of detail they offer. Pew found that majorities of both Democrats (61%) and independents (53%) favor gay marriage; self-identified Republicans (25%) are distinct outliers by comparison.

Pew found that “cross-pressured” opinion – people who oppose gay marriage in principle but support equal rights for homosexuals in practice – is more than a blip. Most respondents in the Pew polls (56%) say same-sex marriage conflicts with their religious beliefs; but half of the people in that group (28% of the public overall) also believe that same-sex couples “should have the same legal rights as heterosexual couples.”

That means more than 1 in 4 Americans are holding two seemingly contradictory ideas: that gay marriage conflicts with their religious beliefs, but same-sex couples should have the same rights as others. That pattern holds true for 29% of Republicans and 29% of evangelical Christians too.

But maybe that view isn’t as contradictory as it seems. In my column, I quoted Timothy Keller, pastor of an evangelical church in Manhattan, saying “You can believe that homosexuality is a sin and still believe that same-sex marriage can be legal.” Keller doesn’t favor gay marriage; he was merely describing what he called an increasingly common view among young Protestant conservatives.

Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s commission on ethics and religious liberty, outlined the same phenomenon in a recent interview with Politico. “Basically, they just don’t think it’s something we want to talk about,” he said of younger evangelicals. “[They say,] ‘It feels intolerant. We believe what we believe; they have a right to what they want to believe. Marriage should be a church thing, not a legal thing.’”

Gay Marriage: What’s most offensive about the Defense of Marriage Act"

He Has Covered The Supreme Court Since November']",Scalia finds his predictions on same-sex-marriage ruling being borne out,"As smart as they are, Supreme Court justices sometimes falter when they predict the consequences of their decisions.

Dissenting justices are usually the most vocal, forecasting far-reaching and often calamitous results from what they see as the poorly reasoned rulings of the majority. Regardless of the ideology of the justice issuing the doomsday warnings, they often do not live up to the hyperbole.

So give Justice Antonin Scalia credit — or condolences.

When the court last June struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act and said the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages performed in those states where it was legal, Scalia sounded a loud warning.

While the five-member majority of the court said it was not deciding whether a constitutional right to marriage must be extended to same-sex couples, Scalia said the reasoning of the decision made that outcome practically preordained.

“It takes real cheek for today’s majority to assure us, as it is going out the door, that a constitutional requirement to give formal recognition to same-sex marriage is not at issue here,” Scalia wrote.

Instead, “the majority arms well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to its traditional definition,” Scalia wrote, and such suits are a “second . . . shoe to be dropped later.”

Scalia’s words have been highlighted in the two recent decisions about same-sex marriage that will return the issue to the Supreme Court.

U.S. District Judge Timothy Black cited the dissent in a ruling that said Ohio, which bans same-sex unions, must recognize on a death certificate a marriage that was performed in another state.

“Just as Justice Scalia predicted — the lower courts are applying the Supreme Court’s decision, as they must, and the question is presented whether a state can do what the federal government cannot — i.e., discriminate against same-sex couples . . . simply because the majority of the voters don’t like homosexuality (or at least didn’t in 2004),” wrote Black (the ellipses and parenthesis are his).

“Under the Constitution of the United States, the answer is no.”

In Utah, where just before Christmas a federal judge struck down that state’s constitutional amendment forbidding same-sex unions, Scalia’s words played a prominent role both in the challengers’ arguments and the ruling.

Attorneys Peggy A. Tomsic and James E. Magleby, representing a gay male couple and two lesbian couples, relied in part on Scalia’s interpretation of the majority’s DOMA decision, U.S. v. Windsor.

Scalia, they said, recognized the opinion “for what it is: a holding that would bind lower courts, such as this court, if presented a constitutional challenge to state laws banning same-sex marriage.”

In their filings, the lawyers bold-faced the Scalia dissent for emphasis:

(“[T]he view that this Court will take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated beyond mistaking in today’s opinion. . . . [T]he real rationale of today’s opinion . . . is that DOMA is motivated by ‘bare . . . desire to harm’ couples in same-sex marriages. . . . How easy is it, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status.”)

And U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby mentioned Scalia’s dissent throughout his lengthy opinion and concluded: “The court agrees with Justice Scalia’s interpretation of Windsor and finds that the important federalism concerns at issue here are nevertheless insufficient to save a state-law prohibition that denies the Plaintiffs their rights to due process and equal protection under the law.”

Of course, Scalia did not say in his Windsor dissent that lower courts must adopt such an interpretation.

“Lower federal courts and state courts can distinguish today’s case when the issue before them is state denial of marital status to same-sex couples,” he wrote, adding: “Lord, an opinion with such scatter-shot rationales as this one . . . can be distinguished in many ways.”

Still, as Scalia pointed out, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s DOMA decision practically provided a blueprint for how such challenges might be successful.

It is not surprising that judges might want to quote a conservative justice when striking down what voters have put in place. Ohio and Utah voters amended their state constitutions to ban same-sex marriages in 2004, along with other states. Black and Shelby were nominated by President Obama.

Shelby’s decision, and his reliance on Scalia, has gotten the most attention from legal commentators. “In Striking Down Utah’s Gay Marriage Ban, Judge Gives Scalia Big Bear Hug,” read the headline on the liberal Talking Points Memo.

And University of Illinois law professor Jason Mazzone set off a hot debate on the legal website Balkinization when he wrote that Shelby’s opinion “would have appeared considerably more judicial had he resisted the urge to give Justice Scalia the finger.”

Shelby, 43, does not have the reputation as a firebrand. He had been on the bench only six months when he was assigned the same-sex marriage case Kitchen v. Herbert. He was previously a Salt Lake City lawyer and was honored for his service in Operation Desert Storm while in the Utah National Guard.

He was endorsed by both of Utah’s Republican senators, and Sen. Mike Lee, a constitutional conservative popular with the tea party movement, called Shelby “preeminently qualified” and predicted he would be “an outstanding judge.”

The state of Utah has said it will ask the Supreme Court to stay Shelby’s ruling and stop same-sex marriages while an appeals court considers the merits of the decision. Shelby and a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver noted the state failed initially to ask for a stay and has not proven the kind of harm that would warrant one.

In the meantime, marriages in Utah have broken records, according to a review in the Salt Lake Tribune. By last Thursday, the newspaper reported, more than 900 same-sex couples had been married across the state, despite the holiday and some counties refusing to issue licenses until Gov. Gary R. Herbert (R) directed them to follow Shelby’s order.

According to estimates from the plaintiffs’ filing in the court, that is about one-fourth of the gay couples living in the state."

By Treena Shapiro

HONOLULU, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Hawaii's House of Representatives approved a bill on Friday to legalize same-sex marriage in the overwhelmingly Democratic state popular as a wedding and honeymoon destination, paving the way for anticipated final passage in the Senate next week.

The measure cleared the House in a late-night vote of 30-19, with six of the chamber's seven Republicans joining 13 Democrats in opposing the legislation. Two Democrats were absent for the vote.

Governor Neil Abercrombie has indicated he would swiftly sign the measure into law, making Hawaii the 15th or 16th U.S. state to extend marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples, depending on when the governor of Illinois signs that state's bill.

As currently drafted, the Hawaii bill would take effect on Dec. 2.

""This is about a move toward acceptance, tolerance and compassion,"" Representative Sylvia Luke, chairwoman of the House Finance Committee, said as the House floor debate began hours before the vote.

The vote in Hawaii comes at a time of increasing momentum for gay marriage in the courts, at the ballot box and statehouses across the country.

Hawaii's Supreme Court ruled two decades ago that banning same-sex marriage was discriminatory, helping to advance gay rights nationwide but also sparking a backlash that kept the legislature passing a bill on the issue.

With public opinion shifting, Abercrombie, a first-term Democrat, called the state legislature into special session late last month to consider a bill that rolls back a 1994 statute defining marriage as between a man and a woman only.

The Senate overwhelmingly approved the measure last Wednesday, with a 20-4 vote. Three Democrats joined the state's only Republican senator in voting against the bill.

Because the measure was amended in the House, it must return to the Senate for final adoption. The Senate is precluded by legislative rules from acting before next Tuesday, aides say.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Clayton Hee was quoted in the Honolulu Star Advertiser as saying he expected the Senate would accept the House version quickly.

GAY RIGHTS VS. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

Abercrombie, who served more than two decades in the U.S. House of Representatives before running for governor in 2010, signed a same-sex civil unions bill into law two years ago. His predecessor, Republican Linda Lingle, vetoed a civil unions bill in 2010.

The governor has said the proposal was crafted to address opponents' concerns that legalizing gay marriage would infringe on religious freedoms. The proposal exempts clergy and churches from having to perform same-sex marriages.

Only six states and the District of Columbia recognized same-sex marriage a year ago, but the number has since more than doubled, due in most cases to litigation over the issue.

Three states - Maine, Maryland and Washington - became the first to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples by popular vote with passage of ballot initiatives last November.

Last month, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie dropped his legal opposition to gay marriage, making his state the 14th to legalize same-sex weddings.

Illinois, whose legislature gave final approval to a same-sex marriage bill on Tuesday, would become the 15th state, unless Abercrombie manages to beat Illinois Governor Pat Quinn to the punch. (Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Louise Ireland and Sonya Hepinstall)"

That means the political fight will go on and on. Yes, the new conventional wisdom is that gay-rights advocates are certain to win the war, but, without a clear declaration from the high court that marriage equality is a constitutional right, there are many battles yet to be fought. And the easy ones are largely over. Getting approval of same-sex marriage in places such as Washington or California or the liberal Northeast is a cinch compared to what it will take to change hearts and minds and laws in states such as Alabama and Oklahoma and Utah.

A very hard task remains and the irony is that, for heterosexuals, getting married is ridiculously easy. Any pair of drunk, heterosexual fools in Las Vegas can fall in love over the craps table, run off to find an all-night chapel and wake to find themselves with hangovers, cheap wedding rings and membership in the sacred club of husbands and wives.

In 2004, Britney Spears showed up at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Vegas and married her childhood friend, Jason Allen Alexander, only to have their union annulled 55 hours later. Britney is hardly the only celebrity to have perfected the art of marriage as a short-lived publicity stunt (take a bow, Kim Kardashian!). Then there was blond bimbo Anna Nicole Smith who married an 89-year-old billionaire without having to prove it was for love, not for the inheritance.

Many fabled movie stars – Elizabeth Taylor and Zsa Zsa Gabor come immediately to mind – adored being married and had the multiple spouses to prove it. Marital antics are not just a Hollywood thing, though. No matter who they are or where they live or how many times they may have proved inept at matrimony or just plain unwise in the choice of a mate, anybody can get married and divorced and married over and over again – as long as he or she is not gay.

Meth addicts and gang-bangers can legally tie the knot and often do – sometime after the births of their children and before their own premature death. Even inmates in prison are sometimes allowed to marry. But two men who have built a home and spent devoted, monogamous decades together still cannot get married in most states.

That is not to say that gay people will prove to be any more successful and smart at marriage than straight Americans. I already am acquainted with two lesbian couples who married as soon as they could do it legally and divorced within a couple of years. Homosexuals are human. They will be just as foolish and unskilled at creating wedded bliss as the rest of us. But if a couple of gay guys or lesbian gals want to swill Gimlets and Cosmopolitans and then stagger to the altar at some neon-lit Las Vegas wedding chapel, they should have as much right to their folly as any other Americans."

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Gay marriage ruling: Supreme Court finds DOMA unconstitutional,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court struck down a key part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act on Wednesday and declared that same-sex couples who are legally married deserve equal rights to the benefits under federal law that go to all other married couples.

The decision is a landmark win for the gay rights movement. It voids a section of the law known as DOMA, which was adopted with bipartisan support in Congress in 1996 to deny all benefits and recognition to same-sex couples.

At that time, no state permitted gays and lesbians to marry. Now, 12 states and the District of Columbia authorize same-sex marriages.

FULL COVERAGE: Prop. 8 and DOMA

Justice Anthony Kennedy, speaking for the 5-4 majority, said DOMA was unconstitutional because it violated the right to liberty and to equal protection for gay couples.

“By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute” violates the Constitution, he said

Dissenting were Justices John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.

The ruling means that more than 100,000 gay and lesbian couples who are legally married will be able to take advantage of tax breaks, pension rights and other benefits that are available to other married couples.

Four years ago, several gay couples who were married in Massachusetts launched a lawsuit to challenge DOMA, arguing it denied them equal protection of the laws. They won before a federal judge in Boston and before the federal appeals court there.

Their win prompted the Obama administration to switch course and join with the challengers, who said the law was discriminatory. House Republicans voted to take up the legal defense of the law.

When the issue reached the Supreme Court, the justices voted to decide a case brought by Edith Windsor, a New York widow who was sent a $363,000 estate tax bill by the Internal Revenue Service after her wife died in 2009.

The decision leaves in place another provision in the law that says no state is required to recognize gay marriages performed in any other state. That provision was not under challenge.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since', 'Christi Parsons Was The Los Angeles Times', 'White House Correspondent']",White House asks justices to reject Prop. 8,"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has urged the Supreme Court to strike down California’s voter-passed law barring same-sex marriage, arguing for the first time that the Constitution protects an equal right to marry for gays and lesbians.

“Tradition, no matter how long established, cannot by itself justify a discriminatory law,” the administration said in a brief filed with the high court late Thursday. “Prejudice may not be the basis for differential treatment under the law.”

The administration’s legal argument also would apply in at least seven other states that already have granted same-sex couples nearly all the rights of marriage through civil unions. To give those rights while withholding the status of marriage would amount to discrimination based on a person’s sexual orientation, and that cannot be justified under the Constitution, the brief says.

“The designation of marriage,” the brief notes, “conveys a message to society that domestic partnerships or civil unions cannot match.”

Presenting the argument in that manner struck a legal middle ground — giving the justices a way to overturn California’s Proposition 8 without upsetting the laws in all states that ban same-sex marriage. Gay rights advocates have asked the court to strike down all laws nationwide that bar same-sex couples from marrying, but many legal analysts have doubted that a majority of the justices would go that far.

The seven other states directly affected would be Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island, the brief says.

In addition, the government argued, laws that discriminate based on sexual orientation should be treated skeptically by the courts, much as laws that discriminate by gender. That standard, if adopted, ultimately could invalidate other states’ laws against same-sex marriage.

The administration was not required to get involved in the California case, but the White House was heavily lobbied by gay rights groups that have orchestrated a series of briefs on their side by business leaders, prominent Republicans and other groups. Although the government’s brief did not go as far as gay rights advocates would have liked, it won immediate praise from those organizations.

Unlike most other outside groups, the views of the solicitor general’s office often have particular weight with the justices, although the court could decide the case on several other grounds.

The decision to file a brief, which came after several weeks of hesitation and internal debate, marks the latest step in President Obama’s self-described evolution on the issue of same-sex marriage. When he ran for president in 2008, he did not support marriage rights for gays and lesbians, although he also opposed Proposition 8, which California voters approved that year.

Last spring, as he was running for reelection, Obama said he supported gay marriage but believed the issue was a matter for the states to decide. At the time, some close to him suggested he would not weigh in officially on a constitutional right to marry.

But in January, gay rights activists took heart when, in his inaugural address, Obama compared their struggle to the civil rights and women’s movements.

“We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths — that all of us are created equal — is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall,” Obama said in that address, putting on the same plane key moments in fighting discrimination based on gender, race and sexual orientation.

Since then, Obama had appeared at times to be debating with himself. He referred to same-sex marriage as an issue of civil rights, but also told people in his inner circle that he thought social change was better when it took place through elections, not by court decree.

In conversations, he talked about the writings of civil rights leaders who had struggled with how and when to let courts drive societal change. On Wednesday, Obama seemed to be resolving that inner battle as he paid tribute to civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks at a ceremony in her honor.

“Whether out of inertia or selfishness, whether out of fear or a simple lack of moral imagination, we so often spend our lives as if in a fog, accepting injustice, rationalizing inequity, tolerating the intolerable,” he said.

“Rosa Parks tell us there’s always something we can do,” he went on. “She tells us that we all have responsibilities, to ourselves and to one another.”

In a statement Thursday, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. also put the marriage case in the context of the country’s civil rights tradition. “Throughout history, we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination,” he said. “The issues before the Supreme Court are not just important to the tens of thousands of Americans who are being denied equal benefits and rights under our laws, but to our nation as a whole.”

Publicly, White House officials took pains to present the decision of whether to weigh in on the marriage case as one made at the Justice Department.

“The president obviously has expressed an opinion in the past on this issue as a matter of policy, but when it comes to legal and constitutional issues around it, that’s a jurisdiction that resides at the Department of Justice,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

Privately, however, senior administration officials made clear that on such a weighty policy issue, the government’s lawyers would wait for the president’s decision.

The case before the court will be the first to directly confront the justices with the question of whether the U.S. Constitution gives gays and lesbians a right to marry.

Judges in several states have upheld gay marriage under their state constitutions, and the California Supreme Court did the same in 2008. Proposition 8 overturned that ruling by changing the state constitution.

The case before the high court began shortly afterward when two same-sex couples sued in federal court in San Francisco, arguing that excluding them from marrying violated their rights to liberty and equal treatment.

A federal judge agreed and struck down Proposition 8. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision, but did so on the narrower basis that the voters could not take marriage rights from gays and lesbians once those rights had been granted.

In December, the Supreme Court voted to hear an appeal from defenders of Proposition 8, who say the courts should defer to the wishes of the state’s voters.

California’s top officials, including Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, have joined the case on the side of the gay plaintiffs. In a brief filed this week, Harris noted that more than 50,000 children in California are being raised by same-sex couples.

“California’s interests in protecting all of its children are best served by allowing these same-sex couples to enjoy the same benefits of marriage as opposite-sex couples,” Harris said.

The case will be argued before the court on March 26.

Bigots.

Scanning national media over the last several days, one sees words such as homophobia, bigotry and xenophobia thrown like confetti by liberals at anyone who dare say that under the federal constitution, states have the right to define marriage. These scare tactics are actually working—Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, felt compelled to appear on national TV and explain that Catholic religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman forever, to create life is not bigotry but a religious teaching. The left's response—not enough. Nothing is enough short of changing religious doctrine to fit the beliefs of the liberal masses.

This is a common refrain in right-wing circles these days:This is driving the wingers to distraction. Theirs is an entire movement built on the politics of resentment, from the racist Southern Strategy to anti-gay ballot initiatives. Now those roosters are coming home to roost, and the damage inflicted is incalculable.

We liberals always knew modern conservatism was (literally) built on racial resentment, from the day the Republican Party accepted the Dixiecrats with open arms. But that brand is seeping into the broader mainstream. I keep going back to this GOP focus group in Ohio after the 2012 election, where young working-class white voters expressed dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama and the Democrats, but were just vicious in their assessment of the GOP:



None of them expressed great enthusiasm for Obama. But their depiction of Republicans was even more lacerating than the women’s had been. “Racist,” “out of touch” and “hateful” made the list — “and put ‘1950s’ on there too!” one called out.

Remember, those aren't liberals, but the kind of white working-class swing-state voters Republicans need to attract to offset their growing disadvantages with non-Anglo voters. But few want to vote for a racist, hateful, out-of-touch party straight out of the 1950s.

That's why you'll now see the bigots spend half their time arguing that they're not bigots and don't really hate gay people, it's just that they can't tolerate something consenting adults are doing so fuck them and their rights. See? It's not bigotry. It's just intolerance, which is totally different than bigotry!

The mask is off the modern GOP, and all the whining and revisionism can't change the fact that America sees them for the hateful paranoid bigoted xenophobes that they are. And if that hurts their chances at winning elections? It just means that sometimes, there really is justice in this world.

But here are some of Chan's ""gems"" extracted by the San Antonio Express-News:



By the way, this is politically incorrect. I don’t think homosexual people should do adoption. They should be banned by adoption. You’re going to confuse those kids. They should be banned.

If you wanted to choose that lifestyle, we don’t want to discriminate you, but you shouldn’t affect the young people. How terrible. … They’re going to be confused. You see two men go into a bedroom. You see two women kissing. Is that not confusing? It’s confusing.

It is actually, what you call, suggestive, for the kids to be corrupt, which is against nature. I’m telling you, anything that is against nature is not right.

You know, to be quite honest, I know this is not politically correct. I never bought in that you are born, that you are born gay. I can’t imagine it.

When I say that it’s … behavioral preference, they say that, ""No, you’re born with it."" But I never bought into that.

I think it’s just disgusting just to even think about.

In strategizing on how to oppose the anti-discrimination ordinance, Chan decided to have her staff draft an op-ed to appear in a local paper. “Can you guys come up with a draft?” she asks her aides. “Come up with draft with all the good, those arguments we talk as a speaking point, in terms of we’re addressing an issue that is not an issue. This is national politics again at the council level. “This is another layer of bureaucracy, that we have not heard any discrimination,” she continues. “And then add in the family value in there. … Maybe I’ll use the industries, that we have a trend, that is, maybe I’ll use we have water rates and CPS rates to worry about.” “Maybe what we can do, can we maybe throw some questionable confusions like, OK, this ‘transgender,’ because the definition is so broad…”

Perhaps even more interesting is how far she's willing to go to cover up her obviously antiquated views from the public.Listen to the horrifying recording yourself:

Chan's then-chief of policy Jeff Bazan is the one on the recording who warns that we're on a slippery slope toward incest and bestiality (how original, right?) and tells Chan to be a ""culture warrior"" on the issue. Well, he's now working for pro-gay Democrat Ron Nirenberg, who was just elected to the City Council, as his chief of staff. Can somebody say awkward? Bazan released the following statement yesterday:



I was basically explaining the viewpoint that some people have on the gay marriage issue. What I said was wrong and I deeply regret it. I can say that those comments, which were intended to be purely political, do not reflect my heart. Councilman Nirenberg, whom I currently serve and support, has made it clear that discrimination is not negotiable, and I am proud to work for him.

Right.

As for Chan, she acted as if she didn't know Stevens at first when confronted about the recording. Then she had this to say:



I think that's in a private setting and I don't know if that's — I need to hear that recording to know. I'm not quite sure what you're talking about so maybe you can play that back to me. We talk a lot of things in the staff meetings, so I wanted to know also under what context.

There is apparently a rumor that Chan is planning a run for Mayor in 2015, which she wouldn't confirm or deny. Right. We'll see how that goes for her."

USATODAY

A federal judge has ruled that gay marriages may continue in Utah

Judge Richard Shelby on Monday denied a request by the state of Utah to halt the weddings pending appeal

Utah is expected to ask a higher court to put the process on hold

A federal judge has ruled that gay marriage in Utah may continue, making Utah the 18th state in addition to the District of Columbia where gay and lesbian couples can marry.

Judge Richard Shelby on Monday denied a request by the state that sought to halt gay marriage until the appeals process plays out.

Couples on Monday waited to marry in lines that at times stretched for blocks outside the Salt Lake City County Government Center. Some had spent the night in their cars in the parking lot to make sure they didn't miss their chance.

Well-wishers arrived with flowers, coffee and doughnuts to give to the brides and grooms waiting in the chill morning air. At midmorning a group of Christmas carolers arrived to serenade them.

For now, a state considered as one of the most conservative in the nation has joined the likes of California and New York to become the 18th where same-sex couples can legally wed.

Utah is home to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was one of the leading forces behind California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, which voters approved in 2008. The church said Friday that it stands by its support for ""traditional marriage"" and that it hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman.

The state Office of the Attorney General appealed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to have Shelby's ruling stayed just after it was issued, said spokesman Ryan Bruckman in Salt Lake City.

The marriages will continue until the appeal is either upheld or denied, he said.

The decision drew a swift and angry reaction from Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, who said he was disappointed in an ""activist federal judge attempting to override the will of the people of Utah.""

Gay couples began lining up to marry on Friday when Shelby overturned Utah's ban on same-sex marriage, ruling it is unconstitutional. Lines continued to be out the door in many areas as couples raced to get married for fear a stay might be issued and the wedding ended.

Jolene Abbott, 39, and her wife, Colleen Mewing, 51, were married in July in Washington State. But they got married in Salt Lake City Monday afternoon just to make extra sure they were well and truly married in their home state.

""An attorney friend of ours told us that if the appeal goes through they might still recognize the marriages that have occurred in Utah so far, but couples married outside of the state might not be recognized,"" she said of their decision to marry for a second time.

Utah's Bruckman doesn't think that is correct but he's not sure. ""It's the million dollar question. We're in a state of flux, where Amendment 3 (which bans same sex marriage in Utah) is the law and is not the law.""

""We don't have a timetable on this,"" Bruckman said.

Retired Utah state representative Jackie Biskupski was at the Government Center officiating at weddings on Monday. ""I've done about ten today. The clerks are issuing about 45 licenses an hour and there are over 50 ministers in the building to marry people.""

She believes that gay couples who are legally married elsewhere but live in Utah ""need to get married in Utah to have that marriage recognized here.""

Some county clerks are refusing to issue licenses to same sex couples. Other have ""elected, for safety's sake, to not give out any marriage licenses at all until we know what we're required to do,"" said Bruckman.

Groups advocating for same sex marriage expressed pleasure at Shelby's ruling.

""We're thrilled that this decision continues the process of decisions across the country that support the right of gay and lesbian couples to get married and have their love and families protected equally under the law,"" said Brian Silva, executive director of Marriage Equality. The New York City-based group promotes the rights of gay and lesbian couples to marry.

The 53-page ruling said the constitutional amendment Utah voters approved in 2004 violates gay and lesbian couples' rights to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment. Shelby said the state failed to show that allowing same-sex marriages would affect opposite-sex marriages in any way.

The ruling has thrust Shelby into the national spotlight. He has been on the bench for less than two years, appointed by President Obama after GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch recommended him in November 2011.

Shelby served in the Utah Army National Guard from 1988 to 1996 and was a combat engineer in Operation Desert Storm. He graduated from the University of Virginia law school in 1998 and clerked for the U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene in Utah, then spent about 12 years in private practice before he became a judge.

Their questions reflected a unanimous craven impulse: How do we get out of this? This court is plenty bold imposing bad decisions on the country, like anointing W. president or allowing unlimited money to flow covertly into campaigns. But given a chance to make a bold decision putting them on the right, and popular, side of history, they squirm.

“Same-sex couples have every other right,” Chief Justice John Roberts said, sounding inane for a big brain. “It’s just about the label in this case.” He continued, “If you tell a child that somebody has to be their friend, I suppose you can force the child to say, ‘This is my friend,’ but it changes the definition of what it means to be a friend.”

Donald Verrilli Jr., the U.S. solicitor general arguing on the side of same-sex marriage, told the justices, “There is a cost to waiting.” He recalled that the argument by opponents of interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia in 1967 was to delay because “the social science is still uncertain about how biracial children will fare in this world.”

The wisdom of the Warren court is reflected two miles away, where a biracial child is faring pretty well in his second term in the Oval Office.

The American Academy of Pediatrics last week announced its support for same-sex marriage, citing evidence that children of gays and lesbians do better when the couples marry. It may take another case, even another court, to legitimize same-sex marriage nationally, but the country has moved on. An ABC/Washington Post poll showed that 81 percent of Americans under 30 approve of gay marriage. Every time you blink, another lawmaker comes out of the closet on supporting the issue."

(CNN) —

Today is the 46th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared unconstitutional any ban on interracial marriage. More than four decades after the historic and aptly named Loving decision, the U.S. Supreme Court is once again poised to rule in a case that could put an end to discriminatory bans prohibiting marriage, this time for gay and lesbian couples.

This month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in a decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case brought by two California couples challenging the constitutionality of the state’s ban on same sex marriages, commonly called Prop 8. Attorneys Ted Olson and David Boies – a Republican and Democrat best known for battling each other before the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore – have teamed up and taken the Perry case beyond California.

JUSTIN LAROSE/cnn Donna Brazile

Olson and Boies argued before the justices that the Supreme Court has the obligation under the Constitution to strike down not just Prop 8, but all state laws banning marriage equality for gay and lesbian Americans. After all, they say, this is precisely how the court ruled in Loving – and 13 other cases dating back to 1888 in which a majority of the justices stood up to protect the fundamental right of every American to marry the person he or she loves.

A broad ruling in the Perry case this month would be a historic step forward in affirming that gay Americans are entitled to the same rights and freedoms as everyone else. Although I firmly believe public opinion is irrelevant to the court’s responsibility to ensure equality under the law, our nation is clearly ready to embrace marriage equality.

When the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in 1967, a Gallup poll found that only 20% of Americans approved of such marriages. But the court fulfilled its duty to protect individual rights without regard to what was popular.

Today, we have already have evolved much further on marriage equality. A growing bipartisan majority of voters – 58% – support marriage rights for same-sex couples.

When Richard Loving told his lawyer to “tell the court I love my wife,” he could not have known that his words would still be applicable 46 years later in the very same courtroom. There is never a wrong time to stand up for justice and equality, but the time has never been more right to stand up for gay rights than in the Perry case.

As the Supreme Court weighs equality for gay and lesbian couples, the anniversary of Loving provides a timely reminder of a new legacy they could write for the history books.

“I believe America is at its best when we champion the freedom and dignity of every human being,’’ Mrs. Clinton said in a video posted Monday on the Internet by the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group. Her announcement comes as the Supreme Court is about to hear two landmark gay rights cases that advocates hope will make same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states.

Mrs. Clinton’s announcement represents a switch in position; as a presidential candidate in 2008, she explicitly opposed same-sex marriage, saying that she favored civil unions but that decisions about the legality of marriage should be left to the states. (Until last year, President Obama took that position as well; the president now favors a right to marriage for gay couples.) But Mrs. Clinton did take steps to protect gay couples when she was secretary of state, work that she said “inspired me to think anew” about the values she holds.

“L.G.B.T. Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones, and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship,’’ she said in the six-minute video, using the abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. “That includes marriage.’’

Mrs. Clinton spoke in the video of the recent wedding of her own daughter, Chelsea, saying, “I wish every parent that same joy.’’

Mrs. Clinton and her family have longstanding ties to the Human Rights Campaign. The group’s president, Chad Griffin, was born in Hope, Ark. – Bill Clinton’s hometown – and got his start in politics volunteering for Mr. Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. The former president and Chelsea Clinton expressed their support for same-sex marriage when it was under consideration in the New York State legislature.

And just last week, Mr. Clinton expressed his explicit support for overturning the federal Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law — which he signed — that requires the federal government to view marriage as between a man and a woman for legal purposes."

The ruling applies even to gay couples who live in states where their union is not recognized -- so long as they were married in a state that allows same-sex marriage.

""Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide."" said Secretary Jacob J. Lew in a statement. ""This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.""

The U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service announcement comes on the heels of the landmark Supreme Court ruling in June that said same-sex couples are entitled to federal benefits. The ruling struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that blocked federal recognition of gay marriage.

The ruling applies to filing status, personal and dependency exemptions, standard deduction, employee benefits, IRAs, earned income tax credits and child tax credits, according to the Treasury Department and IRS statement.

The ruling does not apply to those in registered domestic partnerships or civil unions.



Thirteen states and Washington, D.C., have legalized same-sex marriage as of August: California, Delaware, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, Minnesota and New Hampshire.

Several Native American tribes and some counties in New Mexico have also allowed marriage licenses to be issued.

Before Thursday's ruling, same-sex couples that had married had to declare themselves as ""unmarried"" on federal income tax forms. The Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights organization, said that cost the average same-sex couple more than $1,000 a year in additional taxes. It also meant that gay couples could not inherit property without it being taxed.

""No family should have to worry about losing important federal rights and benefits, simply because they live in a state that doesn't recognize them as equal under the law,"" Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement.

In the anti-marriage camp, Brian Brown, president of National Organization for Marriage, denounced the ruling in a statement.

""The Treasury Department is grossly overstepping its authority,"" Brown said. ""The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex marriage on an unwilling public."""

Now that the Supreme Court has struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, some of these issues will be wiped away. The ruling makes clear that married gay couples living in states that recognize their unions will immediately gain access to more than 1,000 federal benefits, like Social Security and family leave rights. Less certain is how couples living in the remaining 37 states will fare.

The murkiness exists because federal agencies generally defer to the states to determine a couple’s marital status. Some agencies look to the laws in the state in which a couple now live, for instance, while others look to those in the state in which the couple were married.

“Unless the administration changes its practices and rules — and in a couple of cases, unless the law changes — then couples residing in a nonmarriage-equality state may not be recognized for some federal programs,” said Brian Moulton, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign. “Now that we have an opinion out, we will be anxiously awaiting what the administration will say about this and urging them to ensure that all married couples, regardless of where they live, are fully recognized.”"

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']","In gay marriage cases, court must balance strong traditions","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard two powerful arguments last week about marriage for gay and lesbian couples, and the path the justices choose could determine not only whether gay marriage will become the law nationwide, but how soon.

One argument spoke to the principle of equal rights. Denying federal benefits to legally married gay couples “cannot be reconciled with our fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law,” the Obama administration’s top courtroom lawyer told the justices, as he urged the court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act.

The other argument spoke to the traditions of states’ rights and letting people, rather than the courts, decide the great social issues of the day. Debate over same-sex marriage is “roiling throughout this country,” said a lawyer defending the California ballot measure that barred gays from marrying. This process of “democratic debate” should continue, he said, rather than end with a sweeping court ruling that decides the law for the entire nation.

PHOTOS: Court considers same-sex marriage

How the court reconciles those two traditions could shape the future of the “marriage equality” debate.

If the justices were to strike down the marriage act in June, when they announce a decision, and declare that married gay couples deserve equal rights, it would set a ringing legal precedent that would almost surely lead to same-sex marriage in much of the nation. If it is a question of equal rights, how could states refuse to permit committed gay couples from marrying?

However, if the court were to decide the case by stressing that states decide who is married, the ruling would bolster those who favor a go-slow approach. If marriage is indeed a matter for the states, then conservative states can argue they are entitled to preserve laws limiting marriage to a man and a woman.

The arguments on Wednesday revealed the dilemma. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who probably holds the deciding vote, repeatedly said he was troubled by the federal law because it interferes with the “traditional authority of the states to regulate marriage.”

Nine states, concentrated in the Northeast, now allow gays and lesbians to marry, but the federal government refuses to recognize them as married. If the Supreme Court were to strike down this provision on the grounds that the states’ decision on marriage should prevail, it would be a victory for 130,000 legally married gay couples. It could also prove an obstacle for gay rights lawyers who say the state laws forbidding gay marriage are unconstitutional.

That’s why U.S. Solicitor Gen. Donald Verrilli Jr. and the liberal wing of the court insisted the issue was one of equal rights, not “federalism.”

The tenor of the two-day argument suggested that Kennedy and the most liberal justices wanted to move cautiously in favor of same-sex marriage. They seemed determined to put off for now a constitutional decision on whether gays have the right to marry across the nation.

“That would not be a surprise. It would be consistent with the court’s incremental approach to recognizing civil rights,” said Columbia University law professor Suzanne Goldberg, who watched the two days of arguments.

The court’s most famous civil rights ruling, the Brown vs. Board of Education decision of 1954, was a sweeping declaration that racial segregation is unconstitutional. But less known are the decisions that came before and after.

The court had handed down rulings from 1938 to 1950 that gave black students the right to enroll in previously all-white Southern universities. Those precedents paved the way for the Brown decision. Then, after insisting on desegregation of the schools, the justices waited until 1967 to strike down the remaining state laws that barred interracial marriages in the aptly named case of Loving vs. Virginia.

Gay rights advocates do not expect it will be decades before same-sex marriage is the law throughout the nation. And some had high hopes the court would declare a constitutional right to marry this year.

“There was some disappointment that the court was not further along,” Kate Kendell, a lawyer for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said after the argument. But she also heard much that was encouraging. “Not one justice made statements in any way vilifying of LGBT people,” she said.

She took special note of a comment from Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., a conservative who said he favored a cautious approach. In questioning the lawyers, he asked about a same-sex couple who are “just as loving and committed” as a heterosexual couple. Despite a disagreement on the law, Alito “talked about us in very human terms imbued with dignity,” Kendell said.

Last year’s struggle over the healthcare law showed the difficulty of reading too much into the oral argument. In March 2012, the justices debated whether the law’s requirement that everyone obtain health insurance could be upheld as regulation of interstate commerce. Most of the conservatives sounded skeptical. But by June, Chief Justice John G. Roberts had decided the requirement could be upheld and enforced as a tax penalty. The four liberal justices agreed.

In Wednesday’s argument, five justices sounded ready to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. They have until June to agree on a majority opinion.

Once they have decided that issue, the justices could turn their attention to the more tricky question of what to do with California’s Proposition 8, the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage. A federal judge in San Francisco and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled this state measure unconstitutional.

The oral argument on Tuesday made clear it was the court’s four most conservative justices who had voted to hear the Proposition 8 case. That decision is made behind closed doors, and the votes are not disclosed. But Kennedy and several of the liberal justices said it was a mistake for the court to have agreed to hear the appeal.

Advertisement

That suggested they would seek to dispose of the Proposition 8 case without ruling directly on whether gays have a constitutional right to marry. They could say the sponsors of the ballot measure do not have legal standing to appeal to the high court. They could dismiss the appeal as “improvidently granted.” Or they could hold the case until late June and send it back to California in light of the ruling in the Defense of Marriage case. All three options would lead to the restoring of gay marriage in California, but without a legal precedent that would affect the other states. It’s also possible but unlikely that Kennedy could join with the conservatives to uphold Proposition 8 on states’ rights grounds.

“Allow the democratic process to continue,” Paul D. Clement, the former solicitor general, told the justices in his closing comments. He was defending the marriage act on behalf of the House Republicans, and it appeared a five-vote majority would vote against him. But even if they do, the fight over gay marriage will likely continue.

""Sadly, in a culture infected with political correctness, people of faith are targeted for defending their beliefs with no consideration of their First Amendment rights. I will continue to stand with my fellow Texans in defending our God-given, constitutionally protected freedoms.""

Given the caliber of political mind Texas Republicans seem intent on foisting off onto the rest of us, non-Texans might be curious as to what sorts of people they've tapped for state government of late. The simple answer is ""more of the same,"" as the responses to an AP questionnaire on gay rights sent to GOP candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general revealed. Lt. Gov. Dewhurst sets the tone Yes, yes. Why are we even talking about civil rights for gay Americans when people of faith are the real victims here. It's getting so you can't even show your love for Jesus by calling someone names and beating them up anymore.

GOP gubbernatorial candidate Tom Pauken:



""Current statutes adequately address the issue of equality before the law and I would oppose laws that provide preferential treatments based on lifestyle choices.""

Unless that lifestyle choice is my own, in which case all the rules will be written to support that and only that.

Attorney general candidate Ken Paxton:



""I do not believe in elevating sexual 'rights' to be superior to religious freedom and freedom of conscience. Such rights are enumerated nowhere in the Texas or U.S. Constitution, unlike religious freedom ...

Again, the victimhood is palpable. You having your rights will automatically infringe on my right to believe you shouldn't have that, so you shouldn't have that. Each candidate seems to have set out to make the laziest, dullest argument possible as point of personal conservative pride.

We shall see if Texas demographics begin to reverse the tide of celebrated Republican dullardism that has turned state politicians into national laughingstocks. Republicans are highly devoted to making sure that doesn't happen, but I remain confident that at some point the party will elect someone to office who is so stone-cold stupid, such an obvious empty sack, such an impressive specimen of termite-riddled fencepost that the entire state shudders in embarrassment and begins to rethink their party lifestyle choice en masse. It would have to be someone meaner than Steve Stockman and dumber than Louie Gohmert and—well, I forget the third thing—but do not worry about that. Somewhere in Texas there is a very drunk and bitter man sleeping it off under a church pew who fits all those requirements and then some. Get to it, Republicans. Find that final mean, stupid, godbothering anti-science crank who can out-crook and under-whelm all the rest of them. It is your destiny.

By contrast, when same-sex couples decide to have children, “substantial advance planning is required,” said Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for House Republicans.

This unusual defense of traditional marriage was set out last week in a pair of opening legal briefs in the two gay marriage cases to be decided by the Supreme Court this spring.

Lawyers defending California’s Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act want the high court to decide it is reasonable for the law to recognize only marriages between opposite-sex couples.

Conservative attorneys did not argue that gays or lesbians engaged in “immoral” behavior or lifestyles. Instead they emphasized what they called the “very real threat” to society posed by opposite-sex couples when they are not bound by the strictures of marriage.

The traditional marriage laws “reflect a unique social difficulty with opposite-sex couples that is not present with same-sex couples — namely, the undeniable and distinct tendency of opposite-sex relationships to produce unplanned and unintended pregnancies,” wrote Clement, a solicitor general under President George W. Bush. “Unintended children produced by opposite-sex relationships and raised out-of-wedlock would pose a burden on society.”

“It is plainly reasonable for California to maintain a unique institution [referring to marriage] to address the unique challenges posed by the unique procreative potential of sexual relationships between men and women,” argued Washington attorney Charles J. Cooper, representing the defenders of Proposition 8. Same-sex couples need not be included in the definition of marriage, he said, because they “don’t present a threat of irresponsible procreation.”

In one case from New York, the court will decide whether the federal government may deny equal benefits, such as filing a joint tax return, to legally married gay couples. U.S. appeals courts in Boston and New York struck down this part of the Defense of Marriage Act on the grounds it denied gay couples the equal protection of the laws. The Obama administration chose not to defend this provision, so the House Republicans hired Clement to argue in defense of the law.

In the California case, the court will decide on the voter initiative in 2008 that limited marriage to a man and a woman. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals voided this measure on the grounds it took away from gays and lesbians the right to marry, which they had won before state judges.

In the lower courts, defenders of the traditional laws struggled to explain why committed couples of the same sex should be denied the benefits of marriage. The plaintiffs include same-sex couples who are raising children.

Clement and Cooper do not address that issue directly. Instead, they argue that it is reasonable for the law to steer opposite-sex couples toward marriage, including by giving them extra benefits. “It was rational for Congress to draw the line where it did,” Clement said, “because the institution of marriage arose in large measure in response to the unique social difficulty that opposite-sex couples, but not same-sex couples, posed.”

In another part of their brief, they argue for the high court to stand back and to let the “democratic process” resolve the dispute over gay marriage. Both note that voters in several states recently approved same-sex marriage, and opinion polls report that most Americans now favor it.

Clement said gays and lesbians are hardly a politically powerless minority subjected to discrimination and in need of protection from the courts. “Gays and lesbians are one of the most influential, best-connected, best-funded and best-organized interest groups in modern politics, and have attained more legislative victories, political power and popular favor in less time than virtually any other group in American history,” he wrote.

Congress has repealed the ban on gays serving openly in the military, and it might repeal the Defense of Marriage Act too, Clement said. And Cooper noted that California voters could put a measure on the next ballot and repeal Proposition 8.

Next month, gay rights advocates will file their arguments in favor of striking down the two laws. The court will hear arguments in the cases on March 26 and 27.

Not so for the sovereign Navajo Nation, whose borders spill over into the northeast part of the state and where tribal law is clear: Such unions are banned.

Some Navajo hope to change that, buoyed by the cultural climate shift underscored when the U.S. Supreme Court in June struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Gay marriage is permitted in the District of Columbia and 18 states, the most recent being Utah, although officials there plan to appeal a federal court decision that overturned the state’s ban on same-sex marriage.

For Navajo activists, it won’t be easy.

The Diné Marriage Act, passed in 2005 by the Navajo Nation Council, defines marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman and declares polygamy, unions between family members and same-sex marriages “void and prohibited.”

A grass-roots attempt to block it from becoming law failed when the legislature overrode a veto from the Navajo Nation’s then-president, Joe Shirley Jr.

“The Diné Marriage Act legislation is unnecessary and addresses issues already governed by existing law and by cultural values and our clan system,” Shirley said in a statement posted on the website for the advocacy group Coalition for Navajo Equality, which seeks to repeal the law.

Recently, Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly, who took office in 2011, also backed the effort to allow same-sex marriage. “We’ve got some catching up here to do with our laws, our codes and what we operate our government under,” he said in a statement.

Shelly, who served as Shirley’s vice president from 2007 to 2011, was among 14 council members in 2005 who voted against the override, short of what was needed. Sixty-two voted for the override and 12 delegates abstained.

Despite the high-level support, “only an action by the Navajo Nation Council to repeal the act would change the law,” Jared Touchin, a council spokesman, said in an email. “There is currently no such legislation that attempts to do so.”

While the law states that “the purposes of marriage on the Navajo Nation are to promote strong families and to preserve and strengthen family values,” some Navajo activists say it does the opposite.

“It goes against our tribe’s fundamental teaching of harmony in family,” said Alray Nelson, 27, an openly gay member of the Navajo Nation and part of the Coalition for Navajo Equality. “It’s hard to understand why we implemented something like this because it goes against everything we are founded upon.”

Nelson nonetheless said he was undaunted by the failed effort in 2005 because persuading the council president to veto the measure is still seen as one of the coalition’s biggest accomplishments.

“It was not popular in 2005 to support same-sex marriage,” he said, “so the political climate was already set against the coalition efforts. The coalition basically took a long nap until this year, after the Supreme Court decisions.”

The Supreme Court, in striking down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, declared that same-sex couples who were legally married had the same right to federal benefits as other married couples. The court also upheld a lower court’s invalidation of California’s Proposition 8, clearing the way for same-sex marriage to resume in the state.

Justices did not, however, require states to legalize gay marriage. Even if they had, tribes would almost certainly be exempt from the ruling because of their sovereignty.

“Moving forward, our first goal will be to repeal the act by going through the courts like they did in New Mexico,” Nelson said. “Second, we will continue to have these conversations with family members and community leaders. We are not going directly to lawmakers. We are going to the people who put them into office.”

Some tribes permit same-sex marriage. In 2008, the Coquille Indian Tribe in Oregon became the first in the U.S. to approve a gay marriage law that states “marriage” or “domestic partnership” means a “formal and express civil contract entered into between two persons, regardless of their sex.” Seven others have followed suit, including the Santa Ysabel tribe in San Diego County.

Elizabeth Kronk Warner, director of the Tribal Law & Government Center at the University of Kansas School of Law, said her research showed that tribes historically accepted same-sex unions.

“In many of our tribal cultures, we called gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender members as ‘two spirits,’ because there was a belief that they had two spirits captured within themselves,” she said. “They were treated specially and with a lot of respect.”

Now, there is a struggle between the two-spirit concept and the newer but strong Christian influence, she said.

“I think the national trend is definitely in favor of recognizing same-sex marriage,” said Kronk Warner, a member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. “There are already several tribes who recognize same-sex marriages despite state law. ... It’s as complicated an issue among tribes as it is in individual states.”

Touchin, the council spokesman, said there was room for debate on the Navajo law.

“The increased attention placed on gay marriage over the last few years certainly has the potential to make people, including the Navajo Nation’s lawmakers, rethink the issue,” he said. “However, most would agree that the Navajo Nation has taken a conservative approach to gay marriage. … Therefore, until legislation is introduced to address the Diné Marriage Act, we cannot be certain.”

Nelson, however, is confident that change is on the horizon.

“By around this time next year, if the law is repealed ... that’s when we can be proud as a Navajo people.”

No, DOMA was the demon seed of a hate group.","Back in 1995, a group of individuals, including Don Wildmon, met in Memphis, Tennessee, because of what had happened in Hawaii where the court imposed same-sex marriage. Of course the folks there pushed back in the state of Hawaii. But then there was a concern that this could happen across the country. And so a group of leaders met in Memphis, Tennessee, and talked about the need to solidify marriage and by preventing states from imposing definition of marriage on the states. So the concept of the Defense of Marriage Act—wasn't called that at the time—originated, and actually we took it back to our policy shop at FRC and formulated the policy and actually gave it the name Defense of Marriage Act.

If you are a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or just believe that homosexuality is wrong, and the law gives homosexuality protected status, then your personal beliefs are now outside civil law. The entire civil rights apparatus can be brought against you. Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal sanction; schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital love.

Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan showed Wednesday that in 1996, the House passed the Defense of Marriage Act not to gently respect tradition but ""to express moral disapproval of homosexuality."" Paul Clement, the law's defender in court, tried to claim that's not so, but the more you look at the origins of DOMA, the more you realize that there is no way a law conceived so directly out of hatred can represent anything but hatred. DOMA didn't originate in the House, GLAAD reminds us. Rather, it came out of a coalition of hard-right groups like the Family Research Council, and from there to Congress. Current FRC head Tony Perkins explains:The rollout of DOMA included Peter LaBarbera , who likes to talk about ""homo-fascism"" and has said ""We need to stop conceding the moral high ground in a fearful bid to appear 'tolerant,'"" and Robert Knight , who just this week wrote that ""the left’s drive for 'gay rights' poses the greatest domestic threat to the freedoms of religion, speech and assembly."" It included a C-SPAN-televised FRC briefing for Capitol Hill staff at which Knight claimed that:At the same briefing, another ""expert"" argued that ""Every argument for gay marriage is an argument that would support polygamy."" That same person argued, on another occasion, that the Supreme Court's Romer v. Evans decision that states can't ban anti-discrimination laws was a terrible, terrible thing because making it illegal to discriminate against gay people is in effect discriminating against bigots (or, as he put it, religious people).

This was the origination and the push for DOMA. There is no way to disguise it as anything but hate. And there is no way to seriously claim that in the not quite 17 years since the law's passage it has miraculously transmuted from hate to ... whatever Paul Clement is now claiming with his repeated invocations of the law as ""rational."""

The Supreme Court has yet to announce its decision on the two gay marriage cases. However, that has not stopped conservatives from pledging to defy marriage equality, if the high court makes a pro-LGBT decision.

In a letter released Thursday, more than 200 conservative activists -- ranging from the Catholic League’s Bill Donohue to Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kern (R) -- vowed to ignore any ruling in favor of same-sex couples. The group of endorsers, signing under the moniker of Freedom Federation, is composed of anti-LGBT Christian conservatives, many of whom have fallen from prominence in recent years.

""We stand together as Christians in defense of marriage and the family and society founded upon them,"" the letter reads.

Liberty Counsel head Mat Staver and Deacon Keith Fournier, the editor-in-chief of Catholic Online, drafted the ""Marriage Solidarity Statement"" that attacks marriage equality by invoking ""Natural Moral Law"" and questioning the authority of the Supreme Court.

""This Natural Moral Law gives us the norms we need to build truly human and humane societies and govern ourselves. It should also inform our positive law or we will become lawless and devolve into anarchy,"" the statement warns. ""Redefining the very institution of marriage is improper and outside the authority of the State. The Supreme Court has no authority to redefine marriage.""

While the letter ends with a vague threat that the signers must draw a line on the definition of marriage and will not cross it, the statement does not specify what the Freedom Federation intends to do if the Supreme Court rules in favor of marriage equality.

Raw Story makes a good point, writing: ""What, exactly, they intend to do is unclear, since their churches presumably do not perform same sex unions, and because they themselves do not work in the wedding business or grant marriage licenses.""

The Supreme Court is expected to release its decision on the two marriage equality cases, Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor, sometime next week. The former questions whether California's Proposition 8 violated the constitution, while the later challenges the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage.

Though an online HuffPost/YouGov survey conducted earlier this month indicated that Americans are sharply divided on whether the court should overturn DOMA, another poll released by Pew Research revealed that 72 percent of Americans say the recognition of same-sex marriage is ""inevitable.""

A majority of Supreme Court justices expressed concern Wednesday about a federal law that bars same sex marriage, signaling the nation's highest court may be poised to extend a potentially historic victory to the gay rights movement.

Hearing arguments in the second of two major gay marriage cases over two days, the probing questions from both wings of the court suggest the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars the federal government from recognizing same sex marriage in states where it is legal, could be struck down. Such a decision would be breakthrough for supporters of same sex nuptials, who until now have measured progress at a state by state level.

But the fundamental question of whether gay couples can marry in the U.S. will most likely not be settled by the court this time. Striking down DOMA would likely benefit only married same sex couples in the nine states (and the District of Columbia) where their marriages are legal. And a day earlier, justices hinted they might toss a challenge to Prop 8, a California law banning gay marriage, on procedural grounds.

Justices across the spectrum Wednesday seemed troubled by DOMA, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996. Clinton has since announced his opposition to the law.

The court's conservative leaning justices asked pointed questions about whether the law was anti-federalist, since it intrudes into states' traditional right to regulate marriage. The more liberal justices seemed amenable to the argument that DOMA discriminates against gay people and was passed with the clear intention of excluding an unpopular group.

Justices could strike down the law in a narrow way that would force the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages only in states where it's already allowed. There's a chance the court could rule more broadly, making dozens of state gay marriage bans legally vulnerable. Such an expansive ruling from the court is considered much less likely.

Story continues

The Justice Department would typically defend a federal law being challenged in the Supreme Court, but he Obama administration has declined to do so because it believes it is unconstitutional. Paul Clement, an attorney chosen by House Republicans who support DOMA, defended it instead.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative-leaning swing vote who has written two landmark opinions affirming gay rights, seemed unconvinced by the argument advanced by Clement that DOMA defines marriage as only between opposite-sex couples to avoid confusion. Clement said that the federal government has an interest in ""uniformity,"" and had passed the law to avoid having to treat same-sex couples differently based on whether they live in states that allow gay marriage or not.

Kennedy pointed out that DOMA excludes married same-sex couples in more than 1,100 federal statutes and laws, which has a substantial impact on the ""day to day life"" of those couples and their children. He said the law does not provide uniformity because it affects ""only one aspect of marriage.""

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said excluding married gay couples from sick leave, tax benefits, Social Security survivor benefits, and hundreds of other federal benefits and obligations, relegates same-sex couples to a ""skim milk marriage"" that is substantially worse than what heterosexual couples are allowed.

Justice Elena Kagan suggested that the law was not passed for uniformity's sake, but to discriminate. She read aloud from the House report on the law when it passed 17 years ago saying it expressed ""moral disapproval of homosexuality.""

Chief Justice John Roberts objected to the argument that Congress passed DOMA based on a dislike or hatred for gays and lesbians. He asked Attorney General Donald Verrilli, representing the Obama administration, whether he believed the 84 senators who voted for it at the time were all motivated by animus. Verrilli said the lawmakers could have voted for DOMA due to a ""lack of careful reflection,"" but that the law discriminates no matter why it was passed.

Roberts also objected to Attorney Roberta Kaplan's characterization of gay people as a disadvantaged minority group lacking political power.

""As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your case,"" Roberts said.

But Roberts did seem concerned by the federalist argument. He, Kennedy and Justice Samuel Alito posed tough questions about whether the federal government was overreaching with the statute. Kennedy said DOMA did not seem to recognize states's ""historical"" responsibility for marriage and suggested the central question of the case is whether the federal government has the authority to regulate marriage.

Both attorneys arguing to strike down DOMA refused to make a federalist argument against the law, however -- instead insisting it was a discrimination case.

Before even getting to the merits of the case, the justices spent nearly an hour grappling with whether they should decide it at all because of procedural issues.They appointed Harvard professor Vicki Jackson to make the case that House Republicans do not have the legal right, or standing, to appeal the lower court's decision.

Several justices were also critical of the Obama administration's decision to stop defending the law in court while still enforcing it. Roberts appeared to have serious doubts about the case's procedural issues, repeatedly saying that it is ""unprecedented"" for the U.S. government to appeal a case even when the parties agreed with a lower court's ruling.

The two gay marriage cases before the court this term have been dogged by procedural concerns, as both were left orphaned by public officials who no longer wanted to defend them.

On Tuesday, Kennedy wondered whether the court should have agreed to hear the Proposition 8 case at all. Other justices suggested they were skeptical that supporters of Proposition 8 had standing to appeal the case once California officials decided to drop it.

It's possible that neither case could end with a decision. In DOMA, that means the lower court's decision would stand and DOMA would be illegal in the Third Circuit. The plaintiff, Edith Windsor, would be repaid the $360,000 she had to pay in estate taxes when her wife died because the government didn't recognize her marriage in New York, where gay marriage is legal. In the Proposition 8 case, gay marriage would most likely become legal in California if the justices throw it out on standing or do not reach a majority."

A majority of the group of 30 or so sign-holders were in their 50s and much older -- and they called themselves Catholics.

Linda Karle-Nelson, 72, and her husband Tom Nelson, 83, organized Thursday's event in response to recent remarks made by Detroit Archbishop Allen H. Vigneron asserting that those who support gay marriage and take Communion are contradicting themselves.

""This sort of behavior would result in publicly renouncing one's integrity and logically bring shame for a double-dealing that is not unlike perjury,"" Vigneron said last month. The archbishop thinks gay marriage supporters should, instead, abstain from receiving the sacrament of the Eucharist.

But Nelson and his wife couldn't reconcile Vigneron's statements with their own understanding of their faith, nor with their experience as parents of gay children.

""The trauma that exists in families today over this issue is virtually unrecognized, except by folks like us,"" Nelson said. ""When we hear rhetoric from the church that demeans our children, we just can't be silent.""

The Archdiocese of Detroit declined to comment on the protest earlier on Thursday.

Nelson and Karle-Nelson are members of the national organization Fortunate Families, a group that represents Catholics with LGBT children and sponsored Thursday's event. They were both widowed and had fully grown children from those previous marriages before they wed six years ago.

Nelson recalled ""pontificating religious doctrine"" in his household when his kids were younger. His view of the church changed when he learned that his gay son attempted suicide while he was in college.

""That was the beginning of my journey and completely changed my attitude,"" Nelson said. ""His struggles, what he was going through -- he was so closeted, he kept it so veiled. I had no clue.""

""The greatest blessing of my life was having a gay son, because of what it's taught me,"" he added.

Nelson's son continued to worship as a practicing Catholic after coming out, until the LGBTQ Catholic group he practiced with was asked to leave the church they attended. He, and four of his five siblings, have since left the church.

Karle-Nelson's son, who is also gay, had a different experience. He left the church shortly after he left home to attend college. But several years ago, he returned to services when he found a Jesuit parish that was welcoming and diverse.

""It shows you that where there is acceptance and a welcoming [environment], people flower,"" Karle-Nelson said.

Mary Ellen Lopata, who is the co-founder and on the board of directors of Fortunate Families, said it's a ""sad situation"" that many children have left the Catholic church over its lack of acceptance of gays and lesbians.

""We encourage people to speak up, because the bishops don't know our children and they need to hear our children, and understand that our children are every bit as whole and holy,"" Lopata said.

Fortunate Families is part of Equally Blessed, a coalition of groups that support full equality in the church and society for LGBT people. The organization does not have local chapters, instead representing constituents from its base in Rochester, N.Y., and supporting actions like the Nelsons' and drawing attention to injustices within the church.

""We're starting to see tiny glimmers of hope that pastors and members of the hierarchy might be willing to talk,"" Lopata said. ""We do believe that if they would just talk to us and talk to children and listen to what they would have to say, their hearts would be changed.""

Nelson and Karle-Nelson attend St. Alexanders Parish in Farmington Hills, a suburb of Detroit. ""I think ... many of the clergy [there] are sympathetic to our cause,"" Nelson said. ""But because of the leadership and the Archdiocese, they have to fly under the radar and be careful how they respond to issues like this.""

""There have been many instances in the history of the church where they have made statements [that they withdrew],"" Nelson said, rattling off a list that included child labor laws, women's suffrage and democracy. ""It took them 400 years to apologize to Galileo,"" he noted.

""But guess what? They changed,"" he said. ""They will change on this too, but it will take a long time."""

It is the same unit (3) recognized by the laws of nature, the (4) laws of government, and (5) civilized societies for thousands of years: (6) one man, married to one woman, with so many children as God should see fit to entrust to their care through birth or adoption.

If that happens, the high priests and priestesses of political correctness will have done irreparable harm to yet another pillar of the American paradigm for our patriotic, wholesome culture — “God, the flag, mom and apple pie.”

The Obama administration makes the incredible assertion that motherhood is superfluous to rebut an argument that the traditional two-parent family, led by both a mother and a father, provides the ideal situation to raise a child. In defiance of biology, nature and common sense, the administration argues that children need neither a father nor a mother and that having two fathers or two mothers or more is just as good as having one of each.

Government, both federal and state, has a legitimate and defensible interest in ensuring that children conceived by a mother and father are, in fact, raised by their biological mothers and fathers whenever possible.

(1) Says you. (2) Except the ""multiple wives"" ones. (3) There is no ""marriage"" at all in the ""laws of nature"", and you have no earthly clue what the ""laws of nature"" even might be, and ""family"" in nature is the result of anything from pair bonding to harems to gang rape to ritual murder to situational hermaphroditism to the male of the species biting the female upon which his body is slowly dissolved and absorbed into the female until only only the testicles are left, so shut up about what the supposed laws of nature say we should be doing to get ourselves in a family way and (4) see (2), and (5) see (2) and (4) and a whole mess of civilized societies who thought having a young boy on the side was the purest form of love there could be and (6) I'm just going to point out, yet a-freaking-gain, that the whole concept of ""marriage"" has been for nearly all of human history a question of property rights, and the spouse counted as a useful but not necessarily decisive portion of the property. I now have an absolute hatred for the sack that is Tim Huelskamp because he managed to hork up nearly every self-centered, pompous-assed non-argument used by outright morons in the span of one quick paragraph, and there really ought to be a rule saying if you do that the general citizenrygets to put you in the official congressional Dunk Tank and start flinging balls until somebody gets lucky.God damn it, here we have a person honestly using ""God, the flag, mom and apple pie"" as the pillars of ""the American paradigm,"" and they're not doing it ironically, neither the ""apple pie"" or the ""paradigm"" part. No, Tim here means it literally, and goes on to say that Bloomberg's soda ban and Michelle Obama's gentle-but-possibly-Hitlerish suggestions that our nation's kids get up off their fat asses every once in a while means that apple pie is under attack. This screed isn't an April Fool's prank, this is a April Fool's way of life, preached about by an April Fool's mind, taken as a holy god damn April Fool's sacrament.You are an idiot, and nobody's arguing anything about that, and by the way you are an idiot. Do you think—and we're just going to explore this for one second, before my migraine ends this entire path of debate—that if we do not allow same-sex marriage, those children are suddenly going to get a mom and a dad? That there are gay couples out there who, if we deny same-sex marriage, will say, ""Oh, rats, well, I guess I am now going to form a lifelong partnership with the opposite gender, which will suck for me but now my hypothetical future child will at least have appropriate biological nurturing."" No. This does not happen. I hate you for thinking that this will somehow happen—that the only thing standing between every child and the one-man, one-woman parenting that a great many of them do not currently have is to deny gay Americans certain legal and tax structurings.You, Tim Huelskamp, are a monster. Here you say that children should be raised by their biological mothers and fathers, and yet you say yourself that you've adopted four of them. You are a terrible person. Those children will never know the love of a genetically related male/female pairing placed in that prime nurturing role, and I can only assume it's because you, you bastard, adopted them rather than letting them rot in an orphanage or on the streets where they could get a better appreciation of why it is they would want that thing.

I don't even want to go through all of Huelskamp's drivel; it's all just a collection of other people's most vapid thoughts, dumbed down, beaten up, then put in The Sack and tossed into op-ed form. It hurts. But the main argument, such as it is, is that if we let gay marriage take place then gay people are going to somehow god damn take our god damn children and raise them in god damn non-preferentially-biological households because god damn magic, and it would be better to not allow marriage equality at all than allow that. He's not even talking about ""gay Americans should not adopt children"", which would be at least something vaguely approaching the point he roughly purports to be orbiting around, he's saying that the Supreme Court recognizing same-sex relationships as existing things at all is an affront to ""motherhood"" and ""God"" and, sweet Jeebus, ""apple pie.""

This. This is why I have come to thoroughly despise this entire debate. Because it is not earnest, it is not thoughtful, it is not anything but the tin-eared rantings of bigoted, dull-minded twerps who know they don't like same sex marriages being recognized, but can't rustle up so much as even the slightest actual, substantive non-God-says-so argument against the thing. God does not care what the tax status of same-sex couples is, nor do I expect the big guy on the cloud has a pressing interest in making sure a pair of people can't get hospital visitation or other legal rights if they don't have the proper combination of non-matching genitalia. Even if we were to all stipulate that a one-mom-one-dad family is better for the children than a one-mom or one-dad single-parent version in all cases, full stop, which itself is an implausible argument, you had at least better occupy yourself with explaining why you think a two-dad version has to be inferior to a single father, or a two-mom version worse than the single mom version, and not this damn generic high fructose corn syrup of arguments, this blanket assertion that if we somehow discriminate more it will result in unspecified magic in which we don't have single parents or foster homes or divorce or cheating spouses or broken homes or abusive parents or one bad traffic accident or teenage moms or Those Damn People Who Think Different From Me anymore.

This is what happens when the last blowhards in an argument know they have lost. This is what happens when all sensible people have, at long last, moved on, leaving only the dim bulbs and the lard-for-brains and the burlap sacks of discount-grade asbestos to prop up the dying cause. You get people like this guy, droning on with mealy-mouthed phrases that mean nothing, mustered for an argument that doesn't even make any internal sense, mustered because the only people left on the loser's side of the debate are people who do not give a damn whether their arguments make any sense, and all regurgitated up by whatever die-hard friendly rag has not yet evolved sufficient shame to know how silly it all looks.

Her public endorsement comes as the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments this week on challenges to Proposition 8, the voter-approved same-sex marriage ban in California, as well as the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman.

Republican Sen. Rob Portman also reversed his stance on the issue and announced his support earlier this month, citing his gay son as a big reason for his change of heart. Last week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also publicly backed the issue.

And in February, a chorus of prominent Republicans, including former GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, signed onto an amicus brief that advocated for the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage.

McCaskill, who was recently sworn into a second term and is not up for re-election until 2018, says her views have ""changed over time""

""As many of my gay and lesbian friends, colleagues and staff embrace long term committed relationships, I find myself unable to look them in the eye without honestly confronting this uncomfortable inequality,"" she wrote, adding that her decision is ""simply the right thing to do.""

McCaskill was considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in 2012 but survived re-election after her Republican opponent, Rep. Todd Akin, made controversial comments about rape.

The senator, in posting her announcement, also cited a Bible verse: I Corinthians 13, which says ""And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.""

""Good people disagree with me,"" she wrote. ""On the other hand, my children have a hard time understanding why this is even controversial. I think history will agree with my children.""

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-nears-historic-vote-gay-rights-bill-080458695--election.html,,[],Senate nears historic vote on gay rights bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate pushed toward a historic vote on legislation outlawing workplace discrimination against gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, demonstrating the nation's quickly evolving attitude toward gay rights nearly two decades after Congress rejected same-sex marriage.

All 55 members of the Democratic majority, including senators from the Deep South, and several Republicans were expected to unite on Thursday in backing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Sen. John McCain, the GOP's presidential nominee in 2008, signaled his conditional support on Wednesday.

""It is time for Congress to pass a federal law that ensures all our citizens - regardless of where they live - can go to work unafraid to be who they are,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who urged House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to reconsider his opposition.

The enthusiasm of the bill's supporters was tempered by the reality that the Republican-led House, where conservatives have a firm grip on the agenda, is unlikely to even vote on the legislation. Boehner maintains his longstanding opposition to the measure, arguing that it is unnecessary and certain to create costly, frivolous lawsuits for businesses. Outside conservative groups have cast the bill as anti-family.

In the Senate, opponents of the legislation remained mute through three days of debate, with no lawmaker speaking out. That changed on Thursday as Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana said the legislation would force employers to violate their religious beliefs, a direct counter to rights embodied in the Constitution.

""There's two types of discrimination here we're dealing with, and one of those goes to the very fundamental right granted to every American through our Constitution, a cherished value of freedom of expression and religion,"" Coats said.

The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that would have expanded the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption. Opponents argued that it would undermine the core bill.

Story continues

Senate passage would be a major victory for gay rights advocates in a momentous year for the issue. The Supreme Court in June affirmed gay marriage and granted federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. In the heartland, Illinois is on the verge of becoming the 15th state to legalize gay marriage, along with the District of Columbia.

""I hope that we are on the verge of making history tomorrow by passing this bill with a strong vote,"" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Wednesday. ""I then hope that our colleagues on the House side will follow suit and that we can see this bill signed into law.""

If the House fails to act on the bill, gay rights advocates are likely to press President Barack Obama to act unilaterally and issue an executive order barring anti-gay workplace discrimination by federal contractors.

Through three days of Senate debate, backers of the bill repeatedly described it as an issue of fairness some 50 years after Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act.

""It is well past time that we, as elected representatives, ensure that our laws protect against discrimination in the workplace for all individuals, that we ensure ... some protections for those within the LGBT community,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who described the diversity in her state.

Murkowski's support underscored the generational shift. Seventeen years ago, when a bill dealing with discrimination based on sexual orientation failed by one vote in the Senate, the senator's father, Frank, voted against it. That was the same year that Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act.

Current federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race and national origin. But it doesn't stop an employer from firing or refusing to hire workers because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.

The bill would bar employers with 15 or more workers from using a person's sexual orientation or gender identity as the basis for making employment decisions, including hiring, firing, compensation or promotion. It would exempt religious institutions and the military.

By voice vote Wednesday, the Senate approved an amendment from Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire that would prevent federal, state and local governments from retaliating against religious groups that are exempt from the law.

The Senate planned to vote Thursday on an amendment by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., to expand the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption.

Likely Senate approval of the overall bill reflects the nation's growing tolerance of gays and the GOP's political calculation as it looks for supporters beyond its core base of older voters. A Pew Research survey in June found that more Americans said homosexuality should be accepted rather than discouraged by society by a margin of 60 percent to 31 percent. Opinions were more evenly divided 10 years ago.

Deep-pocketed Republican-leaning groups such as the American Unity Fund, which counts on hedge fund billionaires and Mitt Romney donors as well as former Republican lawmakers, pushed for the legislation.

Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have approved laws banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and 17 of those also prohibit employers from discriminating based on gender identity.

About 88 percent of Fortune 500 companies have adopted nondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation, according to the Human Rights Campaign. About 57 percent of those companies include gender identity."

The Presidential Inauguration Committee announced Tuesday that the President Obama has selected Pastor Louie Giglio of the Georgia-based Passion City Church to deliver the benediction for his second inauguration. In a mid-1990s sermon identified as Giglio’s, available online on a Christian training Web site, he preached rabidly anti-LGBT views. The 54-minute sermon, entitled “In Search of a Standard – Christian Response to Homosexuality,” advocates for dangerous “ex-gay” therapy for gay and lesbian people, references a biblical passage often interpreted to require gay people be executed, and impels Christians to “firmly respond to the aggressive agenda” and prevent the “homosexual lifestyle”

I can tell you that one of the most hurtful parts of the first Obama administration was asking to have Rick Warren speak at his inaugural. He was giving a platform to someone who spread hate, when there were so many other choices there. It was greatly resented by many in the LGBT community. In fact, it set off a chain of events (Rev. Robinson ""accidentally"" not being shown on live TV etc.) which got Obama off on very bad footing with many in the LGBT community.

Following McClurkin, I was very angry with Obama. Then came Warren. But apparently Obama/the inaugural team haven't learned anything:

From above Alternet piece:



(17:37) Men, women, I can’t say anything other to you tonight than this, that if you look at the counsel of the word of God, Old Testament, New Testament, you come quickly to the conclusion that homosexuality is not an alternate lifestyle… homosexuality is not just a sexual preference homosexuality is not gay, but homosexuality is sin. It is sin in the eyes of God, and it is sin according to the word of God. You come to only one conclusion: homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation. It is less than God’s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us, is sin. That’s God’s voice. If you want to hear God’s voice, that is his voice to this issue of homosexuality. It is not ambiguous and unclear. It is very clear.

There are numerous other very incendiary quotes.

So let me address the naysayers now:

- But Obama has done so much for LGBT rights, it's just a speaker at the Inauguration

Um, first, if you are trying to make improving LGBT rights a cornerstone of your presidency, you don't have to spit in the eye of the people you are supposedly trying to help. This is a PERSONAL choice. Hagel I can somewhat justify because there are other plusses to his candidacy. This is Obama picking yet another bigot when there could be much better choices out there who were/are not so vehemently anti-gay

Also, when will he get past this bullshit of making in-roads with these people? These people will always vote against him and his agenda. Why give the marquee moment to a hater

- But, but he said those things long ago

Yeah, and those are the seeds of hatred which were sown in the very people today who support discrimination against LGBT people.

Also, if Shirley Sherrod is up for scrutiny for what she didn't even say, Hagel for his homophobic remarks, they why should this guy not be held accountable, as would anything with a history of anti-African American, anti-woman, anti-Hispanic, anti- remarks. Yeah, the times are changing and its time for the haters and the Vichy apologists to be held accountable for hating when it was a much bigger trend.

And for what it's worth, I am against Hagel ALSO for this reason. As Maddow pointed out, there will be many, many issues involving LGBT people in the military coming up. So he should answer for his bigotry then. Yet another reason why he is a bad choice.

- But, but, Obama has a GAY CUBAN poet speaking

And this argument pisses me off most of all. In Obama and Co's mind, if you put up a minority group, that cancels out, makes ok having the hater up there. No, it doesn't. You don't have a ""mixed program"" by putting up people who have advanced society, like Ms. Evers and those who have held it back. Once again, we'll likely have an inauguration with the usual symbolic winks and nods to the LGBT community while the hater gets a front row seat.

Starting off Obama II in a sucky way, like he started off Obama I. Except he can't blame Boehner for this one. A fucking huge disappointment."

Ken Bencomo, 45, of Rancho Cucamonga, was fired from his teaching position at the Catholic girls school after photos of his wedding to partner Christopher Persky, 32, were published in a local newspaper last month.

They were among the first couples to be married at the San Bernardino County assessor–recorder’s office after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing gay couples to marry in California.

Bencomo had worked at St. Lucy’s for 17 years and school administrators knew of his sexual orientation for most of that time, his attorney, Patrick McGarrigle, said.

Former students said Bencomo was a popular teacher who was a mentor and involved in many school activities. They demonstrated in front of the school Thursday morning to show their support and demand he be rehired.

“Come with powerful voices, ready to sing our Alma Mater and show the SL administration — ‘We Are That Change!’” the group’s Facebook page said.

An online petition to reinstate Bencomo has gathered more than 49,000 signatures.

Brittany Littleton, a 2008 graduate who created the petition, said Bencomo’s firing was a shock.

“He never made it part of the discussion and he never pushed his personal life on us,” she said. “But we knew, the school knew, teachers knew — it was never a problem.”

In a statement released through an attorney earlier this month, the school said it is “a community of faith for those who wish to express, practice and adhere to values in education based on the Roman Catholic tradition.”

“While the school does not discriminate against teachers or other school employees based on their private lifestyle choices, public displays of behavior that are directly contrary to church teachings are inconsistent with these values,” the statement reads. “These values are incorporated into the contractual obligations of each of our instructors and other employees.”

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Gay marriage ruling: Supreme Court finds DOMA unconstitutional,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court struck down a key part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act on Wednesday and declared that same-sex couples who are legally married deserve equal rights to the benefits under federal law that go to all other married couples.

The decision is a landmark win for the gay rights movement. It voids a section of the law known as DOMA, which was adopted with bipartisan support in Congress in 1996 to deny all benefits and recognition to same-sex couples.

At that time, no state permitted gays and lesbians to marry. Now, 12 states and the District of Columbia authorize same-sex marriages.

FULL COVERAGE: Prop. 8 and DOMA

Justice Anthony Kennedy, speaking for the 5-4 majority, said DOMA was unconstitutional because it violated the right to liberty and to equal protection for gay couples.

“By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute” violates the Constitution, he said

Dissenting were Justices John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.

The ruling means that more than 100,000 gay and lesbian couples who are legally married will be able to take advantage of tax breaks, pension rights and other benefits that are available to other married couples.

Four years ago, several gay couples who were married in Massachusetts launched a lawsuit to challenge DOMA, arguing it denied them equal protection of the laws. They won before a federal judge in Boston and before the federal appeals court there.

DOCUMENTS: Supreme Court decisions on DOMA, Prop. 8

Their win prompted the Obama administration to switch course and join with the challengers, who said the law was discriminatory. House Republicans voted to take up the legal defense of the law.

When the issue reached the Supreme Court, the justices voted to decide a case brought by Edith Windsor, a New York widow who was sent a $363,000 estate tax bill by the Internal Revenue Service after her wife died in 2009.

The decision leaves in place another provision in the law that says no state is required to recognize gay marriages performed in any other state. That provision was not under challenge.

Pelosi pontificated:

And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring, as the president does, the Constitution. When you pass a bill in the House, as we did with the health care bill, we made it iron clad constitutionally. You have a responsibility to honor the Constitution. In fact, we take an oath to do just that, and that is the oath that President Obama is upholding.

Attacking the GOP’s support for the Defense of Marriage Act, Pelosi whined:

We weigh equities. Congress passes a bill. It’s questionable in terms of constitutionality. There’s no question about your oath to the Constitution of the United States, and the behavior of the Republicans in the House of Representatives on this subject has been so irresponsible. First of all, why in this time would you pass a bill that increases discrimination? We’re going in the direction of the arc of Justice [Henry L.] Benning in favor of more justice, not more discrimination. Why would you do such a thing in the first place? And then when it is questioned in terms of its constitutionality to spend money in the tune of millions outside the regular order of how that money should be spent to defend increasing discrimination in our society, it’s just plain wrong. And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring, as the president does, the Constitution.

Pelosi boasted of her home city’s influence in the assault on traditional values, claiming that same-sex marriage is “inevitable.” She continued:

From our beautiful place in San Francisco, the city of St. Francis, we knew that it was inevitable that all of this would happen. It was inconceivable to others that it would, and it was our job to use whatever influence we could have to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable. And I think that’s what’s happening at the court because of many people’s courage, especially those directly, personally affected."

He recently told local news outlet WRAL that his ""personal opinion"" is that marriage is ""between a man and a woman, but my role is not to influence what people believe in the state I live in or what the state does that I live in.""

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Public opinion could sway Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage,"WASHINGTON — Public opinion on marriage for gay and lesbian couples has shifted with almost unprecedented speed since California voters banned such unions in 2008.

That shift could influence the Supreme Court, in particular Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and possibly Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., as it decides whether to uphold Proposition 8 in coming months.

Advertisement

Throughout his long career, Kennedy has been willing to make major changes in the law on issues including the death penalty, gun rights and gay rights. Kennedy has been a strong, steady proponent of constitutional principles such as free speech, individual liberty and limits on government power.

But before signing on to major changes — abolishing the death penalty for young murderers, for example — he has wanted to feel comfortable thatthe change was in line with public opinion and the trend in the law.

“Among all the justices, he is most concerned about public opinion,” New York University law professor Barry Friedman said of Kennedy. “The more there is a groundswell of support for gay marriage, the more it is likely he will vote to support it.”

Kennedy, along with others on the court, probably would also resist going too fast. The current justices, both liberals and conservatives, say the court of the early 1970s made a mistake by striking down all state laws on abortion and capital punishment. Both decisions appeared to trigger a backlash, and the death penalty was soon restored to law.

Better to move in line with — or just slightly ahead of — shifting opinion, they believe.

In California, public opinion clearly has shifted since Proposition 8 passed in 2008 and banned same-sex marriage. A Field Poll survey released this week showed that California voters, by a nearly 2-1 margin, now approve of allowing same-sex couples to marry, a finding in line with states that legalized gay marriage in November’s election.

Advertisement

With that shift, lawyers supporting same-sex marriage have offered the justices a range of options they could use to rule in favor of gay rights. The Obama administration’s legal brief advocates a step-by-step approach.

Commenting Friday on the administration’s filing in the case, President Obama told reporters: “I do think that we’re seeing, on a state-by-state basis, progress being made — more and more states recognizing same-sex couples and giving them the opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do.” But, he added, the administration wanted to “answer the specific question” before the court — whether “the California law is unconstitutional.”

Advertisement

In providing that answer, Solicitor Gen. Donald Verrilli Jr. drew on arguments he had filed with the court just a few days earlier saying the justices should strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to legally married gay couples in states such as Massachusetts. He advised the court to say that discrimination based on a person’s sexual orientation is highly suspect, akin to gender bias. It can be justified only if a state can show a strong need to treat gays and lesbians differently than other citizens, the administration argued.

Verrilli’s brief filed Thursday applied that same approach in the Proposition 8 case. It argues that because California and seven other states — Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island — already have given gay couples full legal rights, there is no justification for denying them a right to marry.

Advertisement

This is what some lawyers have dubbed the “eight-state solution.”

Already, nine other states and the District of Columbia authorize same-sex marriage. If the Supreme Court were to adopt the administration’s view, it could raise the total to 17, mostly in the Northeast and on the West Coast.

Advertisement

While this would be a significant ruling, it would not require Justice Kennedy and his colleagues to mandate gay marriage in the red states where majority opinion continues to oppose it.

The defenders of Proposition 8 also cite the change in public opinion, but argue it is a reason for the court to stand aside. Because there is a great national debate over gay marriage, and some states are changing their laws, the court has no need to intervene, they said.

Advertisement

Andy Pugno, general counsel for the Proposition 8 proponents, said it was “very disappointing” that the Obama administration had urged the court to strike down the voter initiative. “The president has impugned the motives of millions of Californians,” he said, “and disregarded the rights of each state to decide for itself whether to redefine marriage.”

If the court were to adopt a version of the eight-state solution, it would allow most states to decide for themselves, as Pugno advocates — at least for now. But it is also true that if the justices decided discrimination against gays violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws, that same argument eventually could be used to invalidate the remaining state laws against same-sex marriage. The justices might be particularly willing to do so if the majority of states already had acted.

In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that laws barring mixed-race couples from marriage violated the Constitution. By then, only 16 states still had such laws on their books.

USATODAY

A federal judge has ruled that gay marriages may continue in Utah

Judge Richard Shelby on Monday denied a request by the state of Utah to halt the weddings pending appeal

Utah is expected to ask a higher court to put the process on hold

A federal judge has ruled that gay marriage in Utah may continue, making Utah the 18th state in addition to the District of Columbia where gay and lesbian couples can marry.

Judge Richard Shelby on Monday denied a request by the state that sought to halt gay marriage until the appeals process plays out.

Couples on Monday waited to marry in lines that at times stretched for blocks outside the Salt Lake City County Government Center. Some had spent the night in their cars in the parking lot to make sure they didn't miss their chance.

Well-wishers arrived with flowers, coffee and doughnuts to give to the brides and grooms waiting in the chill morning air. At midmorning a group of Christmas carolers arrived to serenade them.

For now, a state considered as one of the most conservative in the nation has joined the likes of California and New York to become the 18th where same-sex couples can legally wed.

Utah is home to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was one of the leading forces behind California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, which voters approved in 2008. The church said Friday that it stands by its support for ""traditional marriage"" and that it hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman.

The state Office of the Attorney General appealed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to have Shelby's ruling stayed just after it was issued, said spokesman Ryan Bruckman in Salt Lake City.

The marriages will continue until the appeal is either upheld or denied, he said.

The decision drew a swift and angry reaction from Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, who said he was disappointed in an ""activist federal judge attempting to override the will of the people of Utah.""

Gay couples began lining up to marry on Friday when Shelby overturned Utah's ban on same-sex marriage, ruling it is unconstitutional. Lines continued to be out the door in many areas as couples raced to get married for fear a stay might be issued and the wedding ended.

Jolene Abbott, 39, and her wife, Colleen Mewing, 51, were married in July in Washington State. But they got married in Salt Lake City Monday afternoon just to make extra sure they were well and truly married in their home state.

""An attorney friend of ours told us that if the appeal goes through they might still recognize the marriages that have occurred in Utah so far, but couples married outside of the state might not be recognized,"" she said of their decision to marry for a second time.

Utah's Bruckman doesn't think that is correct but he's not sure. ""It's the million dollar question. We're in a state of flux, where Amendment 3 (which bans same sex marriage in Utah) is the law and is not the law.""

""We don't have a timetable on this,"" Bruckman said.

Retired Utah state representative Jackie Biskupski was at the Government Center officiating at weddings on Monday. ""I've done about ten today. The clerks are issuing about 45 licenses an hour and there are over 50 ministers in the building to marry people.""

She believes that gay couples who are legally married elsewhere but live in Utah ""need to get married in Utah to have that marriage recognized here.""

Some county clerks are refusing to issue licenses to same sex couples. Other have ""elected, for safety's sake, to not give out any marriage licenses at all until we know what we're required to do,"" said Bruckman.

Groups advocating for same sex marriage expressed pleasure at Shelby's ruling.

""We're thrilled that this decision continues the process of decisions across the country that support the right of gay and lesbian couples to get married and have their love and families protected equally under the law,"" said Brian Silva, executive director of Marriage Equality. The New York City-based group promotes the rights of gay and lesbian couples to marry.

The 53-page ruling said the constitutional amendment Utah voters approved in 2004 violates gay and lesbian couples' rights to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment. Shelby said the state failed to show that allowing same-sex marriages would affect opposite-sex marriages in any way.

The ruling has thrust Shelby into the national spotlight. He has been on the bench for less than two years, appointed by President Obama after GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch recommended him in November 2011.

Shelby served in the Utah Army National Guard from 1988 to 1996 and was a combat engineer in Operation Desert Storm. He graduated from the University of Virginia law school in 1998 and clerked for the U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene in Utah, then spent about 12 years in private practice before he became a judge.

Frum defended what was then the consensus conservative (and consensus national) position. Redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, he argued, would explicitly sever the institution’s connection to the two interrelated realities, gender difference and procreation, that it had evolved to address. In so doing, it would replace a traditional view of matrimony with a broader, thinner, more adult-centric view, which would ultimately be less likely to bind parents to children, husbands to wives.

“Proponents of gay marriage can only get what they want,” Frum wrote, “by weakening Americans’ attachment to the traditional family even more than it has already been weakened,” and speeding the “process of social dissolution” that the 1960s and 1970s began.

Sullivan countered that the “process” Frum feared was simply an established fact. Heterosexuals had already severed marriage from procreation and permanence, and so there was no more reason to deny same-sex couples marriage licenses than to deny them to the infertile and elderly. Indeed, far from being radical, gay marriage was more likely to be stabilizing, “sending a message about matrimonial responsibility and mutual caring” to gays and straights alike."

From what has been reported in the Associated Press, Dolan also said that the Catholic Church has been ""caricatured as being anti-gay.""

No Cardinal Dolan, the Catholic Church hierarchy hasn't been 'outmarketed' on gay marriage, nor have you been 'caricatured' as anti-gay. The hard truth is that, while right on so many of the most important issues of our time, the Catholic Church leadership in America is wrong on the question of gay marriage and someday (probably centuries from now) you will have to own up to it.

First of all, marketing isn't the problem. We know where the Catholic Church bishops stand on the issue as they have been engaged in a full on anti-gay marriage campaign including a recent exorcism against gay marriage in Illinois and using communion as a hostage against same sex marriage in New Jersey, not to mention the firing of a lesbian teacher from a Catholic school in Arkansas after her same sex marriage.

The logic of the Catholic position against gay marriage seems to go something like this -- marriage is ultimately, and most importantly about procreation, if you can't naturally procreate, you shouldn't get married. This, of course, doesn't sit that well with heterosexuals who don't want, or are unable, to have children. And of course it is an intentional non-starter with homosexuals who have the wrong body parts.

Stability, life long commitment, fidelity and love are not as crucial to the idea of marriage as procreation which is elevated above all else. For instance, the love between Edie Windsor and Thea Spyer that lasted over 40 years and including a final 30 years of Windsor caring for Spyer through her debilitating multiple sclerosis is demoted and diminished in the 'procreation' argument. Their life together, and love for each other doesn't rise to the level of marriage.

What is happening with increasing speed is that Americans do understand the Catholic Church's position but that people just don't agree with its conclusions. In fact, even Catholics themselves don't agree with the Bishops position as polls show a majority of them are for gay marriage. In fact Catholics in the pews are more in favor of gay marriage than the national average.

The other Cardinal Dolan comment that requires a response is that the church has been ""caricatured as being anti-gay."" The hard reality that Cardinal Dolan and all Christians need to face up to is that the Catholic Church along with every other church whether Orthodox, Protestant or Catholic has been horrifically, persistently and vehemently anti-gay for almost all of its history.

This is a fact. There is no 'caricature' needed.

The Church has inspired deep hatred of the LGBT community, and the fact that many of us who are LGBT still feel called to participate in the Church is perhaps the most powerful testimony to the presence of Christ that one can find in the world today.

But for one to deny that the Church is anti-gay in one sentence and then to maintain a stance against gay marriage in the next adds injury to insult. Let's just be very clear here -- if you are against marriage equality you are anti-gay.

Done.

You can not say you are supportive of me as a gay man, and then say but you are against my marriage to my partner Brad. It just doesn't work that way. If you are against gay marriage you are against gay married people. In the future, if you want to know if your actions or words are anti-gay -- try asking a gay person. We'll be glad to let you know.

The truth is, the Catholic Church, along with most religious traditions will eventually have to change their positions on LGBT people. It will take a long, long time. I certainly don't expect to live to see the Catholic Church hierarchy change official dogma on the issue.

But I have faith that they will. And then a simple 'we're sorry' would be appreciated.

(CNN) —

Celebrity chef Paula Deen hopes the Supreme Court’s ruling allowing same-sex marriage to be legal in California will help in her defense against a racial discrimination lawsuit.

The woman alleging that she was subjected to a hostile work environment while working as an assistant manager at Deen’s restaurants is white and therefore doesn’t have the “standing,” or legal right, to claim racial discrimination, according to a motion filed Monday by Deen’s lawyer.

The high court rejected an appeal of California’s Proposition 8 law last week on the grounds that the private parties behind the appeal did not have standing to defend the ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock.

Even if the federal judge in Savannah, Georgia, accepts the argument and tosses the lawsuit, much damage has already been done to Deen’s career and businesses by the public fallout from a deposition in which she acknowledged using the “N-word.”

Chat: Comfort food, uncomfortable topics

Asked by the lawyer taking the deposition if she had ever used the word, she said, “Yes, of course.”

She said she had probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about “when a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head” – an incident that took place 30 years ago.

Asked if she had used it since then, she said, “I’m sure I have, but it’s been a very long time.” She noted that circumstances have changed “since the ‘60s in the South.”

Many of Deen’s lucrative business relationships have crumbled in the wake of media coverage of the lawsuit. She has lost at least nine endorsements along with her Food Network cooking show, and publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook has been canceled.

Deen attorney William Franklin’s motion, filed Monday with the U.S. District Court in Savannah, cited the June 26 Supreme Court decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, the California case.

“Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts made this observation: Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding actual ‘Cases’ or ‘Controversies,’” the motion said. “One essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so. This requires the litigant to prove that he has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”

George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told CNN Tuesday the contention that the Prop 8 ruling is relevant to the Deen case won’t hold water.

The concept of standing is hardly new, and the Supreme Court bringing it into the spotlight in Hollingsworth v. Perry doesn’t not advance Deen’s motion to dismiss the case, Turley said.

Deen’s accuser: ‘This has never been about the N-word’

Lisa Jackson, the plaintiff in the suit against Deen is white, has no standing because she couldn’t have suffered “a personal and tangible harm” from hearing the “N-word” on the job, the Franklin’s , motion says.

In the Prop 8 case, state officials refused to pursue an appeal when a federal judge struck down the same-sex marriage ban. Private citizens picked it up, ultimately to be told by the high court last week that they had no standing to do so.

Jackson is a former manager at Deen’s restaurants in Savannah, Georgia. She is suing Deen and her brother, Bubba Hier, alleging they committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five-year employment at Deen’s Lady & Sons and Bubba’s Seafood and Oyster House eateries in Savannah.

She gave a statement to CNN’s Don Lemon through her lawyer, Matthew Billips, on Monday.

“This lawsuit has never been about the N-word,” she said. “It is to address Ms. Deen’s patterns of disrespect and degradation of people that she deems to be inferior. I may be a white woman, but I could no longer tolerate her abuse of power as a business owner, nor her condonation of Mr. Hier’s despicable behavior on a day-to-day basis. I am what I am, and I am a human being that cares about all races, and that is why I feel it is important to be the voice for those who are too afraid to use theirs.”

Deen’s lawyer has called the allegations false, and Deen has said she does not tolerate prejudice.

Deen made an emotional appearance on NBC’s “Today Show” last week in which she called the accusations “horrible, horrible lies.”

“I believe that every creature on this Earth, every one of God’s creatures, was created equal,” she said. “… I believe that everyone ought to be treated equal.”

Deen was raised to never be unkind to anyone, she said.

The resolution reaffirms our core belief in doing one%27s %22duty to God.%22

Changing adult standards would have conflicted with the virtues of our chartered partners.

We will work to stay focused on that which unites us.

The Boy Scouts of America is part of the fabric of this nation. Our focus is on working together to deliver the nation's foremost youth program of character development and values-based leadership training. Somehow, Scouting has become one of the focal points in the debate on homosexuality. However, it is not the role of the Boy Scouts to resolve this complex issue, nor can the decision we will make today.

In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the BSA has the right to set its membership standards. It is worth noting that the court's decision was not about whether homosexuality is right or wrong; rather, it affirmed that private organizations have the right to set membership rules based on their beliefs and values.

At the BSA's National Annual Meeting today, the 1,400 voting members of our National Council will vote on a proposed resolution that would end the restriction on gay youth membership. That's the right decision for Boy Scouts.

Duty to God

Today's proposed resolution reaffirms our core belief in doing one's ""duty to God."" It would remove the restriction denying membership to youth on the basis of sexual orientation alone and would maintain the current membership policy for all adult leaders. Further, the resolution reinforces that Scouting is a youth program, and that any sexual conduct, heterosexual or homosexual, is contrary to the virtues of Scouting. It also prohibits the use of the organization to promote or advance any social or political positions or agendas.

While some people wish the proposed resolution would go further, it was clear from our listening phase that changing adult standards would have conflicted with the majority of our partners, 70% of which are religious organizations, and would have disrupted our ability to deliver Scouting. Conversely, some have asserted that the proposed change for youth runs counter to the values of, and raises concerns among, Scouting's religious chartered organizations. We are unaware of any major religious chartered organization that believes a youth member simply stating he or she is attracted to the same sex, but not engaging in sexual activity, should make him or her unwelcome in their congregation. We reviewed a variety of policy options and concluded this option would provide kids a place to belong while they learn and grow.

About the kids

The change to the Boy Scouts of America's membership policy is not the result of pressure from outside; it is the result of extensive dialogue within the Scouting family. Parents, adults in the Scouting community and teens alike tend to agree that youth should not be denied the benefits of Scouting. The resolution is not about adults; it is about what is best for young people.

Some have voiced concerns that this proposal could put children at risk of being abused. The BSA makes no connection between sexual abuse and homosexuality. The nation's leading experts agree. The BSA has stringent polices that protect the safety and privacy of youth and has always worked to ensure that it is a supportive and safe environment.

The BSA's executive committee unanimously presented this resolution because it stays true to Scouting's mission and remains focused on kids. No matter what your opinion is on this issue, America needs Scouting, and our policies must be based on what is in the best interest of our nation's children.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Gay marriage opponents take unusual tack with Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON — Marriage should be limited to unions of a man and a woman because they alone can “produce unplanned and unintended offspring,” opponents of gay marriage have told the Supreme Court.

By contrast, when same-sex couples decide to have children, “substantial advance planning is required,” said Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for House Republicans.

This unusual defense of traditional marriage was set out last week in a pair of opening legal briefs in the two gay marriage cases to be decided by the Supreme Court this spring.

Lawyers defending California’s Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act want the high court to decide it is reasonable for the law to recognize only marriages between opposite-sex couples.

Conservative attorneys did not argue that gays or lesbians engaged in “immoral” behavior or lifestyles. Instead they emphasized what they called the “very real threat” to society posed by opposite-sex couples when they are not bound by the strictures of marriage.

The traditional marriage laws “reflect a unique social difficulty with opposite-sex couples that is not present with same-sex couples — namely, the undeniable and distinct tendency of opposite-sex relationships to produce unplanned and unintended pregnancies,” wrote Clement, a solicitor general under President George W. Bush. “Unintended children produced by opposite-sex relationships and raised out-of-wedlock would pose a burden on society.”

“It is plainly reasonable for California to maintain a unique institution [referring to marriage] to address the unique challenges posed by the unique procreative potential of sexual relationships between men and women,” argued Washington attorney Charles J. Cooper, representing the defenders of Proposition 8. Same-sex couples need not be included in the definition of marriage, he said, because they “don’t present a threat of irresponsible procreation.”

In one case from New York, the court will decide whether the federal government may deny equal benefits, such as filing a joint tax return, to legally married gay couples. U.S. appeals courts in Boston and New York struck down this part of the Defense of Marriage Act on the grounds it denied gay couples the equal protection of the laws. The Obama administration chose not to defend this provision, so the House Republicans hired Clement to argue in defense of the law.

In the California case, the court will decide on the voter initiative in 2008 that limited marriage to a man and a woman. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals voided this measure on the grounds it took away from gays and lesbians the right to marry, which they had won before state judges.

In the lower courts, defenders of the traditional laws struggled to explain why committed couples of the same sex should be denied the benefits of marriage. The plaintiffs include same-sex couples who are raising children.

Clement and Cooper do not address that issue directly. Instead, they argue that it is reasonable for the law to steer opposite-sex couples toward marriage, including by giving them extra benefits. “It was rational for Congress to draw the line where it did,” Clement said, “because the institution of marriage arose in large measure in response to the unique social difficulty that opposite-sex couples, but not same-sex couples, posed.”

In another part of their brief, they argue for the high court to stand back and to let the “democratic process” resolve the dispute over gay marriage. Both note that voters in several states recently approved same-sex marriage, and opinion polls report that most Americans now favor it.

Clement said gays and lesbians are hardly a politically powerless minority subjected to discrimination and in need of protection from the courts. “Gays and lesbians are one of the most influential, best-connected, best-funded and best-organized interest groups in modern politics, and have attained more legislative victories, political power and popular favor in less time than virtually any other group in American history,” he wrote.

Congress has repealed the ban on gays serving openly in the military, and it might repeal the Defense of Marriage Act too, Clement said. And Cooper noted that California voters could put a measure on the next ballot and repeal Proposition 8.

Next month, gay rights advocates will file their arguments in favor of striking down the two laws. The court will hear arguments in the cases on March 26 and 27.

We are the change we seek,” candidate Barack Obama said in 2008. At the time, his comments came in for criticism: They were narcissistic; they were tautological; they didn’t make a whole lot of sense.

But in the aftermath of Obama’s 2012 reelection and his second inaugural address, his 2008 remarks seem less a statement of self-absorption than one of prophecy. There is an Obama majority in American politics, symbolized by Monday’s throng on the Mall, whose existence is both the consequence of profound changes to our nation’s composition and values and the cause of changes yet to come.

That majority, as the president made clear in his remarks, would not exist but for Americans’ struggles to expand our foundational belief in the equality of all men. The drive to expand equality, he said in his speech’s most historically resonant line, “is the star that guides us still, just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.”

Our history, Obama argued, is one of adapting our ideals to a changing world. His speech (like recent books by Michael Lind and my Post colleague E.J. Dionne Jr.) reclaimed U.S. history from the misrepresentations of both constitutional originalists and libertarian fantasists. “Fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges,” the president said. “Preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.”

Having established that the moral and practical arc of U.S. history bends toward equality, Obama vowed to push his demands for equality still further — to ending the systemic underpayment of female workers; the voter suppression that compels some Americans, usually minorities, to wait hours to cast their votes; the deportations of immigrants who would otherwise help build the economy; and the laws that forbid gay Americans to marry.

As the president acknowledged, however, social equality is rising even as the relative economic equality that once defined American life has sharply and broadly receded. “Our country cannot succeed,” he said, “when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.” For this, Obama prescribed revamping our taxes and reforming our schools, but these are by no means sufficient to transform our nation into one that, as the president put it, “rewards the effort and determination of every single American.” The waning of the middle class is, with climate change, the most vexing item on the president’s agenda and requires far-reaching solutions beyond any he laid out. U.S. workers must regain the power they once had to bargain for their wages, but that only begins the list of economic reforms that are as difficult to achieve as they are necessary to re-create an financially vibrant nation.

The president closed his speech by asking his supporters to join him to help “shape the debates of our time.” The biggest mistake Obama made when he took office was to effectively disband the organization of the millions of Americans who had worked for his election — for fear, in part, that it might upset members of Congress whose votes he would need for his policies. He wants no such unilateral political disarmament now; his operatives hope to keep his 2012 campaign’s volunteer army in the field for the legislative battles ahead. Obama’s legions have proven that they can win elections, and this matters a great deal more, the president has learned, than whatever trace elements of goodwill he may win by deferring to Congress.

The Obama Majority — its existence and mobilization — is what enabled the president to deliver so ideological an address. No such inaugural speech has been delivered since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, demanding the curtailment of government programs and secure in the knowledge that much of the white working class had shifted its allegiance away from the Democrats and supported his attack on the public sector and minority rights. On Monday, Obama, secure in the knowledge that the nation’s minorities had joined with other liberal constituencies to form a new governing coalition, voiced their demands to ensure equality and to preserve and expand the government’s efforts to meet the nation’s challenges. As he left the stage, he stopped and turned to marvel at the crowd, at the new American majority they represented. They were the ones he, and we, were waiting for.

http://news.yahoo.com/churches-changing-bylaws-gay-marriage-ruling-153638830.html,,[],Churches changing bylaws after gay marriage ruling,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Worried they could be sued by gay couples, some churches are changing their bylaws to reflect their view that the Bible allows only marriage between one man and one woman.

Although there have been lawsuits against wedding industry businesses that refuse to serve gay couples, attorneys promoting the bylaw changes say they don't know of any lawsuits against churches.

Critics say the changes are unnecessary, but some churches fear that it's only a matter of time before one of them is sued.

""I thought marriage was always between one man and one woman, but the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision said no,"" said Gregory S. Erwin, an attorney for the Louisiana Baptist Convention, an association of Southern Baptist churches and one several groups advising churches to change their bylaws. ""I think it's better to be prepared because the law is changing. America is changing.""

In a June decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law. A second decision was more technical but essentially ushered in legal gay marriage in California.

Kevin Snider is an attorney with the Pacific Justice Institute, a nonprofit legal defense group that specializes in conservative Christian issues. His organization released a model marriage policy a few years ago in response to a statewide gay marriage fight in California. Snider said some religious leaders have been threatened with lawsuits for declining to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies.

Dean Inserra, head pastor of the 1,000-member City Church Tallahassee, based in Florida, said he does not want to be alarmist, but his church is looking into how best to address the issue.

Inserra said he already has had to say no to gay friends who wanted him to perform a wedding ceremony.

""We have some gay couples that attend our church. What happens when they ask us to do their wedding?"" Inserra said. ""What happens when we say no? Is it going to be treated like a civil rights thing?""

Story continues

Critics, including some gay Christian leaders, argue that the changes amount to a solution looking for a problem.

""They seem to be under the impression that there is this huge movement with the goal of forcing them to perform ceremonies that violate their freedom of religion,"" said Justin Lee, executive director of the Gay Christian Network, a nonprofit that provides support for gay Christians and their friends and families and encourages churches to be more welcoming.

""If anyone tried to force a church to perform a ceremony against their will, I would be the first person to stand up in that church's defense.""

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia now recognize gay marriage.

Some Christian denominations, such as the United Church of Christ, accept gay marriage. The Episcopal Church recently approved a blessing for same-sex couples, but each bishop must decide whether to allow the ceremony in his or her local diocese.

The majority of Christian denominations, however, view homosexual relationships as sinful. In more hierarchical denominations, like the Roman Catholic Church or the United Methodist Church, individual churches are bound by the policies of the larger denomination. But nondenominational churches and those loosely affiliated with more established groups often individually decide how to address social issues such as gay marriage.

Eric Rassbach is an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest legal group that defends the free expression rights of all faiths. He said it is unlikely the government would try to force a pastor to perform a same-sex marriage, but churches that rent out their facilities to the general public could face problems if they refuse to rent to gay couples.

Although his organization has not advocated it, he said it could strengthen a church's legal position to adopt a statement explaining its beliefs about marriage.

""A number of groups don't have a written doctrine,"" Rassbach said. ""Say a group like the Primitive Baptists — they don't want a written-down credo, but the courts like written-down things.""

Rassbach said it was important for churches to get their beliefs in writing before a dispute arises, otherwise it can look to a court as if something was done after the fact as an attempt to cover up hostility to gays.

Airline Baptist Church Senior Pastor Chad Mills said members of the public use their facilities in Bossier City, La., for many activities, including Zumba classes. In the past, anyone who could pay the fee was allowed to reserve the space. But recently, the church changed its rental policy to allow wedding-related events only for male-female couples.

Some denominations are less concerned about the Supreme Court rulings. The Assemblies of God, the group of churches comprising the world's largest Pentecostal denomination, sought legal advice after the rulings. An attorney for the group distributed a memo to ministers saying there was no reason to change their bylaws.

However, the memo also said that ""doing so is not inappropriate, and may be warranted based on future rulings by the Supreme Court and other state and federal courts.""

The bylaw changes are coming at a time when many churches are wrestling with gay marriage in general and are working hard to be more welcoming to gays and lesbians.

""It's probably one of the most difficult issues our churches are facing right now,"" said Doug Anderson, a national coordinator with the evangelical Vineyard Church. ""It's almost an impossible situation to reconcile what's going on in our culture, and our whole theology of welcoming and loving people, versus what it says in the Bible."""
http://news.yahoo.com/smallest-state-big-battleground-gay-marriage-072938762.html,,[],Smallest state is big battleground on gay marriage,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Hundreds of supporters of same-sex marriage rights assembled at the Rhode Island Statehouse on Tuesday, urging lawmakers to make the nation's smallest state the 10th to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed — and the last to do so in New England.

House Speaker Gordon Fox, who is gay, has called for a vote on same-sex marriage legislation in his chamber by month's end, making Rhode Island the latest state to address an issue whose supporters see things swinging their way after voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington approved gay marriage last fall.

About 300 supporters and opponents signed up to address the legislative committee reviewing the bill — they were limited to 2 minutes each to keep the hearing from going all night — while hundreds more gathered in the hallways outside the hearing.

Downstairs, a raucous rally of gay-marriage opponents beneath the Statehouse rotunda at times drowned out those testifying in the third-floor committee room.

""I'd like us to get on the right side of history,"" said Josephine O'Connell, 71, of Providence, who said it ""breaks her heart"" that her home state is the only one in New England that doesn't allow gays and lesbians like her to marry. ""I don't want to be looking back in 20 years, thinking 'what were we thinking?'""

Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, and Treasurer Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, both spoke out in favor of gay marriage at the hearing.

""I'm here as your treasurer, but I'm really here as a mother and wife,"" said Raimondo. ""Every Rhode Islander deserves the same rights that we have.""

Hundreds of others showed up to urge lawmakers in this heavily Catholic state to drop the legislation and protect the current definition of marriage.

The Roman Catholic Church opposes the legislation on religious grounds — and more practical ones. The Rev. Bernard Healey told lawmakers that the Providence Diocese is concerned Catholic schools and charitable organizations could be forced to change their employee benefit policies if compelled to recognize the same-sex spouses of employees.

Story continues

""We are here to defend and support the longstanding definition of marriage... as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman,"" Healey said. ""Using the law to alter or redefine marriage is an injustice to those who have embraced this way of life.""

Others warned that allowing gay marriage would erode social norms.

""Just because these states in New England have decided to redefine marriage doesn't mean we should follow them down this path,"" said Michael Krzywonos of Pawtucket. ""The polygamists will be next in line. Then we'll begin to test the boundaries of what age is permissible. And then we will test whether love and marriage can only be between two people.""

Supporters are hoping to build on national momentum following the votes in Maine, Maryland and Washington. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, voters rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have prohibited gay marriage, the first time such a ballot question has failed in the United States.

Lawmakers in Illinois are also expected to consider gay marriage this year.

Supporters in Rhode Island expect the measure will pass the Democrat-controlled House but concede the state Senate is more challenging. Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed, a Newport Democrat, is a gay marriage opponent but has said she will allow a committee vote on the legislation should it pass the House. She said Tuesday that she would not vote for the legislation as it's currently written.

But in an interview published in January’s GQ Magazine, the duck call inventor and Roberston family patriarch goes on record with comments about the sinfulness of gays and black people under Jim Crow that are about as forward-thinking as his Old Testament facial hair.

In the profile, an unedited Robertson sounds off on what’s ailing the country during a trip through the Louisiana backwoods.

“Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,” he tells reporter Drew Magary. “Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers—they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.”

He also muses rather colorfully about his own sexual orientation: “It seems like, to me, a vagina—as a man—would be more desirable than a man’s anus. That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.”

In a quote that may raise even more eyebrows than his feelings about gays, Robertson claims he “never” saw black people mistreated during the pre-civil rights era in his home state, and strongly suggests that African Americans were more content under Jim Crow.

“Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I’m with the blacks, because we’re white trash,” he said. “They’re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.”

Robertson also shares an interesting rationale for voting for Mitt Romney over President Obama, saying he favored the candidate because he was from Salt Lake City, a safer city than Chicago. “Where would I rather be turned around at 3 o’clock in the morning?” he said. As Magary points out, Romney, though a Mormon, hails from Boston.

The Robertsons, particularly Phil, are outspoken about their Christian faith (each episode of “Duck Dynasty” ends with a prayer) and have also campaigned for Republicans, but their show, a hit in red and blue states alike, is largely nonpolitical and has so far carefully avoided issues such as race and gay rights.

The comments could prove to be a headache for A&E, which has a ratings winner in “Duck Dynasty.” The August season premiere of the technically unscripted (if carefully edited) series garnered 11.8 million viewers, setting a record for a nonfiction cable program, and it regularly beats out many shows on broadcast. Season 5 is set to bow Jan. 15.

A very few years ago, most Americans (including me) viewed the idea of gay marriage as both undesirable and wildly improbable. Today, most Americans (including me) believe that permitting gay and lesbian couples to marry is the right thing to do, a matter of simple justice.

Let us pause in wonder at the speed and moral meaning of this change. As recently as a decade ago, homosexual conduct itself was a crime in many U.S. states. That world has vanished. Gay rights of all kinds are increasingly protected. Gay marriage is legal in 12 states and counting. Gay families are a part of our social fabric. Whatever the Supreme Court decides about the two cases now before it won’t be nearly as important as what has already happened in the country.

VIDEO OP-ED: Fighting for gay marriage and immigration reform

And yet these court decisions will affect the lives of millions of Americans. At stake in the DOMA case is whether the federal government can deny benefits to legally married same-sex couples that it extends to legally married opposite-sex couples. At stake in the Proposition 8 case is whether, or in what circumstances, a state can withhold marriage rights from same-sex couples.

So if you can’t sponsor your spouse for a green card simply because you’re both gay, the court’s view of DOMA matters a lot. And if you are a gay couple living in, say, my home state of Mississippi, or in one of the other Sunbelt states in which opposition to gay rights is strong, you care very much about whether your state can prohibit same-sex marriage.

For those reasons and more, I have every hope the Supreme Court will craft decisions that will move the country in the direction it is already headed: toward marriage equality.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronology

Advertisement

And yet arriving at that position has for me been a difficult and painful journey. Until June 2012, I was a vocal opponent of gay marriage. I wrote a book about it and spoke against it across the country; I was an expert witness in support of Proposition 8.

I did all of that not because I condemned homosexuality or objected to gay civil unions — I didn’t. But I believed gay marriage would weaken the traditional institution of marriage, the institution that binds mothers, fathers and their children together.

Advertisement

A wealth of social science evidence about child poverty, mental and emotional distress, educational failure, crime and other problems suggests that when marriage breaks down — when fathers are absent and mothers are left alone to raise children — society breaks down too. Gay marriage and families, which by their nature involve the loosening of biological family ties, seemed to pose one more threat to an already beleaguered institution.

In the end, I didn’t change my mind on gay marriage because I stopped believing in the importance of intact biological families. Nor was it because of new studies or additional facts. (Gay marriage still strains biological family bonds, although research also points to the potential stability of gay marriage and family structures.) And I didn’t change my mind because I got tired of being criticized. I changed my opposition to gay marriage because of personal relationships.

In my case, it began with the writer Jonathan Rauch, who I’d been publicly debating on the gay marriage issue. But at some point we stopped debating and started talking about our lives, including about my wife, Raina, and his husband, Michael. Did Jonathan’s marriage threaten the idea of marriage? Perhaps in theory. But in real life, was I able to see it? No. In fact, quite the opposite.

It may sound trite, but for me the key was the gradual breakthrough of empathy. I found that as friendships develop, empathy becomes at least possible, no longer kept at bay by a wall of fixed belief. Put simply, becoming friends with gay people who were married or wanted to get married led me to realize that I couldn’t in good conscience continue to oppose it.

But another reality was also becoming clear. At the same time that gay and lesbian couples and their supporters are struggling for the right to marry, millions of straight couples are abandoning marriage entirely, with tragic consequences for them and their children. Further, this abandonment is occurring among our once heavily married middle and working class.

Upscale Americans are still enjoying marriage’s economic and social advantages. For example, only about 6% of children born to college-educated women are born outside marriage. Among women with a high school degree but not a four-year-college degree, though, it’s 44%, and among poorly educated women, it’s 54%. Many other numbers tell the same story.

This class-based marriage divide is not only large, it’s constantly getting larger. Scholarship shows that it’s contributing significantly to the rise of economic inequality. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that it’s threatening the American dream.

So this is where I found myself a year ago: Fighting gay marriage was wrong because it was denying real people access to a status and an institution we all have a stake in. Moreover, that battle was doing nothing to strengthen the institution overall.

And this is where I find myself now: The goal of marriage equality is to make marriage available and achievable for all who seek it — gay and straight, the upscale minority and the non-upscale majority. And the strategy for achieving full marriage equality is a strategy of strange bedfellows: social conservatives and gay rights liberals, a coalition that could put an end forever to the conflict between gay rights and family values.

That coalition is waiting to be born, no matter what the Supreme Court decides.

Utah has Upset the Supreme Court's Applecart,"First, we have Professor Michael Dorf from Cornell Law School:

“If the court thought it was going to get a few years, I think they were naïve.”

Professor Dorf said there are probably not five votes on the Supreme Court to block Judge Shelby’s ruling. “On the strictly legal argument,” he said, “it’s hard to justify granting a stay.” But he added that the lower courts should have done so, partly because of the potential cruelty of voiding the new marriages and partly because the Supreme Court is hard to predict. “It’s pretty clear that even the five justices who are sympathetic to same-sex marriage would rather take a few years before getting there,” Professor Dorf wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. “If their hand is forced, as it now will be, it’s impossible to say with certainty what they’ll do.”

Dorf, of course, thinks that the lower court and the 10th Circuit should have issued a stay. Now that several hundred couples have been married in Utah, that seems more moot than the several hundred couples San Francisco married in 2004.""Would rather."" What a pity they're being rushed. Liptak doesn't see this as an issue for this term, but sees it for the session that begins in October 2015 (which is what I've been saying) by which time that will be several thousand couples in Utah, not several hundred, and several hundred, no doubt, in Idaho and Colorado and Wyoming because Utah is closer than, say, New Mexico or Iowa.

And, yes, Liptak points out that the Utah decision was based on a sentence in Scalia's dissent on the Windsor case

“The view that this court will take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated beyond mistaking by today’s opinion”

did not impress Jason Mazzone, a law professor at the University of Illinois. “His opinion would have appeared considerably more judicial had he resisted the urge to give Justice Scalia the finger,” Professor Mazzone wrote in a blog post last Friday.

as GrafZeppelin127 and Kalil pointed out here when the decision was published, a gesture, that, as Liptak reports,Well, okay!

But Michael Klarman, a historian at Harvard Law School, now thinks two to six years, even with the current composition of the court. He doesn't think it's open-ended any more.

So, Utah has set the wheels in motion for the endgame. Illinois, Oregon and New Jersey are in the pipeline now. Historically, this is a QUICK process, as we remember that Prop 8 was only five years ago. Of course, the Supreme Court COULD have done this sooner by accepting the Ninth Circuit's decision on Prop 8, a decision that is now lost to them, but I think I can wait a couple of years.

Now, our task is to change the composition of the House so we can get ENDA passed and signed."

Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman announces his support of legalizing gay marriage

Only current U.S. Senator and one of just a few members of Congress to support gay marriage

Gay son encouraged Portman to switch his position

WASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Rob Portman said Thursday that he now supports gay marriage — a surprise turnabout on a hot-button social issue, sparked by a deeply personal reflection that began two years ago after Portman's son, Will, told him that he is gay.

""It's a change of heart from the position of a father,"" Portman told three Ohio reporters on Thursday during a 45-minute interview in his office. ""I think we should be allowing gay couples the joy and stability of marriage.""

Portman's endorsement of gay marriage makes him the only sitting Republican senator to hold that position. But it comes at a time when public attitudes are shifting quickly on the issue, and more and more states are sanctioning gay marriage.

Ohio's junior senator outlined his position in the interview, and in an op-ed that appears Friday in The Columbus Dispatch.

""I have come to believe that if two people are prepared to make a lifetime commitment to love and care for each other in good times and bad, the government shouldn't deny them the opportunity to get married,"" Portman writes in the op-ed. ""This isn't how I've always felt.""

Portman said his own evolution on the issue began in 2011, when Will, then a freshman at Yale University, made a stunning revelation.

""Will … came to Jane and me and announced that he was gay, that it was not a choice. It was who he is and he had been that way since he could remember,"" Portman recalled of the conversation. ""Jane and I were both surprised, very surprised, but also very supportive of him. Our reaction was not about policy or positions. It was about him as a son and letting him know we were 110% supportive of him.""

His son's homosexuality ""allowed me to think about this issue from a new perspective, and that's as a dad who loves his son a lot,"" Portman said. He said he wants Will to have the same chance at an enduring relationship, ""like Jane and I have had for over 26 years.""

Portman — who until now said marriage should only be between a man and a woman — said it took him ""a while"" to make the political shift and ""get comfortable"" supporting gay marriage.

Portman was among those who, as a member of the House in 1996, voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as between a man and a woman and bars federal recognition of same-sex marriage. It also says states can't be forced to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state. Portman also voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage when he was in the House.

""Rob believes marriage is a sacred bond between one man and one woman,"" Portman's spokesman told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2011. At the time, Portman was the target of a protest by University of Michigan Law School students. He had been invited to deliver the school's commencement address, but nearly 300 students, angry about Portman's opposition to gay rights, asked the school to revoke the invitation.

On Thursday, Portman said he would like to see Congress repeal the provision of DOMA that bans federal recognition of same-sex marriage, although he still supports the part of the law that says states should not be forced to recognize same-sex marriages.

""I'm of the view that the states ought to be deciding this issue, and frankly that's happening increasingly,"" Portman said.

Portman, who is Methodist, said he did not come to this new position easily or quickly. He talked to his pastor and other religious leaders. He talked to his family, friends, and political allies. He talked to those who support gay marriage, including former vice president Dick Cheney — as well as those who do not, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

""I have had a process and a journey,"" he said. ""I've done a lot of reading. I've done a lot of talking to folks.""

Asked whether he would support overturning Ohio's state ban on same-sex marriage if it comes up in a voter referendum, Portman said yes.

""I'm going to be supportive of Ohioans having the opportunity to marry,"" he said. ""I would not plan to take a leadership role in this, but people will know my position.""

Other Republicans have similarly embraced same-sex marriage. For example, more than 80 prominent Republicans — including ex-governors, former members of Congress and veterans of the George W. Bush administration — are planning to file a ""friend of the court"" brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage.

The signers include former governors Jon Huntsman of Utah, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, and William Weld of Massachusetts.

But many Republicans in Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner, remain fiercely opposed to same-sex marriage. And the issue ignites strong passions among social conservatives, a key base for Portman in Ohio.

Portman said Will, who is now 21, nudged him to change his views and wanted him to publicly declare his support for gay marriage. ""He hasn't pushed me, but he's been encouraging, and he's been very much involved,"" he said.

Portman said his previous views on marriage were rooted in his faith. But ""the overriding message of love and compassion that I take from the Bible . . . and the fact that I believe we are all created by our maker . . . that has all influenced me in terms of my change on this issue,"" he said.

Portman said he concluded that marriage as an institution would be strengthened by allowing gay couples to wed.

""When two people make a commitment to one another, it can actually enhance the institution of marriage,"" he said.

Even as he endorsed same-sex marriage, Portman said this would not suddenly become a top legislative priority for him. He has no plans, for example, to introduce legislation to repeal elements of DOMA or take on any other gay rights issues.

""I'm kind of an economic policy wonk,"" he said. ""That's how I got into this business. That's been my priority and my focus, and it will continue to be.""

Portman said he wanted to announce his position now, in part because the Supreme Court will hear arguments on DOMA later this month.

""I felt it was important to let my constituents know where I stand because these court cases are going to encourage members of the media to ask senators and House members what their position is,"" Portman said, adding that he wanted ""to do this before the politics of these court decisions . . . makes it more difficult maybe to have an honest discussion.""

Portman said he's told some of his Republican colleagues about his shift and all of them have been very ""respectful"" of his decision, even if they don't agree.

He consulted Cheney, whose daughter is gay, about the issue last weekend, when they were both attending a conference. ""His advice was 'Do the right thing. Follow your heart,' "" Portman said.

Asked how this might affect his political career, Portman, who has been touted as a possible 2016 presidential candidate, said he had no idea.

""That has nothing to do with my decision,"" he said. ""This was personally and family initiated, and then it was a process of carefully thinking through the issue."""

LZ Granderson: The 2014 Olympics taking place in Russia with its extreme anti-gay laws

In Russia, LGBT teens reportedly being kidnapped, bullied, even killed, he says

All of Congress should sign letter for Russia to ensure LGBT Americans' safety, he says

Usually when we talk about the 1936 Olympics in Berlin we focus on two men -- Adolf Hitler and Jesse Owens -- and rightfully so. They are the two with an undeniable impact on history, albeit in vastly different ways.

But in light of President Barack Obama's recent remarks on ""The Tonight Show"" denouncing Russia's new anti-gay laws, laws that have led to bloodshed in the streets, it is important that we remember Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller.

They too were at those games. They too left a mark.

You see, the day before they were scheduled to run in the 400-meter relay, their coach, Dean Cromwell, replaced them.

They were not injured.

LZ Granderson

They did not break any team rules nor were they disqualified for any violations.

They were, however, Jewish, and this was Nazi Germany, which had adopted the Nuremberg laws limiting Jewish citizens' rights a year earlier. Apparently, Cromwell, along with leaders from the U.S. Olympic Committee, decided it would be best if Glickman and Stoller did not compete.

At the time I'm sure it seemed like a decision that would only hurt the two men. After all, the 400, led by Owens, still won gold.

Today we know better.

Today we look at that decision and lower our heads in shame, understanding that it made us complicit with something that evolved into a far worse crime than unjustly replacing a pair of sprinters. In the moment when we should have spoken up, we remained silent.

And so here we are again: an Olympics on the horizon, another host country with recently legislated laws persecuting a group of people, and for a while, we were silent. And then Tuesday happened.

""I've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights, when it comes to people's basic freedoms, that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country,"" Obama said, going on to talk about how Russia's treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people goes against the spirit of the Olympics.

He did not call for a boycott.

But on Wednesday he canceled a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin planned for September. The White House cited Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and ""lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control"" among other reasons. But it also mentioned human rights issues.

Recently, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry received a letter from 88 members of Congress -- Republicans and Democrats -- urging him to do something to guarantee the safety of LGBT Americans visiting Russia during that time. That leaves 447 lawmakers we should be asking why they did not sign that letter.

Last month Buzzfeed provided the world photos of LGBT people being violently beaten by anti-gay protesters and police in Russia.

Russian officials have said they don't condone the attacks, but police have stood by while they happened and then arrested the battered victims for being gay. And because it is unclear whether or not the anti-gay laws will be enforced during the Olympics, the safety of all Americans -- because you can be arrested if police think you look gay or even if you support gays -- is in question.

Which brings me to: Why aren't the names of all 535 members of Congress on that letter?

In talking about the 1936 Olympics, I do not equate what is happening in Russia to what happened to Jewish people during World War II. I just want to remind you that the Holocaust did not happen overnight. It was subtle.

Surgical.

In silence.

These new anti-gay laws are disturbingly similar to the anti-Semitic Nuremberg laws Hitler passed before the 1936 Olympics. And with the Pew Institute finding 84% of Russians believe society should reject gay people, perhaps some saying they object to gays for fear of arrest, the world should question how far Russia intends to go.

We should question how far Russia, our lukewarm ally, intends to go and what our participation in the 2014 Olympic Games will look like generations from now.

In one of his final interviews before passing away in 2001, Glickman told the San Diego Jewish Press-Heritage that there had been some talk of boycotting the 1936 Olympics because of Hitler, but no one foresaw what would happen to the Jews a short time later.

""There is no way in the world that I would think of going to Nazi Germany,"" he said. ""The Holocaust and those things around Nazi Germany which we all loathe weren't in existence in 1936.""

No one can predict the future. But this week Obama showed he learned an important lesson from our Olympic past -- offering silence to appease evil is a senseless endeavor because evil will never be satisfied. Now it's our turn to speak up. There are 447 members of Congress who have yet to sign that letter to Kerry -- we need to be asking why.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/opinion/the-california-marriage-case.html,2013-03-27 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],The California Marriage Case - The New York Times,"Before the Supreme Court justices turned to the merits of the case on Proposition 8, California’s ban on same-sex marriage, they seemed perplexed by a procedural issue: whether the petitioners had legal standing to appeal a lower-court ruling that struck down the ballot measure. Having taken the appeal, they cannot easily decide to avoid the substantive question of whether same-sex couples have a constitutionally protected right to marry in California and elsewhere in the country.

If the court decides the case on the merits, it is hard to imagine that a majority could be swayed by the arguments offered by Charles Cooper, the lawyer for the marriage ban’s supporters. Even if his presentation had been more fluent, there was no way to overcome the incoherence of his position.

The core of Mr. Cooper’s argument was that a ruling allowing same-sex marriage would be “redefining” marriage in a way that undermines the “responsible procreation” of children. Yet California allows same-sex couples to adopt children, and many heterosexual couples who can’t have children get married.

When Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked him if — outside the marriage context — he could “think of any other rational basis, reason, for a state using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens,” he could not. When Justice Elena Kagan asked him to describe “what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples” would occur if same-sex couples were allowed to marry, he failed to provide a single example. He also contended that “debate over whether the age-old definition of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples” should be left to the states but could not explain why the Constitution would permit this kind of discrimination."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/22/politics/supreme-court-marriage/index.html,2013-02-22 00:00:00,"['Bill Mears', 'Cnn Supreme Court Producer']",Obama administration weighs in on defense of marriage law,"Edith Windsor, right, who is at the center of a Supreme Court case, talks with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., in December.

Story highlights The Justice Department files first in a series of legal briefs involving two big cases Supreme Court will hear arguments next month on Defense of Marriage Act Lawyers for House GOP say they should be able to defend the marriage law in court U.S. still deciding whether to intervene in second case involving California law

In a preview of a major constitutional showdown at the Supreme Court over same-sex marriage, the Obama administration said on Friday that a federal law denying financial benefits to legally wed gay and lesbian couples is unconstitutional.

The Justice Department filed the first of a series of briefs in a pair of cases dealing with the multilayered issue, outlining the executive branch’s positions.

The high court will hear oral arguments next month on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman.

That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, and family medical leave protections – do not apply to gay and lesbian couples.

This case deals with Edith “Edie” Windsor, forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than other married couples would have to pay. Because her decades-long partner was a woman, the federal government did not recognize the same-sex marriage in legal terms, even though their home state of New York did.

But now, led by President Barack Obama’s recent political about-face, the administration opposes the law.

“Moral opposition to homosexuality, though it may reflect deeply held personal views, is not a legitimate policy objective that can justify unequal treatment of gay and lesbian people” contained in the DOMA law, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said in the Justice Department’s legal brief.

The separate case from California deals with Proposition 8, a 2008 voter-approved referendum banning same-sex marriage. This after the California high court had earlier concluded same-sex couples could legally wed. That case too will be heard in late March.

Though not a party in the California case, government sources say the Justice Department was prepared next week to file an “amicus” or supporting brief asserting a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, and that Proposition 8 should be struck down as a violation of constitutionally guaranteed “equal protection” of the laws.

Those sources say Obama was expected to make the final call on whether to intervene in the state dispute.

“I have to make sure that I’m not interjecting myself too much in this process, particularly when we’re not a party to the case,” Obama said Wednesday in an interview with CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco.

Of more immediate concern was the DOMA fight, where the administration is squarely involved. But a tricky gateway or “jurisdictional” question threatens to stall any final consideration of the law’s constitutionality. That was the focus of much of the Friday legal papers.

The DOMA law will be defended by House Republicans, after Obama concluded the law was unconstitutional.

Traditionally, that role would fall to the solicitor general’s office. But Obama, in an election-year stunner, said last May that he supported same-sex marriage.

The president had already ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend DOMA in court. That raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law.

Besides the constitutional issue, the justices had specifically ordered both sides to argue a supplemental question: whether congressional Republicans – operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives – have “standing” or legal authority to make the case.

Lawyers representing the House GOP said Friday that they should be able to take the lead and defend the law, since both Windsor and the Obama administration are taking the same legal position.

“Without the House’s participation,” said attorney Paul Clement, representing House leaders, “it is hard to see how there is any case or controversy here at all. Both Ms. Windsor and the executive agree that DOMA is unconstitutional and that Ms. Windsor was entitled to a [tax] refund. And the lower courts granted them all the relief they requested. Only the House’s intervention provides the adverseness that Article III [federal court jurisdiction] demands.”

But the Justice Department said it alone should present the government’s case.

“House Republicans lack “any basis for supplanting the executive branch’s exclusive role in representing the United States’ interests in this litigation, and has no interests of its own that would satisfy” federal court scrutiny, said administration lawyers.

Windsor’s legal team also said the House leaders could defend DOMA, at least partially, suggesting the woman wants ultimate resolution on the constitutional questions as soon as possible.

“I was devastated by the loss of the great love of my life, and I was also very sick, then had to deal with pulling together enough money to pay for the taxes,” the 83-year-old Windsor told CNN recently. “And it was deeply upsetting.”

The story of Edith and Thea

That fundamental unfairness, as Windsor and her supporters see it, is at the center of DOMA legal fight.

In November, three states – Maryland, Washington, and Maine – approved same-sex marriage, adding to the six states and the District of Columbia that already have done so. Minnesota voters also rejected an effort to ban such unions through a constitutional amendment.

As more states legalize same-sex marriage, one of the key questions the justices may be forced to address is whether a national consensus now exists supporting the idea of expanding an “equal protection” right of marriage to homosexuals.

A bill known as the Respect for Marriage Act is working its way through Congress and would repeal DOMA.

That law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states. Most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers, who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans, and other benefits.

Many other states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples – a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law.

But other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. California’s Proposition 8 is the only such referendum that revoked the right after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it. That makes it a somewhat unique legal case for review by the justices.

The DOMA cases are U.S. v. Windsor (12-307) and Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives v. Windsor (12-785)."

The Presidential Inauguration Committee announced Tuesday that the President Obama has selected Pastor Louie Giglio of the Georgia-based Passion City Church to deliver the benediction for his second inauguration. In a mid-1990s sermon identified as Giglio’s, available online on a Christian training Web site, he preached rabidly anti-LGBT views. The 54-minute sermon, entitled “In Search of a Standard – Christian Response to Homosexuality,” advocates for dangerous “ex-gay” therapy for gay and lesbian people, references a biblical passage often interpreted to require gay people be executed, and impels Christians to “firmly respond to the aggressive agenda” and prevent the “homosexual lifestyle”

I can tell you that one of the most hurtful parts of the first Obama administration was asking to have Rick Warren speak at his inaugural. He was giving a platform to someone who spread hate, when there were so many other choices there. It was greatly resented by many in the LGBT community. In fact, it set off a chain of events (Rev. Robinson ""accidentally"" not being shown on live TV etc.) which got Obama off on very bad footing with many in the LGBT community.

Following McClurkin, I was very angry with Obama. Then came Warren. But apparently Obama/the inaugural team haven't learned anything:

From above Alternet piece:



(17:37) Men, women, I can’t say anything other to you tonight than this, that if you look at the counsel of the word of God, Old Testament, New Testament, you come quickly to the conclusion that homosexuality is not an alternate lifestyle… homosexuality is not just a sexual preference homosexuality is not gay, but homosexuality is sin. It is sin in the eyes of God, and it is sin according to the word of God. You come to only one conclusion: homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation. It is less than God’s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us, is sin. That’s God’s voice. If you want to hear God’s voice, that is his voice to this issue of homosexuality. It is not ambiguous and unclear. It is very clear.

There are numerous other very incendiary quotes.

So let me address the naysayers now:

- But Obama has done so much for LGBT rights, it's just a speaker at the Inauguration

Um, first, if you are trying to make improving LGBT rights a cornerstone of your presidency, you don't have to spit in the eye of the people you are supposedly trying to help. This is a PERSONAL choice. Hagel I can somewhat justify because there are other plusses to his candidacy. This is Obama picking yet another bigot when there could be much better choices out there who were/are not so vehemently anti-gay

Also, when will he get past this bullshit of making in-roads with these people? These people will always vote against him and his agenda. Why give the marquee moment to a hater

- But, but he said those things long ago

Yeah, and those are the seeds of hatred which were sown in the very people today who support discrimination against LGBT people.

Also, if Shirley Sherrod is up for scrutiny for what she didn't even say, Hagel for his homophobic remarks, they why should this guy not be held accountable, as would anything with a history of anti-African American, anti-woman, anti-Hispanic, anti- remarks. Yeah, the times are changing and its time for the haters and the Vichy apologists to be held accountable for hating when it was a much bigger trend.

And for what it's worth, I am against Hagel ALSO for this reason. As Maddow pointed out, there will be many, many issues involving LGBT people in the military coming up. So he should answer for his bigotry then. Yet another reason why he is a bad choice.

- But, but, Obama has a GAY CUBAN poet speaking

And this argument pisses me off most of all. In Obama and Co's mind, if you put up a minority group, that cancels out, makes ok having the hater up there. No, it doesn't. You don't have a ""mixed program"" by putting up people who have advanced society, like Ms. Evers and those who have held it back. Once again, we'll likely have an inauguration with the usual symbolic winks and nods to the LGBT community while the hater gets a front row seat.

Starting off Obama II in a sucky way, like he started off Obama I. Except he can't blame Boehner for this one. A fucking huge disappointment."

The majority opinion said the ruling only applied to married gay couples seeking federal benefits

The ruling has already been cited in cases in New Jersey and Michigan

Only federal courts in California have called state gay marriage bans unconstitutional

WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Supreme Court struck down part of an anti-gay marriage law, Justice Anthony Kennedy took pains in his majority opinion to say the ruling applied only to legally married same-sex couples seeking benefits from the federal government.

But judges and lawyers representing same-sex couples are already using Kennedy's language and reasoning in other cases about the right to marry.

It's a predictable next step in a long-term, incremental legal strategy that is being used at both the state and federal levels, and in state legislatures and executive mansions as well as the courts, to build public and official acceptance of gay marriage. Much the same approach was used decades ago by civil rights lawyers fighting state-sanctioned discrimination; one decision becomes a steppingstone to the next.

In the fight over gay marriage, Kennedy's words also figured in an earlier example. He insisted in June 2003 that his opinion overturning state sodomy laws had nothing to do with governments' recognition of same-sex marriage. Five months later, language from his opinion showed up in the second paragraph of a state court ruling that made Massachusetts the first state to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry.

In the June 26 decision in U.S. v. Windsor, Kennedy said the provision denying federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples relegates those marriages to second-class status, and ""it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples.""

He framed his argument with reference to states' ""historic and essential authority to define the marital relation.""

But it doesn't take too much creativity to reframe his opinion to challenge state bans on same-sex marriage, said Jon Davidson, legal director of the gay rights group Lambda Legal.

""It's stigmatizing and it's harmful to people and particularly harmful to children when their parents' relationship is treated as inferior by the government. Those points are points we will be making in all of our marriage cases,"" Davidson said.

Davidson's group is relying on the invalidation of the Defense of Marriage Act provision in a state lawsuit to force New Jersey to allow same-sex couples to wed. In that case, the new argument is that the New Jersey Constitution does not allow the state to essentially keep same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits by prohibiting them from marrying.

Like the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, other state court rulings in favor of gay marriage have relied on provisions of their state constitutions. That has not happened by accident. The litigation plan had been to pursue marriage in liberal states, based on state constitutions, and generally avoid federal courts where judges appointed by conservative Republican presidents had, until recently, been in the majority.

Federal courts in California are so far the only ones that have said that a state same-sex marriage ban violates the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court did not decide that issue one way or the other in its gay marriage rulings, and instead relied on a technical legal argument to resolve the California case and clear the way for same-sex marriage in the state, which resumed at the end of June.

Same-sex marriage is legal, or soon will be, in 13 states and the District of Columbia, representing about 30% of the U.S. population. The states are: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

But now federal challenges are popping up as well, in Nevada, Hawaii and Michigan, among other states.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which struck down the California prohibition on same-sex marriage, will consider the Hawaii and Nevada bans together, but that case is in its early stages.

In Michigan, a federal judge prominently cited the Windsor decision in allowing a challenge to the state's marriage ban and its prohibition on same-sex couples jointly adopting children to go forward.

U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, quoted Kennedy in concluding that ""plaintiffs are entitled to their day in court and they shall have it.""

A separate case in Michigan also ""might cast a large shadow over a state law limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples,"" Georgetown University law professor Marty Lederman wrote on scotusblog.com.

In that dispute, public employees are challenging a Michigan law that cuts off domestic partner benefits for unmarried couples.

U.S. District Judge David Lawson, appointed by President Bill Clinton, partly relied on the recent Supreme Court case in saying, ""It is hard to argue with a straight face that the primary purpose, indeed, perhaps the sole purpose, of the statute is other than to deny health benefits to the same-sex partners of public employees. But that can never be a legitimate governmental purpose."" Lawson blocked the law for now, pending a trial.

When civil rights lawyers began their decadeslong quest to end official discrimination against black Americans, they pursued cases in state and federal courts that typically stopped short of the ultimate goal of overturning the Supreme Court decree in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 that ""separate but equal"" treatment of the races was permitted by the Constitution.

In a series of cases, the court chipped away at discrimination in higher education, including its 1950 decision in Sweatt v. Painter that said the University of Texas had to admit a black student to its law school because the one it created for black students did not offer an equivalent education. But even in June 1950, the court refused to re-examine the Plessy case.

Four more years elapsed before the court issued its seminal ruling in Brown v. Board of Education outlawing discrimination in public schools.

The prominent odd-couple lawyers who brought the California case to the Supreme Court, Republican Theodore Olson and Democrat David Boies, hoped the court would in one fell swoop get rid of 30 state constitutional bans on gay marriage and a few state statutes and declare that the right to marry cannot be abridged on the basis of sexual orientation and gender.

They failed to win that big victory, although their clients got married two days after the court decision.

For a time, Olson and Boies were at odds with many gay rights advocates who feared that asking the court to rule too broadly too soon could backfire. It turned out that the California case helped focus attention on gay marriage and perhaps sped up the shift in public opinion that now shows a majority in favor of same-sex marriage in most polls.

The different approaches have sometimes coexisted uneasily. That, too, is reminiscent of the civil rights movement, said Harvard Law School professor Mark Tushnet, who has written about the legal strategy of civil rights lawyers. ""There were lawsuits that the NAACP didn't want because they were seen as sure losers, but local lawyers went ahead and brought them anyway. They weren't part of the plan,"" Tushnet said.

Ten years ago, 13 states still had laws against sodomy when the court said that states have no right to intrude on the private, personal conduct of people, regardless of sexual orientation.

Interracial marriage still was illegal in 16 states in 1967 before the high court outlawed race-based state marriage bans.

In 1954, when the court issued its landmark Brown decision, 17 states had formally segregated school systems.

No one is sure what the magic number needs to be for the court to set a nationwide rule. Tushnet predicts that when roughly 40 states allow same-sex marriage, ""it is going to seem all right to tell Mississippi that it has to recognize gay marriage.""

Justice Antonin Scalia, a dissenter in 2003 and again this year, saw the seeds of same-sex marriage in the court's 2003 decision and he saw them again in the Windsor case, despite Kennedy's insistence that the opinion was limited.

""How easy it is, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status,"" Scalia said."

It might have been characteristically blunt, but Robertson neither singled out homosexuals nor questioned the humanity of gay people. Robertson focused on sexual behavior, including the sexual behavior of heterosexuals. The major media are merely using Robertson’s quotes to advance their own anti-Christian bigotry by smearing Christian beliefs as de facto bigotry and launching a McCarthyist campaign to silence Christians.

When you have major media outlets declaratively describing Robertson’s expression of his Christian beliefs as “anti-gay,” what you are really seeing is major media outlets outing themselves as anti-Christian.

Politico. CNN. The Hollywood Reporter. Entertainment Weekly. Yahoo. Variety. And so on…

Robertson listed more than a half-dozen sins other than homosexual behavior, including a number of heterosexual behaviors, and “the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers”.

It is certainly possible to try to disguise anti-gay bigotry as Christianity. Singling out gay people and not distinguishing between homosexuals as people and homosexual behavior are two of the most glaring examples.

But Robertson did neither. What he did do was to speak a Christian truth about various sins, and the media know this.

Anti-sin is not anti-gay.

But because the media and left are desperate to toxify Christianity as bigotry and bully Christians into silence, Robertson’s remarks are seen as the perfect opportunity to do both.

Of course it is an added benefit to the media to try to tarnish a culturally conservative mega-hit, and maybe drive it off the air.

What we have here is nothing more than the media practicing McCarthyism and disguising it as tolerance.

Notice how the media are not reporting on the most important thing Robertson said:

You put in your article that the Robertson family really believes strongly that if the human race loved each other and they loved God, we would just be better off. We ought to just be repentant, turn to God, and let’s get on with it, and everything will turn around.

Governor Sarah Palin put this exactly right when she said this is an attack on “all of us.”

Is Hillary Clinton, the Democrats’ presumptive 2016 presidential nominee, just now coming out now in support of gay marriage? How weird.

How is it possible that Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican stalwart who hails from the most conservative part of Ohio, beat her to the punch last week?

The gay marriage issue is just turning this world upside down.

As the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to overturn California’s law against gay marriage and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, every influential voice matters.

Certainly, the justices are not immune to the pull of history. They undoubtedly know that in the last 10 years, support for legalizing gay marriage has leapt. In the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, http://www.langerresearch.com/uploads/1147a5GayMarriage.pdf 58% support it, vs. 37% a decade ago.

President Obama has been out in favor of gay marriage for months, so it’s not as if the issue’s embrace by another high-profile liberal is going to make a difference to the justices. And Hillary can’t even be said to be a leader in her own family; both her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, are on record supporting gay marriage. Was anyone, anywhere holding his or her breath that Hillary would not support gay marriage?

By contrast, if you want to talk about courage, if you want to know who really put something on the line to support gay marriage, talk about Portman, a man whose anti-gay marriage cred is nothing short of impeccable. He was a cosponsor of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and has long espoused the idea that heterosexual-only marriage is a core value.

You can tick right down through the Republican platform and find virtually nothing with which this man disagrees. His party loyalty is one of the main reasons -- besides being a native of a swing state -- that Mitt Romney came close to choosing him as his running mate last year. This is a man who simply does not color outside the political lines.

Until now.

Two years ago, his oldest child, Will, told his parents, Rob and Jane, that he is gay. And that it was not a choice. In an op-ed for the Columbus Dispatch, Portman said he had decided to support gay marriage because of Will, who is now a freshman at Yale.

“Ronald Reagan said all great change in America begins at the dinner table, and that’s been the case in my family,” wrote Portman. “With the overwhelming majority of young people in support of allowing gay couples to marry, in some respects the issue has become more generational than partisan.'

Portman, a freshman senator who is up for reelection in 2016, is the only Republican in the Senate who supports gay marriage.

Despite surveys showing increasing support in the U.S. for gay marriage, Ohio conservatives have clung to the fact that in 2004, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage passed in their state with 62% of the vote.

The chairman of the Ohio Republican Party has said publicly the party will stand by Portman. Closer to Portman’s home in Cincinnati, Hamilton County GOP Chairman Alex Triantafilou said many younger Republicans are excited, but “a very vocal group of strong social conservatives” has made its displeasure known.

“Rob is so beloved here and so respected that he’s getting a lot of personal support,” said Triantafilou. “I don’t know that he will lead a revolution on this topic right away, though.”

Indeed. “It’s gonna cost him his seat,” predicted Phil Burress, president of Citizens for Community Values, a conservative evangelical group. Burress told me Monday that Portman, a good friend for decades, called him to share his change of heart about gay marriage the night before he went public.

Portman started off by saying he had “some bad news” and sounded depressed, said Burress, who “nearly dropped the phone” when Portman told him the reason for his call."

According to a press release, protestors gathered outside of the Ford Foundation on Sept. 26 in an effort to raise awareness of the institutionalized mistreatment and disenfranchisement of LGBT Jamaicans and Simpson-Miller's blind eye to their situation.

In 2011, Simpson-Miller promised LGBT Jamaicans a concise vote in Parliament surrounding the country's LGBT laws. However, this has yet to happen.

Jamaica Anti-Homophobia Stand reportedly wants Jamaica to legalize homosexuality.

Protestors shouted “Gay rights are human rights!” and “Portia, shame on you!” as the Prime Minister came out of the building, blew a kiss at the group, and returned inside.

Since its branding as the ""most homophobic place on earth"" in 2006 by Time magazine, Jamaica has gained international media attention surrounding its treatment of LGBT citizens. The country still operates under an ""abominable crime"" law of buggery that punishes sex between two men or two women with up to ten years of hard labor. As a result, LGBT Jamaicans live enshrouded within a culture of fear and violence, largely driven by the homophobic attitudes their friends and neighbors are raised to embody.

Earlier this summer, five gay men were trapped and barricaded in their home by members of their village after an ""alleged homosexual man... made statements that made them gravely concerned."" Additionally, a mob attempted to attack two men following a minor car accident because they perceived them to be gay, forcing the men to take refuge in a police station.

Increasingly violent instances of anti-LGBT sentiment have also plagued Jamaica, with an openly gay man having allegedly been stabbed to death and his house burned with his body inside late one evening.

The anti-LGBT violence pervading the country has sparked not only international outrage, put protests against Jamaica's homophobic climate. Though coverage of anti-LGBT violence in the country is sparse and limited, smaller news outlets have sprung up, enabling those outside of the nation to gain a perspective surrounding the lives of LGBT Jamaicans.

Jamaica Anti-Homophobia Stand is reportedly planning another protest on Saturday, Sept. 28 at the United Nations Plaza.

Bush, four former governors and two members of Congress — have signed a legal brief arguing that gay people have a constitutional right to marry, a position that amounts to a direct challenge to Speaker John A. Boehner and reflects the civil war in the party since the November election.

The document will be submitted this week to the Supreme Court in support of a suit seeking to strike down Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative barring same-sex marriage, and all similar bans. The court will hear back-to-back arguments next month in that case and another pivotal gay rights case that challenges the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act.

The Proposition 8 case already has a powerful conservative supporter: Theodore B. Olson, the former solicitor general under Mr. Bush and one of the suit’s two lead lawyers. The amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief is being filed with Mr. Olson’s blessing. It argues, as he does, that same-sex marriage promotes family values by allowing children of gay couples to grow up in two-parent homes, and that it advances conservative values of “limited government and maximizing individual freedom.”

Legal analysts said the brief had the potential to sway conservative justices as much for the prominent names attached to it as for its legal arguments. The list of signers includes a string of Republican officials and influential thinkers — 75 as of Monday evening — who are not ordinarily associated with gay rights advocacy, including some who are speaking out for the first time and others who have changed their previous positions."

A gay teacher at a Catholic high school in Glendora was fired after he married his partner and photos of the wedding were published in a local newspaper last month.

Ken Bencomo, 45, of Rancho Cucamonga was fired from his teaching position at St. Lucy’s Priory High School days after he married his partner of 10 years.

He and his partner, Christopher Persky, 32, were among the first couples married at the San Bernardino County Assessor-Recorder’s Office following a U.S. Supreme Court decision that allowed gay couples to marry in California.

Photos of the ceremony were published in the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin.

School officials had been aware of his sexual orientation for about 10 of the 17 years Bencomo has been employed by the high school, said Patrick McGarrigle, Bencomo’s attorney.

School officials specifically mentioned the wedding and the publicity it received during a meeting at which Bencomo was informed that he had been fired, McGarrigle said.

Bencomo, through his attorney, declined to comment.

“Ken was one of the school’s star educators and the decision to terminate him because he lawfully married a man is just heartbreaking to him –- it’s crushing,” McGarrigle said. “It shows a terrible error of judgment and complete disregard of Ken and what he has brought to the school.”

On multiple occasions over the years, McGarrigle said, Bencomo has introduced Persky as his partner to administrators at school events.

In a statement released through an attorney, the school said it is “a community of faith for those who wish to express, practice and adhere to values in education based on the Roman Catholic tradition.”

“While the school does not discriminate against teachers or other school employees based on their private lifestyle choices, public displays of behavior that are directly contrary to church teachings are inconsistent with these values,” the statement reads. “These values are incorporated into the contractual obligations of each of our instructors and other employees.”

Bencomo hopes to resolve the situation without legal action, but has not ruled out filing a lawsuit, McGarrigle said.

“The school went to the Draconian measure of firing him without warning and without legal reason,” he said. “The haven’t expressed any interest in finding a way for Ken to return.”

An online petition to reinstate Bencomo’s position at the school garnered nearly 10,000 signatures by Thursday afternoon.

Brittany Littleton, a 2008 graduate of the school who created the petition, said that she was appalled to learn that Bencomo had been fired for something that was common knowledge through her entire time at the school.

“He never made it part of the discussion and he never pushed his personal life on us,” she said. “But we knew, the school knew, teachers knew -– it was never a problem.”

For the record, 9:58 a.m., August 2: A previous version of this post said incorrectly that Bencomo was informed during a meeting with school officials that his contract would not be renewed for the upcoming school year. His contract for the next school year had actually already been approved and he was informed that he had been fired.

Although there have been suits against wedding industry businesses that refuse to serve gay couples, attorneys promoting the bylaw changes say they don't know of any lawsuits against churches.

Critics say the changes are unnecessary, but some churches fear that it's only a matter of time before one of them is sued.

""I thought marriage was always between one man and one woman, but the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision said no,"" said Gregory S. Erwin, an attorney for the Louisiana Baptist Convention, an association of Southern Baptist churches and one several groups advising churches to change their bylaws. ""I think it's better to be prepared because the law is changing. America is changing.""

In a June decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law. A second decision was more technical but essentially ushered in legal gay marriage in California.

Kevin Snider is an attorney with the Pacific Justice Institute, a nonprofit legal defense group that specializes in conservative Christian issues. His organization released a model marriage policy a few years ago in response to a statewide gay marriage fight in California. Snider said some religious leaders have been threatened with lawsuits for declining to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies.

Dean Inserra, head pastor of the 1,000-member City Church Tallahassee, based in Florida, said he does not want to be alarmist, but his church is looking into how best to address the issue.

Inserra said he already has had to say no to gay friends who wanted him to perform a wedding ceremony.

""We have some gay couples that attend our church. What happens when they ask us to do their wedding?"" Inserra said. ""What happens when we say no? Is it going to be treated like a civil rights thing?""

Critics, including some gay Christian leaders, argue that the changes amount to a solution looking for a problem.

""They seem to be under the impression that there is this huge movement with the goal of forcing them to perform ceremonies that violate their freedom of religion,"" said Justin Lee, executive director of the Gay Christian Network, a nonprofit that provides support for gay Christians and their friends and families and encourages churches to be more welcoming.

""If anyone tried to force a church to perform a ceremony against their will, I would be the first person to stand up in that church's defense.""

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia now recognize gay marriage.

Some Christian denominations, such as the United Church of Christ and the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, accept gay marriage. The Episcopal Church recently approved a blessing for same-sex couples, but each bishop must decide whether to allow the ceremony in his or her local diocese.

The majority of Christian denominations, however, view homosexual relationships as sinful. In more hierarchical denominations, like the Roman Catholic Church or the United Methodist Church, individual churches are bound by the policies of the larger denomination. But nondenominational churches and those loosely affiliated with more established groups often individually decide how to address social issues such as gay marriage.

Eric Rassbach is an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest legal group that defends the free expression rights of all faiths. He said it is unlikely the government would try to force a pastor to perform a same-sex marriage, but churches that rent out their facilities to the general public could face problems if they refuse to rent to gay couples.

Although his organization has not advocated it, he said it could strengthen a church's legal position to adopt a statement explaining its beliefs about marriage.

""A number of groups don't have a written doctrine,"" Rassbach said. ""Say a group like the Primitive Baptists -- they don't want a written-down credo, but the courts like written-down things.""

Rassbach said it was important for churches to get their beliefs in writing before a dispute arises, otherwise it can look to a court as if something was done after the fact as an attempt to cover up hostility to gays.

Airline Baptist Church Senior Pastor Chad Mills said members of the public use their facilities in is Bossier City, La., for many activities, including Zumba classes. In the past, anyone who could pay the fee was allowed to reserve the space. But recently, the church changed its rental policy to allow wedding-related events only for male-female couples.

Some denominations are less concerned about the Supreme Court rulings. The Assemblies of God, the group of churches comprising the world's largest Pentecostal denomination, sought legal advice after the rulings. An attorney for the group distributed a memo to ministers saying there was no reason to change their bylaws.

However, the memo also said that ""doing so is not inappropriate, and may be warranted based on future rulings by the Supreme Court and other state and federal courts.""

The bylaw changes are coming at a time when many churches are wrestling with gay marriage in general and are working hard to be more welcoming to gays and lesbians.

""It's probably one of the most difficult issues our churches are facing right now,"" said Doug Anderson, a national coordinator with the evangelical Vineyard Church. ""It's almost an impossible situation to reconcile what's going on in our culture, and our whole theology of welcoming and loving people, versus what it says in the Bible."""

Eventually, she’ll probably take the plunge — just not yet. In the meantime, though, she can execute an impressive maneuver from lower heights.

In other words, the justices seemed tempted to put off deciding the question of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. But they appear, at least reading the oral-argument tea leaves, prepared to take the significant step of overturning the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and granting full federal benefits to same-sex couples in states that recognize their marriages.

Indeed, the juxtaposition of the two cases may have the beneficial effect, from the perspective of those supporting same-sex marriage, of making the DOMA case look like a relatively easy and modest move.

Ultimately, will a majority of the court find that the Constitution protects the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry? Maybe it’s wishful thinking, but the comments in Tuesday’s arguments on California’s Proposition 8 suggested the possibility of a skittish, tenuous majority inclined toward finding a right.

Caption Oral arguments in the legal battle to extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples — and to grant federal recognition of such unions — was difficult to imagine even a decade ago. March 27, 2013 College student Adam Sulier, brandishing a sign supporting same-sex marriage rights, rides on the shoulders of classmate Cam Tucker while waiting in front of the Supreme Court. Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the likely swing vote, worried openly about the court being asked “to go into uncharted waters.” But, he told Charles Cooper, who was defending the ban, “there are some 40,000 children in California” who “want their parents to have full recognition and full status. The voice of those children is important in this case, don’t you think?”

Actually, what Cooper thinks doesn’t matter. But if Kennedy is hearing those voices, that signals where in those uncharted waters the court may end up.

The two days of oral argument underscored how difficult it is for opponents of marriage equality to concoct a convincing case for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. Cooper was reduced to citing the state’s supposed interest in “responsible procreation,” within the context of marriage.

Yet as Justice Elena Kagan pointed out, this rationale explains why same-sex couples might not be included in the definition of marriage — it doesn’t provide a basis for excluding them, any more than couples too old to have children could be barred from marrying.

The next day, the argument from Paul Clement, supporting DOMA on behalf of Republicans in the House of Representatives, boiled down to the alleged federal need for “uniformity” in administering benefits.

Again, Kagan: “Historically, the only uniformity that the federal government has pursued is that it’s uniformly recognized the marriages that are recognized by the state.”

Indeed, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out, discriminating against same-sex couples is hardly uniform. “You are treating the married couples differently,” she said. “You are saying that New York’s married couples are different than Nebraska’s.”

The arguments also illustrated how far the legal and political debate on gay rights has come. Just 27 years ago, the court ruled, in a case since overturned, that states could, consistent with the Constitution, criminalize homosexual conduct. At the Proposition 8 arguments, Cooper — the lawyer for the anti-gay rights side — took pains to make clear how much his argument for treating gays differently was limited to matters of marriage.

Sotomayor: “Outside of the marriage context, can you think of any other rational basis . . . for a state using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens on them? . . . Denying them a job, not granting them benefits of some sort, any other decision?”

Cooper: “Your honor, I cannot.”

Likewise, in the DOMA case, Chief Justice John Roberts, seeking to head off the claim that laws discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny by courts, cited the increasing political power of gays and lesbians.

“As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case,” he told Roberta Kaplan, representing Edith Windsor, a New York woman who had to pay an extra $300,000 in extra estate taxes after her spouse died.

As Justice Samuel Alito noted in the Prop 8 case, the court is being asked to render judgment “based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cellphones or the Internet.” That explains the court’s understandable edginess about wading into the issue right away. But, like cellphones and the Internet, same-sex marriage is here to stay — and destined to be back before the high court.

SALT LAKE CITY (RNS) -- In the week since a federal judge overturned Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage, the number of weddings in the state has skyrocketed, shattering records and accruing thousands of dollars for Utah’s 29 counties.

As of close of business Thursday (Dec. 26), more than 1,225 marriage licenses had been issued in Utah since last Friday (Dec. 20). Of those, at least 74 percent, or 905 licenses, were issued to gay and lesbian couples.

Marriage licenses in Utah cost between $30 and $50, depending on the county.

With an average marriage license costing $40, counties in Utah made a grand total of more than $49,000 in the three-and-a-half days most county clerk’s offices were open this week.

About three-quarters of that money came from gay and lesbian couples seeking marriage licenses in the immediate aftermath of U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling that overturned a statewide ban on same-sex marriages.

Salt Lake County shattered a previously held record of 85 marriages in a given day, by handing out 353 on Monday (Dec. 23) — the first full day of issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

On the other hand, Piute, a small county of about 1,500 people in the center of the state, was of several counties with no takers. Had any Piute couples requested a license, they would have been denied anyway.

County Clerk Valeen Brown is on vacation until Monday (Dec. 30), officials said. So, Piute officials suspended all marriage license activity until Brown returns.

Utah County — which made national news this week when Shelly Eyre and her partner Cheryl Haws declared that they would sue its clerk for denying gay and lesbian couples — was doling out certificates Thursday to all.

“Moving forward, we probably won’t keep track of how many same-sex couples versus opposite-sex couples we issue licenses to,” said Bryan Thompson, the county’s clerk and auditor. “I don’t see any reason to differentiate between them.”

http://news.yahoo.com/couples-seek-ruling-illinois-gay-marriage-case-181308092.html,,[],Couples seek ruling in Illinois gay marriage case,"CHICAGO (AP) — Twenty-five couples who filed a lawsuit challenging Illinois' ban on gay marriage asked a judge on Wednesday to rule quickly in their favor, saying a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down part of a law denying federal benefits to married gay couples creates a new urgency in the state.

Illinois legalized civil unions two years ago, but the recent Supreme Court decision applies only to married gay couples.

Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois filed a motion for summary judgment in Cook County Circuit Court. They said Judge Sophia Hall could rule on the motion as soon as Aug. 6, when oral arguments are scheduled on a defense motion to dismiss the lawsuit.

""We will say that we should win as a matter of law"" under the state constitution, said Camilla Taylor, Lambda Legal's marriage project director. ""Illinois now is the only thing standing between these families and numerous federal rights.""

A lawyer representing five downstate county clerks — who are defending the ban after the state attorney general and Cook County prosecutor refused to do so — said the request is premature because all the evidence has not yet been presented. He also complained that the plaintiffs took nine months to respond to the motion to dismiss the case.

""For them to come in (now) ... has me wondering if they're particularly confident of their legal position as a matter of law,"" said Peter Breen, executive director of the Thomas More Society, a public interest law firm that opposes gay marriage.

Wednesday's motion comes a day after civil rights lawyers in Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn that state's 17-year-old ban on same-sex marriage and to force the state to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples who wed in other jurisdictions.

Same-sex marriage is legal, or soon will be, in 13 states. Federal courts in California are so far the only ones that have said a state same-sex marriage ban violates the U.S. Constitution. Meanwhile, federal court challenges are emerging in other states, including Nevada, Hawaii and Michigan. In the coming days and weeks, the ACLU plans to lodge same-sex marriage challenges in North Carolina and Virginia.

Story continues

It also is pursuing same-sex marriage legislation in several other states and referenda in Oregon and Nevada in the coming years, ACLU lawyers said.

Illinois' lawsuit was filed last year against Cook County Clerk David Orr, a supporter of gay marriage whose office is responsible for issuing marriage licenses in Chicago and the rest of the county. All plaintiffs had applied for and been denied marriage licenses in Cook County.

But in an unusual move, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez declined to defend the state's 17-year-old ban, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, saying it violates the state constitution's equal protection clause. The downstate clerks later were granted permission to intervene.

Alvarez said it was her job to represent Orr, and they both agreed with the plaintiffs. Madigan said she would file arguments in support of the plaintiffs.

John Knight, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Project of the ACLU of Illinois, said only marriage will ensure that gay couples in Illinois get protections that other married couples enjoy, including family medical leave and veterans and tax benefits.

James Darby, an 81-year-old Korean War veteran, said he wants to be buried in Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Illinois, along with his partner of 50 years, Patrick Bova, 75. But as of now, that's impossible.

""I gave up four years of my life during the Korean War, I served my country ... and I came back home and expected to have the same rights as everyone else,"" said Darby. ""But I'm considered a second-class citizen in my own state.""

Bova said he's ""looking forward to the time when our marriage and its practical and emotional aspects will be realized. I think 50 years is a long time to wait.""

(CNN) – Conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage must accept that they’ve “lost the issue,” radio host Rush Limbaugh argued Thursday.

“This issue is lost,” the conservative firebrand said. “I don't care what the Supreme Court does, this is now inevitable - and it's inevitable because we lost the language on this. “



Limbaugh went on to assert conservatives “lost the issue when we started allowing the word ‘marriage’ to be bastardized and redefined by simply adding words to it.”

“Marriage is one thing, and it was not established on the basis of discrimination,” he continued. “It wasn't established on the basis of denying people anything. ‘Marriage’ is not a tradition that a bunch of people concocted to be mean to other people with. But we allowed the left to have people believe that it was structured that way. “

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the legality of same-sex marriage earlier this week.

Another notable conservative, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, said on Tuesday that same-sex marriage advocates have a more convincing argument than opponents, who do nothing but rehash scripture to make their point.

""The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals,"" O'Reilly said Tuesday on Fox. ""That's where the compelling argument is. 'We're Americans. We just want to be treated like everybody else.' That's a compelling argument, and to deny that, you have got to have a very strong argument on the other side. The argument on the other side hasn't been able to do anything but thump the Bible.""

O'Reilly has previously stated he takes a libertarian view on the issue, and repeated Tuesday night that it's a decision that should be left up to the states. ""I support civil unions. I always have. The gay marriage thing, I don't feel that strongly about it one way or another."""

The justices could decide that the sponsors of the ballot measure outlawing same-sex marriage had no legal right, or standing, to defend it in federal court. That would end the case in Washington, but it is not clear what it would mean for California.

If state officials declared Proposition 8 dead, relying on U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker’s 2010 ruling against the measure, same-sex weddings could commence within weeks or months. Or there could be another legal fight over the reach of Walker’s ruling.

That technicality has prompted fierce arguments among prominent law professors over legal procedure. Their debate has taken place on legal blogs, with scholars staking out sharply different stands.

“It’s become a cottage industry,” said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for the challengers.

Depending on what the Supreme Court decides, a ruling on standing could provoke a fight over whether the San Francisco judge’s decision applies statewide or only to the two couples who sued or the counties where they live, Los Angeles and Alameda.

On one side is Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine law school. He says Walker’s ruling affects all of California because it ordered state officials to stop enforcing Proposition 8. Marriage is a matter of state law, not local law, he said.

On the other is UC Davis law professor Vikram Amar, who says Walker’s order would be limited because the suit was filed on behalf of two couples, not all gay couples, and included only two of the state’s 58 counties as defendants.

Amar’s point of view was bolstered by a liberal judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, who in 2011 chided the high-profile anti-Proposition 8 legal team for failing to have sued more defendants.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage across the U.S.

Gay rights lawyers are counting on Gov. Jerry Brown and Atty. Gen. Kamala D. Harris, who support same-sex marriage, to view Walker’s ruling as a statewide mandate and enforce it.

“We have definitely been communicating our views to them,” Boutrous said.

University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt said that even though he doubts Walker had the authority to issue a statewide ruling, Brown could choose to follow it.

“It would be perfectly permissible for the governor to say that this law has been held invalid, and I agree with that decision, and I will not enforce it any further,” Roosevelt said.

Such a step conceivably could lead to same-sex weddings before a court even had time to rule on the breadth of Walker’s ruling. The judiciary would still have the final say, though, and could stop the nuptials once a challenge was filed.

If the Supreme Court ruled that Proposition 8’s sponsors had no right to appeal, then the 9th Circuit’s decision, upholding Walker’s ruling, would be wiped out, leaving only Walker’s order. The high court could resolve any confusion by deciding the reach of Walker’s injunction, or it could let lower courts resolve it.

During the 9th Circuit’s hearing on the case, Judge Stephen Reinhardt grilled the Proposition 8 challengers on why they had not named more defendants to ensure a statewide impact.

“Plaintiffs could have obtained a statewide injunction had they filed an action against a broader set of defendants, a simple matter of pleading,” Reinhardt later wrote in a concurrence in a Proposition 8 order. “Why preeminent counsel and the major law firms of which they are a part failed to do that is a matter on which I will not speculate.”

Boutrous said the legal team considered filing a class action but decided it was unnecessary.

If only two counties could marry same-sex couples or only two gay couples could wed, “it would make no sense,” Boutrous said. “Los Angeles and Alameda would become the mecca for marriage, like Niagara Falls.”

To be sure, the debate may not even arise if the high court decides the dispute in another way. It could rule on the constitutional questions or even dismiss the case by saying the justices should never have taken it up, which would leave the 9th Circuit’s decision in place.

California voters passed Proposition 8 in 2008, six months after the California Supreme Court gave gays the right to wed. The state high court later upheld the initiative as a valid state constitutional amendment.

In anticipation of the state court’s ruling, a newly formed gay rights group hired renowned lawyers Theodore B. Olson and David Boies to sue in federal court in San Francisco. Their suit attacked the measure on federal constitutional grounds and named two same-sex couples as plaintiffs.

Walker held a trial and ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional. The 9th Circuit, in a 2-1 ruling written by Reinhardt, agreed that the law had to be struck down but relied on different legal reasoning. The 9th Circuit has jurisdiction over several Western states but limited its ruling to California. Proposition 8’s sponsors then appealed to the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule late next month.

Procedurally, if the Supreme Court decides Proposition 8 supporters lacked the right to bring an appeal, the case would return to the 9th Circuit., That court could then lift its hold on Walker’s order, lawyers said. Any further challenges would be heard in district court in San Francisco. The Supreme Court decision would take effect in 25 days, the lawyers said.

Walker, who served as the Northern California district’s chief judge, and his successor have both retired. Judge Claudia Wilken, a Clinton appointee, now heads the district court and may inherit the dispute.

ProtectMarriage, the sponsors of Proposition 8, insist that Walker’s ruling affected only the two gay couples who sued. But the group did not appeal the scope of his injunction at the time.

If the Supreme Court determines that ProtectMarriage has no standing, the group would have to find a surrogate, possibly a county clerk opposed to gay marriage, to make its arguments in court. And that clerk would then also have to show standing.

“One would hope our opponents would say it is time to stop this fight and move on to something else,” Boutrous said.

Gay rights lawyers said they would advise couples that they could marry legally if Brown follows Walker’s ruling, even with continued litigation.

“People are just grasping at straws to think there is a problem,” said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights group.

Most Americans, however, know this self-proclaimed defender of the Constitution and freedoms and whatnot mostly from his alcohol-fueled boating crash last year (and yes, there were injuries, and yes, he's still facing charges).

In this new, miserably depressing story on Dwyer, he cites two things as the reasons for the ""increased"" drinking that culminated in his crash with another boat, causing him multiple injuries and fracturing the skull of a five-year-old girl. The first is his 2011 separation from his wife. The second is the pressure of being in the legislature, but more specifically, that time other legislators ""betrayed"" him by not being sufficiently anti-gay-marriage themselves:



Dwyer says he felt sold out when Dels. Tiffany Alston, Wade Kach and Bob Costa voted for same-sex marriage, an issue he spent years crusading against. Dwyer told reporters one day before the vote that he had enough support to block the bill. Kach, a Republican from Baltimore County, and Alston, a former Democrat from Prince George’s County, voted against the bill in committee. But Kach changed his vote after hearing testimony from gay couples. Alston shifted her vote after her amendment was adopted. Kach and Costa, of Deale, were the only two House Republicans to vote for the bill. It passed the House by two votes in February. “I had no time to do anything,” Dwyer said. “Had I known earlier, I could have taken some action.” It was petitioned to the November ballot and passed by 52 percent of voters state wide. Voters in Dwyer’s district, however, rejected it. “That betrayal really affected me,” he said. “I was physically ill. You pour your heart into an issue like that and it’s devastating.” He said his drinking culminated in the crash.

So an intense hatred of gay marriage—and not having that hatred reciprocated by his fellow legislators and voters—is what drove this poor defender of proper marriage and proper faith to booze up and crash his damn boat into another boat. That's some powerful hatred, right there.

In the wake of the crash, Dwyer did not resign as any decent person might, instead gaudily announcing he needs to stay put to ""defend individual liberty against unconstitutional laws,"" but he does admit he needs to rebuild ""trust"" with voters. I don't know that voters should be keen on reelecting someone whose past reaction to other people being insufficiently anti-gay was to booze up and nearly get some people killed, but I am not from Maryland, I am not a Republican voter, and Dwyer seems confident that all will be forgiven, allowing him to get back to expressing his obsessively anti-gay frustrations in some hopefully less child-skull-fracturing ways.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what it means to be an American religious conservative.

Pelosi pontificated:

And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring, as the president does, the Constitution. When you pass a bill in the House, as we did with the health care bill, we made it iron clad constitutionally. You have a responsibility to honor the Constitution. In fact, we take an oath to do just that, and that is the oath that President Obama is upholding.

Attacking the GOP’s support for the Defense of Marriage Act, Pelosi whined:

We weigh equities. Congress passes a bill. It’s questionable in terms of constitutionality. There’s no question about your oath to the Constitution of the United States, and the behavior of the Republicans in the House of Representatives on this subject has been so irresponsible. First of all, why in this time would you pass a bill that increases discrimination? We’re going in the direction of the arc of Justice [Henry L.] Benning in favor of more justice, not more discrimination. Why would you do such a thing in the first place? And then when it is questioned in terms of its constitutionality to spend money in the tune of millions outside the regular order of how that money should be spent to defend increasing discrimination in our society, it’s just plain wrong. And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring, as the president does, the Constitution.

Pelosi boasted of her home city’s influence in the assault on traditional values, claiming that same-sex marriage is “inevitable.” She continued:

From our beautiful place in San Francisco, the city of St. Francis, we knew that it was inevitable that all of this would happen. It was inconceivable to others that it would, and it was our job to use whatever influence we could have to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable. And I think that’s what’s happening at the court because of many people’s courage, especially those directly, personally affected."

You will change your profile pic to show that you are supportive - but what are you ACTUALLY doing to help our country? I promise the supreme court doesn't care about your Facebook profile picture.

Every time I see a Facebook status or a tweet that reads like this:I know right away that the person behind the words has no tangible friendship or touchable connection with a person who is gay. I know that the person is speaking from a place devoid of the sort of empathy that comes from truly connecting with a person who is being deprived of rights.

Because let me tell you why I changed my profile picture to that small, meaningless speck of red peppered with two horizontal bars. I did it not because I think it's going to influence Justice Kennedy's legal opinion. I'm a few months shy of being a lawyer, so I'm in as good a position as anyone to know that matters like this are decided in the reaches of highly analytical and highly calculated minds that sit under black robes.

No. I change my profile picture because I have friends who are gay. I have former co-workers who've displayed to me their humanity through their professionalism and their skill. I have friends who I've sat with to discuss the ways in which real-world bigotry keeps them from enjoying a full life. These are people I respect, and they are people who deserve respect.

And they should know that in their fight, in their battle for equality, they are not alone. I can't imagine what it must have been like to have been a black person during the 1960s, fighting out of second-hand citizenship to a place of at least some equality. If I had been there, and I had been black, I I might have looked to some of the people I thought were friends, and I might have said: ""Are you out there?""

I change my profile picture because, unlike you, conservative who is only concerned about concepts like ""children starving"" and ""poverty"" when it helps you make a point about the triviality of gay marriage, I understand that the freedom of each of us is tied to the freedom of everyone. It's that unmalleable concept that says to my gay friends: your liberation is bound up with mine.

I change my profile picture not because I've forgotten that there are big problems in the world. To the contrary, it's because I remember that our problems are big, and big problems are only solved by groups of people with the conviction to stand up with one another and for one another. Because during a day when I might advocate for protections for the poor, I can take a few seconds out to show my gay brothers and sisters that they are loved, respected, and worthy of support. It's not because I'm some great ambassador for gay rights. It's them, my friends so willing to fight for their own rights, who are the heroes, and if I can do the smallest something to show them that they're not on an island, then I will do that.

My profile picture didn't change because I think such a change will change the world. It changed because I'm lucky enough to have tangible relationships with real people whose lives are dramatically affected by this movement. And I'm sorry that you don't."

Speaking at the annual Values Voter Summit, a gathering of conservative Christians in Washington, Rios painted a picture of a nation under siege by homosexuals.

Rios, the former president of the conservative Christian group Concerned Women of America, referenced a recent story in The Advocate, a national magazine geared toward LGBT readers, that challenges the narrative of the Matthew Shepard story. The article examines a new book by Stephen Jimenez, The Book of Matt, which suggests Shepard's murder was drug-related.

In Rios' retelling, however, Shepard's murder was part of a long-term plan by liberals and the LGBT community to create a society that is accepting of gay people.

It is up to Christian conservatives, Rios argued, to stop that acceptance. ""We can't let [gay people] keep breaking hearts and taking lives,"" she said, one of a number of references Rios made to her theory that gay men are responsible for the AIDS epidemic.

""You think youth is worshipped in heterosexual sex? It is top of the line [for gay men]. And they like young men, young virile men,"" Rios told a crowd of hundreds in the ballroom of the Omni Shoreham Hotel. ""You get old and you're a gay man? There's so much rejection.""

Rios also railed against the nonprofit civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks and catalogues extremist and hate groups in the United States. Rios said the SPLC ""cares more about attacking American Christians than it does about protecting"" the civil rights of African-Americans, which the group has done for more than three decades.

SPLC and a coalition of other human rights groups encouraged members of Congress not to speak at the Values Voter Summit because a number of the sponsoring groups, including the American Family Association and the Family Research Council, hold extremist anti-gay views.

President Barack Obama in 2009 passed anti-hate crimes legislation named after Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., who was also killed in a hate crime."

Kennedy will approach the two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. But I haven’t heard anyone wondering which side Antonin Scalia will be on. He has made his views on gay relationships painfully clear.

In December, Scalia spoke at Princeton University, where I am a freshman, and I asked him about language he used in past decisions involving gay rights — language that I, as a gay man, found extraordinarily offensive.

In my question, I quoted from two of Scalia’s opinions (both of them dissents). One passage came from the case of Romer vs. Evans, which involved a Colorado statute banning laws that recognized gay people as a protected class. Scalia wrote: “I had thought that one could consider certain conduct reprehensible — murder, for example, or polygamy, or cruelty to animals — and could exhibit even ‘animus’ toward such conduct. Surely that is the only sort of ‘animus’ at issue here: moral disapproval of homosexual conduct.”

PHOTOS: Battle of the gay marriage signs

I asked if he had come to regret that language. He hadn’t. In response to my question, he posed two questions of his own: “If we cannot have moral feelings against homosexuality, can we have it against murder? Can we have it against these other things?”

I hadn’t really expected Scalia to apologize for his language. He has been remarkably consistent over his judicial career. Still, I had hoped, and continue to hope, that my question might lead Scalia to think about the language he uses in the soon-to-be-decided cases of U.S. vs. Windsor and Hollingsworth vs. Perry, which will determine the fates, respectively, of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and California’s Proposition 8. I know from personal experience that poisonous language like Scalia’s can be devastatingly hurtful.

Growing up in Northern California, I struggled to accept the fact that I was gay. I was labeled a “faggot” in middle school too many times to count. I listened to my neighbor explain how California needed Proposition 8 to “protect the children.” I heard my grandfather declare that San Francisco’s gay community was “just different from the rest of us.” Those words hurt, and honestly, they still do. Although I am very close to my parents, I only felt comfortable coming out to them a month before putting my question to Scalia.

TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronology

More than half of LGBT youth report having been verbally assaulted or attacked with anti-gay slurs. For some, it leaves a permanent scar. For others, it proves too much to handle, which is why an appallingly high number of gay teens commit suicide.

I tell myself that verbal assaults are rooted in ignorance. But I still haven’t figured out how to reassure myself when the ignorance is emanating from the nation’s highest court. In the 2003 case of Lawrence vs. Texas, the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law banning sodomy. Scalia’s dissent in the case, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, embraced the idea that citizens should be able to pass laws banning sexual behavior they find “immoral and unacceptable,” including such things as “adult incest, bestiality and obscenity.”

I have every confidence that history will judge Scalia harshly, and that one day it will be unacceptable to equate laws against consensual gay sex with laws against incest and bestiality. But I still worry about the impact of his language in the here and now.

OPINION L.A.: For Scalia, no gay people, just gay sex?

In the next couple of months, the court will issue its rulings on Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, and we’re likely to hear more of his views on the morality of gay relationships. Still, I can’t help but hope that this time he will consider how words have the potential to lead people to desperation and self-destruction. Wouldn’t it be great if Scalia surprised us this time?

USA TODAY

Alaska senator says she supports right of people %22to marry the person they love and choose%22

Murkowski joins GOP Sens. Rob Portman and Mark Kirk to back gay marriage

Supreme Court is considering two cases dealing with controversial issue

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has endorsed same-sex marriage, becoming the third Republican senator to do so.

In a statement posted Wednesday on her website, Murkowski said supporting same-sex marriage is consistent with her values as a ""lifelong Republican"" who believes in ""promoting freedom and limiting the reach of government.""

""I support the right of all Americans to marry the person they love and choose because I believe doing so promotes both values: it keeps politicians out of the most private and personal aspects of people's lives -- while also encouraging more families to form and more adults to make a lifetime commitment to one another,"" she said.

Murkowski joins Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Mark Kirk of Illinois to voice support for the right of same-sex couples to marry. The highly charged issue is taking on new importance as the Supreme Court considers two cases dealing with gay marriage.

The justices, who are trying to complete work this month before their summer break, could rule as early as Thursday on California's gay marriage ban and the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group, praised Murkowski, who had said earlier this year that her views on gay marriage were ""evolving.""

""Senator Murkowski's courageous and principled announcement today sends a clear message that marriage equality must come to all 50 state in this country,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. ""As the Supreme Court prepares to rule in two landmark marriage cases this month, a growing bipartisan coalition is standing up for the right of all couples to marry -- and there is no turning back that tide.""

Several senators, who were previously opposed or on the fence, issued statements supporting gay marriage in March as the court heard arguments in the two marriage lawsuits.

In her statement, Murkowski said she was influenced in part by an Alaskan family headed by two lesbians who have adopted four siblings to give them a home together. ""This first-class Alaskan family still lives a second-class existence,"" she wrote.

Murkowski, who is Catholic, said she believes religious institutions should have the right to define marriage on their own terms. But she is clear about the government's role.

""Churches must be allowed to define marriage and conduct ceremonies according to their rules,"" she said, ""but the government should not tell people who they have a right to marry through a civil ceremony.""

http://news.yahoo.com/more-wines-coming-support-gay-200018865.html,,[],More wines coming out in support of gay marriage,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wineries are coming out loud and proud in their support of gay marriage. They're putting it right on the label.

""Little by little, we're breaking down the barrier,"" says Gary Saperstein of Out in the Vineyard, an events and tour company based in Sonoma wine country that caters to gay travelers.

One of the barrier-breakers is Same Sex Meritage, a red blend that sends its message on the bottle and at the cash register — $1 for every bottle sold is donated to the advocacy group Freedom to Marry.

""It's the right thing to do,"" says Matt Gold, who is based in Chicago and teamed with Josh Stein of Stein Family Wines in California to make the wine, which launched last December. Meritage is a brand name that refers to a Bordeaux-style blend. And, of course, it sounds a lot like marriage.

Gold and Stein see their business partnership as a way to make wine and make a statement. ""Everyone should have the right to marry. Everyone should have the same rights as anyone else,"" says Gold.

Same Sex Meritage isn't the only wine reaching out to the LGBT community.

Egalite, a bubbly from the Burgundy region of France, was launched earlier this year with the name — French for equality — reflecting the wine's origins as a Burgundy cremant (sparkling wine) and its support for the gay community. Each quarter, a portion of profits is donated to a LGBT nonprofit organization chosen by fans of the wine on Facebook; $15,000 has been donated since the wine's January launch.

From Stand Tall Wines, there's Genetic Pinot Noir, which refers to sexual orientation having genetic origins. Stand Tall Wines was founded by Larisa Stephenson and partner Dana Sabin. The wine is being made in the Napa Valley using grapes shipped from Oregon's Willamette Valley and 1 percent of Genetic sales is being donated to the Napa LBGTQ Project (which is the process of changing its name to LGBTQ Connection).

And though it doesn't have a message-specific label, Barefoot Wine & Bubbly has been supporting marriage rights for gays for 25 years, donating to local LGBT centers and other organizations, investing in Pride Week events, even putting up a 20-foot-tall inflatable wedding cake in front of San Francisco's City Hall to show support for gay marriage.

Story continues

""We definitely love to celebrate the LGBT community and all of its progress,"" says Jerime Black, Barefoot's national LGBT sales and marketing manager. ""Barefoot really is all about fun. It's taking the stuffiness out of wine.""

OK, so not too many major wine companies have an LGBT marketing manager. So far as he knows, Black is the only one of his kind. ""I like to say I have the gay man's dream job,"" he jokes. But there has been a growing awareness of the importance of that community.

Along with the philosophical statements, the marketing effort makes good economic sense. Saperstein credits some of the awareness of LGBT consumers to the economic crisis. With consumers cutting back on luxury purchases, producers started studying the market, looking for niches.

Out in the Vineyard sponsors a Gay Wine Weekend each June and this year had more than 30 wineries involved at various levels of participation.

For Sonoma and Napa Valley producers, the LGBT market is a particularly good fit since the wine regions are close to San Francisco and its substantial gay population which, Saperstein points out, includes a lot of people who love food and wine.

As with all marketing, it's important to back up the message with a real commitment. ""Don't think it's a one-time hit and you're going to get a payback right away. You have to show the community that you care,"" says Saperstein.

Gold's aware that message-specific wines are in danger of being dismissed as a gimmick, which is why he and Stein work to make sure the wine in the bottle lives up to the label.

""We have to have a good quality wine,"" he says. ""Otherwise people are only going to buy it once.""

Instead of defending state and federal laws defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman, President Obama and Gov. Jerry Brown of California urged courts to hold them unconstitutional.

That has complicated the Supreme Court’s job in challenges to Proposition 8, California’s ban on same-sex marriages, and to the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Because the plaintiffs and defendants in both cases agree that the laws under review are unconstitutional, there is a question about whether the justices have anything to decide. Indeed, when the justices in December agreed to hear the two same-sex marriage cases, they went out of their way to ask for briefs on whether the court has the power to decide them in light of the actions of government officials.

John C. Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., and the chairman of the National Association for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, said government officials in the two cases had demonstrated “a cavalier attitude toward their duties to enforce the law.” He was particularly critical of Mr. Herrera’s suit, which followed a brief period in 2004 during which Gavin Newsom, then the mayor of San Francisco and now the state’s lieutenant governor, instructed city officials here to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. “It was exhibiting lawlessness,” Professor Eastman said.

Mr. Herrera said it was sometimes necessary for government lawyers to attack the laws they are charged with defending. “When a disfavored minority is being targeted,” he said, “it’s up to a public law office to stop it.”

San Francisco’s role in the Proposition 8 case, Hollingsworth v. Perry, No. 12-144, has been overshadowed by that of Theodore B. Olson and David Boies, the prominent lawyers who in 2009 filed the suit challenging the initiative. The city promptly intervened, and the two teams of lawyers worked closely together at the trial."
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/12/06/judge-orders-baker-to-serve-gay-couples-despite-his-religious-beliefs/,2013-12-06 00:00:00,['Todd Starnes'],Judge orders baker to serve gay couples despite his religious beliefs,"A Colorado judge says a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex ceremony must serve gay couples despite his religious beliefs, a ruling that a civil rights group hailed as a victory for gay rights.

Administrative Law Judge Robert N. Spencer ruled Friday that Jack Phillips, the owner of the Masterpiece Cakeshop in suburban Denver, will face fines if he continues to turn away gay couples who want to buy wedding cakes.

“The undisputed facts show that Respondents (Phillips) discriminated against Complainants because of their sexual orientation by refusing to sell them a wedding cake for their same-sex marriage,” Spencer wrote.

Last year, David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited the Masterpiece Cakeshop to order a cake for their upcoming wedding reception. The couple had planned to marry in Massachusetts and hold a reception in Colorado.

Phillips told the men that he could not bake their cake because of his religious beliefs opposing same-sex marriage. He offered to make them any other baked item, but not a wedding cake. The couple immediately left the shop and later filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division.

“Being denied service by Masterpiece Cakeshop was offensive and dehumanizing especially in the midst of arranging what should be a joyful family celebration,” Mullins said in a statement. “No one should fear being turned away from a public business because of who they are.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado hailed the ruling and said it serves as a warning.

“While we all agree that religious freedom is important, no one’s religious beliefs make it acceptable to break the law by discriminating against prospective customers,” ACLU staff attorney Amanda Goad said in a statement. “No one is asking Masterpiece’s owners to change his beliefs, but treating gay people differently because of who they are is discrimination plain and simple.”

Phillips was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal firm specializing in religious liberty cases. Attorney Nicolle Martin condemned the judge’s ruling.

“America was founded on the fundamental freedom of every citizen to live and work according to their beliefs,” Martin said in a prepared statement. “Forcing Americans to promote ideas against their will undermines our constitutionally protected freedom of expression and our right to live free.”

Martin said this was simply a case of a baker who declined to use his personal creative abilities to promote and endorse a same-sex ceremony.

“If the government can take aware our First Amendment freedoms, there is nothing it can’t take away,” she said.

Martin added that Phillips is a devoted Christian who has an unwavering faith. She said he is a person of such deep faith that he won’t even bake Halloween-themed treats – at all.

“He’s just trying to live within a certain set of biblical principals because he believes that he answers to God for everything that he does,” Martin told Fox News.

She said this case is an example of gay rights trumping religious rights.

“It sends a message not just to other business owners, it sends a message to Americans – that if the government can take away our First amendment freedoms and tell you what to say and when to say it, there’s nothing they can’t take away,” Martin told Fox News.

Judge Spencer said Phillips did not demonstrate that his free speech rights had been violated and he said there’s no evidence that forcing him to make a cake for a same-sex ceremony would hurt his business.

“On the contrary, to the extent that the law prohibits Respondents’ (Phillips) from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, compliance with the law would likely increase their business by not alienating the gay community,” he wrote.

Martin said it was unclear if Phillips will appeal the judge’s ruling."

There's not much to add, except that this homophobe got his ass handed to him by Wahls and walked away from the segment looking like a complete jackass. Watch and enjoy:

For those who can't watch, here's a transcript:



Whelan: Not at all. In fact, I think the example I give indicates exactly the opposite. Look, what's at issue here is that we have an organization that has long stood in defense of traditional, American, moral values, and it's attracted supporters and parents from churches precisely because it has stood in defense of those values. The Supreme Court has held that the Boy Scouts have a First Amendment constitutional right to pursue their values and to exclude leaders whose presence would be inconsistent with those values. That includes, by the way, not just gays, but atheists. Now, we can respect, and we do respect, our fellow citizens who are gays or atheists. We love our relatives or friends who are gays or atheists. But we are not obligated to regard them as suitable to be Scout leaders.

Host: Hm. All right, well let me ask Zach to weigh in here. Zach?

Wahls: Yeah, I think it's interesting that Ed is going to this, you know, traditional, moral values framework. I think what he is trying to do is define this as some particular biblical, literal, fundamentalist tradition that has become popular in the U.S. over the last forty years. The reality is that there are Christians of all different denominations who are applauding the BSA for this proposed policy change, including the United Church of Christ, one of the BSA's top eight church sponsors, which on Friday issued a statement saying, ""The ban is inconsistent with the values of dignity and respect which serve as the foundation of the Scouting program,"" and we couldn't agree more. Even though Ed may be talking about respect, respect for him is a one-way street. Nobody is calling for the exclusion of Baptists or Mormons or Catholics or, frankly, anybody who even holds Ed's point of view. What we're trying to say is that Scouts should be an inclusive program experiencing, you know, a large amount of inclusivity because we believe in the values that constitute the program.

Host: Let me ask you about this woman, Ed--Jennifer Tyrell. She was kicked out of the Scouts. She is a lesbian mom who was a den leader for her son. Is she a threat?

Whelan: Look, the question here is whether a private organization can have its own standards for for its leaders.

Host: But answer that question first, if you will. Is she a threat?

Whelan: I don't know this particular woman. How could I possibly judge whether she's a threat? The fact of the matter is that organizations have all sorts of general rules that they adopt because the rules are sensible, and we don't have to defend every single application of every particular rule. The problem here is that the Boy Scouts, if they adopt this notion that different troops can have different policies, it's completely unworkable, it's going to invite legal attacks on the troops that maintain the traditional policies, and Zach and his cohorts are not going to call a peace truce. They're going to realize that the Boy Scouts can be intimidated, and they're going to continue to intimidate them, and this is an unstable stopping point--it's just a path to further surrender.

Wahls: Speaking as an Eagle Scout and somebody who actually spent twelve years in the organization, I simply have to disagree. We're appealing to the traditional values that have been a part of the Boy Scouts from their very inception in 1903, and I feel that, moving forward, this is going to be a part of the program that is fostering inclusiveness, and applying the values and the lifelong principles of the Boy Scouts to the entire, you know, population of young American men, not just those who happen to be straight. And further, on your point of whether or not this is something that is an unworkable legal solution, on a national call with the key three of the Boy Scouts earlier this week, the president of the board said, ""With the current ban in place, we don't want to find ourselves in a position in which a judge is telling us that we need to expand our policy even further than we're going here."" So even though you might be, you know, looking at this in one specific way, the BSA certainly isn't taking that position at all.

Host: Ed, let me ask you, because I know you mentioned this change in policy would deprive the troops of protection. Protection from what? What do they need protection from?

Whelan: They need protection from legal challenges to their decision to exclude gay leaders. The national Supreme Court organization won that victory thirteen years ago. They're throwing it away in a way that would expose local troops and volunteer leaders to lawsuits by activists like Zach.

Host: Would you want your son to be in the Scouts if he was gay?

Whelan: [long pause] Uh, I think a question like that directed at my son is a rude question, but let me answer it this way. I would not have put my son in a troop with an openly gay leader or an openly atheist leader. And lots and lots of other parents, the most vibrant part of the Boy Scouts, feel the same. So Zach can cite, you know, one liberal denomination that is satisfied with this proposal. There are plenty of other folks who aren't, and I think the Boy Scouts--

Wahls: That's an interesting point--

Whelan: Please let me finish. This, I think, would be an epic failure in leadership if they were to cave to the financial pressure that Zach and others are putting on them. This isn't a decision being made on the merits--this is a decision that is being made in the face of financial pressure, the almighty buck, and what sort of lesson is it to Scouts that the national organization would cave because of financial pressure rather than adhere to principle?

Host: Let me let Zach jump in here with the final word.

Wahls: I mean, yeah, to be clear, it's not just the UCC that has weighed in. Currently, the Mormon Church and Catholic Church, hardly denominations known for their liberal stances, have both declined to comment. Only the Baptists--

Whelan: [angrily] They're not going to approve this! Don't you dare suggest they're going to approve this!

Host: Ed, let Zach finish.

Wahls: No, I mean, the point is simply that, while there may be some who are, you know, very opposed to this policy position, there is a vast difference between being opposed to gay marriage and opposing the enrichment and development of young men because they happen to be not straight. So while I think Ed's position is, you know, certainly one that I will respect, and we're not going to remove his son from the program, I think he should understanding that Scouts is about respecting the opinions of all the people who want to be members, not just some.

Whelan: You're not respecting it, you're trying to--

Host: Appreciate your time. Appreciate both of you discussing this this morning. Thank you."

One of them, the author Richard Florida, has identified the “three T’s” — talent, technology and tolerance — as the fundamental basis for the growth of new economies.

With a high concentration of outstanding colleges and universities, Rhode Island certainly has the talent. The technology is there as well, with our state’s broadband speed and coverage ranked among the nation’s best. The Beacon Hill Institute’s most recent State Competitiveness Report also placed Rhode Island fifth among all states in the technology category. Now we are poised to adopt the third and final T: tolerance.

The point is not simply that we are welcoming to gay people, though we are. It is that we want to welcome everyone. The talented workers who are driving the new economy — young, educated and forward-looking — want to live in a place that reflects their values. They want diversity, not simply out of a sense of justice, but because diversity makes life more fun. Why would any state turn away the people who are most likely to create the economies of the 21st century?

I have been heartened in recent months to see members of my old party coming around on marriage equality, including the entire Republican caucus in the Rhode Island Senate — the first time a caucus of either party has been unanimous in its support. That reflects sound political judgment, and some values that are at least as Republican as they are Democratic, including a belief in marriage as an institution and a desire to keep government out of our personal lives.

The push for equality will continue to grow stronger in statehouses, courthouses and polling places in every state in America. This is, by and large, a generational issue, not a geographic one. Even in the reddest states, the rising generations are far more tolerant than their parents and grandparents. As this shift continues, marriage equality will inevitably become law in more and more states. The states that cling to their old prohibitions will then be viewed as the outliers. Like Rhode Island in recent years, they will be seen as islands of old thinking.

This is also true, more broadly, at the national level. The United States is at a competitive disadvantage in attracting skilled workers to fill high-level jobs in technology, finance and health care, as noted by industry leaders and Wall Street executives at Monday’s annual “Out on the Street” conference. It is my hope that the Supreme Court will choose to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, and that my fellow governors will lobby their Congressional delegations to address our country’s discriminatory policies at the federal level.

So tomorrow, when I sign the Marriage Equality Act into law, I will be thinking of the Rhode Islanders who have fought for decades simply to be able to marry the person they love. I will be thinking of how Rhode Island is upholding its legacy as a place founded on the principles of tolerance and diversity. But I will also be thinking, as all governors must, about the economy. With marriage equality becoming law tomorrow night in Rhode Island, we are sending a clear message that we are open for business, and that all are welcome. I hope that leaders in capitals across the country — including Washington — will soon realize that marriage equality is an issue where doing the right thing and the smart thing are one and the same."

That has complicated the Supreme Court’s job in challenges to Proposition 8, California’s ban on same-sex marriages, and to the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Because the plaintiffs and defendants in both cases agree that the laws under review are unconstitutional, there is a question about whether the justices have anything to decide. Indeed, when the justices in December agreed to hear the two same-sex marriage cases, they went out of their way to ask for briefs on whether the court has the power to decide them in light of the actions of government officials.

John C. Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., and the chairman of the National Association for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, said government officials in the two cases had demonstrated “a cavalier attitude toward their duties to enforce the law.” He was particularly critical of Mr. Herrera’s suit, which followed a brief period in 2004 during which Gavin Newsom, then the mayor of San Francisco and now the state’s lieutenant governor, instructed city officials here to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. “It was exhibiting lawlessness,” Professor Eastman said.

Mr. Herrera said it was sometimes necessary for government lawyers to attack the laws they are charged with defending. “When a disfavored minority is being targeted,” he said, “it’s up to a public law office to stop it.”

San Francisco’s role in the Proposition 8 case, Hollingsworth v. Perry, No. 12-144, has been overshadowed by that of Theodore B. Olson and David Boies, the prominent lawyers who in 2009 filed the suit challenging the initiative. The city promptly intervened, and the two teams of lawyers worked closely together at the trial."

Oliver White, Sean Hannity Show, March 27, 2013

In general, most news outlets have provided awful coverage of the Supreme Court proceedings on same-sex marriage. Covering the proceedings like they cover a political campaign or a sporting event, most of the analysis and commentary has been about political “wins” for one side or the other and the ramifications of the pending decision on homosexuals in our society, rather than the wide-ranging ramifications for society itself.

Filling the void of thoughtful analysis has been talk radio. Unlike the vapid and two-dimensional conversations repeated every ten minutes on cable, talk radio has been able to explore larger questions entwined in the same-sex marriage debate and have been able to challenge the politically correct orthodoxy presented in other media outlets where it comes to the religious side of the issue.

Enter Sean Hannity whose Wednesday show featured a fascinating exchange with Terry Jeffrey, a news editor from CNS News Service, and Rev. Oliver White, a pro-same sex marriage pastor. Because Hannity is not constrained by the limitations of a TV news schedule and the need to change subjects every 5 minutes, as is so often the case on cable news, he was able to allow the on-air debate over the scriptural basis for marriage to naturally unfold to the point where the lack of scriptural foundation for same-sex marriage was laughingly evident.

This exchange in particular was the most glaringly infuriating as White, a proponent of same-sex marriage who angered his own congregation recently because of his adamant belief that Christianity supports such a practice, went so far as to agree that Jesus Christ was wrong about His position on marriage being defined as one man and one woman, and if Jesus were alive today he would, in fact, support gay marriage.

In this segment, the good minister is quizzed further on his unique and ever-morphing interpretation of scripture by Hannity and it’s revealed for the audience that his understanding of sin and morality is quite pliable and able to bend to meet any modern need:

Finally, Rev. White is able to admit that he does draw moral lines with regard to sexuality, but those lines are rooted less in God’s law but in the current popular practices of the times we live in:

This is the kind of exchange, full of thoughtful and challenging questions that force the guests and the listener to re-examine what they believe and what they espouse can only happen in a medium like talk radio and new media where hosts are able to take positions and not pretend to be objective. We know there is no real objectivity when Don Lemon or Anderson Cooper are conducting an interview on this topic. Cooper would probably never have Rev. White on in the first place, because he would make the pro-same sex marriage side look bad. And, if he did have a minister on to discuss the biblical basis for same-sex unions, there is no chance that Don Lemon would be able to pose questions for their guest in the way that Hannity and Jeffry did.

In general cable and network news have not served the public interest in exploring these complicated and important issues because, in many cases, the hosts and anchors assigned to the topic are just not equipped or are completely unwilling to have both sides of the issue get a fair and through hearing.

Congratulations to Sean Hannity for taking advantage of his medium and shedding light on an angle of this story that’s been neglected by his TV counterparts."

You would have to travel to one of those states to get married.”

The second issue being presented before the Supreme Court addresses a more expansive question, about who has the right to marry. It challenges Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage. “The Prop 8 case is a broader case than the DOMA case because the remedy in the Prop 8 case would be, at a minimum, to allow same-sex couples in California to marry,” said James D. Esseks, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s project dealing with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, “and it might also be that every state in the country has to allow same-sex couples to marry.”

The court, of course, could keep the laws as they are now, or go in any of several other directions. But let’s look at how life would change for same-sex couples if they woke up one June morning to learn that, at the very least, the Defense of Marriage Act had been dismantled.

I turned to a same-sex couple I interviewed more than four years ago, Jeff Friedman and Andrew Zwerin, of Rockville Centre, N.Y., to see how they would fare. Back then, they told me about a slightly torn manila folder stuffed with documents — their marriage license, their son’s adoption decree, among other things — that proved they were a family. They didn’t travel far without it.

The couple, both 44, still have the folder, which is now showing even more signs of wear. Mr. Friedman said they would continue to carry it around even if DOMA were overturned because they wanted to be sure their family was recognized wherever they may go. That’s especially important, they said, because they have had to prove their family status to hospital staff members on more than one occasion. And unfortunately, they’ve had to make more than a dozen trips to the emergency room because their 9-year-old son, Joshua, battles allergies and asthma. On one occasion, when Josh was barely breathing because of a severe asthma attack, a nurse wouldn’t admit the family to the pediatric unit even after the couple provided a birth certificate that named them as the parents. The nurse was waiting for a mother."

States%27 rights argument establishes respect of state restrictions on gay marriage.

The Prop. 8 case dismissal closes door to private parties defending initiatives they created.

The court granted state executives %22backdoor%22 veto power over laws they disagree with.

On Wednesday, advocates for marriage equality — and I count myself among them — celebrated the Supreme Court's historic decisions on same sex marriage. The elation was justified.

In Windsor v. United States, the high court unequivocally dismantled the most odious provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which would have restricted federal benefits to opposite sex couples.

Also on Wednesday, the Court held that those placing the Proposition 8 case, Hollingsworth v. Perry, on the 2008 ballot in Calif. had no constitutional authority to defend the law in federal courts. The Hollingsworth ruling paved the way for the recognition of same-sex marriages in California, the most populous state in the county, with the highest population of persons identifying as lesbian, gay or bisexual.

Undoubtedly, it was a historic day in our society's evolution towards fulfilling our deepest constitutional commitments to equal protection and equal dignity. Yet, those of us happy to scrap DOMA and Prop. 8 should take heed of some of the less discussed legal and political consequences of these landmark decisions. Inherent in the reasoning of these two cases are at least three important consequences for the future of marriage equality litigation specifically, our political and constitutional order, more generally.

Justice Kennedy framed his majority opinion in Windsor by discussing the traditional powers of states — and not the federal government — to regulate the marriage arena. His concern about equal dignity extended only to those couples in states that had already decided to permit same-sex marriage. In essence, he found it problematic that the federal law stigmatized married gay couples after certain states had chosen to offer them legal protection and benefits.

By emphasizing a states-rights based equality framework, the majority opinion leaves open the possibility of a variegated, national patchwork of marriage laws. If the federal government must respect state decisions regarding the provision of same-sex marriage, must it not respect state decisions restricting marriage as well? Even if such an objection can be overcome, those seeking to defend same-sex marriage bans in other states are left with legal fodder after Windsor.

And because the Prop. 8 case was dismissed on on the technical legal issue of standing, it is a ruling that ultimately narrows access to federal courts. Avoiding the much-anticipated question on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage, it decided that private parties lack the legal right to defend, in federal court, the initiatives they sponsored

Ironically, the curiosity of the five-justice coalition in Hollingsworth was the liberal contingent who joined the opinion (Justices Kagan, Breyer, and Ginsberg), and not the more conservative Justices (Roberts and Scalia) who have traditionally favored limiting federal court access. Indeed, both Justices Roberts and Scalia dissented in the DOMA case on the grounds that the Supreme Court lacked standing to hear the case.

In the end, this odd majority lineup in Hollingsworth clarified for the foreseeable future that citizen-ballot proponents cannot defend the constitutionality of laws they helped craft and advance. This may be the right reading of the Court's prior standing jurisprudence, but it will also closes a door to the courthouse in less sympathetic circumstances.

Finally, by dismissing the case on standing grounds, the Court implicitly allowed state executive officials a backdoor veto power over laws or ballot propositions with which they disagree. Proponents of Prop. 8 were placed in the position of appealing the trial court's ruling because the parties with the legal right to appeal — the governor and attorney general — declined to continue defending the law.

I agree with the underlying reasons for the governor's decision, but it is unsettling that the ultimate fate of a citizen-approved initiative can be thwarted by an unreviewable executive decision. The alternative to such significant exercises of gubernatorial discretion is also troubling; stripping him and other enforcement officials of the discretion to disengage from costly litigation is also likely not in the best interest of state citizens. Such decisions are rare, and voters may punish officials at the polls if they disagree with the decision. Regardless, the potential for this type of discretion to enable state officials to insulate matters from judicial review raises complex issues for our political order.

I am not suggesting that Wednesday's decisions were wrongly decided. Although I hoped the Court would have erased all doubts as to constitutional imperative of marriage equality, I believe the cases were justifiably reasoned. Despite their flaws, they still advance the cause of human equality.

However, it remains important to take stock of the important trade-offs and ancillary effects of these cases. We should still celebrate them, but we should remain aware that these advancements have a price.

http://news.yahoo.com/gay-couples-could-see-windfalls-court-action-194109191.html,,[],Gay couples could see windfalls from court action,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — For Mina Meyer and Sharon Raphael, two women in their 70s who fell in love more than four decades ago and have been married for more than four years, the U.S. Supreme Court's pending consideration of a law that prohibits the federal government from recognizing unions like theirs is about more than civil rights. It's about buying a new roof for their California home, replacing their 2005 Toyota Camry, and ensuring Meyer doesn't take a financial hit if Raphael dies first.

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments this month in a challenge to a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, that denies legally married gay and lesbian couples federal benefits available to heterosexual married couples, including tax and Social Security benefits. A decision is not expected until the end of June, but accountants and tax attorneys anticipating the 18-year-old law's demise are already encouraging same-sex couples like Raphael and Meyer to seek prospective tax refunds, back retirement payments and other spousal subsidies they may have been denied.

It is unclear how the justices might rule, but the Obama administration and former President Bill Clinton, who signed the act into law, have urged the court to overturn it on grounds that it violates the civil rights of gay Americans. DOMA supporters, including House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner, argue that Congress — not the court — should decide as public opinion for same-sex marriage grows. Other conservative groups argue that spousal benefits should be reserved only for couples of the opposite sex.

Part of the urgency for couples to act stems from deadlines established under the U.S. tax code, which gives taxpayers three years to file protective claims for income and estate tax refunds. Same-sex couples or surviving spouses who were legally married before or during 2009 would therefore have until April 15 of this year to submit amended returns claiming overpayments on income for that tax year, said Vickie Henry, a senior staff attorney at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders.

Story continues

At the time, gay unions were legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont, and briefly had been in California. New York and the District of Columbia, which have since legalized same-sex unions, also recognized marriages performed in other states or countries.

While married couples from those jurisdictions would have the strongest cases, couples from states such as Hawaii, Nevada and Illinois that treat domestic partnerships and civil unions as the same as marriage for tax purposes might also see federal refunds depending on how the Supreme Court rules, said Pat Cain, a federal tax expert at the Santa Clara University School of Law.

""On the income tax side, anybody who would benefit from filing jointly and who would be eligible to do so if DOMA falls should consider filing amended tax returns for the applicable years,"" Cain said.

The sums at stake are not inconsequential. The case the justices accepted, for example, involves a New York state widow, Edith Windsor, 83, who is seeking a refund of the $363,000 she had to pay in estate taxes after her wife, Thea Spyer, died in 2009. If Windsor had not been married to another woman, her tax bill would have been $0 because married U.S. citizens are allowed to pass their assets onto their spouses tax-free — but only if the surviving spouse is of the opposite sex.

Gerald McIntyre, directing attorney at the National Senior Citizens Law Center, said Social Security benefits, which kick in based on the date of application, are where gay couples have lost the most and stand the most to gain.

Lower-earning spouses such as Meyer have been doubly penalized under DOMA, McIntrye said, first by being unable to claim the spousal benefit that allows married heterosexuals to increase their monthly benefits by drawing half of a husband or wife's Social Security, then being deemed ineligible for survivor benefits that are equal to what a deceased spouse got in retirement each month.

A 2009 study by The Williams Institute, a think tank on sexual orientation and the law at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimated that gay couples received an average of $3,060 less a year in Social Security benefits than married straight couples. For lesbian couples, the disparity rose to $5,412. The same study found that gay or lesbian widows or widowers lost out on more than $5,700 a year in survivor benefits than their straight counterparts received.

In the case of retirees Raphael and Meyer, it could mean an additional $7,335 year in Social Security benefits because Meyer, who worked in office jobs and a bookstore, would be entitled to the Social Security benefits of Raphael, who earned considerably more as a college professor for 40 years. That would boost their fixed monthly income by about 10 percent. Last year, on the advice of a professional colleague and with the high court poised to decide if DOMA is constitutional, Meyer applied for more than a year's worth of retroactive benefits as well as bigger future checks if the law is struck down.

""This is not the only money we live on, but it does make a big difference,"" said Meyer, 73, who also would see her Social Security checks more than quadruple in the event she is widowed and the court overturns the act. ""That $700 a month is $700 a month.""

Other married same-sex couples may end up paying more in taxes if DOMA is overturned, due to the so-called federal ""marriage penalty."" Janis Cowhey McDonagh, a tax attorney in the New York office of accounting firm Marcum LLP, (equals) has been encouraging many of her clients in same-sex marriages to get their returns in order before the Supreme Court rules.

""If it's better for them to file single even though they are married, I tell them they need to file before DOMA comes down, because if DOMA comes down, they won't have the choice,"" she said.

USA TODAY

10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the state%27s request for an emergency stay

Utah%27s last chance to temporarily stop the marriages would be the Supreme Court

Utah has become the 18th state to allow same-sex weddings

Same-sex marriages can continue in Utah, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.

The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court rejected the state's request to halt the issuance of licences until the appeals process concludes.

The Utah attorney general's office said it was ""disappointed"" by the court's refusal to issue a stay and would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday morning. Justice Sonia Sotomayor is assigned to oversee the 10th Circuit, the Salt Lake Tribunenotes.

U.S. District Judge Richard Shelby struck down the state's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage Friday, saying it violated the constitutional rights of gay and lesbian couples. Monday, he refused to stop county clerks from issuing licences.

So far, about 700 same-sex couples have received marriage licences, most around Salt Lake City, headquarters of the Mormon church.

Utah is the 18th state where same-sex couples can legally marry, something voters thought they had outlawed in 2004.

Nearly two-thirds of the state's 2.8 million residents belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which deeply opposes homosexuality and same-sex marriage.

""Until the final word has been spoken by this Court or the Supreme Court on the constitutionality of Utah's marriage laws, Utah should not be required to enforce Judge Shelby's view of a new and fundamentally different definition of marriage,"" the state said in a motion to the appeals court.

Gov. Gary Herbert's office directed state agencies Tuesday afternoon to comply with Shelby's ruling or consult the Utah attorney general if there were conflicts with local rules.

The Utah Department of Workforce Services, which administers food stamps, welfare and related benefit programs, is recognizing the marriages of gay couples when they apply, a spokesman told the Associated Press on Tuesday.

But at least one county — the state's second largest — was refusing to issue same-sex licences.

""Until I receive further information, the Utah County clerk's office will not be making any policy changes in regards to which we issue marriage licenses,"" Utah County Clerk Bryan Thompson said in a statement.

A lesbian couple plans to sue the county after a staffer slammed the door in their faces as they tried to get a marriage license Monday."

The (Jackson, Miss.) Clarion-Ledger

Mississippi approved a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in 2004

Supreme Court is expected to rule on two cases any day now

Gay couples have various experiences in the state

JACKSON, Miss. -- Mississippi stands to be caught in the crossfire of what could be one of the most high-profile cases since Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling that ended segregation. The issue: gay marriage. Any day now the U.S. Supreme Court will issue rulings on two cases, one determining states' rights to define marriage and the other questioning the role of the federal government in recognizing same-sex unions.

And while Mississippians answered the question of gay marriage in 2004 by overwhelmingly approving a state constitutional amendment banning the practice, the aftershock of the Supreme Court rulings on California's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act could weaken or obliterate the state's stance on the issue.

Or the nation's high court could reaffirm what Mississippi and 30 other states already have done in passing the bans.

Which way the typically 5-4 split court is leaning is anybody's guess.

Three Mississippi couples explain their experiences.

Leslie & Cheryl: A life of laughter, love

The story of Leslie Criss and Cheryl Sproles began decades ago when a neighborly gesture formed a friendship that would last forever.

They didn't know the chance encounter would end with a happily ever after. But then again, who sees Cupid's arrow before it hits?

A few decades ago Criss was home for the summer from college visiting her family in Brookhaven, Miss. The Criss clan had just moved to the area, and there was concern that Criss' younger sister, Beth, wouldn't know anyone at school.

Family friends hatched a plan. Sproles would go meet Beth and befriend her, ensuring she didn't start the new academic year at the local school without any friends.

""She knocks on the door and my sister and I – both shy girls – answer the door where she says, 'Hi I'm Cheryl Sproles. I'm the most popular girl in town, and I'm here to be your friend,' "" said Criss.

There were no fireworks, no pledges of undying love, no Pavarotti playing in the background. The shy girl and the popular girl became friends and nothing more.

As the years passed, the friendship remained intact. Criss spent time in Los Angeles, a move she said she felt she needed to get out of her system. Sproles moved to New York City to pursue acting. Life happened and the two went right along with it.

Eventually, both of their paths led them back to Mississippi.

When she was 39, Criss said she admitted something to herself that she spent a lifetime denying.

""I knew when I was a third-grader, a shy, scared third-grader, I knew that something was different about me,"" Criss said. ""But I knew instinctively that whatever made me know I was different was something that I should shove deep inside and never talk about.""

A conversation with an Episcopalian minister in Corinth, Miss., was her next step, she said. ""It was the most freeing, empowering moment of my life.""

Meanwhile, Sproles had her own personal journey to find herself.

""With me, I didn't have any idea,"" she said. ""I guess some people know it in the third grade. I was living in New York. I knew it was a lifestyle or something, (but) being raised in the Baptist Church, it was not a possibility.

""When I moved to New York and was introduced to different faiths and different people, it was just kind of eye-opening,"" Sproles said. ""I don't want to make it sound like New York made me realize I was gay, but I had an intern and she said she had a crush on me and I had all these feelings happen.""

Nearly six years ago, Criss was at her job with the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal in Tupelo, a job she still holds.

Sproles had suffered a stroke a year before that, eventually selling her business in Jackson and starting her recovery. One day, while driving through Tupelo, Sproles said she looked up her old friend.

""I asked her out to lunch,"" Sproles said. ""And we've been together pretty much ever since.""

Sproles moved to Tupelo. About a year later, the couple held a commitment ceremony.

It was an experience Criss thought she'd never have.

But there they were, surrounded by family in a small ceremony that announced their intentions to live life to the fullest with each other.

""I have never laughed as much as I have the last six years,"" Criss said. ""We've had some sad times, too.""

""Yeah, we have,"" Sproles said.

Nowadays, the self-diagnosed shy Criss has an infectious grin on her face. The woman who had been content sitting in the audience stood on a theater stage during a recent production of ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" an idea encouraged by her theatrical partner.

And Sproles, a woman who has a million faces and hilarious quips, pauses from time to time to stare lovingly at the woman who anchors her life while keeping her free spirit intact.

It's the work of each woman, wives in everything but name only.

Amelie & Sabrina: A proud family

North Mississippi can be described as one of the most conservative areas in one of the most conservative states. But for Amelie Hahn and Sabrina Mays, it's home.

It's where the two met three years ago while working for the U.S. Census Bureau's big count. Mississippi — Houston, specifically — is where the couple held a commitment ceremony.

""She walked in and she wouldn't give me the time of day,"" said Hahn of the couple's first encounter. ""I tried to talk to her, and she wouldn't speak to me, pay me any attention at all.""

At their first meeting, Hahn made paper footballs, flipping them in Mays' direction. It was a schoolyard attempt to get a crush to look up.

Instead, Mays kept on texting, focusing her attention on her phone she was holding underneath the table.

Hahn, however, wasn't going to give up.

She looked around and found a softball league, choosing to get involved. Of course, it didn't hurt that Mays was a player.

And sometime between whizzing paper footballs past Mays' head to throwing softballs around together, Hahn got the attention she wanted.

She also got a partner.

Mississippi is where the two hard-working moms raise their daughters, Haley, 14, and Jessa, 13.

And it's also a place where the family sometimes feels the sting of disapproval.

""I don't like the dirty looks, I don't like that when we walk by people talk about me,"" Hahn said.

""Most of my friends are pretty cool about it,"" Jessa said. ""I've never had anyone not be my friend because of it.""

There are a couple of friends whose parents don't allow their children to visit the Hahn-Mays house. ""But that's their problem,"" Jessa said.

Even with some of the stares, the family is determined to stay put. At least in some part of Mississippi.

""We're comfortable here,"" said Hahn, adding she and her family want to move to Jackson, a place she describes as being more open than Houston and closer to the hospital where they take Haley, a special needs child.

In the meantime, the family will continue to make an example of themselves, a testament to their normalcy.

""What we're going to have to do is make our presence known and get people to see us as human beings because that's what we are, you know, we're a family just like any other family,"" Hahn said. ""We get up in the morning, we eat breakfast, the kids go to school, she goes to work, I start my school work.""

And Hahn said her family is the reason she will stay and take a stand.

""If we leave, then that's one less couple to stand up and speak out.""

Eddie & Justin: A living example

Growing up gay in the South isn't easy for many members of the LGBT community, but the times, they are changing.

Eddie Outlaw and Justin McPherson have carved out their own little piece of Jackson, the city where they have lived the last nine years. It's where their home is, their friends are and their business operates.

McPherson said the evidence can be seen by younger Mississippians able to come out in high school, to openly discuss their sexuality with their parents.

""I will put my life out there as an example of what this looks like,"" said McPherson, 32. ""It does get better.""

When he was coming out as a teenager, ""it was real bad then, and it's done nothing but improve and will continue to improve.""

""I guess for a teenager looking at what's happening right now -- from (President Barack Obama) to most of the Democrats in the Senate saying they are for marriage equality and overturning (the Defense of Marriage Act), it sends a message,"" said Outlaw, 41.

McPherson said he wants to show that by owning a business while being openly gay, that there is life after coming out.

""I know what it's like growing up in the South. Eddie knows what its like to grow up in the South,"" he said. ""I want to be an example for them, for their parents.""

Support now for same-sex marriage — more than half in favor, about one-third against — is roughly the public divide on the question of public school desegregation in 1954 when the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in Brown v. Board of Education. But the court’s call then for states to end racial discrimination in public schools “with all deliberate speed” was a big error. It gave states far too much latitude to move slowly and gave them an excuse for resistance, which delayed desegregation in many school districts for many years. The court should avoid that kind of error in the same-sex-marriage cases. It should broadly declare that under the Constitution the right to marry applies equally to all couples, period, and that this principle applies to the federal government and every state.

The arguments of those defending discrimination against gay couples are beyond far-fetched. Proposition 8’s advocates, for example, contend that restricting marriage to heterosexual couples must be rational because for thousands of years people widely agreed that the institution involved only the union of a man and a woman. That reasoning stinks of the faulty logic used to justify the persistence of all sorts of discrimination. They also argue that marriage’s purpose is to ensure that children are born into stable families; therefore, California should be allowed to limit marriage to only those capable of biological procreation. That is a narrow and insulting view of marriage. Would it then be constitutional to deny sterile heterosexual couples the right to marry? How about older couples? Moreover, lesbians can bear children and gay men can adopt. Why wouldn’t society want their parents to be wed, too?

Statistically speaking, Franklin County should be straighter than John Wayne eating Chick-fil-A. The middle-of-nowhere rectangle in southwest Mississippi -- known for its pine forests, hog hunting and an infamous hate crime -- is home to exactly zero same-sex couples, according to an analysis of census data. In other words: It's a place where gays don't exist. At least not on paper. [...] In a place where ""everybody knows everybody,"" as Richard Pickett put it, very few seem willing to talk about the possibility of gay residents. You could blame that on the would-be gays. ""If (a gay couple) did live together, they would probably keep it quiet,"" the 54-year-old told me. ""They're not going to march up and down the street with a sign"" announcing their homosexuality. The common Franklin County wisdom seems to be that gays, like unicorns or dragons, are living over the next pine-covered hill, out of sight and out of mind. They're not my kids. Not my neighbors. They're somewhere else. Maybe. But here's the thing: There certainly are gay people in Franklin County. And for the most part, they're not in the closet. Many are happy to talk about it. It's their neighbors and families who aren't.

The GOP filibuster strategy is proving to be the tool of choice for draining momentum from President Obama’s reelection mandate. It stops the Democratic majority in the senate from controlling the Senate. And it makes it difficult for the president to put his nominees in place to govern the country. The GOP is betting that voters will blame Democrats for the dysfunction in Congress as much as they blame the GOP. And so far, the bet is paying off, because the press is failing to call out the GOP for an extreme and nasty political strategy of demanding a super-majority of 60 votes —the votes required to break a filibuster — to get anything done.

A lawsuit the federal government filed against JP Morgan in late 2011 alleged the bank consistently overstated the quality of the loans it packaged into mortgage bonds; that it inflated home values to make mortgages seem safer than they were; and that JP Morgan and its brokers didn’t adhere to their own underwriting standards. Federal lawsuits against other Wall Street banks made similar claims. Post-crisis investigations have revealed that outside auditors told banks that they were handling bad mortgages, but the banks stuffed them into bonds and sold them off anyway. The banks did all this while knowing they would have to own any mortgage fraud that investors discovered. Just imagine what they’ll be tempted to pull once they let themselves off that hook.

There comes a point when some folks prove themselves so careless so consistently with the facts that the rest of us should have license to ignore any additional utterance ever to leak from their lips. That time has come with regard to Michele Bachmann. The not-so-esteemed congresswoman from Minnesota crossed a new threshold last week (just how many thresholds can there be?) when she blasted President Obama’s lavish lifestyle of “excess” (a claim of such lavish excess itself that it prompted even Bill O’Reilly to dress her down for it) and called for a repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act “before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.” Breathtaking. And I don’t mean that in a positive way.

Christie%2C a Catholic%2C vetoed a bill to recognize gay marriages

He endorses having a referendum on the same-sex marriage

Advocates say marriage is a civil right that should not be ruled by majority vote

As activists push states to recognize gay marriages, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — conservative Republican governor in a blue state and a 2016 presidential possibility — is walking a fine line between two electorates and two elections.

Christie vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year and severely criticized the Supreme Court's decision striking down a ban on federal rights for same-sex married couples. At the same time, he is ""adamant'' that same-sex couples deserve equal legal protection, wants a referendum on gay marriage, and vows to abide by a same-sex marriage law if the voters approve it.

He's tiptoeing between constituencies. First are the voters of New Jersey: polls show they favor same-sex marriage, and Christie wants them to reelect him in November by a big margin. Then there are Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. Christie needs their backing if he runs for president in 2016; in 2012, evangelical conservatives, who generally oppose gay marriage, made up 57% of Republican caucusgoers in the state, according to exit polls.

And there is a third group of voters to think about: swing voters across the nation, who might go for a Republican presidential nominee who is sufficiently centrist.

To appeal to those voters, Christie ""will want to not be perceived to be as far right as many Republicans are,'' says David Boaz of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. ""That's a lot of tightropes to walk.''

Christie, who is Roman Catholic, has said he does not believe being gay is a choice, nor is it a sin, and that he has gay friends who argue the issue with him. Marriage, he said last year on CNN, is ""special and unique in society.'' He followed his veto in of the gay-marriage bill in February 2012 with a call for a statewide referendum on whether to allow same-sex marriage by constitutional amendment.

""When you want to change the core of a 2,000 year-old institution, the way to do that is to put it in front of the voters,'' he told reporters July 2.

A referendum would allow same-sex marriage to pass in New Jersey without his fingerprints — or as he said at a town-hall-style meeting last month: ""I don't have to compromise my principles that I believe in and someone else doesn't have to compromise theirs.''

Christie is in the same position as his party. The Republican platform says marriage is only for couples of different sexes, but Chairman Reince Priebus has said that the Republican Party should be open to those who favor same-sex marriage. ""I don't believe we need to act like Old Testament heretics,"" he told USA TODAY in March. Instead, Republicans ""have to strike a balance between principle and grace and respect.''

Garden State Equality, a leading advocate for same-sex marriage in New Jersey, opposes a referendum saying civil rights should not be on the ballot. ""It should never be up to the majority to vote on the rights of the minority,'' spokesman T.J. Helmstetter said.

Same-sex marriage advocates are now lobbying New Jersey legislators to override Christie's veto before the end of the year, when the window to do so expires. Christie is too powerful a party leader to let that happen, says Ben Dworkin, director of Rider University's Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics.

""I can't envision a situation where the Republican votes that are needed to get the two-thirds override would come, given this administration's history,'' Dworkin says. ""The Christie administration sees no reason why any Republican should really ever override a Republican governor. That's their logic, so I'd be shocked if it ever got to happen.""

Last year, Christie nominated a gay judge (a Republican) to the state Supreme Court, a first for the state. Last month, when the Supreme Court ruled on Defense of Marriage Act, he called it ""insulting"" to the Congress and president which passed the law.

Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, said, ""I don't like to pretend I can get inside the mind of the governor, but I think the closer we get to him having future political ambitions the more staunch his opposition gets to marriage equality.""

But Jimmy LaSalvia, a founder of GOProud, a Republican gay-rights group that favors same-sex marriage, gives Christie credit for not trying to change the subject. ""He's one Republican who doesn't say 'I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. We need jobs and the economy is hurting,''' says LaSalvia, who now works with the ACLU trying to pass same-sex marriage state by state. ""He's willing to talk through the issue in a way that no other Republican has the balls to do.''

Christie has to make his political calculus now, even though ""he doesn't know how much public opinion will change between now and 2016,'' Boaz says. ""Will people be more liberal then? Is the country? Yes. But the Republican primary electorate, maybe not so much.''

Public opinion on gay marriage has changed rapidly. Four years ago, 37% of Americans favored same-sex marrage. Now, 51% do, according to the Pew Research Center.

Iowa and New Hampshire, traditionally the first states to hold presidential nominating contests, both allow same-sex marriage – which could mean voters there no longer focus on it as an issue. ""Those people in those states have been living with (same-sex marriage) for a while,'' LaSalvia says. ""I don't think any of us knows how the issue is going to play in 2016 because it's moving so fast.'' An October poll sponsored by the Iowa Republican, a news site, showed Iowans favor gay marriage 49% to 42%.

Iowa has allowed gays to marry since a 2009 state Supreme Court decision – and voters remain conflicted about it, says pollster Ann Selzer, who conducts the Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, ""You ask them on the street and nobody can say that their lives have been affected. But you ask them if they like it and they don't.'' In a poll taken a month after the 2012 caucuses, 64% of Republicans favored a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage."

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Public opinion could sway Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage,"WASHINGTON — Public opinion on marriage for gay and lesbian couples has shifted with almost unprecedented speed since California voters banned such unions in 2008.

That shift could influence the Supreme Court, in particular Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and possibly Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., as it decides whether to uphold Proposition 8 in coming months.

Throughout his long career, Kennedy has been willing to make major changes in the law on issues including the death penalty, gun rights and gay rights. Kennedy has been a strong, steady proponent of constitutional principles such as free speech, individual liberty and limits on government power.

But before signing on to major changes — abolishing the death penalty for young murderers, for example — he has wanted to feel comfortable thatthe change was in line with public opinion and the trend in the law.

“Among all the justices, he is most concerned about public opinion,” New York University law professor Barry Friedman said of Kennedy. “The more there is a groundswell of support for gay marriage, the more it is likely he will vote to support it.”

Kennedy, along with others on the court, probably would also resist going too fast. The current justices, both liberals and conservatives, say the court of the early 1970s made a mistake by striking down all state laws on abortion and capital punishment. Both decisions appeared to trigger a backlash, and the death penalty was soon restored to law.

Better to move in line with — or just slightly ahead of — shifting opinion, they believe.

In California, public opinion clearly has shifted since Proposition 8 passed in 2008 and banned same-sex marriage. A Field Poll survey released this week showed that California voters, by a nearly 2-1 margin, now approve of allowing same-sex couples to marry, a finding in line with states that legalized gay marriage in November’s election.

With that shift, lawyers supporting same-sex marriage have offered the justices a range of options they could use to rule in favor of gay rights. The Obama administration’s legal brief advocates a step-by-step approach.

Commenting Friday on the administration’s filing in the case, President Obama told reporters: “I do think that we’re seeing, on a state-by-state basis, progress being made — more and more states recognizing same-sex couples and giving them the opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do.” But, he added, the administration wanted to “answer the specific question” before the court — whether “the California law is unconstitutional.”

In providing that answer, Solicitor Gen. Donald Verrilli Jr. drew on arguments he had filed with the court just a few days earlier saying the justices should strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to legally married gay couples in states such as Massachusetts. He advised the court to say that discrimination based on a person’s sexual orientation is highly suspect, akin to gender bias. It can be justified only if a state can show a strong need to treat gays and lesbians differently than other citizens, the administration argued.

Verrilli’s brief filed Thursday applied that same approach in the Proposition 8 case. It argues that because California and seven other states — Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island — already have given gay couples full legal rights, there is no justification for denying them a right to marry.

This is what some lawyers have dubbed the “eight-state solution.”

Already, nine other states and the District of Columbia authorize same-sex marriage. If the Supreme Court were to adopt the administration’s view, it could raise the total to 17, mostly in the Northeast and on the West Coast.

While this would be a significant ruling, it would not require Justice Kennedy and his colleagues to mandate gay marriage in the red states where majority opinion continues to oppose it.

The defenders of Proposition 8 also cite the change in public opinion, but argue it is a reason for the court to stand aside. Because there is a great national debate over gay marriage, and some states are changing their laws, the court has no need to intervene, they said.

Andy Pugno, general counsel for the Proposition 8 proponents, said it was “very disappointing” that the Obama administration had urged the court to strike down the voter initiative. “The president has impugned the motives of millions of Californians,” he said, “and disregarded the rights of each state to decide for itself whether to redefine marriage.”

If the court were to adopt a version of the eight-state solution, it would allow most states to decide for themselves, as Pugno advocates — at least for now. But it is also true that if the justices decided discrimination against gays violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws, that same argument eventually could be used to invalidate the remaining state laws against same-sex marriage. The justices might be particularly willing to do so if the majority of states already had acted.

In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that laws barring mixed-race couples from marriage violated the Constitution. By then, only 16 states still had such laws on their books.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/14/Federal-Judge-Rules-Laws-Against-Polygamy-Unconstitutional,2013-12-14 00:00:00,['Ken Klukowski'],Judge Cites Same-Sex Marriage in Declaring Polygamy Ban Unconstitutional,"In a game-changer for the legal fight over same-sex marriage that gives credence to opponents’ “slippery slope” arguments, a federal judge has now ruled that the legal reasoning for same-sex marriage means that laws against polygamy are likewise unconstitutional.

In his 91-page opinion in Brown v. Buhman, on Dec. 13, U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups struck down Utah’s law making polygamy a crime. In so doing, he may have opened Pandora’s Box.

As a condition for becoming a state in 1896, Congress required Utah to outlaw polygamy, which is marriage between three or more persons. This case involved a family of fundamentalist offshoots of nineteenth-century Mormonism. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints disavowed polygamy in 1890, and again in 1904, but some splinter groups continue the practice.

Waddoups’ opinion would not only cover such groups, however, but also Muslims or anyone else who claims a right–religious or otherwise–to have multiple-person marriages. He notes that the Supreme Court ruled against polygamy in its 1878 case Reynolds v. U.S., but said he cannot simply rest upon that decision “without seriously addressing the much developed constitutional jurisprudence that now protects individuals from the criminal consequences intended by legislatures to apply to certain personal choices.”

In its 2003 Lawrence v. Texas case, the Supreme Court overruled previous sexuality precedents by declaring unconstitutional laws that made homosexual sodomy a crime, holding that although the Constitution says nothing about sex or marriage, there is nonetheless a right to consensual sexual activity between adults that government cannot regulate. This was over the vigorous dissent of conservative justices, who said that the Constitution commits such questions of marriage and morality to the states and the democratic process, and that therefore federal courts have no power to impose their own moral judgments.

The Lawrence case lays the foundation that has been cited for a decade now in court to make the case for a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. If government cannot forbid homosexual conduct, this argument goes, then neither can it deny those who define themselves by homosexual behavior to officially recognize any such relationship as a marriage. It began a political, religious, and philosophical debate in America between two different definitions of marriage and family.

For over 5,000 years of recorded human history, marriage laws worldwide were about providing a social structure for producing and raising children. These laws simply acknowledged the biological reality that only sex between a man and a woman can produce a baby, and that, correspondingly, that every child born into the world has two parents, one of which is a man, the other a woman.

Marriage laws were designed to secure parental rights for that man and woman over the child they had created, and also imposed strict duties and obligations on each of them for raising that child. As part of that, those laws also bound the man and woman to each other, imposing obligations of sexually exclusivity, mutual care, and support.

Those laws were created for the nurturing of those children, and assign the gender role of demanding the man’s protection and support of the woman during pregnancy and once the children were born. They were designed primarily for the protection of children, and secondarily for the support of women.

A man and woman would form a new family to act as a single unit in society, and care for any children resulting from their monogamous sexual relationship. Thus, marriage has been defined as the union of one man and one woman. More precisely, it is the union of (1) two consenting persons, (2) of opposite biological sex, (3) who are not close blood relatives.

The new conception of marriage, rooted in the proliferation of no-fault divorce laws in the 1970s and the sexual revolution, is that marriage is about personal happiness and fulfillment. People should be free to form whatever relationships they find personally satisfying and to follow whatever their personal sexual inclinations are to engage in whatever form of sexual behavior they find gratifying.

If, therefore, you have a right to officially recognize those homosexual relationships through redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, then there is no reason to say it cannot include more than two people, so long as everyone is a consenting adult.

This lawsuit is the brainchild of Prof. Jonathan Turley at George Washington University. He’s designed a two-step strategy, piggybacking on same-sex marriage: first, decriminalize polygamy, then assert a right to official recognition of polygamy.

As Turley explained in previous court filings, he believes there is a “right to self-determination of private relations and family matters free of government intrusion.” He noted that many oppose polygamy, and goes on to assert that polygamists “are entitled to protection from such majoritarian animus and bias vis-à-vis their private lifestyles and relations. Their status under domestic law is a civil rights issue deserving the same protections afforded to homosexuals and other minority groups.”

The exact legal arguments for same-sex marriage equally apply to multiple-person marriages. Turley acknowledges that marriage laws that do not include both are “a tool for the imposition of a uniform moral agenda or tenets on citizens.”

Turley then goes on to make clear he is not only arguing for the form of polygamy technically called polygyny, which is one man with multiple women. In other words, he also argues for a right to polyandry (one woman with multiple men) and polyamory (multiple men with multiple women).

Waddoups concluded that Reynolds has been overtaken by Lawrence and other recent legal developments. While keeping in place for now the Utah law against issuing multiple marriage certificates for polygamous marriage (the second step of the Turley strategy), he invalidated the criminal law against multiple adults cohabiting together as a family, which is the core of the laws against polygamy.

This case will likely now go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver.

Today, the justices will consider the federal Defense of Marriage Act that denies federal benefits to same-sex married couples. On Tuesday, the issue before them was California’s Proposition 8, the voter-approved initiative that placed a same-sex marriage ban in the state constitution in 2008. A U.S. District Court judge subsequently declared the ban unconstitutional, and in 2012 the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling.

During oral arguments, some of the nine justices appeared uncomfortable jumping into the gay marriage debate at all. Much time was spent arguing about whether the petitioners on the pro-Prop. 8 side had legal standing to bring the appeal. Determining that they do not, the court could let the lower court’s ruling stand. They could also simply uphold the 9th Circuit’s decision. Either way, the justices could avoid a broader judgment that homosexuals have a constitutional right to marry in all 50 states.

Also wanting to stop short of that outcome, yet still urging the justices toward a somewhat broader middle ground, Solicitor Gen. Donald Verrilli Jr. offered a position that would open the way to same-sex marriage only in states such as California that already give homosexual couples every legal benefit accorded married persons except the right to marry. Because such states have essentially conceded that there is no societal harm in established domestic partnerships, those states cannot reasonably contend there would be harm in letting same-sex partners marry, Verrilli argued.

The perverse aspect of this position was readily apparent to the justices, however. They noted that following this path would force gay marriage on states that have been generous to same-sex couples while demanding nothing from the most regressive states that grant no legal benefits to homosexual partners.

Even more untenable was the core argument of the attorney for the pro-Prop. 8 petitioners, Charles J. Cooper. He asserted that marriage is primarily an institution that society has established to formalize and manage the production of offspring. Since, by nature, children cannot be conceived by two women or two men, homosexuals cannot carry out that prime purpose of marriage and, therefore, have no equal claim on matrimonial rights, he said.

This led to an amusing exchange between Cooper and Justice Elena Kagan. Kagan said, by Cooper’s reasoning, a 55-year-old couple could be barred from marrying since they could not produce offspring. Laughter erupted from the courtroom audience when Cooper responded by noting the 55-year-old man, at least, would be fertile. Justice Antonin Scalia chimed in with weird comments about the fertility of the very elderly former senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. How that was germane only Scalia knows.

Oddly, no one pointed out that homosexual couples actually are producing children through sperm donors and surrogate mothers. They are also becoming parents via adoption. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy noted that, in California alone, 40,000 children are being raised by homosexual parents. In the modern world, there is more than one path to parenthood.

Seeking more solid ground for their skeptical view of same-sex marriage, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the other court conservatives rallied around the idea that moving too fast on same-sex marriage would be unwise because it is a novel idea that breaks with tradition. Theodore B. Olson, representing the anti-Prop. 8 side, offered the obvious and most pertinent rejoinder: interracial marriage was illegal until the Supreme Court invalidated laws against it in 1967. Such laws enforced a traditional view and were supported by large majorities, not just in the South, but all over the country. Yet the court went against the majority of Americans and against the status quo in that decision.

The principle is exactly the same in the case of Prop. 8 as it was with interracial marriage: a certain class of citizens should not be denied the right to marry simply because they were born different from the majority. It looks doubtful, though, that the current court will be as brave in asserting equal rights as were their counterparts back in ’67."

http://news.yahoo.com/boy-scouts-vote-policy-toward-openly-gay-boys-194343272.html,,[],Boy Scouts vote on policy toward openly gay boys,"GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) — In one of their most dramatic choices in a century, local leaders of the Boy Scouts of America voted Thursday on whether to ease a divisive ban and allow openly gay boys to be accepted into the nation's leading youth organization.

Whether yes or no, the result will bitterly disappoint many. The decision expected Thursday evening could trigger defections among those on the losing side.

Casting ballots were about 1,400 voting members of BSA's National Council who were attending their annual meeting at a conference center not far from BSA headquarters in suburban Dallas.

At stake was a proposal drafted by the BSA's governing executive committee that says boys could no longer be excluded from Scouting solely on the basis of sexual orientation. A longstanding ban on gay adult leaders would remain in place.

Whatever the outcome, the vote will not end the wrenching debate over the Scouts' membership policy.

Some conservative churches that sponsor Scout units want to continue excluding gay youths, and in some cases have threatened to leave the BSA if the ban were lifted.

More liberal Scout leaders — while supporting the proposal to accept gay youth — have made clear they want the ban on gay adults lifted as well. If the full no-gays policy is maintained, some units in liberal areas may consider either leaving the Scouts or openly defying the ban.

However the vote goes, the BSA could take a hit financially. Many Scout units in conservative areas fear their local donors will stop giving if the ban on gay youth is lifted, while many major corporate donors are likely to withhold donations if the ban remains.

In January, the BSA executive committee suggested a plan to give sponsors of local Scout units the option of admitting gays as both youth members and adult leaders or continuing to exclude them. However, the plan won little praise, and the BSA changed course after assessing responses to surveys sent out starting in February to members of the Scouting community.

Story continues

Of the more than 200,000 leaders, parents and youth members who responded, 61 percent supported the current policy of excluding gays, while 34 percent opposed it. However, most parents of young Scouts, as while as youth members themselves, opposed the ban.

In the weeks leading up to the vote, and on Wednesday as National Council members arrived in Grapevine, advocacy groups on both sides of the debate organized news conferences, photo opportunities and forums to make their case.

Two conservative groups opposed to any easing of the ban — the Family Research Council and OnMyHonor.net — placed an ad Thursday in the Dallas Morning News warning that lifting the ban on gay youth would trigger lawsuits that could force the BSA to admit gay adults as well as youth. It said lifting the ban on gay boys could drive out as many as 400,000 of the Scouts' youth members.

The BSA's overall ""traditional youth membership"" — Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers — is now about 2.6 million, compared with more than 4 million in peak years of the past. It also has about 1 million adult leaders and volunteers.

Of the more than 100,000 Scouting units in the U.S., 70 percent are chartered by religious institutions. Those include liberal churches opposed to any ban on gays, but some of the largest sponsors are relatively conservative denominations that have previously supported the broad ban — notably the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Southern Baptist churches.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced in April that it was satisfied with new proposal, and the National Catholic Committee on Scouting has not opposed it.

However, 50 leaders of other conservative religious groups have issued a statement imploring the National Council to retain the full ban, warning that easing it ""would open the Scouts to a wide range of open sexual expressions.""

The signatories included the leaders of the Assemblies of God, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.

The BSA, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010, has long excluded both gays and atheists.

Protests over the no-gays policy gained momentum in 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the BSA's right to exclude gays. Scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies, and several local Scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy.

http://news.yahoo.com/utah-asks-supreme-court-block-same-sex-unions-205801270--politics.html,,[],Utah asks Supreme Court to block same-sex unions,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah took its fight against gay marriage to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, asking the high court to suspend same-sex unions that became legal when a judge struck down the state's voter-approved ban.

The heavily Mormon state wants the marriages to stop while it appeals a judge's decision, which said banning gay couples from marrying violates their right to equal treatment under the law.

In papers filed Tuesday, the state asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor to overturn a decision that has led to more than 900 gay marriages in Utah. Sotomayor handles emergency requests from Utah and other Rocky Mountain states.

Sotomayor responded by setting a deadline of by noon Friday for legal briefs from same-sex couples. She can act by herself or get the rest of the court involved.

""Numerous same-sex marriages are now occurring every day in Utah,"" Utah lawyers complain in the filing. ""Each one is an affront not only to the interests of the state and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels, but also to this court's unique role as final arbiter.""

Also Tuesday, the Utah Attorney General's Office advertised a formal bid request to outside law firms for help preparing the appeals.

State officials have said it could cost $2 million, bringing criticism from a lawyer for couples who sued to overturn the ban and say Utah should give up the fight.

""We are disappointed that Utah will spend millions of dollars in taxpayer's money, to attempt to reinstate laws which deny due process and equal protection to all of Utah's citizens,"" the lawyer, James Magleby, said Tuesday.

Utah insists that states have the authority to define marriage as between a man and woman. ""That states have a powerful interest in controlling the definition of marriage within their borders is indisputable,"" Utah said in the filing.

U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby's decision on Dec. 20 came as a shock to many in the state, which approved the ban on same-sex marriage in 2004.

Story continues

Shelby and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have already refused to halt weddings while the state appeals what it calls a ""rush to marry."" Magleby argued that because so many couples have already married, ""there is no emergency need for a stay.""

Shelby's decision came late on a Friday afternoon and sent people rushing to a county clerk's office in Salt Lake City — about 3 miles from the headquarters of the Mormon church — for marriage licenses. The following Monday, 353 more gay and lesbian couples grabbed a license, some camping out overnight to get in line early the next morning.

After the 10th Circuit Court refused to halt the ruling, the few county clerks who had refused to issue licenses changed course. Officials say things have slowed down after a run on marriage licenses that started hours after Shelby's decision.

Since then, Gov. Gary Herbert has directed state agencies to comply with Shelby's order, meaning gay couples are eligible for food stamps and welfare, among other benefits. The state Tax Commission said it was looking at changing tax returns to allow same-sex couples to file jointly, although it didn't immediately give assurances that will happen.

Nearly two-thirds of Utah's 2.8 million residents are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Mormons dominate the state's legal and political circles. The Mormon church was one of the leading forces behind California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8.

The church says it stands by its support for ""traditional marriage"" and hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman.

In the papers filed Tuesday, Utah argues that children are best raised by a mother and father in a good relationship.

""On average children navigate developmental stages more easily, perform better academically, have fewer emotional disorders and become better functioning adults when reared in that environment,"" it says."

They’re small-town people, they said, and planned an intimate, no-frills celebration of their love.

“I intended to tell people, ‘Hey, we’re getting married. Come on down and have dinner,’” Pickel said, laughing. Then, during an interview in his Oklahoma City apartment, his cellphone vibrated: yet another media request. And then came another.

Since word about their upcoming nuptials spread, Pickel and Black Bear have been thrust into the spotlight over one of the most hot-button issues in this state. Gay marriage is banned in Oklahoma, but the men will marry legally under Native American tribal jurisdiction.

Black Bear is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, based in rural Concho. The joint tribe does not specify gender in its laws regarding marriage, referring to those involved only as “Indians.” Because the tribe is a federally recognized sovereign nation, the state’s ban does not apply.

Black Bear and Pickel, who is not a tribal member, will be eligible for federal benefits made available to married same-sex couples after the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act.

Under state law, however, “tribal same-sex weddings are treated the same way as out-of-state same-sex weddings,” Alex Weintz, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Mary Fallin, said in an email. “They are not recognized by the state of Oklahoma.”

In 2004, Oklahomans voted overwhelmingly — 75% to 25% — to approve a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman and making it a misdemeanor to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple.

Black Bear, 45, and Pickel, 36, had originally planned to travel to Iowa this fall to get married. They have been a couple for nearly nine years and have “been through all the trials” and “have always stuck together,” Black Bear said.

Planning a trip to Iowa, however, proved difficult with their busy schedules. Black Bear works as a floral supervisor in Oklahoma City, and Pickel is working on an undergraduate degree in mortuary science while doing a funeral home apprenticeship.

Pickel decided to call his tribe about a marriage license, even though he expected to be turned down.

A clerk told them all they needed was $20 and a few forms of identification. They got their license in Concho on Oct. 18, said Pickel, who will change his last name to Black Bear.

They hadn’t planned to publicize their engagement. They mentioned it on Facebook, and word spread further when tribal and mainstream newspapers wrote about the couple.

Last week they were still unpacking boxes in their new Oklahoma City apartment a few weeks after their old apartment building burned in a fire. Pickel said their new neighbors are probably wondering why news trucks have been parked outside.

The upcoming marriage has focused attention on the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribe, which has about 12,000 members. The tribe has quietly married two other gay couples since December, said Lisa Liebl, a spokeswoman.

Not all tribes allow gay marriage. Some, such as the Osage Nation and the Cherokee Nation, have laws banning same-sex marriage.

On Friday, about three dozen tribal members attended a hastily called meeting in the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal Administration Center in Concho.

Ida Hoffman, the tribe’s chief of staff, called the meeting to make a personal statement against the marriages. Pickel sat in the front row, wearing a small rainbow-colored ribbon on his chest.

“These men are receiving their 15 minutes of fame to the detriment of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes as a sovereign nation,” Hoffman said.

The tribe should get the chance to vote on the issue, Hoffman said, adding, “My plan is to make sure it is prohibited in the future.”

In an impassioned and sometimes tearful response to Hoffman’s statements, Frances Wise, 28, said she was a proud member of the gay community. Native people have long accepted gay people, who were called “two-spirited people,” she said. That respect shouldn’t change because they wanted their relationships validated by marriage, Wise said.

“Hating someone because they have a different sexual preference is like hating someone because they have brown eyes or because they have brown skin,” she said. “That’s something they can’t help.”

Pickel said he and Black Bear did not intend to “bring any negative light to the tribe” and that they had received love and support from tribal members.

Ramona Tall Bear, a legislative clerk for the tribe, said she thought the issue of marriage should go to a vote by tribal members because it dealt with a legal code. But the tribe has always been accepting of gay people, she said.

“My mother always said to treat them with more respect because their lives are so hard,” Tall Bear said.

Hiram Prairie Chief and his husband, Fritz Prairie Chief, sat quietly in the back of the room during the meeting. They were the first gay couple to be issued a marriage license by the tribe and were married in a small ceremony in December.

Hiram Prairie Chief says they are involved with the tribe and serve on powwow committees. They have never received negative comments about their marriage, he said.

“We don’t hide it,” he said.

Pickel and Black Bear plan to get married Thursday on tribal land. They will wear khaki pants and black shirts, and they are writing their own vows. Black Bear’s father, the Rev. Floyd Black Bear, a former tribal council member, will officiate.

They ended up sending more than 100 invitations, including one to Fallin. The governor, they said, politely declined.

Having taken the appeal, they cannot easily decide to avoid the substantive question of whether same-sex couples have a constitutionally protected right to marry in California and elsewhere in the country.

If the court decides the case on the merits, it is hard to imagine that a majority could be swayed by the arguments offered by Charles Cooper, the lawyer for the marriage ban’s supporters. Even if his presentation had been more fluent, there was no way to overcome the incoherence of his position.

The core of Mr. Cooper’s argument was that a ruling allowing same-sex marriage would be “redefining” marriage in a way that undermines the “responsible procreation” of children. Yet California allows same-sex couples to adopt children, and many heterosexual couples who can’t have children get married.

When Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked him if — outside the marriage context — he could “think of any other rational basis, reason, for a state using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens,” he could not. When Justice Elena Kagan asked him to describe “what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples” would occur if same-sex couples were allowed to marry, he failed to provide a single example. He also contended that “debate over whether the age-old definition of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples” should be left to the states but could not explain why the Constitution would permit this kind of discrimination."

In an interview with the Des Moines Register, the politician said that embracing gay marriage would be ""suicidal"" for the party. The former senator also noted that some Republicans, like Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who have openly endorsed gay marriage are no different than those politicians who parted ideological ways from the party over the abortion issue in the 1960s and 1970s.

""I think you're going to see the same stories written now and it's not going to happen. The Republican party's not going to change on this issue. In my opinion it would be suicidal if it did.""

Santorum went on to note that speaking about how best to communicate messages is fine, but that transforming ""foundational principles"" is another story -- one that could prove problematic for the GOP.

""Just because some of those things happen to be popular right now doesn't mean the Republican party should follow suit,"" he noted.

""I think you'll see, hopefully, a chastened Supreme Court is not going to make the same mistake in the (current) cases as they did in Roe v. Wade,"" he said. ""I'm hopeful the Supreme Court learned its lesson about trying to predict where the American public is going on issues and trying to find rights in the Constitution that sit with the fancy of the day.""

The politician also said that the door for a presidential run in 2016 could be open, but that much consideration and contemplation still remains to be made.

President%27s %27evolution%27 on same-sex marriage is now complete

Justice Department says gays%2C lesbians have equal right to wed

Court%27s historic debates scheduled for March 26-27

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration came out forcefully Thursday against California's ban on same-sex marriage and, by extension, implicated similar bans in 37 other states.

In a brief to the Supreme Court, which will hear two landmark same-sex marriage cases in late March, the Justice Department argued that gay and lesbian couples should have the same right to marry as heterosexuals.

""The government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said. ""Throughout history, we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination.""

The brief marks the first time the administration has weighed in on the constitutionality of any state ban on gay marriage. Although it was aimed at the voter initiative passed in California in 2008, it put the administration squarely against other such prohibitions. It urged the court to subject the state's ban to a difficult legal standard that no state prohibition is likely to meet.

In particular, the brief implicated the other states that, like California, allow domestic partnerships or civil unions: Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island.

""The designation of marriage ... confers a special validation of the relationship between two individuals and conveys a message to society that domestic partnerships or civil unions cannot match,"" the brief states. ""Proposition 8's denial of marriage to same-sex couples, particularly where California at the same time grants same-sex partners all the substantive rights of marriage, violates equal protection.""

Theodore Boutrous, a partner in the law firm Gibson Dunn, which is representing the two same-sex couples who filed the case initially, said the administration's arguments represent ""a clear path to marriage equality across the United States.""

The court filing completes President Obama's self-described evolution on gay marriage and puts his administration squarely on the side of gay rights groups and the nine states where same-sex marriage is legal.

The president opposed California's ban, Proposition 8, during his 2008 campaign but refused to endorse gay marriage. He made that endorsement during last year's campaign but said the issue should be decided by the states.

Then, in evocative language in this year's inaugural address, Obama equated gay rights to past battles on behalf of women and African Americans by mentioning Stonewall, the New York City bar that was the site of 1969's historic gay rights riots.

""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law,"" Obama said. ""For if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.""

The action was heralded by groups that seek to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.

""President Obama and the solicitor general have taken another historic step forward, consistent with the great civil rights battles of our nation's history,"" said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which brought the challenge to Proposition 8.

Conservative groups criticized the decision to weigh in against the gay marriage ban, particularly since Obama once said it should be left to the states. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said the president was ""putting allegiance to extreme liberal social policies ahead of constitutional principle.""

The high court has reserved two days in late March to consider the California ban on gay marriage and the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. Both have been declared unconstitutional by lower courts, decisions which are being challenged by gay-marriage opponents.

Proposition 8 was approved by California voters in November 2008 to block a state Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Ever since, gay couples have been blocked from marrying in the nation's most populous state. A final ruling overturning the ban would open the floodgates to thousands of new same-sex marriages there.

What effect a court ruling striking down Proposition 8 would have on other states is not clear. The justices could rule narrowly, as a federal appeals court did, holding only that voters cannot take away a right previously enjoyed, however briefly, by Californians. But a more sweeping decision declaring marriage rights for gays and lesbians would endanger all state bans.

The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1996 as a response to a Hawaii Supreme Court ruling that questioned the denial of a marriage license to a same-sex couple. The federal law has blocked legally married couples from receiving federal benefits in Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.

The administration is leading the effort to overturn DOMA in the case of Edith Windsor, an 83-year-old New York widow who was forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes when her lesbian spouse died in 2009. Had she been married to a man, she would have faced no inheritance tax.

The new filing is more significant, however, because the administration did not have to get involved at all. Two same-sex couples are contesting Proposition 8 along with the state of California, while organizations that promoted the 2008 voter initiative are defending it.

In the Windsor case, the Justice Department's brief argues that gays and lesbians have been subjected to a long history of discrimination, and it refers specifically to the California marriage ban as an example.

On the subject of states' rights vs. the Constitution, its brief to the Supreme Court states: ""Deference to the democratic process must give way to the fundamental constitutional command of equal treatment under law.""

Polls have been shifting toward approval of gay marriage. In a December USA TODAY survey, 53% of Americans said same-sex couples deserve the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples, up from 40% in 2009.

California's ban has attracted 37 ""friend of the court"" briefs, mostly from conservative and religious groups. Opponents of the ban have until today to file their briefs, and until Friday in the Defense of Marriage Act case. They were coming in from a variety of groups on the political left and right:"

http://news.yahoo.com/gay-couples-could-see-windfalls-court-action-194109191.html,,[],Gay couples could see windfalls from court action,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — For Mina Meyer and Sharon Raphael, two women in their 70s who fell in love more than four decades ago and have been married for more than four years, the U.S. Supreme Court's pending consideration of a law that prohibits the federal government from recognizing unions like theirs is about more than civil rights. It's about buying a new roof for their California home, replacing their 2005 Toyota Camry, and ensuring Meyer doesn't take a financial hit if Raphael dies first.

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments this month in a challenge to a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, that denies legally married gay and lesbian couples federal benefits available to heterosexual married couples, including tax and Social Security benefits. A decision is not expected until the end of June, but accountants and tax attorneys anticipating the 18-year-old law's demise are already encouraging same-sex couples like Raphael and Meyer to seek prospective tax refunds, back retirement payments and other spousal subsidies they may have been denied.

It is unclear how the justices might rule, but the Obama administration and former President Bill Clinton, who signed the act into law, have urged the court to overturn it on grounds that it violates the civil rights of gay Americans. DOMA supporters, including House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner, argue that Congress — not the court — should decide as public opinion for same-sex marriage grows. Other conservative groups argue that spousal benefits should be reserved only for couples of the opposite sex.

Part of the urgency for couples to act stems from deadlines established under the U.S. tax code, which gives taxpayers three years to file protective claims for income and estate tax refunds. Same-sex couples or surviving spouses who were legally married before or during 2009 would therefore have until April 15 of this year to submit amended returns claiming overpayments on income for that tax year, said Vickie Henry, a senior staff attorney at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders.

Story continues

At the time, gay unions were legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont, and briefly had been in California. New York and the District of Columbia, which have since legalized same-sex unions, also recognized marriages performed in other states or countries.

While married couples from those jurisdictions would have the strongest cases, couples from states such as Hawaii, Nevada and Illinois that treat domestic partnerships and civil unions as the same as marriage for tax purposes might also see federal refunds depending on how the Supreme Court rules, said Pat Cain, a federal tax expert at the Santa Clara University School of Law.

""On the income tax side, anybody who would benefit from filing jointly and who would be eligible to do so if DOMA falls should consider filing amended tax returns for the applicable years,"" Cain said.

The sums at stake are not inconsequential. The case the justices accepted, for example, involves a New York state widow, Edith Windsor, 83, who is seeking a refund of the $363,000 she had to pay in estate taxes after her wife, Thea Spyer, died in 2009. If Windsor had not been married to another woman, her tax bill would have been $0 because married U.S. citizens are allowed to pass their assets onto their spouses tax-free — but only if the surviving spouse is of the opposite sex.

Gerald McIntyre, directing attorney at the National Senior Citizens Law Center, said Social Security benefits, which kick in based on the date of application, are where gay couples have lost the most and stand the most to gain.

Lower-earning spouses such as Meyer have been doubly penalized under DOMA, McIntrye said, first by being unable to claim the spousal benefit that allows married heterosexuals to increase their monthly benefits by drawing half of a husband or wife's Social Security, then being deemed ineligible for survivor benefits that are equal to what a deceased spouse got in retirement each month.

A 2009 study by The Williams Institute, a think tank on sexual orientation and the law at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimated that gay couples received an average of $3,060 less a year in Social Security benefits than married straight couples. For lesbian couples, the disparity rose to $5,412. The same study found that gay or lesbian widows or widowers lost out on more than $5,700 a year in survivor benefits than their straight counterparts received.

In the case of retirees Raphael and Meyer, it could mean an additional $7,335 year in Social Security benefits because Meyer, who worked in office jobs and a bookstore, would be entitled to the Social Security benefits of Raphael, who earned considerably more as a college professor for 40 years. That would boost their fixed monthly income by about 10 percent. Last year, on the advice of a professional colleague and with the high court poised to decide if DOMA is constitutional, Meyer applied for more than a year's worth of retroactive benefits as well as bigger future checks if the law is struck down.

""This is not the only money we live on, but it does make a big difference,"" said Meyer, 73, who also would see her Social Security checks more than quadruple in the event she is widowed and the court overturns the act. ""That $700 a month is $700 a month.""

Other married same-sex couples may end up paying more in taxes if DOMA is overturned, due to the so-called federal ""marriage penalty."" Janis Cowhey McDonagh, a tax attorney in the New York office of accounting firm Marcum LLP, (equals) has been encouraging many of her clients in same-sex marriages to get their returns in order before the Supreme Court rules.

""If it's better for them to file single even though they are married, I tell them they need to file before DOMA comes down, because if DOMA comes down, they won't have the choice,"" she said.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court is urged to allow gay marriage nationwide,"WASHINGTON — The lawyers challenging California’s Proposition 8 urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday to rule that gays and lesbians across the nation deserve an equal right to marry, ratcheting up the pressure on the Obama administration and the justices.

Rather than seek a narrow win based on the special situation in California, the legal brief argues that marriage should be available as a constitutional right to all loving and committed couples.

“We believe this is a matter of fundamental rights,” said Washington attorney Ted Olson shortly after filing his legal brief with the high court.

Next week, the Obama administration must decide whether to take part in the California case by filing a “friend of the court” brief.

“The solicitor general is still looking into this,” President Obama said Wednesday in an interview with a San Francisco TV station. “I can tell you, though, obviously my personal view, which is that same-sex couples should have the same rights and be treated like everybody else.”

Olson and co-counsel David Boies said they decided to “paint the broad picture” for the Supreme Court on how marriage for gays fits with the nation’s historic commitment to liberty and equality.

“Because of their sexual orientation — a characteristic with which they are born and which they cannot change — plaintiffs and hundreds of thousands of gay men and lesbians in California and across the nation are being excluded from one of life’s most precious relationships. They may not marry the person they love, the person with whom they wish to partner in building a family and with whom they wish to share their future,” they wrote.

Forbidding them to marry “denies gay men and lesbians their identity and their dignity; it labels their families as second-rate. That outcome cannot be squared with the principle of equality and the unalienable right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness that is the bedrock promise of America from the Declaration of Independence to the 14th Amendment and the dream of all Americans.”

Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Proposition 8 as unconstitutional, but did so for a reason unique to California: In 2008, voters adopted a state constitutional measure limiting marriage to a man and a woman in order to overturn a state Supreme Court ruling permitting gay marriage. The appeals court said it was unconstitutional for a state or its voters to take away such a fundamental right.

If the U.S. Supreme Court were to follow this approach, it would void Proposition 8 and permit gay marriage in California, but its ruling would not affect other states.

Nine states permit marriage for same-sex couples.

Olson and Boies also argue that the ban on same-sex marriages hurts children. “There are nearly 40,000 children living in California households of gays and lesbians. This is about their rights, their equality and their families,” Olson said.

If the high court wants to avoid a broad ruling, Olson offered one exit ramp. He said the proponents of Proposition 8 are not the state of California and have no standing to appeal. If the justices agree, they could let stand the judge’s original ruling in favor of the gay couples who sued.

The lawyers defending Proposition 8 argued that because there is a great national debate over gay marriage, the justices should step aside and allow voters and lawmakers to resolve the issue state by state.

Besides the California case, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge next month to the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal law that forbids federal agencies from recognizing same-sex marriages. The Obama administration is due to file its brief Friday arguing that the law’s ban on benefits for legally married gay couples violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws.

Olson said he would welcome support from the administration in the California case as well. “We would very much like the United States to file a brief as a friend of the court,” said Olson, who served as U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush.

A simple pink equal sign on top of a red background - a variation of the Human Rights Campaign’s traditionally blue and yellow logo - has dominated social media. In total, according to Fred Saiz, vice president of communication for the gay-rights organization, the image has been seen by 10 million people on Facebook alone.

The image was first posted at 1 p.m. ET on Monday and since then Saiz said it has ""snowballed"" into a bigger deal than the HRC expected. While one post by the campaign that used the image was shared 43,000 times, a number of people have saved the image as their own at the HRC's urging and have replaced their profile picture with the pink equal sign.

""It has caught us off guard, to be honest with you,"" Saiz said. ""It has taken off like wild fire.""

For an hour Tuesday morning, the Human Rights Campaign website crashed, according to Saiz, because of the traffic they were getting off the image.

As nine justices pondered the future of same-sex marriage in the United States, millions have taken to Facebook and Twitter to litigate the issue. The top ten terms trending on Facebook all related to same-sex marriage, while terms like ""SCOTUS"" and ""Prop8"" were trending nationally on Twitter.

One of the top trending terms on Facebook on Tuesday was ""equality,"" according to data from the social networking website. On the day that the Supreme Court heard arguments over Proposition 8, a law that prohibited same-sex marriage in California, use of the term spiked more than 5,000 percent.

This is high, considering the fact that ""equality"" is a term used every day.

According to Facebook, celebrities like Ricky Martin, Felicity Huffman and George Takei, as well as politicians like Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, changed their Facebook profile pictures to the red and pink image.

Takei, the famed Star Trek actor and prominent gay rights activist, has a massive Facebook following and changed his Facebook profile image to the red logo.

A post from him this morning asking people to adopt the logo has over 64,000 likes and more than 31,000 shares.

Another post overlaying the internet meme ""Grumpy Cat"" on top of the red logo has quickly gone viral with more than 60,000 likes and 17,000 shares within the first half an hour of posting.

Saiz, from the Human Rights Campaign, called the reaction ""unprecedented.""

""You always hope that these things will capture the imagination of those that see it,"" he said. ""I think what you can't predict and plan for how individuals with a bigger reach than your own are going to make your reach exponential in nature.""

Although an image in favor of same-sex marriage dominated outside the courthouse, justices inside seemed reluctant to extend a sweeping constitutional right for gays and lesbian to wed in all 50 states.

In the first of two days of hearings on cases that have the potential to fundamentally alter how American law treats marriage, Justice Anthony Kennedy - considered the likely deciding vote on the divided court - questioned whether justices should even be hearing the issue.

The overriding legal question in the California case is whether the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage as that state has.

The Family Research Council, an organization ""honoring God's design for marriage and celebrating all who have joined together as man and wife,"" also created their own shareable social graphic featuring a man and a woman holding hands.

Over the past few days, the image has received over 10,000 likes and shares.

Additionally, the March for Marriage, a Tuesday afternoon event aimed at advocating marriage between a man and a woman, has been posting sharable graphics on its Facebook page in the last week. The page itself has received almost 4,000 likes.

However, these campaigns have been overshadowed on Facebook by the efforts same-sex organizations like the Human Rights Campaign have undertaken.

Even though such self-defense laws were not used in George Zimmerman’s defense, comedian and veteran progressive activist Dick Gregory argued at the rally outside the federal courthouse in Washington on Constitution Avenue that people should fight against them. Gregory also praised protesters who staged a sit-in until they could meet with Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who has agreed to meet with the protesters but continues standing strong on Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. Gregory called for protesters to join musician Stevie Wonder in boycotting Florida.

We say thanks to brother Stevie Wonder. For all of his gigs he pays $100,000 tax. So you see what he’s giving up. We sit around arguing about so and so is not doing this, reverend is not doing this, I don’t hear you talking about Stevie. He didn’t have to huddle with nobody. He didn’t have to go to New York and huddle with white agents and say “Can I do this?” So what can we do to help Stevie? We don’t have to ask the First National Bank. We don’t have to ask Congress. We can make our decision when we leave here today because that governor of Florida said last night, “Hear me, hear me!” He said “I’ll meet with them but nothing is going to change.” And he met with them and he said if the deal was passed again, he would sign it. Well, we got a message for you.

Some members of the crowd jumped in and started shouting, “Boycott Florida! Boycott Florida!”

Gregory made the argument that supporters of Trayvon Martin should take action by not acting. “Whoa. Hang on,” he said. “Let me say something. Let me say something. See that’s what you mean. Some of y’all ain’t been to Florida in your life and ain’t going. And all you got to do is get Florida to come to you. Now what do I mean by that? They got oranges that they can’t afford to have you not buy because they will rot.”

“You leave here now and you get on the phone and you call people and tell them to call people,” he continued. “I said to my grandmother, ‘We not going to boycott Florida orange juice because Florida orange juice is sold under different names. We going to boycott orange juice.’ And when them orange growers start running in to take that governor and he knows he can’t stand his ground with them. This is who we are. Starting thinking about Christmas. You know it’s hard to get us to do something.”

Gregory called for people to boycott Disney as well, since it is based in Orlando, Fla. “How many of y’all have been to Disneyland to see a rat?” Gregory said, referencing Mickey Mouse, to laughter from the several hundred in attendance. “But haven’t walked down the street to see King’s tomb? Had he not died, you wouldn’t be welcome in Orlando. So we not asking you to do anything that costs you. We just say save your money. Don’t spend it. And when they understand who you are, then things will stop happening.” Disneyland is located in Anaheim, CA. Disneyworld is located in Orlando, FL.

Gregory was not the only speaker at the rally; E. Faye Williams, the chair of the National Congress of Black Women, opened her remarks to the crowd by saying, “We stand with our queen sister Sybrina Fulton.”

Williams then began advocating the crowd to take action through various tactics against those who support Stand Your Ground laws. “So we say to you my brothers and sisters, don’t feel like somebody else has to do it,” she said. “Everybody can do something.”

“If you haven’t registered to vote yet, you can register to vote,” she said. “If you haven’t helped somebody else register to vote, you can help them register to vote. If you haven’t given a dime to the Trayvon Martin foundation so we can carry on this work, give a dime, give your time or give something.”

Williams said Stand Your Ground laws “are disproportionately unfair to young black men.”

“We have to be there [where states are implementing these laws],” she said. “We have to keep on pulling our money back. I did it. When I heard about Stand Your Ground and how the American Legislative Exchange Council is going around the country getting states to enact Stand Your Ground laws. I pulled my money out of Bank of America. I pulled my money out of State Farm insurance.”"

Zimmerman, of course, was the Hispanic neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Florida, who trailed a young black man named Trayvon Martin after calling 911, got into an altercation with Martin in which Martin ended up pounding Zimmerman’s head into the pavement, and then ended up shooting Martin in the chest. The media used the Zimmerman case as an opportunity to bully Americans over their supposed racial intolerance. Even the President of the United States weighed in in the midst of an election cycle, suggesting that if he had a son, he’d look like Trayvon Martin.

Breitbart News had the opportunity to sit down for a one-on-one interview with George’s brother, Robert, in Los Angeles. Excerpts of that interview played tonight on Fox News’ Hannity.

Robert didn’t pull any punches about President Obama’s role in raising the threat level to his brother – and to his family. “We do feel that we’re threatened,” Robert told Breitbart News. “There’s not been a legal resolution in this matter. And even the day that there is legal resolution in this matter, the day that happens I don’t think that every single fear of some kind of retribution will simply just go way, but we’re coping as bets we can, day by day.”

Robert saved especially harsh criticism for President Obama, who inserted himself in the Zimmerman case, even inviting race-baiter Al Sharpton to the White House shortly after Sharpton threatened the town of Sanford over the Police Department’s decision not to arrest Zimmerman originally. When the President was asked about the Zimmerman case in the Rose Garden, Robert said, “Here was this president, from the backdrop of the Rose Garden, making comments about someone based on his skin color. I think we felt bullied, we were a little let down initially, and that disappointment grew because if you don’t have the support of at least the law on your side, of the most powerful man in the Western Hemisphere reminding the world that it is entitled to watch, reminding Americans that the world is watching and that we will get through this with due process, but instead bringing up statements about his skin color … it was alarming to say the least.”

Robert went further: “I don’t think a white president would have been able to get away with the same thing from the Rose Garden in an election season.”

The fallout to the Zimmerman family has been extreme. According to Robert, they often require security for everyday tasks. They have had to move around to avoid targeting. And now, George faces a trial in a case where many legal observers agree there is no evidence to support the prosecutor’s second degree murder charge. No matter what happens, George Zimmerman will, thanks to the President and the media, remain a racist in many Americans’ minds. “If you can’t rebut assertions of racism,” said Robert, “the noise kind of drowns you out. You’re really left defenseless, and you have no other choice but to go into hiding.”

, by three African American teenagers

The issue exposed by Jarrett and Henry? The fact that President Obama has not made any public statements on the murder of college baseball player Christopher Lane, who was white. (See my update below: The teenagers who murdered Lane weren't all African American.)

Why do they think this is notable? Because Obama did offer public comments after Trayvon Martin was killed, and after (in Jarrett's words) ""the black Harvard professor"" got arrested inside his home (Jarrett might not know it, but that professor—Henry Louis Gates—has a name).

In the Jarrett-Henry world, this is is hypocrisy, and it proves that President Obama is a virulent anti-white racist who secretly supports the random murder of white people—as long as the murders are committed by non-whites. Never mind the fact that Obama's mother was white, or that his comments on Gates and Jarrett came in response to questions from reporters. Clearly, Paul LePage was right: Obama hates white people.

Of course, Gates and Jarrett completely ignore the fact that when Trayvon Martin was killed, George Zimmerman—the admitted killer—wasn't arrested until weeks after the murder. Lane's murderers were arrested within 24 hours. That's exactly as should be. His murder was awful, and nothing can change that. But the justice system is working. Without the outrage following Martin's murder, Zimmerman never would have had to defend himself in a court of law.

Jarrett and Henry aren't alone; Fox has spent much of they day posing various forms of the ""where's the outrage question"" and much of the rest of the conservative media is joining in as well. But these guys don't care about Christopher Lane, or really even about what President Obama did or didn't say. As James David Dickson writes in the Detroit News:



The “where’s the outrage?” argument comes in another form: Why don’t black people protest black-on-black violence? What about all those dead kids in Chicago and Detroit? Where’s the march for them? This is an argument steeped in ignorance. If the people who make it spent even a minute researching, they’d see their premise was faulty. The reason they don’t know that people do care and do march to stop black-on-black violence is because they don’t care about black-on-black violence. They’re trying to use dead black kids in Chicago to stop you from caring about a dead black kid in Florida, when in reality they care about neither.

That's exactly right. Ultimately, this outrage is manufactured to make the Fox audience feel good about themselves when they turn their heads to injustice. It's about making sure they don't forget that they are the real victims here, because who knows what terrible things might happen to the Republican Party if one day Fox viewers woke up and lost that chip on their shoulder.

*Well, not so much truth as stupid and dishonest race-baiting propaganda.

Wow, it turns out that Fox was even worse than I thought—and that I stupidly fell for part of it. It turns out that the one of the three individuals who murdered Lane was white. So (a) my initial post got that fact wrong, for which I apologize and (b) Fox is even loopier than I originally stated.

Sign our petition demanding that Fox News correct their factual mistake, and cease the despicable race-baiting that has resulted."

(CNN) —

In the emotional aftermath of the Trayvon Martin killing last year, Attorney General Eric Holder signaled the unlikelihood of filing federal hate crimes charges against admitted shooter George Zimmerman.

“For a federal hate crime, we have to prove the highest standard in the law,” Holder said in April 2012, 45 days after Zimmerman shot the African American teenager in what was depicted by civil rights groups as a racially motivated killing.

In words that now sound prescient, Holder described to reporters that day how “something that was reckless, that was negligent does not meet that standard.”

“We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind,” he said.

Zimmerman’s acquittal of state murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday showed the Florida jury rejected that he intended to kill Martin for any reason, including the racial motivation necessary for federal charges that he violated Martin’s civil rights.

The Department of Justice opened an investigation into the Zimmerman case last year, and a statement from the agency on Sunday said it was ongoing and will now include evidence and testimony from the Florida trial.

In a speech in Washington on Monday, Holder said the Justice Department would “continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law” in examining what he called “the tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon Martin.”

“Independent of the legal determination that will be made, I believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,” Holder said. “We must not - as we have too often in the past - let this opportunity pass.”

Separately, the White House said President Barack Obama would play no role in deciding whether federal charges are filed.

“Cases are brought on the merits and the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice,” White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.

The president on Sunday called Martin’s killing a tragedy for America, but said in a written statement that the jury had spoken. He acknowledged the case had “elicited strong passions,” but urged “calm reflection.”

Still, political pressure for a federal case is mounting.

Demonstrators around the country are calling for Zimmerman to be punished, and hundreds of thousands of people have signed online petitions by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) that call for federal charges.

However, legal experts make the same point Holder did last year in saying the law limits the federal government’s options.

Watch Holder’s speech

Because Zimmerman is a private citizen, he can only be charged with a hate crime in terms of civil rights violations under federal law, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who now is in private practice.

To successfully prosecute Zimmerman, the Department of Justice would have to show that Zimmerman “caused the death of Trayvon Martin solely motivated by/because of his race or color,” Weinstein told CNN in an e-mail, adding: “This element was absent from the state trial and quite frankly doesn’t exist.”

Five Reasons for acquittal

CNN Legal analyst Paul Callan agreed Monday that federal prosecutors are “in sort of a tough spot.” The hate crimes statue is generally applied to cases involving police officers or other government agents, Callan said, adding that using it in a case involving a lone private citizen is “very, very rare and I think in this case, it’s going to be very hard to prove.”

A federal hate crimes violation in a killing carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Even if the federal charges were identical to the state charges, it would not be double jeopardy for Zimmerman because the federal government is a separate and sovereign entity.

Those seeking federal charges say the killing was racially motivated, arguing that Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, targeted Martin for special scrutiny because the teenager was an African-American. Regardless of how the shooting occurred, they say, the fight occurred because of Martin’s race.

“The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,” says the petition on the NAACP website.

Petition to White House

Rep. Marcia Fudge, the Ohio Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said racial profiling like what Zimmerman did to Martin “continues to make communities of innocent individuals fear a justice system designed to protect them.”

“Men and women wonder if merely walking or driving justifies being followed, stopped, or questioned,” Fudge said in a statement Monday. “This practice and the presumption of guilt so often associated with people of color must come to an end.”

A crush of petitioners crashed the NAACP website during the night, causing the group to set up a parallel petition drive on the liberal MoveOn.org website, said Derek Turner of the NAACP. A separate petition effort on the White House website generated nearly 15,000 supporters.

Such political pressure evokes memories of the Rodney King case in 1991, when videotape of white Los Angeles police officers clubbing an African-American man after a car chase prompted race-tinged national furor.

When a criminal court failed to convict the officers of police brutality, riots ensued in Los Angeles over alleged racial discrimination.

The Justice Department then filed a civil rights suit against the officers, alleging “deprivations of federal rights under color of law,” and two were convicted in 1993. A court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison.

Weinstein said the Justice Department can’t file similar charges against Zimmerman because he is a private citizen instead of a police officer or government official of any kind.

“There are no other relevant sections under which to prosecute him” other than the hate crime statute, which covers “offenses involving actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin,” Weinstein added.

However, Martin’s family can still file a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Zimmerman to seek penalties and damages. Such a legal move carries no criminal penalty or prison time.

Obama won’t get involved in decision

CNN’s Kevin Liptak, Ben Brumfield and Josh Levs and InSession Trial Editor Jessica Thill contributed to this report."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/07/19/Cnn-On-Obama-Trayvon-Statement-Wow-Stunning-Important,2013-07-19 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],CNN on Obama's Trayvon Statement: 'Wow! Stunning! Important!',"Moments after President Obama made his briefing room statement about race and Trayvon Martin, CNN’s BREAKING NEWS graphic swirled, faded, and cut to anchor Brooke Baldwin, who was visibly flushed with excitement. Brooke announced, “Wow, what a surprise we have all witnessed, if you have been tuned in the last half-hour, we were watching THE President surprise everyone…”

She went on to describe Obama’s statement as “very, very personal; very heartfelt.” Baldwin then assured her audience that Obama had “not used a teleprompter,” because he had “given much thought and much time to making this message VERY personal.”

The CNN anchor then went to a video clip saying, “But FIRST, here’s the president, making this personal.”

Apparently, Baldwin thought Obama’s statement was personal.

After the clip, Breathless Brooke returned with her panel: Candy Crowley, Sonny Hostin, Jessica Yellin, and Gloria Borger.

After another “Wow!”, Baldwin (who looked like she might have been trembling) turned things over to Chief White House Correspondent, Yellin.

If you hadn’t known what she was talking about, based solely on Yellin’s awe-inspired melodramatic rhetoric, you would think that something had happened on the level of the first man walking on the moon. Barely able to contain herself, Yellin described Obama’s statement as something “as personal and as bluntly as I have ever heard him speak about racism in America and his own experience of racism in his life.”

Yellin later added that this was “an important moment for this president, and an important moment for America.”

After again reminding us of how “incredibly personal” Obama was, Baldwin then turned things over to Candy Crowley.

As excited as the rest, Crowley jumped right in to tell us that Obama is a “thoughtful guy” and the “sort of person who thinks these things through.”

Crowley obviously missed Obama’s “acted stupid” racial debacle.

Crowley closed her comment by pointing out that Obama has just “elevated the discussion.”

Sonny Hostin, the only legal analyst in the country who was shocked by the Zimmerman verdict, was left a little speechless due to the “so many thoughts she had running through her mind. After mentioning that she was the mother of a “young, brown boy,” she then put those thoughts together and used Obama’s words to trash our country and judicial system as racist.

Finally, it was political analyst Gloria Borger’s turn, and she started out with some hysterical nonsense about how Obama didn’t want this conversation to be about him — even though this is the second time he has chosen to interject both himself and his race into a local crime that had nothing to with him or racism. Borger found this, “stunning.”

Borger than narrowed her eyes and talked about how Obama came to the podium as an “African-American male and reflected soberly about some important issues we have to discuss in this country.” Borger was in awe over how Obama “distilled ” all of these complicated issues one statement.

My favorite part of the discussion, though, was Borger’s non sequitar. Baldwin had a good moment when she said that she wanted to make clear that the “Stand your Ground” law had nothing to do with Zimmerman’s defense.

Borger then jumped in to say, “But it is the law in thirty states.”

Huh?

Bottom line: For almost fifteen minutes it was hard to tell if you were watching a cable news network, or a slumber party-cam with five breathless Beliebers after a Justin Bieber concert.

The gushing was as non-stop as the criticism and intelligent insight was non-existent.

Like George Zimmerman, Obama has one white parent.

CNN, however, only refers to Zimmerman as a “white Hispanic.”

If you missed Barack Obama's impromptu speech last Friday on the realities of growing up black in the same country as Trayvon Martin, this is the passage that's most essential for understanding why New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly would make a baffling choice to become the country's top domestic security official:

You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there’s a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it’s important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that -- that doesn’t go away. There are very few African-American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. And there are very few African-American men who haven’t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me, at least before I was a senator. There are very few African-Americans who haven’t had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often.

MORE FROM THE ATLANTIC CITIES

Stop-and-frisk, the deeply controversial policing tactic that Kelly has led and defended in New York City, is essentially the institutional version of everything that Obama describes above. The only difference is that the people following blacks in New York, eying them with distrust and suspecting them of being up to no good, are police officers. And they have the power to pat people down and detain them, one indignity piled onto another.

Obama was explicitly trying to bring ""context"" to the outpouring of anger following last week's ruling in Florida. But his words also offer the best context imaginable for why the architect of stop-and-frisk would be a bizarre nominee to become Obama's head of the Department of Homeland Security, a move that would implicitly endorse at the federal level the tactic of preemptively profiling minorities in massive numbers to head off crime.

Obama himself is the source of all this speculation. Janet Napolitano announced earlier this month that she was stepping down from Homeland Security. And there's wide speculation that Kelly will no longer have a job in New York after this fall's mayoral election. Asked last week what he thought of Kelly as a potential replacement, Obama lauded his record and said this: ""Mr. Kelly might be very happy where he is. But if he’s not, I’d want to know about it.”

RELATED: A Stop and Frisk Class Action Lawsuit Would Be Massive

And yet, if you parse out their public statements on this subject, it's almost as if these two men have been having an ongoing conversation about racial profiling from opposing podiums at the same rally. Here is Obama, again, last Friday:

... the fact that a lot of African-American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given, well, there are these statistics out there that show that African-American boys are more violent -- using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain.

Compare that to Kelly, last year, citing those very statistics in defense of stop-and-frisk:

Ninety-six percent of the shooting victims in this city are people of color, 90 percent of the murder victims are people of color. Who do you think's lives are being saved?

Here is Obama on Friday acknowledging that the black community knows and talks about these statistics:

… Now, this isn’t to say that the African-American community is naive about the fact that African-American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence. It’s not to make excuses for that fact, although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context. And so the fact that sometimes that’s unacknowledged adds to the frustration.

And here is Kelly, in the same diatribe... not acknowledging that:

What I haven’t heard is any solution to the violence problem in these communities. People are upset about being stopped, yet what is the answer? What have you said about how do we stop this violence? What have leaders of the communities of color said? What is their strategy to get guns off the street?

Here is Obama on Friday proposing that we might soothe the fear and anger in the minority community by training local police officers on how not to racially profile:

Number one, precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the state and local level, I think it’d be productive for the Justice Department -- governors, mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists. You know, when I was in Illinois I passed racial profiling legislation. And it actually did just two simple things. One, it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped. But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the state on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing.

And here is Kelly seeming to argue on the television show Nightline this spring that, in fact, New York's stop-and-frisk program doesn't profile minorities enough:

The stark reality is that crime happens in communities of color. About 70% to 75% of the people described as committing violent crimes — assault, robbery, shootings, grand larceny — are described as being African-American. The percentage of people who are stopped is 53% African-American. So really, African-Americans are being understopped in relation to the percentage of people being described as being the perpetrators of violent crime.

None of this even touches on the NYPD's policies of surveilling Muslims. That program is equally troubling to many Kelly critics. But given Obama's own powerful articulation of what it's like to be on the other end of racial profiling as a black man, the discordant comments from Kelly on the very same topic would seem to disqualify him from expanding his ideas beyond New York."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/07/16/Daily-Beast-columnist-no-black-on-black-crime,2013-07-16 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Daily Beast: 'There's No Such Thing as Black-on-Black Crime',"On Monday, in response to my piece on 17-year-old Darryl Green of Chicago, who was found shot to death after refusing to join a gang at school, Jamelle Bouie of The Daily Beast claimed that “black-on-black crime” is a myth. “There’s no such thing as ‘black-on-black’ crime. Yes, from 1976 to 2005, 94 percent of black victims were killed by black offenders, but that racial exclusivity was also true for white victims of violent crime–86 percent were killed by white offenders. Indeed, for the large majority of crimes, you’ll find that victims and offenders share a racial identity, or have some prior relationship to each other,” wrote Bouie. Bouie added, “Nor are African-Americans especially criminal. If they were, you would still see high rates of crime among blacks, even as the nation sees a historic decline in criminal offenses. Instead, crime rates among African-Americans, and black youth in particular, have taken a sharp drop.”

That, of course, is not the point. Of course the vast majority of murdered whites are murdered by other whites. That’s why there’s no national outrage when a white person is killed by a black person: it’s not evidence of some underlying black violence problem directed against white people. But when a white Hispanic kills a black man (a far less common occurrence than a black person killing a white person), that’s taken as evidence of a deeply racist America requiring a media tsunami. And when a black person kills a black person, the media ignores it completely.

African-Americans aren’t especially criminal, of course; for Bouie to impute such notions to those who are concerned about black-on-black crime is insidious and vile. But the notion that we don’t see “high rates of crime among blacks” is sadly untrue. The numbers are coming down, but black Americans still commit a disproportionate amount of crime. Blacks represent 13.1 percent of the American population, but 49 percent of the murder victims. More than half of those victims were in their teens or twenties. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, “The percentage of black offenders [in sexual violence cases] increased from 18% in 1994-1998 to 27% in 2005-2010.” Thankfully, crime across the board is dropping, including in the black community. But that does not mean that the black community is not still plagued by black-on-black crime that far surpasses the problem of white-on-white crime by percentage, and absolutely dwarfs the problem of white-on-black crime.

Bouie’s real point is that statistics should not matter – disproportionate black-on-black murder is the result of white racism anyway. “And while it’s true that young black men are a disproportionate share of the nation’s murder victims, it’s hard to disentangle this from the stew of hyper-segregation (often a result of deliberate policies), entrenched poverty, and nonexistent economic opportunities that characterizes a substantial number of black communities,” Bouie wrote. Let’s assume all of that’s the case, for the sake of argument. That still does not justify the media’s disproportionate attention to a problem that does not heavily plague the black community — white (or white Hispanic) on black crime – even while ignoring the sort of crime that destroys black communities day in and day out, in the name of liberal policies and political correctness. The longer those on the left continue to ignore real problems in the black community, the more Darryl Greens will be murdered.

http://news.yahoo.com/civil-rights-case-vs-zimmerman-wont-simple-072336718.html,,[],Civil rights case vs. Zimmerman won't be simple,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Calls for the Justice Department to look into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin reverberated as soon as George Zimmerman was acquitted of state charges in a Florida courtroom, but it may be even tougher to mount a federal case against Zimmerman.

The department says it's reviewing evidence to determine whether criminal civil rights charges are warranted, but legal experts see major barriers to a federal prosecution — including the burden of proving that Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watch leader, was motivated by racial animosity — and say Justice officials would likely be saddled with some of the same challenges that complicated the unsuccessful state case.

""The Justice Department would face significant challenges in bringing a federal civil rights case against Mr. Zimmerman,"" said Alan Vinegrad, the former U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York. ""There are several factual and legal hurdles that federal prosecutors would have to overcome: They'd have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr. Zimmerman attacked Mr. Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street.""

The department opened an investigation into Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed. It said in a statement Sunday that the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and federal prosecutors in Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, plus evidence and testimony from the state trial. The statement came as the NAACP and others called on the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman for the shooting death of the unarmed black 17-year-old.

Zimmerman was acquitted Saturday night in a February 2012 shooting that tapped into a national debate about racial profiling, equal justice and self-defense. Civil rights leaders, Martin's parents and many others said Zimmerman had racially profiled Martin when he followed the teenager through a gated townhouse community and shot him, but Zimmerman said he was physically assaulted by Martin and shot the teenager in self-defense.

Story continues

Though the Justice Department does have an established history of using federal civil rights laws to try to convict defendants who have been previously acquitted in related state cases, experience shows it's almost never easy getting guilty verdicts in such high-profile prosecutions. In this case, federal prosecutors pursuing a civil rights case would need to establish, among other things, that Zimmerman was motivated by racial animosity, even though race was barely mentioned at the state trial.

Lauren Resnick, a former federal prosecutor in New York who secured a conviction in the killing of an Orthodox Jew during the 1991 Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn, said the Justice Department could conceivably proceed under a theory that Zimmerman interfered with Martin's right to walk down a public street based on his race. But even that is difficult since the conflict occurred in a gated community, which may not fit the legal definition of a public facility. Prosecutors would also probably need to prove that trailing Martin on the street constituted interference, she said.

""One could argue it did, if it freaked him out and he couldn't comfortably walk down the street — there's an argument here,"" said Resnick, who now specializes in white-collar defense and commercial litigation.

But she said federal prosecutors were likely to encounter the same hurdles as state prosecutors in establishing that Zimmerman was driven by racial animus and was the initial aggressor, as opposed to someone who acted in self-defense.

""When you have a fact pattern where one person's alive, and one person's not, and the person alive is the efendant, it's hard to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt,"" she said.

Samuel Bagenstos, a former No. 2 official in the Justice Department's civil rights division, said: ""This is an administration that hasn't shied away from bringing hate crimes cases that are solid prosecutions based on the facts and the law, but from what I've seen this would be a very difficult case to prosecute federally because the government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that George Zimmerman acted because of Trayvon Martin's race. If you're trying to prove racial motivation, you are usually looking for multiple statements related to why he is engaging in this act of violence. I think it's a difficult case to prove.""

Another federal case, the Rodney King prosecution, illustrates just how difficult it can be for the federal government to come in behind a state prosecution that ended in acquittal, even when there's videotaped evidence of the crime.

King was beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers after a high-speed car chase in 1991, but the four police officers charged in the incident were acquitted on state charges of assault with a deadly weapon and three of the four were acquitted on a charge of use of excessive force. The jury deadlocked on the excessive force charge against the fourth officer.

Federal prosecutors obtained an indictment on charges of violating King's civil rights. Two of the officers were found guilty and were imprisoned. The other two officers were acquitted.

In a 1970 prosecution, the Justice Department charged three white Detroit police officers and one black private security guard with allegedly conspiring to deprive eight black youths and two white girls of their civil rights during the 1967 riots in Detroit.

The officers had gone to the Algiers Motel in a reported search for snipers. Three black teenagers were slain at the motel. One of the police officers had been acquitted earlier of a state charge of first-degree murder in the case; another officer had been found innocent in a separate state trial on a charge of felonious assault.

The federal case took place in Flint, Mich., an hour's drive north of Detroit, after the defense complained that the defendants could not get a fair trial in the city where the slayings occurred. A jury acquitted all four defendants.

In prosecuting the law enforcement officers, the Justice Department invoked an 1871 civil rights law. Prosecutors alleged that the officers had lined up the people staying at the motel and slugged them with clubs and rifle butts. There was testimony that several of the guests were taken into separate rooms where shotguns were fired into the ceiling in an effort to get those in a nearby hallway to disclose the identity of the alleged snipers and the location of firearms.

In a defense that turned out to be successful, defense attorneys emphasized that the charge against their clients was conspiracy, not assault, coercion, intimidation or murder. Lawyers for the two officers previously charged in the state cases also argued that their clients were being charged with serious criminality even though they had already been acquitted."

After Judge Debra Nelson ruled against a defense motion for acquittal late Friday afternoon, the prosecution announced it was resting and the defense began by calling Zimmerman's mother, Gladys.

She testified the voice heard screaming for help on the 911 call was her son's and she knew it was him ""because he's my son."" The recording was made during a fight between Zimmerman and Martin minutes before the neighborhood watch volunteer shot the teen.

Zimmerman's uncle, Jorge Meza, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, then testified that he overheard the 911 screams while watching television and, "" It was Jorge screaming for his life.""

Court was then recessed until Monday morning.

More On This...

Earlier Friday, Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, testified that her 17-year-old son could clearly be heard on the tape recorded Feb. 26, 2012.

[pullquote]

After the 911 audio was played, prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda asked Fulton, ""Who do you recognize that to be?""

""Trayvon Benjamin Martin,"" she replied.

Defense attorney Mark O'Mara suggested during cross-examination that Fulton may have been influenced by others who listened to the 911 call, including relatives and her former husband.

O'Mara also asked Fulton hypothetically whether she would have to accept it was Zimmerman yelling for help if the screams did not come from her son. O'Mara also asked if she hoped Martin didn't do anything that led to his death.

""I heard my son screaming,"" Fulton said. ""I would hope for this to never have happened and he would still be here.""

Earlier Friday, Fulton posted on Twitter: ""I pray that God give me the strength to properly represent my angel Trayvon.""

Trayvon's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, 22, also testified Friday that he recognized Trayvon's voice on the 911 calls.

O'Mara then asked Trayvon's older brother why last year he had told a reporter that he wasn't sure if the voice belonged to Martin.

""I didn't want to believe it was him,"" Jahvaris Fulton testified.

Zimmerman’s father, in contrast, has said the screams were from his son rather than Martin. The screams are considered to be crucial pieces of evidence because they could determine who was the aggressor in the confrontation. An FBI expert testified earlier in the week that a person familiar with a voice is in the best position to identify it.

Shiping Bao, who performed Martin’s autopsy a day after he was killed, testified that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the chest. The manner of death was a homicide, he said.

Bao testified that Martin was in pain and suffered for up to 10 minutes after being shot by Zimmerman. The fatal bullet went from the front to the back of the teen's chest, piercing his heart.

""There was no chance he could survive,"" Bao testified.

Under questioning by defense attorney Don West following Friday’s lunch recess, Bao said he changed his opinion regarding the length of time Martin lived after being shot from his original estimate during a deposition he gave in November of 1 to 3 minutes to up to 10 minutes. He changed his opinion following another autopsy roughly three weeks ago that was “very similar” to that of Martin’s, Bao testified.

Bao also testified that the marijuana found in Martin’s system coul have had no effect or some effect in the confrontation with Zimmerman.

When asked if Martin would be able to move his arms or hands after being shot, Bao responded that “only one person in this court knows.”

On Wednesday, an expert witness testified that none of Zimmerman's DNA was found under the fingernails of Martin, despite defense attempts to portray Zimmerman as only firing his gun in self-defense.

Crime lab analyst Anthony Gorgone also testified that two different DNA profiles were found on the pistol grip. One was Zimmerman's but the other could not be identified. However, Gorgone said he was able to determine that it did not match Martin's DNA sequence.

Prosecutors spent most of Wednesday's proceedings painting Zimmerman as a police wannabe, amid testimony that featured technological glitches, forensic evidence and a prosecution witness who greeted Zimmerman from the stand.

Zimmerman faces life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. The state argued during its opening statement that Zimmerman profiled and followed Martin in his truck and called a police dispatch number before he and the teen got into a fight.

http://news.yahoo.com/slain-boys-dad-adds-voice-help-black-men-171745593.html,,[],"Slain boy's dad adds voice to help black men, boys","WASHINGTON (AP) — Trayvon Martin's father told a crowded Capitol Hill forum on Wednesday that ""a statute or amendment"" safeguarding young people against the type of circumstances that resulted in his son's death would be a fitting legacy for his son.

""The question is, what can we do as parents, what can we do as African-American men, to assure our kids that you don't have to be afraid to walk outside your house?"" Tracy Martin asked during a forum convened by the Congressional Caucus on Black Men and Boys, one of several such caucuses comprised of House members who want to seek possible legislative responses on various issues.

Martin said he is dedicated to ensuring that depictions during the trial of George Zimmerman, the man who shot Trayvon dead but was acquitted, do not define his 17-year-old son. Trayvon was his hero, Martin said, and ""to not be there in his time of need is real troublesome, not to be able to save my son's life.""

Martin's comments opened what was billed as the first gathering of the caucus, which was formed to focus attention on issues disproportionately affecting black men and boys, such as joblessness and racial profiling.

""I would like to see Trayvon Martin's name attached to a statute or amendment that says you can't just profile our children, shoot them ... and say you were defending yourself,"" Tracy Martin told the lawmakers and the standing-room-only crowd.

""With everything that I have left in me, we will make sure his name will not be dragged through the mud,"" Martin said.

The mostly black audience gave Martin a standing ovation as former NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman who has six sons and four grandsons, praised Martin for the grace and dignity he has displayed in his grief. Martin remained seated and twirled a pen in his hands, appearing almost embarrassed by the adulation.

Mfume cited the cases of Emmitt Till, a 14-year-old boy killed in Mississippi in 1955, and Rodney King, whose 1991 beating by Los Angeles police was captured on video, as examples of a sad, cyclical history that have had an impact on black men and boys.

Story continues

""We cannot keep revisiting this. We cannot and we ought not,"" Mfume said.

Martin's appearance came a few days after President Barack Obama made remarks identifying himself with the plight of the Florida teenager who was shot and killed last year during a confrontation with Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer.

Zimmerman, 29, said he fired the deadly shot at the unarmed boy in self-defense, and he was acquitted July 13 of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The verdict sparked protests and calls for federal officials to charge Zimmerman with violating Trayvon Martin's civil rights. Federal officials are reviewing the case.

Discussion and solutions during the forum included ensuring that high-quality preschools are available to black children, changing minimum drug sentencing laws, and pursuing federal pre-emption of Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which some have cited as justification for Zimmerman's action.

Eleanor Holmes Norton, the congressional delegate for Washington, D.C., called stand-your-ground laws ""a clear and present danger"" to all black males. After the hearing, she said lawmakers are concerned that Martin's case would fade from prominence over time, and ""we will go on to the next kid"" to be hurt or killed in a stand-your-ground situation.

""We owe it to the Martin family to try to get rid of that law,"" she said.

Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., co-chair of the new caucus, said the aim of the coalition is to highlight issues that impact and influence the conditions of black males. For example, he said, there are few male African-American teachers in elementary and primary school, so some black boys never see someone who looks like them involved in education and thus grow up perceiving education as something women do.

The unemployment rate for black men aged 20 and over was 13 percent in June compared to 6.2 percent for white men in that age bracket. The unemployment rate for black males and females 16 to 19 years old was 43.6 percent last month, compared to 20.4 percent for whites, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Also speaking were David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African-Americans, and Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson.

Later this week, members of the Congressional Black Caucus were to convene a summit in Chicago to consider solutions to the issue of urban gun violence.

(CNN) - Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday her prayers are with Trayvon Martin's family and ""every family who loves someone who is lost to violence.""

Addressing the Delta Sigma Theta sorority convention in Washington, Clinton told the crowd, ""No mother, no father should ever have to fear for their child walking down a street in the United States of America.""



Clinton, who's widely considered a potential 2016 presidential contender, addressed the largely-African American audience just days after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Martin, 17.

The jury's decision sparked protests across the country, while many groups, including the NAACP, ramped up pressure on the Justice Department to press federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

At the top of her speech Tuesday, Clinton briefly addressed Martin's death and the recent trial - a story that has loomed large over the convention.

""In a week that I know has brought heartache - deep, painful heartache to many across our country - the solidarity and the solace you find here is all the more important,"" she said.

Attorney General Eric Holder addressed the same convention on Monday, calling Martin's death a ""tragic, unnecessary shooting"" and vowing that the Justice Department with ""follow the facts of the law"" as it continues to investigate the incident.

For her part, Clinton encouraged the sorority, the nation's single largest African-American women's organization, to ""move forward.""

""As we move forward, as we must, I hope this sisterhood will continue to be a force for justice and understanding,"" she said.

Tuesday's appearance marked the latest in Clinton's busy speech circuit. Since retiring as secretary of state at the beginning of 2013, the former first lady and U.S. senator from New York has made numerous paid and non-paid speeches across the country, fueling further speculation that she's gearing up for a presidential bid.

She also addressed the Supreme Court's recent decision that effectively ruled key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as invalid. The high court left it up to a divided Congress to revise the law, so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices.

While many Republicans praised the decision - saying it allowed some states to navigate more freely around outdated rules - many Democrats and civil rights leaders argue the ruling threatens voting rights for minorities in states with a history of discrimination.

Clinton urged the sorority women to pressure Congress to rewrite the law so that those key parts are deemed constitutional.

""I want to make sure that in the next election and the next election and the next and every one after that, people line up to vote and they vote regardless of those who may not want to count their vote or acknowledge their right to vote,"" she said, drawing heavy applause.

The statement noted the “limited” nature of federal civil rights laws, which typically involve acts by public officials, such as police officers. A 2009 federal law, the Matthew Shepard Act, allows prosecution in some cases of people who commit crimes of violence that are motivated by bias, which could include a victim’s race. But the law carries a high burden for proving intentional discrimination.

Last year, administration officials first announced the federal investigation of the case, which is being conducted by the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, the U.S. Attorney’s office for the middle district of Florida, and the FBI. Officials continue to review evidence generated from their investigation into the death of the Florida teen and are expected to evaluate evidence presented at the trial in state court.

“Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department’s policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,” the Justice Department said.

Earlier in the day, President Obama said in a statement that the February 2012 death of Martin, 17, was a tragedy for the nation, but that “a jury has spoken.”

He called on Americans to reflect on whether “we’re doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.”

Some members of Congress and the NAACP have called for the Justice Department to pursue a civil rights case against Zimmerman.

“We hope that once everything has happened that can happen here in Florida … that DOJ will act and will hold Mr. Zimmerman accountable for what he has done,” Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP, told CBS Sunday. “What you have to do there is show that race was a factor in his decision-making. And there seems to be plenty of evidence that suggest that race may have been a factor.”

“There’s a precedent here that I think is very dangerous, that not only did the jury find Zimmerman innocent, even of lesser charges, but, you also validated the stand-your-ground kind of laws that are in other states,” Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), a leader of the House Progressive Caucus, told CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“Clearly there are grounds for civil rights charges here,” the Rev. Al Sharpton said on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “We always said there would be a Plan B.”

http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2012/04/bill-cosby-gun-trayvon-martin-cnn.html,,[],Bill Cosby blames 'that gun' in Trayvon Martin's death,"Bill Cosby blames ""that gun"" for Trayvon Martin's death in February -- forget racism or self-defense.

""I'm a person who believes that that gun, that gun, all around this United States -- when a person has a gun sometimes their mind clicks that this thing is, it will win arguments and straighten people out, and then in the wrong hands and the wrong mind, it's death,"" he said on CNN in an interview that aired Sunday.

He said he wasn't talking about having a gun for self-defense in the home, but made the point ""that when you tell me that you're going to protect the neighborhood that I live in, I don't want you to have a gun.

""I want you to be able to see something, report it, and get out of the way. ... I don't want you to get hurt, and I don't want to hurt anyone.""

Deciding racism is involved in a situation -- Cosby never mentioned George Zimmerman by name -- doesn't solve anything, he said. If a person is scared to death, whether he's a racist matters little if he's carrying a firearm at the time, Cosby said.

The stand-up comic beloved for his well-known routines as well as his turn on ""The Cosby Show"" lost his son Ennis Cosby to gun violence in January 1997. Mikael Markhasev was sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing the 27-year-old during a holdup while Ennis was fixing a flat tire near a freeway offramp.

Martin, 17, was fatally shot by Zimmerman while walking to his father's house from a nearby convenience store. The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer had called police to report Martin as a suspicious person and followed him. After Martin's death in a fight that ensued, Zimmerman claimed self-defense.

After national outrage over the local police department's allegedly insufficient investigation of the crime and failure to make an arrest, Zimmerman was booked into jail last Wednesday on second-degree murder charges brought by a special prosecutor assigned to the case.

People are focusing on this quote: “Trayvon Martin could’ve been me 35 years ago.” To focus on this one line misses the nuances of the President’s message, which includes comments about how African Americans view the Zimmerman Case in the context of the history of racial disparity in America.

""For more than a year, we have been listening to the conversation about this case -- from voices on every side -- and we have become very sensitive to the racial context that surrounds this case. We acknowledge Mr. Obama’s remarks regarding the frustration felt by some when viewed in context of our nation’s history, which includes racial insensitivities spanning generations, and existing even today, including within our criminal justice system.

""While we acknowledge and understand the racial context of this case, we challenge people to look closely and dispassionately at the facts. We believe those who look at the facts of the case without prejudice will see that it is a clear case of self-defense, and we are certain that those who take a closer look at the kind of person George Zimmerman is -- something we understand the Department of Justice is currently doing -- we are confident they will find a young man with with a diverse ethnic and racial background who is not a racist, a man who is, in fact, sensitive to the complex racial history of our country.

""It takes courage to talk about race. It took courage for our President to address the Zimmerman Case and candidly discuss how and why people are upset by the verdict. We would like to stress that the verdict was reached fairly and justly and that it reflects the letter of the law and represents the law’s proper application to the facts. While we acknowledge the racial context of the case, we hope that the President was not suggesting that this case fits a pattern of racial disparity, because we strongly contend that it does not.

""This case has given the nation an opportunity to have a candid conversation about race. We would like to contribute to this discourse. Our President has clearly indicated he is willing to contribute to the discourse. As we begin this conversation, we want to say this: we cannot talk about race in sound bites. Before you cast an opinion about what the President said, be sure to listen to his comments in full. Before you judge George Zimmerman or disparage the verdict of the citizen jury, understand the facts in full. Agree not to listen to just what meets your predisposition, but to accept what exists.

""Only in this way can we assure that the conversations we want to have, that we need to have, will be attended and listened to by those whose presence is necessary for a full discourse -- a discourse that can have positive consequences for our growth as a nation."""

Dr. Vincent Di Maio, an expert testifying for the defense, gave a version of events that was consistent with the defense’s theory of the deadly confrontation between Zimmerman, 29, and Martin, 17, on Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford, Fla.

Zimmerman, charged with second-degree murder, maintains he shot Martin in self-defense after the teenager attacked him.

Di Maio said that he had examined the autopsy, toxicology and photographic evidence and concluded that the evidence was consistent with Zimmerman’s statements to authorities that Martin was straddling him and that Zimmerman fired his gun with his right hand. The path of the bullet ran from Martin’s left side through part of his heart and into a portion of the right lung, Di Maio testified.

“The medical evidence ... is consistent with his statement,” Di Maio said of Zimmerman’s version of events.

Di Maio also testified that the hole in Martin’s shirt showed that the muzzle of Zimmerman’s gun was touching the clothing, and that the wound on Martin’s chest showed that his skin was two to four inches from the muzzle.

Di Maio said he based his conclusions on analysis of debris from the gunshot, including what he called “powder tattoo marks” surrounding the wound, which give the appearance of a reddish, circular rash on the skin. Such marks, he said, would not be present if the muzzle had been held against Martin’s skin.

“So … the muzzle of the gun was against the clothing. But the clothing itself had to be two to four inches away from the body at the time Mr. Martin was shot,” he said.

“This is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman’s account – that Mr. Martin was over him, leaning forward at the time he was shot,” Di Maio said.

WHO’S WHO: The Travon Martin case

Di Maio was the first witness on the 11th day of the trial, the second full day of the defense presentation. The defense could finish its case this week. The trial began June 10 with jury selection.

Di Maio also said that there was “definite evidence” of six impacts that caused wounds to Zimmerman’s nose, the back of his head and his forehead. Those injuries were also consistent with Zimmerman’s account of events, Di Maio said.

Di Maio differed with the state’s expert witness on how long Martin was alive after the shot. Di Maio said Martin lived from one to three minutes. The state’s forensic expert, Dr. Shiping Bao, originally gave a similar estimate, but changed his testimony last week, saying that Martin could have been alive for up to 10 minutes.

Earlier, Judge Debra S. Nelson held an evidentiary hearing on whether to admit a defense animation of the confrontation. The prosecution objects to the animation, saying it isn’t accurate.

The judge could rule on admissibility as soon as Tuesday afternoon.

A Graduate Of Harvard College', 'She Spent A Year As Middle East Bureau Chief Before Returning As Houston Bureau Chief.', 'Matt Pearce Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Covering Internet Culture']",Texas slayings draw attention to white supremacist gang,"KAUFMAN, Texas — They burned the gang’s tattoo off the arm of one man who failed to follow orders. Another new member was kidnapped, shot and killed for disloyalty; gang leaders wanted his finger severed as a trophy.

These are just two of the incidents traced to the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, a white supremacist prison gang whose motto is “God forgives, brothers don’t.”

Advertisement

Some fear that the gang may be involved in the recent slayings in north Texas of Kaufman County Dist. Atty. Mike McLelland, his wife, Cynthia, and fellow prosecutor Mark Hasse. Hasse was fatally shot outside the Kaufman County Courthouse the same January day federal authorities publicly thanked county legal officials for their help prosecuting members of the Brotherhood.

After the federal indictment against 34 alleged Brotherhood leaders and other members in November, the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a confidential bulletin that the gang was plotting retaliation.

The bulletin said, in part, “High-ranking members are involved in issuing orders to inflict ‘mass casualties or death’ to law enforcement officials who were involved in cases where Aryan Brotherhood of Texas [members] are facing life sentences or the death penalty.”

One of the federal prosecutors assigned to handle the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas indictment has withdrawn from the case, citing “security reasons.”

“What we’re seeing is that gangs that were for many years confined to prisons are increasingly spilling onto streets around the country,” said Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center. “The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas is arguably the most violent white supremacist prison gang in the U.S. right now.”

Some who are familiar with the gang’s history are skeptical that the Brotherhood targeted the prosecutors, noting that such high-profile victims would bring unwanted attention and that the attacks didn’t seem consistent with the gang’s self-styled sense of honor.

“I found the murder of the wife to be slightly out of character,” said Houston-based lawyer Richard O. Ely II. “These are macho guys. These people are into manly things, being tough — that’s why their punishments are beat-downs. They don’t do drive-by shootings.”

And though it sounds counterintuitive for a gang known for violence, some Aryan Brotherhood of Texas members have taken umbrage at being linked to the killings.

“There is some grumbling among the ABT from sources I have. They feel like they’re being blamed for this, that they’re being set up,” said Terry Pelz, a Houston-based criminal justice consultant who worked for more than 20 years in the Texas prison system.

The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas was founded in the mid-1980s by white inmates seeking to band together to fight black gangs.

Founders contacted the original Aryan Brotherhood gang, which had started years before at San Quentin State Prison in Northern California, and asked permission to found an offshoot. The gang’s leaders balked.

The Texas gang formed anyway, and corrections officials dubbed them the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, or ABT, Pelz said. He said members referred to their California brethren as “surfers.”

Prison officials tried to destroy the gang, shuffling members within the system, but that proved difficult, Pelz said. “When you move them around, they tend to grow because they establish roots somewhere and get new recruits,” he said.

The gang adopted military titles, with soldiers, captains, lieutenants and a leadership “wheel” of five regional generals. Members are trained to communicate in code, or use wives and girlfriends as go-betweens. Generals issue orders such as “SOS” (smash on sight) and a “green light” for killing rivals and rule-breakers, according to court records.

Advertisement

Members have gone by nicknames — “Chopper,” “Bam Bam” and “Ruthless” are some mentioned in court records — and many subscribed to the white supremacist philosophy of “14/88.”

The “88"" is code for “Heil Hitler,” since “H” is the eighth letter of the alphabet. The “14"" represents the 14 words that sum up their beliefs: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.”

Advertisement

They call their monthly meetings “church,” have their own “bible,” called the “Book of Life,” and their own constitution, which includes a rule that any member assisting law enforcement be killed. Their business has been a mix of guns, prostitution and drugs, especially methamphetamines — big business in East Texas, Pelz said.

Pelz estimates that the gang has at least 1,500 members and associates, but said it was difficult to pin down, in part because “there’s more members outside than there are locked up.”

Advertisement

There had been schisms within the group over the years, but recently the gang had become more organized, Pelz said. “The ABT was cleaning their own house, getting rid of members who aren’t carrying their load,” he said.

For other gangs, cleaning house might mean murder, but the Brotherhood abandoned its old “blood in, blood out” rule long ago, Pelz said, and it has remained less brutal and disciplined than other prison gangs, such as the Texas Syndicate or Mexican Mafia. It had also become less ideological, he said.

Advertisement

“There’s not the same commitment to white supremacy that there was — they’ll do business with Bloods and Mexican Mafia” and Mexican drug cartels, Pelz said. “The color that matters is green.”

Pelz doubts the recent killings were by the Brotherhood. “This doesn’t appear to be the work of the ABT — it’s not like them, it’s out of character. They might threaten, but to actually carry something out like this.… If so, it’s a giant leap,” he said.

Other experts agreed the gang’s leaders would probably avoid such attacks.

“That’s going to bring the heat on you,” said Jorja Leap, an adjunct professor with UCLA and an appointee to the California Board of State and Community Corrections’ gang expert committee. “Long-running gangs on the street are smart enough to know their own limits and don’t cross them. The ones that go crazy are the ones that don’t survive.”

Story highlights Andrew McCarthy: Justice Department should handle cases based strictly on facts and law McCarthy: Attorney General Eric Holder should not have politicized the Zimmerman case He says Zimmerman case is not a federal case because civil rights was not an issue McCarthy: If justice had been served, Zimmerman case would never have been a criminal case

(CNN) —

We have a Department of Justice, not a Department of Social Justice. That is an essential distinction. It is brought into sharp relief by politicized demands that George Zimmerman, having just been acquitted of murder by the state of Florida, be subjected to a second prosecution – a federal civil rights indictment – over the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

The Justice Department has earned the trust of the United States courts precisely because it resists the politicization of law enforcement. Its tradition is to ensure the equal protection of law for every American, to evaluate cases strictly on the basis of facts and law, and to recognize its obligations not only to the community but also to criminal suspects.

Yet, though Attorney General Eric Holder never tires of reminding us about the due process owed even to foreign terrorists who’ve confessed to mass murder, the principle does not seem to apply to Zimmerman, an American now acquitted of murder.

Even if the Justice Department never files criminal charges against Zimmerman – which is likely given the implausibility of obtaining a conviction – it is extremely inappropriate for law enforcement officials, particularly the U.S. attorney general, to engage in a running extrajudicial commentary that taints the jury pool and ratchets up the investigative anxiety for a citizen who is presumed innocent and has been acquitted. Law enforcement officials speak in court – with public charges, if prosecutors have the evidence to back them up.

Andrew C. McCarthy

The justice system is not a morality play. It is not designed to right every wrong, nor has it the capacity to remediate tragedy, such as the indescribable pain the Martin family endures after the loss of their 17-year-old son. In the face of such tragedy, the human instinct to demand some kind of “justice” – social, poetic or cosmic – is something we all feel. But that is not the justice our legal system exists to dispense.

Federal courts prosaically apply established law to provable facts, and they rely heavily on the Justice Department to perform that duty faithfully. When a popular political narrative – such as the left’s portrayal of racism as the root cause of many American ills – crashes into uncongenial facts, the justice system is the place where the narrative must yield, and the Justice Department is supposed to ensure that it does.

Sadly, just the opposite has happened in the Zimmerman case. It has been bereft from the start both of proof that Zimmerman had the requisite criminal intent to sustain a murder charge and of evidence to refute his well-corroborated claim of self-defense. That is why veteran police investigators initially declined to file charges.

Yet Holder and his subordinates joined in the effort to induce Florida to file charges, unabashedly making common cause with the likes of the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose metier is racially divisive demagoguery.

Attending an anti-Zimmerman rally with Sharpton, Holder saber-rattled about filing a civil rights case. As the attorney general well knew, his inappropriate chatter would be construed as a suggestion that Florida had abdicated its responsibilities by declining to prosecute a purportedly racist murderer. Simultaneously, Justice’s Community Relations Service worked closely with anti-Zimmerman activists to pressure Florida Gov. Rick Scott into reversing the police determination that there was no case. Scott finally caved, appointing the compliant special prosecutor Angela Corey, who dutifully lodged a groundless second-degree murder charge.

Standard, prudent Justice Department practice has always discouraged commentary on criminal investigations outside the public record. That is for the politicians. Law enforcement is not supposed to speak until the government is ready to file public charges and back them up in court.

To the contrary, Holder has engaged in an extrajudicial publicity campaign, and now finds himself in the hot seat: It’s been over a year since he promised to file charges if warranted by the facts, and the facts have long been known – indeed, they’ve been tried in court.

Obviously, it is easier to promise to keep investigating – and to keep alive a race narrative dear to President Obama’s political base – than to acknowledge that there is no federal case against Zimmerman. The insurmountable proof problems Florida prosecutors faced do not even begin to describe the challenges that would confront a federal case.

A civil rights case would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman shot Martin out of racial animus. There is no evidence that Zimmerman has ever been a racist – jurors in the Florida case say race was not relevant to the case, and the FBI, after investigating extensively for months, has been unable to find proof of a racial motivation.

Furthermore, a federal prosecution would require proof that Zimmerman was trying to prevent Martin’s enjoyment of some statutorily specified civil right – like attending school, applying for a job, staying in a hotel, going to a restaurant, or participating in a federal program. The Zimmerman-Martin altercation was purely local with no federal implications.

Finally, in light of the Justice Department’s heavy-handed role in pressuring Florida to bring a case that police originally decided not to charge, there may be a serious question whether the “dual sovereignty” exception to double jeopardy – allowing a federal prosecution despite a state acquittal – applies.

This is not a federal case. If real justice had been served, it would never have been a criminal case at all.

Defense attorney Mark O'Mara asked that the witnesses be allowed to testify out of the public eye because of concerns for their safety about testifying at the trial, which starts next week. He said their testimony could impact the jury's decision.

Prosecutors and attorneys for media groups objected to the request.

Circuit Judge Debra Nelson also heard testimony about whether a voice recognition expert will be allowed to testify at the trial. Cries for help can be heard in the background of 911 calls that Zimmerman's neighbors made during a struggle between the neighborhood watch volunteer and Martin before the unarmed teen was shot. Experts have reached mixed conclusions about whose voice is crying for help.

FBI voice expert Hirotaka Nakasone, who was testifying for the defense, said there wasn't enough clear sound on the 911 recording to determine whose voice it was. He also said the concept that individuals have unique voice-prints that could identify them was misleading.

""No one can speak in the same way twice,"" Nakasone said.

Testimony was to continue Friday and the judge didn't issue a ruling.

Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, claiming self-defense, in the racially charged case. A delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to protests nationwide. Martin was black. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Hispanic.

The trial is expected to last more than a month.

The judge also considered a request from defense attorneys to sanction prosecutors for what the defense said amounts to withholding evidence. Zimmerman's attorneys alleged that prosecutors withheld deleted photos and text messages that came from Martin's cellphone. An attorney for a technology worker in the State Attorney's Office testified that he first brought the evidence to the attention of Zimmerman's attorneys after he was contacted by the technology worker.

The judge decided to suspend further testimony on sanctions, and any decision, until after the trial."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/27/Biden--Economy-kept-McCain-from-victory-over-Obama,2013-04-27 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Biden: Gun Control 'Will Pass Before the Year is Out',"(AP) – Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that Arizona Sen. John McCain probably would have beat his boss in the 2008 presidential election had the economy not collapsed.

Biden’s comment about McCain and President Barack Obama came during the opening dinner of an annual forum among the Red Rocks of Sedona in northern Arizona. He and McCain, a Republican, touched on the gun control debate following the Newtown shootings and the bombings in Boston, but made no mention of Syria. Just as the night came to a close, Biden turned to the grueling nature of presidential campaigns.

“The truth of the matter is, Barack knows it, I know, had the economy not collapsed around your ears, John, in the middle of literally — as things were moving — I think you probably would have won,” Biden said. “But it would have been incredibly, incredibly, incredibly close. You inherited a really difficult time.”

The forum is part of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a program formed by McCain as a way to debate foreign affairs. This year’s theme for the Sedona Forum is “How can we promote freedom and democracy effectively?”

Rather than a discussion between McCain and Biden, the two sat on stage together with McCain posing questions to his former Democratic adversary on gun control and whether background checks are necessary, human rights abuses at the hands of the United States and the recent bombings at the Boston marathon.

McCain and Biden both said that despite their disagreements, they’ve never lost respect for one another.

On gun control, Biden said it’s never been a simple issue, but that Congress has miscalculated how deeply the public feels about it and has failed to stand up to groups like the National Rifle Association, particularly after the shootings in Newtown. He said the public is looking to Congress to be mature enough to figure out a way to diminish the chance it will happen again.

“For the first time ever, you have people who are for gun safety, for increasing background checks,” Biden said. “Two out of three of them say it will be a major determining factor in how I vote. That’s the political dynamic that has changed. So I think we’re going to get this anyway. I think this will pass before the year is out, within this Congress.”

In responding to a question about the vulnerabilities of the United States when it comes to terrorist attacks, Biden said that the radical, lone wolves have been the most difficult to catch. But he said America shouldn’t change its values, how it treats people abroad or people coming into the United States. Nor should America adopt policies that keep people from freely walking down the street without being frisked by police or carrying identification cards, he said.

“The moment we change any of those things, that’s when they win,” Biden said. “Because they don’t see how you can have a society that is not ordered and regimented and wedded to an orthodoxy that is theirs. That’s the point that bothers them most about us.”

McCain followed up by saying that those who tortured U.S. prisoners, in violation of the Geneva convention, should be exposed and be held responsible to prevent repeated abuses.

So big that two of the media’s most shameful and shameless gun control advocates — Joe Scarborough and Piers Morgan — have finally conceded that arguments made by pro-Second Amendment activists against the expanding of background checks might not be so ridiculous.

In a roundtable discussion on Friday’s “Morning Joe,” Scarborough said that because of the IRS scandal, “My argument is less persuasive today because of these scandals.” He added: “People say, ‘Hey, if they do this with the IRS, asking people what books you read, then how can I trust them with information about my Second Amendment rights?'”

Mika agreed completely: “That is a really, really good point.” Even the Huffington Post’s Sam Stein agreed.

Andrew Johnson at NRO grabbed the video:

Scarborough added that, when it comes to both background checks and immigration reform, the IRS scandal is “devastating,” because both of those pieces of legislation ask us to trust the kind of government that would seize the media’s phone records and use the IRS to target a president’s political foes.

Also courtesy of NRO, here is no-less than Piers Morgan conceding he was wrong to ridicule gun-rights activists (including our own Ben Shapiro) for making the argument that a legitimate fear of government tyranny is what makes the Second Amendment so crucial:

Though I was appalled by the media’s relentless and shameless push last month to pass the Toomey-Manchin bill that would have tightened background checks, I did support its passage, and said so many times while criticizing the media for their disgusting behavior. But this chilling reminder of how corrupt the federal government is has changed my mind completely.

Moreover, our government is not only corrupt, it is vigorously protected by a media that is just as corrupt (NEVER forget the media ignored, dismissed, and even defended the IRS targeting conservatives). The government and media can scream all they want that background checks won’t be used to create a backdoor registry…

But the government and media are liars.

Fear of a national registry has remained even after two influential senators last week proposed a compromise on background checks. The proposal, which will be voted on as an amendment, would expand background checks to gun shows and Internet sales while exempting personal transactions like those among family members.

The provision, meant to ease concerns about the checks becoming too pervasive, also included language to bar the creation of a federal registry.

But the language was not enough. Some gun-rights supporters continue to worry about a slippery-slope scenario, where a background check expansion sets the stage for a national registry -- which could then be exploited to seize weapons from individuals. Despite the fact that licensed dealers already keep records of their sales and a national registry has not yet been created, the Second Amendment nightmare scenario has lived on.

""Once you get these lists out there, once you have a gun dealer keeping lists for lots of other people, the only way that works, frankly I think, is if you keep the paper,"" Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., told Fox News on Monday. ""And if you keep the paper, eventually, somebody's going to ask for it.""

Concerns about gun seizures were stoked most recently after a New York gun owner had his weapons mistakenly seized. They were later ordered to be returned.

Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who drafted the background check amendment, insist a registry is expressly prohibited.

The language of the proposal says the Justice Department ""may not consolidate or centralize the records"" on firearms sales or possession. It goes on to say nothing in the proposal would allow the establishment of a ""federal firearms registry.""

Manchin, speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" reiterated that sellers can do a background check and keep a record -- but the proposal would prohibit a national registry, punishing anybody who tries creating one with up to 15 years imprisonment.

Despite the assurances, some lawmakers were skeptical.

""It has been said on the floor recently that background check legislation cannot lead to gun registries because federal law prohibits that. But current federal law can be changed,"" Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said last week, calling recordkeeping a ""step toward registration.""

He cited testimony that gun registration is important to ensuring a system of universal background checks works.

Those concerns were echoed Monday by Blunt, who said he plans to oppose the bill. He cited reports last week that said 185,000 people in his state were affected after a list of concealed-weapon permit holders was given to federal officials.

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., also said in a statement last week that the Manchin-Toomey proposal ""prioritizes collecting records over protecting citizens.""

David Addington, with the conservative Heritage Foundation, argued that while the new proposal prohibits a federal registry, it also includes language that could create wiggle room for the Justice Department.

Yet supporters of new gun legislation are slowly peeling off votes in favor of the bill. The Senate voted 68-31 last week to advance to debate, easily clearing the 60-vote threshold.

The bill will have to clear that bar once more before earning a final vote -- and some of those who voted ""yes"" last week could vote ""no"" the second time around.

But over the weekend, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he was ""very favorably disposed"" to the Manchin-Toomey amendment.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., as well as Toomey, have also signaled support from the Republican side.

Democrats have a 55-vote majority in the Senate, including two independents who typically caucus with Democrats. If all those Democrats vote for the bill, they would still need five Republicans.

But Democrats could lose a handful of their own -- for instance, two Democrats facing reelection next year opposed last week's motion -- which would require even more Republican support.

It's not yet clear whether Democrats can garner enough of it. Another prominent Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced Monday that he will oppose the Toomey-Manchin amendment.

""Instead of expanding a broken background check system, let's fix it,"" he said."

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) questioned President Barack Obama's commitment to the Second Amendment on Thursday morning, telling ""Fox and Friends"" he thought Obama lacked the ""political courage"" to admit his real feelings.

""Look, I have questions about whether he is truly committed to the Second Amendment as I understand it, most Americans would understand it, and I don't think he has the political courage to admit that,"" he said.

The Republican senator went on to explain that while he didn't think Obama would try to repeal the Second Amendment, he worried about efforts to weaken it.

""If they don't fully understand the Second Amendment and how it's supposed to apply, they are willing to test it and they are willing to see how much they can infringe on it,"" Rubio said. ""My problem with that is, that you're going to do that in exchange for policies that dont work.""

His comments echoed those he made on Wednesday night on Fox. “I actually think the president -- and he just doesn’t have the guts to admit it -- is not a believer in the Second Amendment, although he states that he is,” Rubio said, as reported by The Washington Post. “If he doesn’t want the Second Amendment to be in the Constitution, or if he wants to reform it, then have the guts to admit that.”

Both appearances were in response to Obama's press conference on Wednesday, where the president unveiled his recommendations to Congress to reform gun control policy, and announced 23 executive actions. ""I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality,"" Obama vowed. ""If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try.""

In Florida, which is sometimes referred to as the ""Gunshine state,"" no permit is required to buy or possess a rifle, shotgun or handgun.

On Wednesday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) expressed support for a review of his state's gun laws, but quickly appeared to walk back his comments. In a statement, his press secretary, Jackie Schutz, said Scott ""supports the Second Amendment and is not proposing any gun law changes."""

He Previously Covered Crime', 'Courts For The Kansas City Star.']",Buffalo Wild Wings waitress in Manassas invokes ‘no guns’ policy on Prince William police officers,"

Signs such as this one appear on many Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants across the country, which has a corporate policy banning guns from all of their establishments. (Jason Lea/Mentor Patch)

While some businesses, such as Starbucks, have no policy on whether you can carry guns inside, the restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings does have a policy: No guns. And when a group of eight plain-clothed Prince William County police officers wearing guns sat down last month at the new BWW in Manassas, near Wellington Road and Market Street, a waitress there refused to serve them.

Jamie Rogers broke this story in the Manassas Patch, and reports that the restaurant’s manager tried to make amends the next day with the Prince William police. “There is no reason why those officers should have been asked to leave,” manager Scott Lupton wrote in a letter. “Police officers are always welcome in my establishment and even though we do have a no-gun policy, as a company that excludes off-duty police officers.” Lupton told Rogers he would try to personally apologize to the officers, and he later told Fox News the officers were not asked to leave. I was unable to reach Lupton Monday.

(UPDATE, 11:30 am: The officers were on duty, though in plain clothes, Prince William police Officer Jonathan Perok said, and were not in violation of the restaurant’s policy because there is an exemption for police. Lupton said he had been instructed not to discuss the incident. Waiting for a call back from the BWW HQ.)

Buffalo Wild Wings launched this policy in 2009, and regularly issues the following statement when asked about it: “Buffalo Wild Wings respects the right of individuals to carry firearms. However, because we are focused on the comfort, safety and enjoyment of all of our guests, we have elected to exercise our right to restrict the carrying of firearms within our restaurants. We regret any inconvenience this may cause but believe that this policy is in the best interest of all our guests and our Team Members.”

Openly carrying weapons in Virginia is legal, though private establishments may make their own rules. Carrying a concealed weapon requires a permit. In 2010, Virginia legalized the previously prohibited practice of carrying a concealed weapon in a restaurant or bar, so long as the person does not drink alcohol (and the restaurant allows it). Concealed or open carry, though, Buffalo Wild Wings still says no to average citizens. What do you say?

http://news.yahoo.com/nra-criticizes-obamas-reference-absolutism-144839969.html,,[],NRA criticizes Obama's reference to 'absolutism',"RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A top National Rifle Association official on Tuesday accused President Barack Obama of seeking to redefine the rights of gun owners, telling a hunting and wildlife conservation group that the president's use of the word ""absolutism"" in his inauguration speech was an attack on law-abiding citizens who own firearms.

Obama said in his speech Monday that Americans shouldn't ""mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.""

The remark was interpreted by the NRA as a reference to the organization's steadfast opposition to any new gun regulations.

NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre told a Weatherby Foundation awards ceremony that the Second Amendment gives Americans the unfettered right to own a firearm, but the president wants to redefine that freedom.

""Absolutes do exist, words do have specific meaning in language and in law,"" he said.

The president wants Americans to believe that ""putting the federal government in the middle of every gun transaction"" will make them safer, LaPierre said. But the NRA believes people have the right to defend themselves and their families with semi-automatic firearms technology, he said.

""No government gave them to us and no government can take them away.""

Obama last week unveiled a set of legislative proposals and executive actions on firearms that were formulated in the wake of last month's Connecticut school shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead.

The NRA responded to the proposals by posting a Web video that labeled Obama an ""elitist hypocrite"" for allowing his daughters to be protected by armed guards while not embracing a proposal — supported by the NRA — that would place armed guards at all schools. The organization has also planned an aggressive lobbying push to thwart new gun regulations and has been raising money in response to the outcry for new gun laws.

LaPierre's speech on Tuesday was billed as a response to Obama's inaugural address."

“I am very concerned that this technology will be used against law-abiding American firearms owners,” said founder and executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation, Alan Gottlieb. “This could violate Fourth Amendment rights as well as Second Amendment rights.”

The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) obtained a partially redacted copy of Homeland Security’s drone requirements through a Freedom of Information Act request; CNET uncovered an unredacted copy.

Homeland Security design requirements specify that its Predator B drones “shall be capable of identifying a standing human being at night as likely armed or not” and must be equipped with “interception” systems capable of reading cell phone signals.

The first known domestic use of a drone to arrest a U.S. citizen occurred last year in the small town of Lakota, North Dakota when rancher Rodney Brossart was arrested for refusing to return six of his neighbor’s cows that had wandered on to his property. Critics say the fact that domestic drones are being used in such minor matters raises serious concerns about civil liberties and government overreach.

“That drone is not just picking up information on what’s happening at that specific scene, it’s picking up everything else that’s going on,” says drone expert and Brookings Institution senior fellow Peter Singer. “Basically it’s recording footage from a lot of different people that it didn’t have their approval to record footage.”

Others, like progressive author Naomi Wolf, have warned that domestic drones may soon be weaponized. The military version of the Predator B drone carries 100-pound Hellfire missiles, but the Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) says the 10 drones in its domestic fleet are unarmed.

Last month, NBC News uncovered a confidential 16-page Justice Department memo that concluded the U.S. government may execute a drone strike on an American citizen it believes to be a “senior operational leader” of al-Qaeda or “an associated force.”

The Obama Administration defended the use of drones to kill Americans thought to be working with terrorists. “These strikes are legal, they are ethical, and they are wise,” said White House press secretary Jay Carney."

If my vagina was a gun, its rights would all be protected, no matter the body count or the children affected.

If my vagina was a gun, I could bypass security, concealed carry laws would ensure I’d have impunity.

If my vagina was a gun, I wouldn’t have to beg you, I could hunt this great land and do all the things men do.

But my vagina is not a gun, it is a mightier thing,

With a voice that rings true making lawmakers’ ears ring.

So stop messing with mine, with legislation that’s tragic.

The ad continues: ""Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he is just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security.""

The video, part of the NRA's new ""Stand and Fight"" campaign, comes in response to comments Obama made on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" last month.

""I am skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools, and I think the vast majority of the American people are skeptical that that somehow is going to solve our problem,"" Obama said. ""And, look, here's the bottom line. We're not going to get this done unless the American people decide it's important.""

President Obama is set to announce his proposals for curbing gun violence on Wednesday. According to a Washington Post report, White House officials have considered funding for more police officers in public schools as part of those recommendations.

While placing armed guards in school remains controversial, some polling has showed support for the idea in the weeks since the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School last month. A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found two-thirds of Virginia voters in favor of increased police presence at schools, while 41 percent of respondents in a Washington Post-ABC poll released Tuesday said that having armed guards in schools would do more to curb violence on campuses than stricter gun measures would.

Watch the NRA video above.

UPDATE: The NRA responded to criticism of the ad Wednesday morning. """"Whoever thinks the ad is about President Obama's daughters are missing the point completely or they're trying to change the subject,"" said a spokesman."

That is, until the government actually attempts to do it. Then the lobby changes its lyrics.

It seemed surreal listening to lobbyists for gun rights groups Monday, as if the ears were playing tricks. They testified at a state Senate Budget Committee hearing in opposition to legislation that would spend $24 million in surplus money to confiscate guns possessed by people who legally aren’t supposed to have them.

They weren’t opposed to the gun seizure, they said—only to the use of this particular money. It would come from the $19 fee each gun buyer pays for a background check to determine whether he’s legally eligible to possess a weapon. Is he a felon? Mentally ill?

The lobbyists contended the fee is too high and should be lowered. Never mind that the gun buyer already probably is spending several hundred dollars to buy the weapon. And bullets—depending on the caliber—may go for around, say, $1 each.

They also argued the money should be used to speed up the background check and reduce the 10-day waiting period for taking possession of a gun. In other words, it’s more important to rush a weapon into the hands of a purchaser than to grab one from the clutches of a violent criminal.

“They’re trapped and lost in their own world, and it’s not the real world,” says Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), coauthor of the bill, SB 140, and chairman of the budget committee.

Let’s back up.

California has a unique program—the only one in the nation—that tracks known handgun and assault weapons owners to make sure they’re still legally permitted to possess a firearm. Starting next year, they’ll also be doing it with buyers of all long guns.

Although the gun owner originally was a legal purchaser, he may have since been convicted of a violent misdemeanor, or been subject to a restraining order or been diagnosed with a mental illness. A little computer cross-checking produces a red flag. And a squad of armed officers can knock on the door and seize the arsenal. Roughly 11,000 weapons have been grabbed over the past six years.

Advertisement

But a few weeks ago, it was revealed by the state Department of Justice that roughly 19,700 Californians still illegally owned around 39,000 firearms, and there wasn’t enough money to confiscate them.

So Leno and Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) introduced the bill appropriating the money on an urgency basis, which means it will require a two-thirds majority vote in each house.

At the committee hearing, the Justice Department reported that the list of “prohibited” gun owners, as of March 1, had risen to an even 20,000 people, possessing 40,790 firearms.

“We know 40,000 guns are in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them,” Steinberg told the committee. “We know their addresses, we know who they are….

Advertisement

“We’re not unmindful that money is precious. But here is $24 million. Go get those guns as fast as you can….This is about the notion that you do whatever you can with what you have.”

A no-brainer, you’d think. But not for the gun lobby.

Although the number of prohibited persons possessing weapons is “inexcusable,” said Kathryn Lynch, representing the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the California Assn. of Firearms Retailers, it is “inappropriate” to use background-check money to seize the guns.

“I would argue,” she continued, “that this is tantamount to an attack on honest citizens.”

Advertisement

National Rifle Assn. lobbyist Ed Worley contended that the $19 fee is too high.

Tom Pedersen, of the California Rifle and Pistol Assn., said the surplus money should be spent on upgrading the system to accelerate the checks.

Advertisement

Sam Peredes, lobbyist for Gun Owners of California, said that using money from “law abiding gun purchasers” to seize the guns of bad guys “is not fair and reasonable, and we believe places an undue burden on those people who are exercising their 2nd Amendment rights.”

He contended the weapons confiscation should be paid for out of the state’s general fund.

Advertisement

Guess that also means hunting-license revenue shouldn’t be used to hire game wardens to track down poachers, who despoil everyone’s wildlife.

Peredes lamented that the committee had blown a “historic opportunity to have both the anti-gun and the pro-gun side come together.”

Advertisement

And in that sentence he verbalized the gun lobby’s isolation from mainstream America. It’s blinded by an uncompromising view that either people are “anti-gun” or “pro-gun,” denying the reality that someone can support gun ownership while still seeking common-sense solutions to gun violence.

A Field Poll recently found that 61% of California voters believe it’s more important to impose stiffer gun controls than to protect gun rights.

Advertisement

The committee ignored the gun lobby and voted for the bill 14-0 — with both Republicans and Democrats on board. Leno says he’ll take it up soon on the Senate floor.

A Republican co-author, Sen. Anthony Cannella of Ceres, told me, “It’s a great bill. It seems a great use of the fees. It just makes common sense.”

Advertisement

As for the gun lobby opposition, Cannella said: “I don’t understand it. They always say, ‘Take guns out of the hands of the people who shouldn’t have them.’ ”

No longer. They’ve reloaded with a new refrain.

The (Jackson, Miss.) Clarion-Ledger

Mississippi approved a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in 2004

Supreme Court is expected to rule on two cases any day now

Gay couples have various experiences in the state

JACKSON, Miss. -- Mississippi stands to be caught in the crossfire of what could be one of the most high-profile cases since Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling that ended segregation. The issue: gay marriage. Any day now the U.S. Supreme Court will issue rulings on two cases, one determining states' rights to define marriage and the other questioning the role of the federal government in recognizing same-sex unions.

And while Mississippians answered the question of gay marriage in 2004 by overwhelmingly approving a state constitutional amendment banning the practice, the aftershock of the Supreme Court rulings on California's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act could weaken or obliterate the state's stance on the issue.

Or the nation's high court could reaffirm what Mississippi and 30 other states already have done in passing the bans.

Which way the typically 5-4 split court is leaning is anybody's guess.

Three Mississippi couples explain their experiences.

Leslie & Cheryl: A life of laughter, love

The story of Leslie Criss and Cheryl Sproles began decades ago when a neighborly gesture formed a friendship that would last forever.

They didn't know the chance encounter would end with a happily ever after. But then again, who sees Cupid's arrow before it hits?

A few decades ago Criss was home for the summer from college visiting her family in Brookhaven, Miss. The Criss clan had just moved to the area, and there was concern that Criss' younger sister, Beth, wouldn't know anyone at school.

Family friends hatched a plan. Sproles would go meet Beth and befriend her, ensuring she didn't start the new academic year at the local school without any friends.

""She knocks on the door and my sister and I – both shy girls – answer the door where she says, 'Hi I'm Cheryl Sproles. I'm the most popular girl in town, and I'm here to be your friend,' "" said Criss.

There were no fireworks, no pledges of undying love, no Pavarotti playing in the background. The shy girl and the popular girl became friends and nothing more.

As the years passed, the friendship remained intact. Criss spent time in Los Angeles, a move she said she felt she needed to get out of her system. Sproles moved to New York City to pursue acting. Life happened and the two went right along with it.

Eventually, both of their paths led them back to Mississippi.

When she was 39, Criss said she admitted something to herself that she spent a lifetime denying.

""I knew when I was a third-grader, a shy, scared third-grader, I knew that something was different about me,"" Criss said. ""But I knew instinctively that whatever made me know I was different was something that I should shove deep inside and never talk about.""

A conversation with an Episcopalian minister in Corinth, Miss., was her next step, she said. ""It was the most freeing, empowering moment of my life.""

Meanwhile, Sproles had her own personal journey to find herself.

""With me, I didn't have any idea,"" she said. ""I guess some people know it in the third grade. I was living in New York. I knew it was a lifestyle or something, (but) being raised in the Baptist Church, it was not a possibility.

""When I moved to New York and was introduced to different faiths and different people, it was just kind of eye-opening,"" Sproles said. ""I don't want to make it sound like New York made me realize I was gay, but I had an intern and she said she had a crush on me and I had all these feelings happen.""

Nearly six years ago, Criss was at her job with the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal in Tupelo, a job she still holds.

Sproles had suffered a stroke a year before that, eventually selling her business in Jackson and starting her recovery. One day, while driving through Tupelo, Sproles said she looked up her old friend.

""I asked her out to lunch,"" Sproles said. ""And we've been together pretty much ever since.""

Sproles moved to Tupelo. About a year later, the couple held a commitment ceremony.

It was an experience Criss thought she'd never have.

But there they were, surrounded by family in a small ceremony that announced their intentions to live life to the fullest with each other.

""I have never laughed as much as I have the last six years,"" Criss said. ""We've had some sad times, too.""

""Yeah, we have,"" Sproles said.

Nowadays, the self-diagnosed shy Criss has an infectious grin on her face. The woman who had been content sitting in the audience stood on a theater stage during a recent production of ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" an idea encouraged by her theatrical partner.

And Sproles, a woman who has a million faces and hilarious quips, pauses from time to time to stare lovingly at the woman who anchors her life while keeping her free spirit intact.

It's the work of each woman, wives in everything but name only.

Amelie & Sabrina: A proud family

North Mississippi can be described as one of the most conservative areas in one of the most conservative states. But for Amelie Hahn and Sabrina Mays, it's home.

It's where the two met three years ago while working for the U.S. Census Bureau's big count. Mississippi — Houston, specifically — is where the couple held a commitment ceremony.

""She walked in and she wouldn't give me the time of day,"" said Hahn of the couple's first encounter. ""I tried to talk to her, and she wouldn't speak to me, pay me any attention at all.""

At their first meeting, Hahn made paper footballs, flipping them in Mays' direction. It was a schoolyard attempt to get a crush to look up.

Instead, Mays kept on texting, focusing her attention on her phone she was holding underneath the table.

Hahn, however, wasn't going to give up.

She looked around and found a softball league, choosing to get involved. Of course, it didn't hurt that Mays was a player.

And sometime between whizzing paper footballs past Mays' head to throwing softballs around together, Hahn got the attention she wanted.

She also got a partner.

Mississippi is where the two hard-working moms raise their daughters, Haley, 14, and Jessa, 13.

And it's also a place where the family sometimes feels the sting of disapproval.

""I don't like the dirty looks, I don't like that when we walk by people talk about me,"" Hahn said.

""Most of my friends are pretty cool about it,"" Jessa said. ""I've never had anyone not be my friend because of it.""

There are a couple of friends whose parents don't allow their children to visit the Hahn-Mays house. ""But that's their problem,"" Jessa said.

Even with some of the stares, the family is determined to stay put. At least in some part of Mississippi.

""We're comfortable here,"" said Hahn, adding she and her family want to move to Jackson, a place she describes as being more open than Houston and closer to the hospital where they take Haley, a special needs child.

In the meantime, the family will continue to make an example of themselves, a testament to their normalcy.

""What we're going to have to do is make our presence known and get people to see us as human beings because that's what we are, you know, we're a family just like any other family,"" Hahn said. ""We get up in the morning, we eat breakfast, the kids go to school, she goes to work, I start my school work.""

And Hahn said her family is the reason she will stay and take a stand.

""If we leave, then that's one less couple to stand up and speak out.""

Eddie & Justin: A living example

Growing up gay in the South isn't easy for many members of the LGBT community, but the times, they are changing.

Eddie Outlaw and Justin McPherson have carved out their own little piece of Jackson, the city where they have lived the last nine years. It's where their home is, their friends are and their business operates.

McPherson said the evidence can be seen by younger Mississippians able to come out in high school, to openly discuss their sexuality with their parents.

""I will put my life out there as an example of what this looks like,"" said McPherson, 32. ""It does get better.""

When he was coming out as a teenager, ""it was real bad then, and it's done nothing but improve and will continue to improve.""

""I guess for a teenager looking at what's happening right now -- from (President Barack Obama) to most of the Democrats in the Senate saying they are for marriage equality and overturning (the Defense of Marriage Act), it sends a message,"" said Outlaw, 41.

McPherson said he wants to show that by owning a business while being openly gay, that there is life after coming out.

""I know what it's like growing up in the South. Eddie knows what its like to grow up in the South,"" he said. ""I want to be an example for them, for their parents.""

""Instead of a paso doble,"" said Outlaw, referring to a traditional Spanish dance, ""we've settled into a slow, steady waltz. We found something that works for us."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/02/court-to-review-speedy-approval-ny-gun-controls/,2013-03-02 00:00:00,[],Court to consider whether speedy approval of NY gun controls violated constitution,"A New York state judge agreed Friday to consider whether the state's tough new gun restrictions were rushed into law in violation of the state constitution.

State Supreme Court Justice Gerald Connolly signed an order granting the request for a hearing by plaintiffs who are challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo's decision to waive the three-day review usually required before votes on bills, according to LoHud.com.

The plaintiffs argue the law violates the guarantees of free speech, property ownership and the right to petition the government guaranteed under the state and federal constitutions.

Plaintiff Robert Schulz called Cuomo a ""king"" for pushing through the nation's toughest gun law by suspending the three-day vetting period by submitting a “message of necessity” on the law, which allows the constitutional waiting period to be suspended.

""Kings govern by opinion,"" said Shulz, who calls himself a ""constitutionalist"" and has challenged governors for decades in court although he isn't a lawyer. ""There has to be some rationale, some justification of facts before waiving the people's demand for three days""' review of a bill.

The law enacted Jan. 15, pushed by Cuomo, sets a seven-bullet limit on magazines, tightens the definition of illegal ""assault weapons"" and requires owners of formerly legal semi-automatic guns to register them, among other measures.

The New Yorkers are representing themselves, without lawyers. A March 11 date in state court is scheduled. State officials will have to argue their case to avoid an injunction against the law.

""We believe the law is, and the process was, valid and constitutional,"" said Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi.

Cuomo and legislative leaders agreed on the bill in closed-door negotiations and put the politically dicey measure to a vote at night in mid-January. That was after Cuomo issued the message of necessity, which the plaintiffs say includes misrepresentations.

The message of necessity, according to LoHud.com, reads: “Some weapons are so dangerous, and some ammunition devices are so lethal, that New York State must act without delay to prohibit their continued sale and possession in the state in order to protect its children, first responders and citizens as soon as possible. This bill, if enacted, would do so by immediately banning the ownership, purchase and sale of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices.”

Schulz, of Warren County, called the gun control law ""repugnant"" and seeks to have it declared void. The plaintiffs said they have 1,200 backers.

Schumer Quietly Adds Extreme Measures to Gun Sellers Bill,"Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has quietly added a slew of new measures to his self-sponsored gun control bill currently making its way through the Senate.

Schumer has been fighting to get his Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers Act of 2013 (S 374)–now called the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2013–passed into law, but one of the early problems with the bill was that it was essentially a shell or placeholder bill, incomplete at the time of introduction.

Ostensibly, Schumer’s bill is meant to change current laws to require that all firearm sales initiate a background check on the buyer before the sale is finalized. Currently, private citizens are exempt from performing background checks when they sell guns to other private citizens.

Though the original bill introduced was a shortened version, the New York Senator has since added new amendments to his bill that raise concerns for gun rights advocates.

Schumer’s new Section 202 will make it illegal for an unlicensed person to transfer a gun to any other non-licensed person. The law would require that a licensed gun seller perform an NICS check and fill out a Form 4473 before a transfer would be legal.

Exceptions include transfers from husband to wife or immediate family, short-term transfers for hunting purposes (if the owner is present), or at a shooting range or for firearms instruction.

Section 202 also sets maximum fees for the paperwork and demands that the FFL keep the paperwork during the length of the transfer.

Section 203 is the more problematic section, as it requires that gun owners report the theft or loss of a firearm within 24 hours after discovering the loss. Unless a report is filed with the “Attorney General and to the appropriate authorities,” the gun owner faces five years of imprisonment.

Second Amendment supporters have been fighting to make sure these transfer records are not kept by the federal government in what would essentially become a national gun owner’s database."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/10/Trayvongate,2013-07-10 00:00:00,['Lee Stranahan'],Trayvongate: Newest Obama Scandal Is 17 Months Old,"The newest Obama scandal is seventeen months old.

Welcome to Trayvongate, where the President of the United States used both the bully pulpit, the Department of Justice and sly media manipulation to gin up charges of racism in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin shooting. Now that the trial is almost finished and the only act of racism mentioned so far came from the victim–Martin called Zimmerman ‘a creepy ass cracker’ according to testimony–the cynical and repeated use of the race card by the White house is even more abhorrent.

Judicial Watch revealed documents today that proved what Breitbart News reported in April, 2012: that Eric Holder’s Department of Justice took an active role in racially charged rallies in Sanford, Florida and that the Community Relations Service helped force the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee. That resignation made it appear that Sanford authorities were suspect and possibly complicit in covering up something.

Some of my reporting at the time was based on interviews with numerous public officials in Sanford who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution from the Obama administration. They described a situation where the CRS team took over and forced decisions while clearing a path for protests and rallies that heightened the appearence of racial tensions.

The CRS is a small unit within the Department of Justice and ostensibly it serves a legitimate purpose; attempting to cool down tense situation. As its website says:

The Community Relations Service is the Department’s “peacemaker” for community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race, color, and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, CRS is the only Federal agency dedicated to assist State and local units of government, private and public organizations, and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, incidents, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.

However, under the highly politicized Holder Department of Justice, the CRS has acted as ‘spies and muscle’ according to a source familiar with the unit. In the Zimmerman case, they ended up as doing nothing to facilitate ‘racial stability and harmony ‘, instead acting a heavy thumb on the scales of justice and helping to force events that gave the nation an impression that Martin’s death was racially motivated.

Not just George Zimmerman, but the police and the entire town were targeted in rallies that saw people being bused-in for protests. We now have proof via the Judicial Watch release that these rallies were facilitated by the Obama administration. They were also highly racially charged. Close Obama ally Al Sharpton, along with Jesse Jackson, led the charge. As CBS Miami reported:

“We live in the middle of an American paradox,” Rev. Sharpton told the crowd. “We can put a black man in the White House but we cannot walk a black child through a gated neighborhood. We are not selling out, bowing out or backing down until there is justice for Trayvon.” “This is not about a hoodie, it’s about racial profiling,” Jackson said. “We will use our marching feet, civil disobedience and every weapon in our non-violent arsenal until justice is served.”

However, much of the rhetoric surrounding the Zimmerman story was violent. Many will remember that the New Black Panther party actually offered a $10,000 bounty for the ‘capture’ of George Zimmerman. As the Orlando Sentinal reported:

New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, who shot Trayvon in a gated Sanford community on Feb. 26. Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland — where the 28-year old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. He declined to say when the group would begin their search.

J. Christian Adams knows the New Black Panther Party well; he resigned his position at the DOJ over the refusal to prosecute the Panthers for the now infamous Philadephia voter intimidation actions during the 2008 election. Adams outlined the crimes committed by the NBPP in Sanford:

Let’s start with solicitation to kidnap. In announcing a reward for the seizure of Zimmerman, the New Black Panthers may have violated Florida Code 787.01. It makes it a felony to “by threat, confining or abducting, or imprisoning another person against his . . . will without lawful authority with intent to . . . terrorize.” Merely soliciting someone else to do this is also a felony in Florida under Florida Code 777.04. “A person who solicits another to commit an offense prohibited by law and in the course of such solicitation commands, encourages, hires, or requests another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such offense or an attempt to commit such offense commits the offense of criminal solicitation.”

That’s only part of the list. The New Black Panther’s outrageous, illegal call for vigilante justice happened on March 24th. According the records obtained by Judicial Watch, the Department of Justice deployed to Sanford the next day: March 25th, 2012. However, the DOJ did not go to Sanford to make arrests against the New Black Panthers. Instead, according the the written record, obtained by Judicial Watch, they “deployed to Sanford, FL, to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.”

Once again, the Holder Department of Justice failed to prosecute the New Black Panther Party. They actually helped facilitate mass rallies against Zimmerman and the City of Sanford.

These actions are made even more scandalous by the direct insertion of the President of the United States into the story. President Obama made his famous “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon” remark at the White House, but what got considerably less press was the fact that Obama had a prior relationship with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump. Obama worked with him on another racially charged case when he was a Senator.

Breitbart News reported on the Obama connection to the 2006 story of Martin Lee Anderson. Attorney Crump said publicly that he was following the same media ‘playbook’ as the Anderson case. Tactics included using a photo of Anderson as a child, the same way the media used the Crump-supplied photo of Trayvon Martin as child. This story from 2006 shows the involvement of Senator Obama (who did not end up appearing at the rally), Sharpton and Jackson as well as other usual suspects from the far left.

A rally will be taking place in Tallahassee Friday, April 21 regarding the ongoing investigation into the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Anderson died Jan. 6 at a Panhandle boot camp after being kneed and punched by Bay County Sheriff’s boot camp guards. Students from Florida State University, Tallahassee Community College and Florida A&M University have been involved in the planning and organization of the event at which Rev. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be making appearances. Charlie and Martin Sheen, who donated $10,000 to the cause, are also reportedly planning to attend Friday, along with former TLC member Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Afeni Shakur, mother of the murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. According Samantha Greer, an FSU student and volunteer for the Coalition for Justice for Martin Lee Anderson, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois may also make an appearance. Greer stressed that the Coalition is still looking for volunteers and that anyone is welcome to join the cause.

What we saw in 2012 was the Obama administration using taxpayer resources to ratchet up racial tensions in a local crime case and literally creating key story points in the narrative, such as forcing the sheriff to temporarily resign. At the same time, the President himself made an emotional statement about the victim with direct reference to his race, without revealing that he had worked with the victim’s attorney a few years earlier in a similar case. At the same time, Obama media ally (and Sharpton employer) NBC outrageously edited the Zimmerman audio to make Zimmerman appear racist. All these manipulative and deceptive uses of the race card–pushed along by the Holder DOJ at taxpayer expense–happened just months before the 2012 presidential election.

The only reason this isn’t a major scandal already is the media hasn’t ever done its job and declared it one."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/23/Sheriffs-Suing-Over-Colorado-Gun-Control-This-is-our-Alamo,2013-07-23 00:00:00,['Awr Hawkins'],Sheriffs Sue over Colorado Gun Control: 'This Is Our Alamo',"Larimer County, Colorado Sheriff Justin Smith is one of nearly 30 Sheriffs who have signed their names on the dotted line of a lawsuit to overturn the latest slew of gun control laws passed by the Colorado legislature and signed by Governor John Hickenlooper (D).

The suit in which Smith is taking part specifically targets the laws that emerged from HB 1224 and HB 1229.

HB 1224 bans rifle and pistol magazines holding more than 15 rounds that “were acquired after July 1, 2013.” At the same time, it also bans many other magazines by prohibiting smaller magazines “designed to be readily converted.”

When Breitbart News spoke to Sheriff Smith on July 22, he explained:

The problem with this is that those who wrote the law don’t understand firearms or magazines. And many of the most popular firearms have magazines with removal floorplates — for instance, a Glock magazine. This law will effectively ban certain magazines even if they’re under the capacity limit, based solely on the fact that they are expandable or simply give the appearance of expandability.

HB 1229 put background checks in place for every sale in the state–in store sales, online sales, private sales, and of course, sales at gun shows. Additionally, after forcing every sale to go through a Federal Firearms License (FFL), this law also adds a $10 fee for every background check.

Smith explained to Breitbart News that another asinine aspect of HB 1229 is that it incorporates a 72 hour rule; the law is written so that any time your gun is out of your possession for more than 72 hours you will have to do a background check before getting it back (which also means you will have to pay a $10 fee).

They’ve written the law in a way that the difference between legality and illegality are undefined. They simply stress that the gun has to be in your possession at all times. They’ve tried to clarify this to mean under or within your domain. But let’s say you’re a Colorado resident in legal possession of gun you owned prior the the July 1, 2013 deadline. You have an automobile accident and while the ambulance takes you to the hospital, police find the gun in your vehicle. They hold the gun for you but you’re in the hospital longer than 72 hours. When you finally recover and leave the hospital you ask the police for your gun and they say you have to do a background check to get your own gun back because it’s been longer than 72 hours. Moreover, you have a 17 round magazine in that gun and those are now banned, and because it was out of your possession for longer than 72 hours you’ve forfeited it. This is a mess.

The suit filed by Smith and his fellow Sheriffs is joined by numerous Colorado businesses and individual Colorado citizens. Said Smith: “We are a cantankerous bunch and this is our Alamo.”

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Residents in a small Rhode Island town are voting Saturday on whether four town council members should be recalled for proposing a change in the way the town issues gun permits.

The rare recall election was prompted by gun rights supporters who said the four Exeter council members ignored their objections to a failed proposal to allow the attorney general to oversee the town's concealed weapons permits.

Both sides were concerned about low-turnout with snow in the forecast.

The four council members supported a resolution asking the state's General Assembly to allow the state attorney general to process concealed weapons permits. Under current law, those seeking a permit may apply to either the attorney general or their local police. Since Exeter doesn't have a police department — just a single town sergeant — the job now falls to the town clerk, who the council members said lacks the resources to conduct proper background checks.

Even though the council's request never got a vote in the Assembly, gun rights supporters began petitioning for a recall, saying the town's leaders had ignored the concerns of hundreds of people who turned out for a meeting on the proposal.

Debates about gun policy have sparked similar ouster efforts elsewhere. In September, two Democratic Colorado state senators were recalled over their support for changes to gun laws following the theater massacre outside Denver in 2012.

The recall vote coincidentally comes on the anniversary of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting.

The four officials being targeted by the recall effort are Council President Arlene Hicks and Councilmen Cal Ellis, Robert Johnson and William Monahan. All are Democrats. A fifth member is not up for recall: independent Councilman Raymond Morrissey Jr., who voted against the resolution.

Should one or more of the council members be recalled, their council seats will go to the losing candidates from the last election. Daniel W. Patterson would get the first seat, Edward F. Nataly the second and Lincoln P. Picillo the third.

The fourth seat would be filled by a council appointment.

Polls close at 8 p.m.

Blumenthal said he had no direct contact with the NRA when he signed on to the measure but had been drawn by the idea of a bipartisan initiative to improve background checks. On Friday, Blumenthal withdrew his support, saying in an interview that he was no longer comfortable with the bill because of “serious unintended consequences” related to provisions governing the mentally ill.

Don't confuse this with what the public wants. That the NRA may win some of this battle doesn't mean they win everything everywhere. They fought and lost in CT, NY, MD and CO. But there are plenty of places where they will win, for now.

David Ignatius:

“I can’t adequately describe how unwilling the American people are to get involved in another war in the Middle East,” said one representative. “We’re almost unable to respond,” given what the United States has spent in Iraq and Afghanistan, said another. He described intervention proposals as “half-baked” and argued that “the last thing we need is something ineffective.” A third member summed up the public mood this way: “We are not just war-weary, we are war-wary.”

And that's a bad thing?

NY Times:

China, which has been deeply suspicious of the American desire to reassert itself in Asia, has not protested publicly or privately as the United States has deployed ships and warplanes to the Korean Peninsula. That silence, American officials say, attests to both Beijing’s mounting frustration with the North and the recognition that its reflexive support for Pyongyang could strain its ties with Washington.

Obama’s proposal is expected to include a call for banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as strengthening the background check system for gun buyers. While Congress would have to approve those major steps, he may also lay out 19 actions he can take by executive order, such as mandating that federal agencies gather data on gun safety.

In the wake of the schoolroom massacre in Newtown, Conn., and many other brutal gun-related tragedies in recent months, ideas for dealing with school safety and mental illness are also said to be on Obama’s list. But most of the attention will be directed at his gun control plan, and much of it will be hotheaded and shrill.

The usual gun rights lunatics are preemptively saying it may be necessary to take up arms to stop the government from confiscating everyone’s guns. Rabid rocker Ted Nugent has declared Obama’s proposals “psychotic” and said putting Vice President Joe Biden and Atty. Gen. Eric Holder in charge of the task force to come up with gun legislation is comparable to “hiring Jeffrey Dahmer to tell us how to take care of our children.”

Although assault weapons have been banned in the past without a loss of liberty, and no regulation Obama is considering comes close to negating the right to keep and bear arms, one congressman from Texas said he would push impeachment of the president for trying to nullify the 2nd Amendment.

Tea party hero Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky equated Obama’s proposed administrative actions with the monarchy of King George III and pledged to fight the president “tooth and nail” as if 2013 were 1776.

Clearly, the debate about guns is not going to be a reasoned discussion about how to better regulate the hundreds of millions of guns in America and keep them out of the hands of criminals and crazy people. At least on the right, it will be an exercise in paranoia and fear-mongering.

Meanwhile, in the sane state of New York, Republican and Democratic legislators have joined together to pass new gun restrictions that will ban high-capacity magazines, strictly limit ownership of assault weapons and ban their sale online. They did it quickly in a bipartisan fashion and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the measure into law on Tuesday. So far, the Empire State shows no sign of turning into a Stalinist nightmare. Other than the significant exceptions of Illinois and Michigan, gun deaths are generally lower in states, such as California, that have strict guns laws. New York was on that list even before this newest law was passed.

Of the annual 30,000 gun deaths in the U.S., only 200 are homicides resulting from acts of self-defense, according to the FBI. Still, no one is talking about stripping away the right of anyone to own a gun to scare off a prowler or hold off a rapist (even though most people shot by guns in homes are relatives and friends). The only types of gun anyone is talking about restricting are the assault rifles that former Gens. Colin Powell and Stanley McChrystal say should only be in the hands of soldiers -- the kind of weapon used by a mentally unstable young man to murder first-graders in Newtown.

But folks on the right disagree with the generals. Apparently, that is the kind of weapon they think they may desperately need in the event of civil war against the would-be monarch in the White House."

(CNN) —

“I don’t consider criminal background checks to be gun control.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey made this profound statement earlier this week while announcing a bipartisan Senate agreement to expand background checks to almost all gun purchasers.

Toomey is absolutely correct. Background checks are not about gun control, they’re about human safety. Having checks will make it more difficult for criminals and the insane to obtain guns.

Yet, despite polls showing that over 90% of Americans support universal background checks, it took a “breakthrough” deal to get this proposal simply to a vote by the U.S. Senate. What’s worse, there’s no guarantee this legislation will pass the Republican-controlled House.

Congress’ exasperating struggle to enact a law supported by most Americans is topic No. 1 of this week’s episode of the CNN podcast, “The Big Three,” co-hosted by CNN Opinion contributors Margaret Hoover, John Avlon and myself. Each week we look at three big issues from the week.

The second big issue is the death of Great Britain’s former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Is the fawning over her justified or did her failings outweigh her accomplishments?

And third, is the new song by country singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J, titled, “The Accidental Racist,” racially insensitive, or in today’s hypersensitive climate is it simply impossible to discuss race without causing an outcry?

Here’s a brief summary of this week’s episode:

1. Gun safety laws

Newsweek/Barry Morgenstein/Dean Obeidallah

John Avlon discussed the cowardice of the Republican senators who threatened a filibuster to prevent a vote on the proposed universal background check law, a point he also raised in his most recent column. Margaret Hoover – a reasonable voice on the right (almost an oxymoron) – agreed that Republican senators like Ted Cruz could cause the entire GOP to appear as extremists if they prevented a vote on this proposal via filibuster. I made the case that we need to stop calling these measures “gun control” laws and instead label them as “human safety” laws because the focus is on saving lives, not grabbing guns.

I also raised the point: Is the second amendment out of date? It was enacted when we had 13 states, a population of 4 million and muskets. Should we consider revising or repealing the second amendment to bring it up to date with today’s world so that owning guns is a privilege rather than a right?

2. Death of Margaret Thatcher

Margaret Hoover, a big Thatcher fan, shared the thrill of meeting the former prime minister years ago. I refused to speak ill of the recently deceased Thatcher. So instead, I read excerpts from a recent op-ed penned by British comedian Russell Brand (we all know comedians tend to write the best opinion pieces). Brand was highly critical of Thatcher’s reign. John and Margaret both defended Thatcher from Brand’s allegations that she was an uncaring person who favored the wealthy at the expense of the working class.

3. ‘The Accidental Racist’

Paisley and LL Cool J recorded a song in the hopes of easing racial tension and fostering more understanding. Instead, their song was met by almost universal criticism. Some said the lyrics are culturally insensitive, others said it’s just bad. All three of us agreed that some of the lyrics were ridiculous, such as LL Cool J’s line: “If you don’t judge my gold chains/I’ll forget the iron chains.” Was LL really saying that if a White man doesn’t judge his choice of flashy jewelry, then Black Americans should forget slavery? But the bigger point we discussed is that it’s almost impossible to talk about race in America without being attacked by people on both the far left and far right. I also tell a joke about “White people” that I had performed last month on a TV show that generated an avalanche of angry tweets and e-mails. Just shows, we’ve gone a long way to go.

We hope you will give a listen to this episode of “The Big Three” – and let us know what you think about the issues we discussed.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/nra-goes-offensive-over-high-capacity-magazine-ban-162148044--politics.html,,[],NRA goes on offensive over high-capacity magazine ban,"

The same week President Barack Obama used his State of the Union to warn Congress that the victims of gun violence ""deserve a vote"" on gun legislation, the National Rifle Association has gone on the offensive against attempts to ban high-capacity magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

The NRA, the nation's largest gun rights lobby, released an ad on Thursday that suggested banning high-capacity magazines will turn the country into a crime-ridden nightmare where only the wealthy are protected from murderers and thieves.

The ad points out that Secret Service and other law enforcement officers will not be barred from using the high-capacity magazines, while criminals would still be able to purchase them on the black market. ""It's just the rest of us, the law-abiding people, who will have to defend our families with limited-capacity magazines,"" a narrator intones. ""Welcome to Barack Obama's middle class.""

High-capacity magazines and some semi-automatic weapons were banned for 10 years under a law signed by President Bill Clinton. It expired in 2004.

Meanwhile, the NRA's vice president, Wayne LaPierre, wrote an op-ed in the Daily Caller on Thursday warning that gun owners must ""stand and fight"" against any attempts at gun control. “Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face—not just maybe. It's not paranoia to buy a gun. It's survival. It's responsible behavior, and it's time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that,"" he wrote.

Polls show a majority of Americans support banning high-capacity magazines, as well as closing loopholes that allow some gun buyers to evade federal background checks before purchasing a weapon. (The background checks screen out felons and people who have been declared mentally ill by a judge from purchasing weapons.)

The NRA has also taken a stand against the background checks.

""When it comes to the issue of background checks, let’s be honest—background checks will never be 'universal'—because criminals will never submit to them,"" LaPierre said at a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting last month.

A ban on certain semi-automatic weapons pushed by Obama and some Democrats in Congress enjoys less popular support than either the magazine ban or background checks.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to a magazine as a clip."

The (Jackson, Miss.) Clarion-Ledger

Article 3%2C Section 12 of the Mississippi Constitution adopted in 1890 guarantees the right to bear arms

Lawmaker wanted to clarify that by saying adults don%27t need a permit for a gun unless it%27s concealed

A circuit court judge had agreed to block the law from taking effect after several people sued

JACKSON, Miss. — The Mississippi Supreme Court unanimously upheld the state's open carry gun law Thursday after a lower-court judge previously blocked it from going into effect.

State leaders are hailing the ruling as a victory for the right to bear arms. The bill's author, GOP state Rep. Andy Gipson of Braxton, Miss., said he knew his bill, which says adults don't need a permit to carry a gun unless it is concealed, was constitutional.

""When the lawsuit was first filed, I said I never seen a lawsuit filed over the constitutionality of a law in the Constitution,"" Gipson said.

Gov. Phil Bryant called the new law, which was to go into effect July 1, an important clarification of citizens' right to keep and bear arms under the state and federal constitutions.

Supporters of the law said it simply restates the right to bear arms that's listed in the Mississippi Constitution.

Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves hailed the ruling as a win for the Constitution and for every Mississippian.

""I'm proud the Supreme Court confirmed our goal of protecting our right to bear arms,"" Reeves said.

Article 3, Bill of Rights, Section 12. The right of every citizen to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person, or property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned, shall not be called in question, but the legislature may regulate or forbid carrying concealed weapons.

Hinds County's district attorney, sheriff, four constables and four state senators had sued to block the law, saying they feared people could become trigger-happy and put law enforcement officers and civilians in danger.

Hinds County Circuit Judge Winston Kidd ruled the law was unconstitutionally vague and indefinitely extended his temporary injunction on the law until the state Legislature could clarify it. But state Attorney General Jim Hood, who earlier had expressed some concerns about the law, filed the appeal with the state Supreme Court to overturn Kidd's ruling.

The new law only clarifies what constitutes a concealed weapon without changing any law, Hood said.

Even with the open-carry law taking effect, a previous law bans guns on school and college campuses. Bryant has said he has no problem with guns being banned in government buildings. Many counties and cities also have bans on openly carried guns in public buildings.

A Graduate Of Harvard College', 'She Spent A Year As Middle East Bureau Chief Before Returning As Houston Bureau Chief.']",From the archives:: NRA’s black commentator becomes Web sensation,"Colion Noir may not fit the NRA stereotype, but he does click with fellow members and is ‘certainly causing some controversies.’

Colion Noir belongs to the NRA and owns several guns, including a sleek Glock 17 handgun and a customized AR-15 rifle. But as Noir frequently points out, he does not fit the stereotype of NRA members, or what he calls OFWG: “Old, fat white guys.”

At 29, he’s not old. Nor is he fat — he’s slender and stylishly dressed with sneakers made by Prada. He’s also not white.

In the world of gun owners, Noir, an African American, has become an Internet sensation and his popularity is growing. At this year’s National Rifle Assn. convention here, he was surrounded by fans when he arrived to film a Sportsman Channel segment on the NRA News stage.

“You are certainly causing some controversies,” said Cam Edwards, host of the radio talk show “NRA News Cam & Co.”

Noir has attracted followers with funny, edgy pro-gun videos — titles include “Gun Control & Bathrooms” and “You Know You’re a Gun Control Hypocrite if ...” He has emerged as a dynamic and unexpected NRA persona.

Gun control advocates dismiss him as an NRA pawn, and some blacks accuse him of being an Uncle Tom. But to many at the convention, Noir demonstrated a historic diversity among gun owners that defies stereotypes.

After Noir left the talk-show stage, fans approached to shake hands and pose for photographs. Most were white. A handful of them, like Quentin Smith, were black.

“Congratulations,” said Smith, 44, a gun owner from Cypress, Texas. “There’s a few of us out there.”

The NRA does not release membership demographics, but according to a Pew Research Center survey, many gun owners in America are white — 31% of whites polled this year said they owned guns, compared with 15% of blacks and 11% of Latinos.

“This is one tie that binds all of us together,” said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam, describing the group as “the oldest civil rights organization in America.”

Arulanandam noted that the NRA also recently signed on a woman and a young veteran as commentators who speak to other growing demographics within the ranks of gun owners. He said the NRA did not choose Noir because of his race.

“When he speaks, he’s able to relate to a variety of people. That’s why he has a broad following,” Arulanandam said.

Noir was born Collins — “Mr. Colion Noir” is a stage name — son of an executive chef and a registered nurse. He graduated from high school in Houston, went to the University of Houston, where he majored in political science, and earned a law degree from Texas Southern University’s Thurgood Marshall School of Law.

Noir is a practicing attorney. He reads fashion blogs, loves gadgets and drives a sports car and a truck — neither with a gun rack, although he keeps a metal candy dish full of bullets in his living room.

Noir said he grew up hesitant to admit he liked firearms because it wasn’t something people talked about in his middle-class neighborhood. He fired his first gun, a little Taurus .40, about seven years ago at the urging of a friend who took him to a shooting range.

“I remember how exhilarating it was.” Colion Noir on his first time firing a gun

“I remember how exhilarating it was,” Noir said, comparing the experience to sky diving.

Soon afterward, he was going to the range weekly and researching guns. He later joined the NRA and bought about a half dozen guns. Noir, who once worked at A/X Armani Exchange and favors tailored suits, worries that a concealed handgun might “print,” or show through the fabric.

“Secret Service have the worst cut suits — big and bulky,” so their guns won’t show, Noir said.

A few years ago he began posting YouTube videos of himself critiquing guns and accessories. Then he started tackling politics and pop culture, addressing mass shootings, assault weapon bans and gun control campaigns by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the rapper formerly known as Snoop Dogg.

Noir said he recently started preparing a video about “stand your ground” laws after a jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida.

“I decided to table it because there’s too much complexity,” Noir said.

Advertisement

Noir sprinkles his videos with gun slang and offbeat humor, sometimes delivered with a smirk, sometimes deadpan. Some videos have been viewed more than 800,000 times.

In one, Noir sits on a plush couch in his loft next to his assault rifle, wearing his black Yankees cap and a modern plaid shirt, tossing off references to Justin Bieber and “Entourage” while mocking the owners of .45 handguns as “the Scientologists of the gun world” because they’ve attributed mythical powers to the .45 bullet — think “Zeus’ thunderbolt or Thor’s hammer.”

The camera cuts again and again to Noir wearing different baseball caps as he plays other characters.

Why carry a .45? The characters explain.

“Because a 9 millimeter only kills your body, but the .45 — that kills your soul,” one says, staring dully at the camera.

“Maybe because I’m too lazy to shoot twice,” another says.

“The only ones I know can survive a .45 is Wolverine and Superman,” says yet another.

Noir reasons there’s not much difference between a .45 and other powerful firearms, like the 9-millimeter handgun: “Are you going to be any more dead when, in one of her drunken stupors, Lindsay Lohan runs over you with her Range Rover Sport versus Kim Kardashian in her full-size Range Rover?”

Noir was launching his online brand last spring when the NRA approached him. Officially, he’s a paid commentator, not a spokesman, though the videos are branded NRA. He and the group declined to say how much he’s paid.

Once a deal had been struck, the NRA released an ad in March promoting his first video praising the gun rights group for championing the right of blacks to bear arms during Jim Crow and the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

“The same government who at one point hosed us down with water, attacked us with dogs and wouldn’t allow us to eat at their restaurants told us we couldn’t own guns when bumbling fools with sheets on their heads were riding around burning crosses on our lawns and murdering us,” Noir says in the video as “Washington elitism” flashes across the screen.

It was not a misreading of history, according to UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.”

Winkler said that the armed Black Panthers of the 1960s, despite criticism by then-Republican California Gov. Ronald Reagan and many conservatives, paved the way for the NRA’s current interpretation of the 2nd Amendment: that citizens should be able to carry guns in public, not just for hunting, but for protection, including protection against government tyranny.

Now some in the black community have denounced Noir for what they say is selling out to the white pro-gun establishment, with critiques posted on theroot.com and the Black Entertainment Television website.

“He’s taking more heat from black people than anybody. The racism that exists now is mostly on our side,” said the Rev. Kenn Blanchard, 50, a gun rights activist who is black. He said he advised Noir to accept the NRA deal.

Noir said he expected attacks, but he gets frustrated when critics highlight his race.

“Calling me an Uncle Tom simply because I’m into firearms, it doesn’t even make sense.” Colion Noir

“Calling me an Uncle Tom simply because I’m into firearms, it doesn’t even make sense. My entire identity as a black guy is based on my ownership of guns? Really?” he said. “Some of the most influential black individuals have advocated for the use of firearms, so how come when I do it, I’m vilified? Take a look at the Black Panthers, MLK, Malcolm X.”

The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. supported gun rights? Noir noted that after King’s home in Montgomery, Ala., was firebombed, King applied for a handgun permit.

When it comes to outreach to potential black gun owners, Noir will find that the demographics are stacked against him, Winkler said. Figures show blacks and Latinos are more likely to be Democrats who support gun control, especially young minorities in urban areas who associate guns with gangs and neighborhood violence, he said.

Perhaps Noir’s rise says more about the NRA’s acceptance of minorities than the group’s ability to woo them.

At the NRA convention, as Noir left the talk-show stage, Chris Blow of Magnolia, Texas, stopped him. Blow, 59, is a longtime NRA member and had watched Noir’s videos. Where, he wondered, did Noir like to shoot? Noir reeled off a few locations in the Houston area. Blow, who is white, smiled knowingly and shook Noir’s hand.

“You seem like someone I’d like to go shoot with,” he said."

So you wake up this morning and find you’re president of the United States.



Pretty cool, no? Helicopters and a 747 at your disposal; courtside seats at any NBA playoff game of your choice; everyone stands up and the band plays when you come into the room.



But the job comes with some baggage, and one of the heaviest of steamer trunks is what to do about a political ally—make that three or four of them—who hands you a stinging defeat on a key, emotionally laden issue.



After the Newtown massacre, you put gun control—sorry, you call it “gun safety” now to avoid ruffling red state sensibilities—back on the table. You give powerful speeches surrounded by the grieving families of the kids who were killed at Sandy Hook. You see a gun rights Democrat, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, and a gun rights Republican, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey draft a bill that provides a kind of, sort of, sprinkled-with-exceptions background check.



And then you see four Democratic senators vote “no.” Three of them—Mark Begich of Alaska, Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas—were up for re-election next year (Begich and Pryor still are, but since the vote Baucus has decided not to run) in states where gun rights sentiment runs strong, and where Obama lost last year by wide margins.



What do you do now? For some on your side of this fight the answer is easy. William Daley, your former chief of staff and a member of the Chicago political family that has always played politics as a contact sport, says he’ll tell the apostates to look elsewhere for campaign contributions.



Some of your own supporters make a different point. They say you’re too soft, unwilling to back a senator up against the wall, stick your face in his (or hers), and get the vote you want—the way Lyndon Johnson used to do.



But you’ve got other considerations to think about. Next years’ midterms are going to be dicey under any circumstances, at least if history is a guide. Presidents in their sixth year almost always find their party losing seats in the Congress. With the retirement of Democrats in tough states such as South Dakota, West Virginia and Montana (Obama performed dismally in all three last year), your party’s hold on the Senate is in jeopardy. Cutting two incumbent Democrats loose significantly raises the chances that your party will lose the Senate. And if that happens, you can say goodbye to your domestic agenda, not to mention your federal judgeship nominations.



What you’re facing, it turns out, is the same dilemma that any president, any major officeholder faces: How much are you willing to live with in order to pursue a broader agenda?



FDR had to deal with Southern segregationists—and outright racists—who held power in Congress, so he had to yield to that power in order to get his New Deal legislation passed. As the Digital History website tells it: ""Most New Deal programs discriminated against blacks. The NRA, for example, not only offered whites the first crack at jobs, but authorized separate and lower pay scales for blacks. The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) refused to guarantee mortgages for blacks who tried to buy in white neighborhoods, and the CCC maintained segregated camps. Furthermore, the Social Security Act excluded those job categories blacks traditionally filled.”



JFK faced the same ugly reality: In order to get a black candidate approved for a federal judgeship, he had to name an ally of Mississippi Sen. James Eastland to the federal bench. That judge delighted in calling black civil rights demonstrators “chimpanzees”—and worse—but Kennedy paid that price.



So what do you do, Mr. (or Madame) President? Do you offer an object lesson to other members of your party by telling the trio of defecting senators to take a hike as a way of saying, “If you desert me on a big issue, you will pay the price?”



Or do you decide to swallow your anger and cheerfully hit the campaign trail next year to save this trio, because the price of losing the Senate is just too high?



You make the call."

Majority of Michiganders support ban on assault weapons and background checks

44%25 of respondents oppose Obama%27s plan

Results broke along party lines%2C with independents split 40%25 in favor%2C 42%25 opposed

WASHINGTON -- Many Michigan residents may be suspicious when asked in general about President Barack Obama's proposals for gun control , however, they appear to support the specific recommendations.

A poll by EPIC-MRA of Lansing, Mich. -- released exclusively to the Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV, Detroit -- shows majority support among state residents for prohibiting the sale or possession of so-called assault weapons, banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and requiring background checks for all firearm purchases.

Those are three of the top suggestions made by Obama last month in the wake of the December school shootings in Newtown, Conn. But when asked in general how they felt about ""President Obama's proposed changes in national gun laws,"" 44% of respondents said they were opposed, compared with 42% who were in favor. Fourteen percent were undecided.

Taken together, those results suggest that when it comes to people's opinions about gun control and the Second Amendment right to bear arms, very little can be taken for granted.

For instance, Beverly Ballew, 59, of Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich., said while she could support increasing background checks, limiting certain high-capacity ammunition magazines and prohibiting access to anything that could fire rounds repeatedly with a single pull of the trigger, she remains suspicious of any proposals Obama puts forward.

""I don't trust him No.1,"" she said. ""No. 2, I'm very supportive of the Second Amendment.""

For the poll, EPIC-MRA surveyed 600 Michigan voters between Feb. 5-10. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Despite splitting over Obama's proposals, respondents supported banning high-capacity ammunition magazines by a 58%-38% margin and prohibiting the manufacture, possession or sale of ""semi-automatic assault weapons, such as the AK-47 or the AR-15, 54%-43%.

The margin was even higher for requiring background checks for all gun sales — with 86% in favor compared with 12% opposed.

Rob Harris, the media director for Michigan Open Carry, a group which advocates the legality of unconcealed possession of firearms in public, said the results show how potentially misleading the issue — and the terms used in the debate — can be.

""Most people that you would come across in society today don't know what an assault weapon is,"" he said. ""If you ask a general person, they're going to say it's a machine gun, and that's not the case. ... It's a scary word that scares a lot of people who are not in the know.""

Steve Dulan, with the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners, said many of the definitions applied in the gun debate have ""been an attempt to mislead people on this issue.""

""I don't think that's even in question,"" he said.

Unlike a fully automatic weapon — such as those used by the military and some law enforcement — a semi-automatic assault weapon still requires a shooter to pull the trigger to fire each round. So-called assault weapons typically don't require a shooter to manually load another round, and gun control advocates argue their military design is antithetical to sporting uses.

Proposing a return of the assault weapon ban that expired in 2004, Obama said last month that weapons such as the rifle used in a shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater last summer ""when paired with high-capacity magazines"" have ""one purpose — to pump out as many bullets as possible, as quickly as possible.""

""These military style weapons, there's no reason why anyone outside the military needs them,"" said David L. Garrett Jr., 68, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.

With a doctorate in chemistry, Garrett — a retired chief materials engineer at General Motors and Delphi — said he has no problem with firearms for sport, but semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned. He doubts it will happen, though.

""With the Republicans in office (and holding the majority in the U.S. House), not a chance,"" he said.

The EPIC-MRA poll showed that while self-described Democrats broke by a better than two-to-one margin in favor of Obama's recommendations and Republicans by a more than two-to-one margin against, independent voters were split 40% in favor, 42% against. Slightly more than half of men — 52% — were opposed to Obama's proposals, compared with 38% in favor and 10% undecided; 45% of women were in favor, compared with 36% against and 19% undecided.

""I think it just shows that while Americans are united in their support for the Second Amendment it needs to go hand in hand with keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals,"" said Zach Pohl, executive director of Progress Michigan, a liberal activist group."
http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/19/us/colorado-town-drone-ordinance/index.html,2013-07-19 00:00:00,['Natalia Perez-Segnini'],Small Colorado town considers drone hunting licenses,"Story highlights Deer Trail aims to sell drone hunting licenses for $25, offer bounties for downed drones

Proposed law is ""a statement against the coming surveillance society,"" its author says

But federal law prohibits stealing or damaging federal government property

City officials aim for financial gain, fun; state official cites Coloradans' sense of humor

Deer Trail, a small Colorado town, is considering a measure that would allow its residents to hunt for federal drones and shoot them down.

""Is it illegal? Of course it is. But it's also illegal to spy on American citizens,"" resident Phillip Steel told CNN in a phone interview. ""If they fly in town, we will shoot them down.""

Steel said he wrote the ordinance after he learned the Federal Aviation Administration ""loosened regulations that would allow the flight of drones in domestic airspace.""

The FAA recently announced plans to create six drone test sites around the country, none of which has been publicly listed. It plans to allow widespread use of domestic drones in 2015 . ""The overall purpose of this test site program is to develop a body of data and operational experiences to inform integration and the safe operation of these aircraft in the National Airspace System,"" the agency said.

Drones are cheaper to operate than helicopters. They can be used for multiple tasks, such as monitoring crops and livestock and assessing building damage.

Deer Trail, which bills itself as the ""Home of the World's First Rodeo,"" has 584 residents and is 50 miles outside Aurora. The entire town takes up less than one square mile. Any resident can petition for a citizens' initiative and then draft an ordinance.

Bounties and shotguns

The Town Board of Trustees will vote on the drone ordinance on August 6. If passed, it would legalize the sale of drone hunting licenses for $25 and offer bounties for captured drones. Six trustees and the mayor make up the board. It would take a simple majority vote to pass the ordinance.

""It is very symbolic ... it's asserting our right and drawing a line in the sand,"" Steel said. ""It declares sovereignty of the airspace.""

The ordinance doesn't aim to stop airliner flights, he said. It outlines the rules of engagement for drone hunters and the types of ammunition allowed. Bounty amounts from $25 to $100, and weapons are limited to 12-gauge shotguns.

It states that ""no background investigation shall be performed"" on those seeking a drone hunting license. Additionally, the licenses would be ""issued on an anonymous basis.""

""Unmanned aerial vehicles may be engaged at a vertical distance of one thousand feet or less,"" and the ""licenses shall only remain valid within the geographic boundaries of the Town of Deer Trail, Colorado,"" according to the ordinance.

Federal legislation ( 18 USC 1361 ) prohibits stealing or damaging federal government property and establishes provisions for fines and imprisonment.

The illegality of the actions within the ordinance doesn't scare Steel.

""I took an oath when I joined the military to protect the U.S. Constitution. That oath did not end when I left,"" he said.

When asked if he had ever seen a drone in Deer Trail, Steel said, ""In real life, no. I hope I never see a drone in Deer Trail. ... This ordinance is a statement against the coming surveillance society. It's a very clear statement against that.""

""In all practicality, nobody is going to shoot down any drones any time soon,"" he added.

'Our mark on the map'

Town Clerk Kim Oldfield says she believes the ordinance could benefit the town.

""This could actually be something to help fund a community center or build us some roads. We need to find our mark on the map,"" Oldfield said. ""The novelty of being allowed to buy a drone-hunting license could turn into a fun thing.""

Board of Trustees member David Boyd said the ordinance has a good chance of passing.

""I think it's important. I know Phil Steel also wants to make a statement about drones. ... Mostly for us, the outcome we want will be to have some fun and make some money,"" Boyd said.

Deer Trail Mayor Frank Fields says he agrees with Boyd. He said the purpose of the ordinance would be ""to have fun and bring in business, tourism and activities for people in town.""

Colorado Attorney General John W. Suthers said state residents have a sense of humor. He responded to the idea of the ordinance by saying, ""A resolution by the town of Deer Trail to allow the hunting of drones is made in the same spirit as the proposal of some rural Coloradans to create a separate state. And both ideas have the same chance to legally succeed: none."""

President John Morse is in danger of getting thrown out for

his support for strict gun control laws passed in the 2013 session.

Early voting began Thursday, continued through Friday and Saturday and will resume Monday. The election is on Tuesday.

The recall initiative was launched by gun rights activists against the Colorado Springs Democrat John Morse and Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo because of their votes for the gun laws that include limiting the size of ammunition magazines and requiring universal background checks.

The Denver Post reports that Republicans are dominating in the early voting in Morse’s district and Democrats will have a lot of votes to make up if they want to keep Morse in office.

The vote totals so far from the El Paso County clerk and recorder show that although Republicans only comprise 26 percent of Morse’s Senate District 11, they account for 41 percent of the early voting.

Here are the figures: VOTER REGISTRATION: 69,481

Unaffiliated: 26,725 or 37.81%

Democrats: 23,344 or 33.59%

""The NRA is venal. They come after you, they put together large amounts of money to defeat you,"" she said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""They did this in '93, and they intend to continue it.""

Feinstein on Thursday introduced details on a ban that would stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of more than 100 specialty firearms and certain semiautomatic rifles. It would also limit the number of rounds in a magazine to 10.

The restrictions would not apply to guns owned before enactment of any law. Feinstein noted her proposal exempts from the ban more than 2,000 models used for hunting or sporting purposes.

In order for the proposal to go anywhere, Feinstein needs enough support from conservative Democrats, who will likely face intense lobbying from the NRA and other pro-gun groups.

While she recognized Sunday that passing the ban will be an ""uphill fight"" and the ""hardest of the hard,"" she expressed confidence that she can at least get it to the Senate floor.

""There will be a package put together. If 'assault weapons' is left out of the package - and I'm a member of (the) Judiciary (committee), No. 2 in seniority - I've been assured by the majority leader I'll be able to do it as an amendment on the floor.""

Feinstein helped push through the 1994 assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. She argued Sunday that the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, last month was the tipping point in getting the ban reinstated.

""For me Sandy Hook was an epiphany,"" she told CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. ""(The gunman) got a very powerful weapon. He went out with that weapon, and he killed 5- and 6- and 7-year-olds, I understand, with three to 11 bullets in each of their bodies, with a weapon that had the velocity of which could really rip these bodies apart. That should not be able to happen.""

Vice President Joe Biden, who also helped champion the original assault weapons ban, expressed support for the ban on Thursday. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama announced that his legislative agenda to curb gun violence included a ban on assault weapons and a cap on magazine capacity.

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, railed against Obama's inauguration speech, in which the president made a brief reiteration of his push for gun control.

""When absolutes are abandoned for principles, the U.S. Constitution becomes a blank slate for anyone's graffiti,"" LaPierre said in a speech Tuesday. ""Words do have meaning, Mr. President. And those meanings are absolute, especially when it comes to our Bill of Rights.""

Feinstein, however, said Sunday it boils down to one question: ""Does government have an obligation to protect those children?""

""I believe we do,"" she continued. ""I believe we do.""

Gabrielle Giffords urging an overhaul and a top National Rifle Association official saying ""homicidal maniacs"" will skirt the system no matter what.

NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre was the final witness to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee as the panel begins to consider new legislation. He argued that more security and more enforcement, but not new laws, is the answer to gun violence.

He specifically knocked down a call by President Obama and others for ""universal"" background checks, particularly at gun shows.

""When it comes to background checks, let's be honest -- background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them,"" LaPierre said.

But Giffords' husband Mark Kelly argued that improving the background check system should be a priority. He said holes in the law ""make a mockery"" of the system -- echoing Obama's recent proposal, he called for submitting private sales to background checks as well. He further argued that stronger background checks could have prevented the mass shooting in January 2011 where his wife was shot in the head.

LaPierre later got into an argument over the issue with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., after LaPierre argued that more background checks would merely subject ""law-abiding people"" to more taxes and fees and hassle without going after ""bad guys.""

""Mr. LaPierre that's the point,"" Durbin said. ""The criminals won't get to purchase the guns because there'll be a background check. We'll stop them from the original purchase -- you missed that point completely. I think it's basic.""

Raising his voice, LaPierre said: ""Senator, I think you missed the point!"" Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then banged the gavel and called for order.

The disagreement was one of several sticking points as the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first gun control hearing since Obama released a comprehensive gun control plan earlier this month.

LaPierre pressed for enforcing existing laws over creating new ones. ""Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works,"" LaPierre testified. ""Unfortunately, we've seen a dramatic collapse in federal gun prosecutions in recent years.""

He continued: ""Proposing more gun control laws, while failing to enforce the thousands we already have -- it's not a serious solution for reducing crime.""

The panel was stacked with high-profile witnesses on both sides of the debate. Giffords, who was shot while meeting with constituents outside an Arizona supermarket in January 2011, made a surprise appearance at the start of the hearing Wednesday morning to urge Congress to act.

""We must do something,"" Giffords said, speaking slowly but clearly. ""It will be hard, but the time is now. ... You must act.""

Giffords urged lawmakers to ""be bold, be courageous."" She later met with President Obama at the White House.

""Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying,"" the former congresswoman said. Six people were killed, and 12 were wounded, in the Arizona attack. The fatal shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., last month brought the issue of gun control back to the fore of the congressional agenda.

Kelly, speaking after his wife, called for a ""careful and civil conversation"" about limitations on firearms. He noted that he and Giffords own guns, but are ""anti-gun violence.""

He said a ""matrix"" of failures contributes to the country's gun violence problem, including mental illness and poverty, but also gun laws. He said the complexity is ""not an excuse for inaction."" Kelly said weapons designed to inflict maximum damage have turned corners of America ""into places of carnage and gross human loss.""

Kelly briefly described how the 2011 shooting affected his family, leaving his wife partially blind and struggling to walk. Kelly and Giffords have formed a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions to back lawmakers who support tighter gun restrictions and counter the influence of the NRA.

LaPierre, though, argued that prosecution for federal weapons violations in 2011 was essentially down 35 percent, compared to previous administrations, which he says means violent felons, gang members and the mentally ill who possess firearms are not being prosecuted.

""That is completely and totally unacceptable,"" said LaPierre, who suggested fixing the country's ""broken"" mental-health system become part of the solution to gun violence -- including making patient records part of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

The hearing, titled ""What Should America Do about Gun Violence,"" takes place roughly seven weeks after a lone gunman with psychological problems used an assault weapon to kill 20 first-graders and six adults inside a Connecticut elementary school, prompting renewed calls for more gun control.

The NRA, with 4.5 million active members, remains the most powerful gun-rights advocacy group in the country.

Obama is calling for a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, along with more extensive background checks.

LaPierre said the group is willing to work with Congress and the president in curbing gun violence, but ""law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals. Nor do we believe the government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families.""

Under questioning from Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson said Wednesday that the current background check system has already stopped nearly 2 million ""prohibited purchases"" between 1994 and 2009.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has already introduced legislation taking similar steps to Obama's proposals.

The California Democrat on Tuesday said she will hold her own hearing on gun control because she was unhappy that three of the five witnesses testifying Wednesday are ""skewed against us."" Feinstein is a member of the Judiciary Committee.

Despite the momentum gun control advocates have gained since the massacre in Newtown, Conn, it will be difficult for them to prevail in Congress this year because of the popularity of guns in many states -- including several represented by Democratic senators -- and the formidable muscle of the NRA on Capitol Hill, lawmakers and others say.

Among other obstacles, the Republican-run House has shown little immediate interest in making dramatic changes in the laws.

At the Senate hearing, Leahy, D-Vt., said lawmakers were not trying to take away Americans' guns.

""They're not at risk. ... what is at risk are lives,"" he said.

The committee's top Republican, Sen. Charles Grassley, said he welcomed the ""renewed discussion"" on gun violence.

But he voiced skepticism about a renewed ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. ""Those can be circumvented by carrying multiple guns,"" Grassley said.

Update: The White House attacked the National Rifle Association on Wednesday for an ad that mentioned President Obama's daughters, calling it ""repugnant and cowardly.""

""Most Americans agree that a president's children should not be used as pawns in a political fight,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

The Obama spokesman added: ""But to go so far as to make the safety of the president's children the subject of an attack ad is repugnant and cowardly.""

The NRA issued its own statement, saying the ad is about Obama's opposition to more armed guards in school.

""Whoever thinks the ad is about President Obama's daughters are missing the point completely or they're trying to change the subject,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.

He added: ""This ad is about keeping our children safe. And the president said he was skeptical about the NRA proposal to put policemen in all schools in this country. Yet he and his family are beneficiaries of multiple law enforcement officers surrounding them 24-hours a day. That's the real issue. Anything else is an attempted calculated distraction.""

Earlier post:

As President Obama prepared to unveil a legislative package attacking gun violence, the National Rifle Association has a new video attacking Obama -- and citing his children.

The 35-second video criticizes Obama's skepticism of proposals to put armed guards in all schools, while noting that his daughters receive Secret Service protection.

""Are the president's kids more important than yours?"" the narrator says. ""Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school? Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he's just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security.""

The law provides Secret Service protection for the president and his immediate family.

This week, CNN TV and CNN.com will take an in-depth look at “Guns Under Fire: A CNN Special Report on Background Checks.” At 8 p.m. today, “AC360” will debut Part 1 of Dana Bash’s exclusive interview with former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot two years ago in Arizona. On Wednesday, CNN will look at gun control and background checks.

(CNN) —

There are days when Congress seems determined to earn its 12% approval rating – and that 14 Republican senators are threatening to filibuster any new gun legislation should make your blood boil if you still have a heart to pump it with.

Four months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School slaughter, the vast majority of Americans still support some sensible new gun laws, but the same legislation has been declared DOA by conservative senators.

It’s enough for some activists to crow that the NRA’s strategy to stall until public attention moved elsewhere has succeeded. The old argument after a mass shooting – “it’s too soon” – has been revealed to be the delay and dodge it always was.

Newsweek John Avlon

In a democracy, the will of the people is supposed to have some sway.

And an astounding 91% of Americans back universal background checks – including 88% of Republicans, according to a Quinnipiac poll. Reality check: 90% of Americans don’t agree on the awesomeness of apple pie and vanilla ice cream. The disconnect between Congress and Main Street America has rarely been so stark.

This should be a no-brainer – especially because the most “controversial” initial proposals have been dropped because they were considered too politically difficult to pass. Those included a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban, which is only supported by a narrow majority of the American people, and a limit on high-capacity magazines

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was hotly criticized by liberals for backing off this proposal, but he cited pragmatism – the need to get 60 votes for passage.

That Reid himself has enjoyed high ratings from the NRA and is looking out for the political fortunes of red state Democrats running for re-election was a source of some suspicion. But even Reid’s attempt to put forward a less polarizing bill has been met by the threatened Republican filibuster. There seems to be no reward for being reasonable.

When Rand Paul filibustered the nomination of CIA Director John Brennan, I cheered – not because I agreed, but because it was a principled attempt to educate the American people on drone strike policy and because Paul pursued the filibuster the traditional “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” way, taking the Senate floor rather than blocking debate with a parliamentary maneuver. But this threatened filibuster on guns follows the old obscure obstructionist ways, blocking debate and accountability rather than encouraging it.

The arguments would-be filibusterers such as Sens. Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Mitch McConnell and Mike Enzi are making sound as if they are principled – if you don’t pay attention to the facts.

Here’s Enzi’s take: “The measures proposed currently by the majority do not reduce crime, they simply restrict the American public’s constitutional right to self-defense. … These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and proponents won’t stop with these restrictions.”

Enzi is singing from the current conservative hymnal, but let’s take a closer look.

His statement is a combination of fictitious fear-mongering (“These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights”) and the dystopian slippery slope (“and proponents won’t stop with these restrictions.”)

Let’s start with a reality check on the most predictable of the oppositional bumper stickers: the “assault on Second Amendment.”

First, the Second Amendment is already enshrined in the Constitution. It cannot be abridged by legislation.

Moreover, there exists the right to reasonable restrictions, such as the ban on machine guns that has existed in the USA since the 1930s and originally passed with NRA support. But don’t take my word for it – listen to conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote in the landmark Heller Decision, which declared D.C.’s functional ban on handguns unconstitutional:

“Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues.

“The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [United States v.] Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those ‘in common use at the time’ finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.”

Got that? Unless gun advocates are going to start calling Scalia a RINO (Republican In Name Only), there should be some room here for reasonable debate.

Yes, we need to acknowledge that Americans use guns differently in urban and rural areas. That’s one reason liberal former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean had an A rating from the NRA when he ran for president in 2004. But if politically difficult but clearly constitutional measures such as an assault weapons ban, which Ronald Reagan backed, aren’t included in the proposed legislation, we surely should be able to debate this issue rationally and in the open.

Republicans are doubling down on irrational appeals and trying to block debate.

That’s another reason this position is infuriatingly stupid – it compounds the number one negative perception about the Republican Party. Namely, that it is “inflexible and unwilling to compromise.”

Why be afraid of an open debate and an up or down vote on this issue?

Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani and John McCain have pointed out the counterproductive nature of this threatened filibuster, with McCain saying on CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand.” He added, sensibly: “What are we afraid of?”

That’s a good question. And the answer is hiding in plain sight.

Republican senators are afraid of a conservative primary challenge fueled by huge amounts of outside money backed by activists and lobbying groups such as the NRA.

I genuinely believe that both parties have good ideas and good people – and principled voices are arguing for a constructive compromise and a real debate on this issue.

Opponents can’t even defend their inaction by arguing they are representing their constituents because of the overwhelming bipartisan margins for the proposed increased background checks and cracking down on gun-trafficking. But hyperpartisan politics are once again threatening to trump policy-driven problem solving. That’s why Congress has such a dismal approval rating in the first place.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, parents who lost children in the Newtown massacre will be walking the halls of Congress, trying to appeal to the conscience of our legislators. It will be interesting to see whether their personal appeals will carry as much weight as the influence of gun lobbyists.

This issue isn’t academic – it is an urgent test of our elected representatives’ ability to be responsive to the public will and reason together.

If Newtown can’t get Washington’s attention, what will? The shooting of a colleague, Gabby Giffords, apparently didn’t. Conscience and compassion should matter more than cold hard cash.

Updated 6:23 p.m. ET, 12/31/2013

Washington (CNN) - A group of Catholic organizations, in an emergency appeal on Tuesday, asked the Supreme Court to delay the Obamacare requirement that certain religious-affiliated groups provide contraception and ""abortion-inducing drug"" coverage to their workers.

Archdioceses in Washington, D.C., Tennessee and Michigan - along with affiliated groups that include Catholic University - asked Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan to block enforcement of the employer mandates under the Affordable Care Act set to take effect on Wednesday.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The issue has been a major sticking sticking point with religious groups and private for-profit companies that have strong moral objections.

Under final rules negotiated between the administration and a variety of outside groups, churches and houses of worships are exempt from the mandate.

But other non-profit religious-affiliated groups like church-run hospitals and parochial schools must either provide no-cost contraception coverage or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer's direct involvement.

""Tomorrow, applicants (the Catholic organizations] will be forced to choose between onerous penalties or becoming complicit in a grave moral wrong,"" according to the court filing from the groups.

""Just as an individual may be held accountable for aiding and abetting a crime he did not personally commit, so too may a Catholic violate the moral law in certain circumstances by cooperating in the commission by others of acts contrary to Catholic beliefs.

""For some, religion provides an essential source of guidance both about what constitutes wrongful conduct and the degree to which those who assist others in committing wrongful conduct themselves bear moral culpability,"" the groups said.

There was no indication when Roberts, Kagan or the high court as a whole would rule.

The appeal came after the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville pressed President Barack Obama on the issue.

He asked Obama in a letter that went further than the appeal to Roberts and Kagan to exempt some businesses and religious-affiliated institutions from enforcement of the mandate - through fines - until the Supreme Court rules on the matter.

He pointed to other delays the administration has made in the law, such as putting off until 2015 the requirement for all employers with more than 50 workers to provide health coverage.

But Kurtz notes that ""an employer who chooses, out of charity and good will, to provide"" health insurance for employees can still face fines if that employer does not want to comply with the contraception requirement.

""In effect, the government seems to be telling employees that they are better off with no employer health plan at all than with a plan that does not cover contraceptives,"" he writes.

The letter represents a major first act by Kurtz, who was elected president of the bishops' conference in November, succeeding Archbishop of New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan.

The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear two cases involving for-profit corporations who say their religious liberty is violated by the law.

Among the plaintiffs is Hobby Lobby, Inc. nationwide chain of about 500 arts and crafts stores.

At issue is whether private companies can refuse to do so on the claim it violates their religious beliefs.

The privately held company does not object to funding all forms of contraception – such as condoms and diaphragms – for their roughly 13,000 employees, which Hobby Lobby says represent a variety of faiths.

The Green family, which owns Hobby Lobby, said in court filings they object to contraceptives like the morning after pill, which they would say constitutes abortion and violates their faith.

Hobby Lobby calculated that their refusal to provide the coverage could result in a fine of up to $1.3 million daily.

The White House said in November that it believes a requirement on contraceptives is ""lawful and essential to women's health.""

A controversial initiative that would require women to buy an additional rider on their health insurance if they wanted abortion coverage is one short step away from going to the Legislature, where it is likely to easily become law. Because no one filed a challenge by Monday’s deadline to the more than 315,000 signatures turned in to the Secretary of State, an initiative that would prohibit abortion coverage from being included in standard insurance policies will go forward. And the Secretary of State certified Monday that Michigan Right to Life, which spearheaded the petition drive, has more than enough valid signatures to start the ball rolling on the new state law. A minimum of 258,088 valid signatures were needed. The anti-abortion activists turned in 315,477 signatures. And the Secretary of State’s elections division estimated that 299,941 of the signatures are valid. The state Board of Canvassers will meet at 9:30 a.m. Dec. 2 to certify the signatures and then the petition moves to the state Legislature, which has 40 days to approve, reject or do nothing with the legislative ballot initiative.

If Republicans vote it down or fail to act on it, it will be a ballot iniatitive in the next general election. Neither of these is likely given their ideologically extreme views. If they pass it, it becomes law. The other 95.8% of us won’t have a say and neither will Governor Snyder.

Oh and, by the way, most Michigan voters actually oppose the law.

“Today’s ruling marks an important victory for Texas women and sends a clear message to lawmakers: It is unconstitutional for politicians to pass laws that take personal, private decisions away from women and their doctors,” said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

After Texas lawmakers approved the new restrictions this summer, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers challenged them in court, arguing that they unfairly limited medication-induced abortion and forced doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital near the abortion clinic where they work, in effect closing a third of clinics statewide.

Opponents did not challenge one of the most controversial provisions of the new law, which bans abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy and is still scheduled to take effect Tuesday.

The Texas attorney general’s office argued that the new provisions protected women and fetuses.

U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel said in his ruling that the admitting-privileges requirement violated the rights of doctors to do what they thought was best for patients. But the judge said restrictions on medication-induced abortions should stand “except when a physician finds such an abortion necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.”

Texas Atty. Gen. Greg Abbott, a Republican campaigning for governor, made no personal comment Monday, but a spokeswoman for his office, Lauren Bean, said the state had already filed an appeal of Yeakel’s ruling with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

“As everyone – including the trial court judge – has acknowledged, this is a matter that will ultimately be resolved by the appellate courts or the U.S. Supreme Court,” Bean said in a statement.

Heather Busby, executive director of Austin-based NARAL Pro Choice Texas, said opponents of the law were “very pleased” that the judge had ruled against the provision requiring admitting privileges.

“This is one of the most dangerous provisions of the law because it would have closed clinics, leaving 22,000 women without access to care,” Busby said, adding that she was “disappointed it wasn’t a more broad ruling.”

Busby said she hoped the appeals court would uphold the judge’s ruling limiting the law.

“Our hope is that the 5th Circuit will look at how other jurisdictions have ruled on this and how damaging it can be for women, and not put politics or personal beliefs before the law,” she said.

Similar admitting-privileges requirements were blocked as a result of challenges in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota and Wisconsin before they took effect. State courts in North Dakota and Oklahoma have struck down restrictions on medication abortion.

Mississippi passed a law similar to the Texas restrictions last year. It faced a similar legal challenge before a federal judge blocked the law pending a trial in March. Mississippi’s attorney general asked the 5th Circuit to lift a temporary stay and allow the law to be enforced in the interim, but the court refused.

In Texas, unlike Mississippi, the judge’s order is a final decision, meaning an appeal to the 5th Circuit would require a review on the legality of the law itself, not just an injunction to block it.

“We’re optimistic that they will share our opinion on this issue,” said Emily Horne, a legislative associate at Houston-based Texas Right to Life.

The proposed restrictions drew national attention this summer when state Sen. Wendy Davis staged a daylong filibuster in an attempt to block them in June. Davis, a Democrat, is also running for governor.

The filibuster forced Republican Gov. Rick Perry to call a second special legislative session, where the Republican-controlled Legislature eventually passed the law.

“Today’s decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life and ensure the women of our state aren’t exposed to any more of the abortion-mill horror stories that have made headlines recently,” Perry said in a statement Monday. “We will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly elected officials of our state, laws that reflect the will and values of Texans.”

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said he hoped the appeals court would uphold the state’s “reasonable” law.

“Texas passed common-sense legislation to protect the health of women and their unborn children. This law is constitutional and consistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent protecting the life and health of the mother and child,” the senator said in a statement.

[For the record, 5:26 p.m. Oct. 28: An earlier version of this post quoted Emily Horne as saying Yeakel had rejected a Texas law two years ago that required sonograms before abortions. Actually, that ruling came from a different federal judge, so the paragraph with the erroneous information has been deleted.]

They're not done exerting more control over womens bodies and one State Senator is promising ""all out hell"" if they proceed.



A Democratic state senator promised ""all out hell"" next week if Republicans stick to their plan to take up a controversial bill restricting abortion for public workers and limiting access to contraception for employees of religious organizations. Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said Tuesday's session could mirror one in June, when Senate President Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) broke the base of his gavel as he slammed it down to quiet Democrats upset over passing a different abortion bill. Footage of those raucous proceedings was featured in an ad targeting Ellis run by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin. Republicans who run the Senate are tentatively planning to approve two abortion bills on Tuesday. One would ban any abortions that are sought because of the sex of the fetus. The other would prevent public employees' health plans from covering most abortions, and would also strictly limit the ability of employees of religious organizations to get contraception through their insurance plans.

That's right. If you're a public employee, you won't be able to get an abortion and if you work for a religious organization (like a hospital), no birth control for you.

In case you've forgotten, this is how Republicans rammed through these bills in June with only 1 speaker and no debate:

Yes, Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling Democrats to sit down and shut up. After the ram through, the State Senate, as you can see, quickly adjourned. Democracy doesn't exist for the GOP."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/24/washington-state-weighs-first-in-nation-abortion-insurance-mandate/,2013-03-24 00:00:00,[],Washington state weighs first-in-the-nation abortion insurance mandate,"In 1970, Washington became the first -- and remains the only -- state in the country to legalize elective abortions by a popular vote.

A generation later, and 40 years removed from the landmark United States Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling that extended abortion access nationwide, Washington is once again poised to stand out.

With 21 states having adopted bans or severe restrictions on insurance companies from paying for abortions, Washington is alone in seriously considering legislation mandating the opposite.

The Reproductive Parity Act, as supporters call it, would require insurers in Washington state who cover maternity care -- which all insurers must do -- to also pay for abortions.

The bill passed the state House earlier this month by a vote of 53-43, though it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. A similar bill in the New York state Assembly has been introduced each session for over a decade but has never received a public hearing.

""This is a core value for Washingtonians,"" said Melanie Smith, a lobbyist for NARAL Pro-Choice Washington. ""We should protect it while we still have it and not leave access to basic health care up to an insurance company.""

The proximate cause of Washington state's measure is the federal Affordable Care Act. Thanks to language placed in it to assuage anti-abortion congressional Democrats, insurers selling their plans on the state exchanges taking effect next year will have to segregate the premiums they collect for abortion coverage.

In addition to that built-in disincentive to insuring abortion, the law also invites states to enact stricter rules of their own. Thus far, 16 states have followed suit, barring or restricting insurance companies on their exchanges from covering the procedure. Three of those states are joining the five that have barred or limited all insurers from covering abortions since the early 1980's.

Supporters of Washington state's proposed abortion insurance mandate are careful to stress that it wouldn't lead to a dramatic uptick in abortions or require carriers with a religious bent to cover the procedure. They also note that a pair of federal plans that will be sold on all 50 state exchanges will be barred from covering elective abortions.

""It's not expanding abortion coverage,"" said Democratic Rep. Eileen Cody of West Seattle, the bill's primary sponsor. ""It's ensuring the rights of women to get what they're paying for now and to continue their freedom of choice.""

Opponents counter that the measure would require businesses and individuals to pay for abortion coverage they'd rather not have.

""Washington state would be the only state in the country that would force employers to pay for abortion,"" said Peggy O'Ban, spokeswoman for Human Life of Washington.

If passed, she said, it would amount to ""the first conscience coercion act in American history.""

Its passage, however, is not assured.

Proponents of the measure say they have the votes they need in the state Senate, but it's not clear that Senate leaders will allow it to get to the floor. It is scheduled to receive a public hearing in the Senate Health Care Committee on April 1.

Ironically, the man bill supporters will likely blame if it fails to get a Senate vote counts himself as a proud backer of the measure.

Sen. Rodney Tom of Medina, a fiscal conservative and social moderate, and one other like-minded Democrat crossed party lines to caucus with Republicans in December, handing a one-vote majority to the GOP. Seizing power for the first time in nearly a decade, elated Senate Republicans reciprocated by installing Tom as Majority Leader.

Last month, Tom addressed about 250 advocates rallying for the measure's passage on the state Capitol steps.

""I'm down here making sure that my 17-year-old daughter has the kind of protections that we need in Washington state and that all of our kids have those same kinds of protections,"" Tom said to cheers.

Moments later, Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat and fellow bill supporter, delivered a not-so-subtle challenge to Tom's political will.

Washington state ""deserves a vote in the state Senate on the Reproductive Parity Act,"" Inslee said. ""We are going to insist that we are not going to let anybody close the door to democracy in this state.""

Another irony: though the bill has proved to be among the most hotly contested of the session, its broader impact if passed may be less than sweeping.

For one thing, most abortions are paid for out-of-pocket. According to the Guttmacher Institute, only 12 percent of abortions nationwide are paid for by private insurers, with 20 percent footed by Medicaid.

For another, because most abortions cost less than a live birth -- the procedure typically runs about $500, though late-term abortions are far more expensive -- insurers may be disinclined to stop covering them.

At present, all major insurers in Washington state cover abortions, and Cody, the bill's sponsor, said she knows of no carrier with plans to change. Insurers new to Washington state on its exchange may be tempted to adopt different policies, she said.

No matter its immediate impact, said Elizabeth Nash, states issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute, the bill's passage would be a watershed event.

""It would be a model for other states to follow,"" she said."

State Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, who is also chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, repeatedly invoked race as she railed against ObamaCare critics.

""I have talked to so many members both in the House and the Senate, and you know what? You ready? You ready? What it comes down to? It's not about how many federal dollars we can receive, it's not about that. You ready? It's about race,"" she said. ""I know nobody wants to talk about that. It's about the race of this African-American president.

She tried to argue that because former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- who is white -- offered a ""similar"" overhaul in the past, the criticism this time ""comes down to the race of the president of the United States which causes people to disconnect and step away from the substance of the bill.""

The Republican Party of Louisiana is calling on Peterson to apologize for the comments.

""Bottom line is it's wrong to call someone a racist just because they disagree with you. There are a plethora of reasons why we disagree with ObamaCare ... and the race of the president or of anyone else has absolutely nothing to do with it,"" Ryan Cross, communications director for the state GOP, told FoxNews.com. ""It's appalling and it has no place on the floor.""

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, also told local affiliate WBRZ that it's ""wrong to call people racists"" simply over opposition to the health law.

Peterson released a statement Thursday afternoon clarifying her remarks while also defending them.

""I think we should judge a policy by its content, not the person proposing it,"" her statement said.

""To be clear, I didn't call any person 'racist.' Rather, I was simply relaying the truth about conversations I've had with my colleagues and the factors they considered on the expansion of Medicaid.

""While others are using this as an opportunity to take my comments out of context in order to distract from the true issue, I think it's critical that we focus on the substance of the policy because it's the right thing to do for Louisiana.""

http://news.yahoo.com/texas-senate-passes-abortion-restrictions-050032557.html,,[],Texas Senate passes new abortion restrictions,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Senate passed sweeping new abortion restrictions late Friday, sending them to Republican Gov. Rick Perry to sign into law after weeks of protests and rallies that drew thousands of people to the Capitol and made the state the focus of the national abortion debate.

Republicans used their large majority in the Texas Legislature to pass the bill nearly three weeks after a filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis and an outburst by abortion-rights activists in the Senate gallery disrupted a deadline vote June 25.

Called back for a new special session by Perry, lawmakers took up the bill again as thousands of supporters and opponents held rallies and jammed the Capitol to testify at public hearings. As the Senate took its final vote, protesters in the hallway outside the chamber chanted, ""Shame! Shame! Shame!""

Democrats have called the GOP proposal unnecessary and unconstitutional. Republicans said the measure was about protecting women and unborn children.

House Bill 2 would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, allow abortions only in surgical centers, limit where and when women may take abortion-inducing pills and ban abortions after 20 weeks.

Abortion-rights supporters say the bill will close all but five abortion clinics in Texas, leaving large areas of the vast state without abortion services. Only five out of 42 existing abortion clinics meet the requirements to be a surgical center, and clinic owners say they can't afford to upgrade or relocate.

The circus-like atmosphere in the Texas Capitol marked the culmination of weeks of protests, the most dramatic of which came June 25 in the final minutes of the last special legislative session, Davis' filibuster and subsequent protest prevented the bill from becoming law.

The Senate's debate took place between a packed gallery of demonstrators, with anti-abortion activists wearing blue and abortion-rights supporters wearing orange. Security was tight, and state troopers reported confiscating bottles of urine and feces as they worked to prevent another attempt to stop the Republican majority from passing the proposal.

Story continues

Those arrested or removed from the chamber included four women who tried to chain themselves to a railing in the gallery. One of the women was successful in chaining herself, prompting a 10-minute recess.

When debate resumed, protesters began loudly singing, ""Give choice a chance. All we are saying is give choice a chance."" The Senate's leader, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, told officers to remove them.

Sen. Glen Hegar of Katy, the bill's Republican author, argued that all abortions, including those induced with medications, should take place in an ambulatory surgical center in case of complications.

Democrats pointed out that childbirth is more dangerous than an abortion and there have been no serious problems with women taking abortion drugs at home. They introduced amendments to add exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to remove some of the more restrictive clauses, but Republicans dismissed all of the proposed changes.

Sen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat, asked why Hegar was pushing restrictions that federal courts in other states had suspended as possibly unconstitutional.

""There will be a lawsuit. I promise you,"" West said, raising his right hand as if taking an oath.

The bill mirrors restrictions passed in Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kansas, Wisconsin and Arizona. In North Carolina, lawmakers are considering a measure that would allow state health officials to apply standards for ambulatory surgical centers to abortion clinics.

Passing the law in Texas would be a major victory for anti-abortion activists in the nation's second most-populous state. A lawsuit originating in Texas would also likely win a sympathetic hearing at the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

But Democrats see in the protests an opportunity that could help them break a 20-year statewide losing streak. They believe Republicans have overreached in trying to appease their base and alienated suburban women, a constituency that helped President Barack Obama win re-election.

""In the long run, all they have done is built a committed group of people across this state who are outraged about the treatment of women and the lengths to which this Legislature will go to take women's health care away,"" Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told The Associated Press in an interview Friday.

Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat, said during the debate that it was clear the bill was part of national conservative agenda attempting to ban abortion and infringe on women's rights one state at a time. He pressed Hegar on why the Texas Medical Association, Texas Hospital Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology opposed the bill.

He asked Hegar how he could ignore these experts.

""There are differences in the medical profession,"" Hegar insisted, rejecting the criticism. ""I don't believe this legislation will majorly impede the doctor-patient relationship.""

Sen. Bob Deuell, a Greenville Republican and a doctor, defended the bill, saying abortion clinics ""had not maintained the proper standard of care.""

That’s a 7.4% increase from last year, with an average wait time of 273 days. Nationally there are 587,351 veterans who have waited more than 125 days.

In Cleveland where Tom’s disability was filed in 1971, then again in 1999, and for a 3rd time one year ago this month, there is a backlog of 25,273 claims, up 16.4% over last year, with a wait time of 334 days. Waiting more than 125 days are 18,971 disability claims. Tom’s claim has gone through that hurtle. The claims examiner ignored Tom’s psychiatric hospitalization and continued care since 1971 by saying that the military medical records from Germany were insufficient proof.

Tom now joins 273,714 whose claims have gone to the appeals process. Of that group 14% or 38,320 will be wrongly decided according to the VA. Hosea Roundtree shares Tom’s experience. Before you criticize the claims examiner, watch this YouTube [5:19 minutes long].



http://youtu.be/...

The difference between Hosea Roundtree and Tom is that Tom is on dialysis. He is so thin that normal body fat which cushions the impact of the needles required to administer the procedure are very painful. That pain makes him nauseous and the weight he needs to gain is never forthcoming.

How long Tom can last under these conditions is anyone’s guess – but, on average his case will take another 2 ½ years before it is heard. Here is the ugly truth: The VA has no reason to hurry these appeals. Should the veteran die before the case is adjudicated either initially or at the appeals level, the case dies with him. His spouse [and Tom has none] may get something but other heirs get nothing.

That’s just wrong. It is patently unfair. That needs to change. There ought to be a law. If a critically ill Veteran dies while their disability claim is pending an initial decision or if the claim has gone to the appeal level, as is the case with Tom, the case must survive as a part of the Veteran’s estate. There are 38,320 Veterans whose families deserve the chance to get a correct answer. So here’s my plea:



Please ask your Congressman and Senators to sponsor legislation that requires the Veterans Administration to make this change: Should a veteran die before their Veteran's disability case is adjudicated either initially or at the appeals level, the disability case survives as part of the Veteran’s estate.

From Richard Cranium:

It’s a sad day when an obscure, oddball 2010 Senate candidate from Delaware (who is NOT Christine O’Donnell) gets the VA benefits claim process workflow about right: 6. Did the veteran die or commit suicide?

- If Yes then the claim is complete.

- If No then go to step 7.

Justice Sotomayor blocked the implementation of the mandate

Sotomayor acted on a request from an order of Catholic nuns in Colorado

Portions of the Affordable Care Act go into effect Jan. 1

WASHINGTON (AP) — Only hours before the law was to take effect, a Supreme Court justice on Tuesday blocked implementation of part of President Obama's health care law that would have forced some religion-affiliated organizations to provide health insurance for employees that includes birth control coverage.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor's decision came after a different effort by Catholic-affiliated groups from around the U.S. Those groups had rushed to the federal courts to stop Wednesday's start of portions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

Sotomayor acted on a request from an organization of Catholic nuns in Denver, the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged. Its request for an emergency stay had been denied earlier in the day by a federal appeals court.

The government is ""temporarily enjoined from enforcing against applicants the contraceptive coverage requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"" Sotomayor said in the order. She gave government officials until 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) Friday to respond to her order.

The law requires employers to provide insurance that covers a range of preventive care, free of charge, including contraception. The Catholic Church prohibits the use of contraceptives. That was not acceptable, said the nuns' lawyer, Mark L. Rienzi.

""The Little Sisters are an order of Catholic nuns whose religious faith leads them to devote their lives to caring for the elderly poor. Not surprisingly, they have sincere and undisputed religious objections to complying with this Mandate,"" Rienzi said.

The Obama administration crafted a compromise, or accommodation, that attempted to create a buffer for religiously affiliated hospitals, universities and social service groups that oppose birth control. The law requires insurers or the health plan's outside administrator to pay for birth control coverage and creates a way to reimburse them.

But for that to work, the nuns would have to sign a form authorizing their insurance company to provide contraceptive coverage, which would still violate their beliefs, he said.

""Without an emergency injunction, Mother Provincial Loraine Marie Maguire has to decide between two courses of action: (a) sign and submit a self-certification form, thereby violating her religious beliefs; or (b) refuse to sign the form and pay ruinous fines,"" he said.

The White House did not comment on the order Tuesday night. Sotomayor issued the order a few hours before leading the final 60-second countdown and pushing the ceremonial button to drop the New Year's Eve ball in New York's Times Square.

A spokeswoman for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the lead counsel for the Little Sisters of the Poor, said the group was delighted by Sotomayor's order. ""The government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people,"" Emily Hardman said in a statement. ""It doesn't need to force nuns to participate.""

Sotomayor's decision to delay the contraceptive portion of the law was joined by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which also issued an emergency stay for Catholic-affiliated groups challenging the contraceptive provision. But one judge on the three-judge panel that made the decision, Judge David S. Tatel, said he would have denied their motion.

""Because I believe that appellants are unlikely to prevail on their claim that the challenged provision imposes a 'substantial burden' under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, I would deny their application for an injunction pending appeal,"" Tatel said."

Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday unveiled his long-promised Women’s Equality Act, a 10-point plan whose controversial final element, which includes codifying federal abortion rights into state law, could determine the fate of various other antidiscrimination provisions included in the bill.

The governor has made the proposal a central part of his plan to reclaim New York’s progressive mantle, and cement his own reputation as a defender of women’s rights, something that could be critical to any presidential bid. But the legislation’s prospects were unclear in the State Senate, which is currently controlled by a coalition of independent Democrats who support abortion rights and Republicans who generally oppose abortion.

On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, sounded cautiously optimistic about the bill’s chances. “We do not have any assurances,” he said in a news conference attended by about two dozen representatives of women’s groups. “But the language of this bill, I believe, this is a bill that can and should pass.”

But Senator Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, the Senate Republican leader, does not plan to consent to bring the abortion portion of the act up for a vote, according to his spokeswoman, Kelly Cummings, though she added that Republicans felt they would come to agreement on all other nine parts of Mr. Cuomo’s plan."

House passes restrictive abortion bill,"Story highlights The bill now heads to the state Senate for approval It includes a requirement for doctors to be present at an abortion It also prohibits government-administered insurance plans to pay for abortions Critics say the bill would make it hard for abortion clinics to stay in business

(CNN) —

North Carolina’s House of Representatives passed a restrictive abortion bill Thursday with a 74-41 vote. The bill now heads to the state Senate for approval.

The bill would place requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business. Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed.

The bill allows North Carolina’s health department to make temporary new rules for the state’s 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit.

It also prohibits government-administered insurance plans, such as those under the Affordable Care Act, to pay for abortions – though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman’s life.

House committee members refashioned a bill on motorcycle safety into one principally about abortion after the state’s governor threatened on Wednesday to veto the abortion measures. That led the bill to be dubbed the “Motorcycle Abortion Bill.”

When legislators attached the abortion measures to the motorcycle safety bill, they placed them at the top of the bill and renamed it “Health and Safety Law Changes.” motorcycle safety measures dropped to the bottom of the bill.

Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, vowed to veto the abortion legislation the first time it came up.

In his campaign, he had promised not to restrict abortion in North Carolina, and abortion-rights advocates lobbied to hold him to his word.

McCrory warned in a statement that the legislation was unacceptable without significant changes, but he noted in his objections “that major portions of the bill are of sound (principle) and value.”

The language of the bill was reworded somewhat the second time around. It now says the health department should make rules without “unduly restricting access.”

McCrory could still veto, though there are enough conservative votes in the House and Senate to override it.

A similar but stricter law passed in Mississippi is coming close to shutting down that state’s last abortion clinic. Another such law passed in Alabama earlier this year.

These new state laws represent a broader, nationwide assault on a woman’s right to choose, said Staci Fox, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman.

“Bills like these have been introduced in 42 states. This is a whole new level of attack on women’s health.”

Some of the states that have already passed new laws did so in anticipation of legal challenges and have shored up war chests to fund the battles, she said.

They are prepared to go to court, even to challenge the landmark Supreme Court abortion ruling Roe v. Wade that provides the basic legal framework for abortion in the United States.

Abortion opponents confirm the judicial strategy behind the laws.

Americans United for Life states: “Using our model legislation and our hard-won expertise with abortion clinic regulations, we also intend to provoke future, strategic ‘test cases’ – federal and state legal challenges to carefully crafted and selected state laws – that will serve as vehicles to severely undermine Roe v. Wade and, ultimately, eradicate it from American law.”

The court by a 5-4 vote denied a request by Planned Parenthood to block a ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, allowing key parts of the Texas abortion law to stay in effect while the lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward.

The four liberal justices who voted in favor of the request said they would have overturned the appeals court's Oct. 31 ruling that allowed the law to take effect.

In its 20-page ruling, the panel of appeals court judges acknowledged that the law's provision requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital ""may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions.""

However, the panel said that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that having ""the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate"" a law that serves a valid purpose, ""one not designed to strike at the right itself."" The provision has led at least 12 clinics in the state to stop performing abortions since the ruling.

A spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General's Office said Tuesday said the office is ""pleased"" with the Supreme Court's ruling.

""These are commonsense - and perfectly constitutional - regulations that further the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of Texas women,"" Lauren Bean said.

Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry also said he was happy with the court's decision.

""This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions,"" Perry said.

The appeals court panel left in place a portion of a previous judge's order that prevents the state from enforcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol for abortion-inducing drugs in cases where the woman is between 50 and 63 days into her pregnancy. Doctors testifying before the court had said such women would be harmed if the protocol were enforced.

The appeals court's order is temporary until it can hold a complete hearing, likely in January.

The restrictions gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June.

The law also bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and beginning in October 2014 requires doctors to perform all abortions in surgical facilities.

During the trial, officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified that they've tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals, but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision.

Many hospitals with religious affiliations will not allow abortion doctors to work there, while others fear protests if they provide privileges.

Many have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility, or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.

The final rule, issued under the new health care law, adopts a simplified version of an approach proposed by the government in February to balance the interests of women with the concerns of the Roman Catholic Church and other employers with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptives.

After considering more than 400,000 comments, administration officials refused to budge on the basic principle. The rule, they said, is very similar to their proposal. An exemption is included for churches. But many Catholic hospitals, schools, universities and other religious institutions will have to take steps so that coverage is available to employees and their dependents.

The issue figured prominently in last year’s elections as President Obama and other Democrats pressed their advantage with female voters. At the same time, Catholic bishops waged a national campaign arguing that the federal policy infringed on religious freedom and violated the church’s social and moral teachings on birth control and abortion."

(Gerry Broome/AP)

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly years ago, Republican Scott Walker pushed two key measures to limit abortions. Neither was successful.

But as governor on Friday, Walker signed legislation requiring that women get an ultrasound before having an abortion and mandating that doctors who perform the procedure have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Opponents say the bill would force at least two clinics in Wisconsin to close.

The measures are part of a wave of abortion limits passed this year by conservative lawmakers and governors, who have approved more than 40 restrictions in statehouses around the country, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks the issue.

The push has been aided by the expanded control of state governments by Republicans, who now hold a majority of governerships and legislatures and who enjoy veto-proof majorities in twice as many states as Democrats. Some of the measures were also fueled by outrage over the conduct of providers such as Philadelphia late-term abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted of murder charges this spring.

By mobilizing partisans on both sides, the abortion issue is poised to figure more prominently in the 2014 and 2016 elections than most strategists would have expected six months ago.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), widely seen as a presidential contender, is weighing whether to play a leading role on the issue by sponsoring a Senate bill to ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization. Rubio is attempting to shore up support among conservatives who opposed his role in crafting a Senate immigration bill.

In North Carolina, the state Senate adopted a sweeping bill Wednesday that includes a ban on sex-selective abortions and on abortion coverage in insurance offered in the state’s health exchange. It also requires abortion clinics be held to the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and have a transfer agreement with a local hospital.

In Texas, the legislature convened a second special session this week to take up a bill similar to North Carolina’s, which state Sen. Wendy Davis (D) successfully blocked through a filibuster in late June.

“It’s not as if there’s some central mastermind strategy that’s organizing action on the state level,” said Maureen Ferguson, senior policy adviser at the Catholic Association. “It really is a response of the people and the growing pro-life sentiment in the country.”

But abortion rights activists and their Democratic allies say the push will work to their political advantage in upcoming congressional and gubernatorial races, allowing them to portray Republicans as more focused on extreme social issues than on bolstering the economy. Many of the abortion measures also face court challenges that could delay implementation for months or years.

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.) said in an interview that the DCCC was already targeting 16 House Republicans who had voted in June for the 20-week abortion ban written by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) or in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood in the last Congress.

“Republicans have shown they can’t help themselves from pursuing an ideological agenda, and they are further alienating independent and moderate voters,” Israel said. “They are pulling themselves down on this issue.”

GOP officials say they do not expect abortion to become a decisive factor in upcoming races. Republican candidates will focus instead on economic issues and on controversy surrounding President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, they said.

“Like most campaigns, the issues that are discussed most are the issues that voters deal with on a day-to-day basis,” said Brad Dayspring, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “At the current moment, that seems to be jobs, the economy, making sure health care is affordable and making sure our children have the opportunities we were blessed with.”

Abortion is already a major campaign issue in some contests, including the Virginia governor’s race between GOP Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II and former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe. But Cuccinelli campaign strategist Chris LaCivita said much of the focus is being driven by one side, which has attacked the attorney general for his opposition to abortion even in cases of rape and incest and his push to impose new requirements on abortion clinics.

“Ken Cuccinelli’s position on life is well known,” LaCivita said. “But the only people trying to make it a central issue are Terry McAuliffe and the Democrats.”

Some Republicans, however, say they are concerned that GOP lawmakers continue to mishandle the issue through clumsy statements that alienate women. During committee consideration of the House abortion bill last month, Franks touched off a firestorm when he said that “the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.”

The following week, Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Tex.) argued that sonograms suggest a young fetus can experience sexual pleasure. “If they’re a male baby, they may have a hand between their legs,” Burgess said. “If they feel pleasure, why can’t they feel pain?”

One Republican Party official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the Franks bill “should have been a political win for us, and it was a messaging disaster. . . . Salacious, inappropriate comments coming out of male House Republicans’ mouths — it just damages the brand.”

Abortion opponents, who play a crucial role in the Republican base, have been pushing particularly hard for legislative action amid revelations about unsafe practices at some abortion clinics. Gosnell was convicted in May of first-degree murder in the deaths of three infants and of involuntary manslaughter in the death of an adult patient. Live Action, an anti-abortion group, has spurred state investigations of clinics by producing dozens of videos with undercover footage.

“House Republicans felt very strongly after the horrors committed by Kermit Gosnell we needed to protect life and protect women and children from these unsafe and inhumane practices,” said Rory Cooper, spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). But he added, “Right now, we’re focused on energy and jobs.”

Public opinion has remained mostly supportive of the right to legal abortion since the 1990s, but many Americans are willing to impose tighter restrictions on the procedure. Under the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, abortions can be performed until the point when an individual doctor determines a fetus’s viability, which is generally defined as up to 24 weeks of gestation. After that point, the government can prohibit the procedure if it provides safeguards for the mother’s health and well-being.

Fifty-five percent of respondents said abortion should be legal in all or most cases in an August 2012 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll, with 42 percent saying it should be illegal in all or most cases. A Gallup poll in December 2012 found that while 61 percent of respondents supported keeping abortions in the first trimester legal, 64 percent thought second-trimester abortions should be illegal and 80 percent backed banning third-trimester abortions.

The pace of state abortion restrictions in recent years has accelerated, with more than 170 enacted since 2011, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, whose group plans to spend $1.5 million helping Cuccinelli, said Republicans can win at the ballot box if they “bring the public to a point of consensus” around issues such as a 20-week ban and tougher operating standards for clinics.

Democrats are doing their best to put all anti-abortion Republicans in the same camp as Todd Akin, whose Senate candidacy for a seat in Missouri collapsed last year after he suggested women don’t get pregnant in instances of “legitimate rape.”

Democrats pounced this week after Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) signed several new abortion restrictions into law while surrounded by a group of male legislators. Both the Democratic Governors Association and American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC, began highlighting the scene in political attacks.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols called the criticism unfounded. “The governor is pro-life and we believe these are reasonable policies to help protect human life,” he wrote in an e-mail.

But Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Kasich’s move “will be an issue for him” in his reelection campaign next year. “These are going to be nationalized races in a way we haven’t seen with these state races, because people understand the things that are at stake,” she said.

The better the access to health care for her constituents, the poorer the odds for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's Republican Party.

Medicaid rolls in South Carolina will grow by about 162,000 people by the middle of 2015. Had the state expanded Medicaid, another 340,000 people would get coverage. As it is, at least many more children will be covered, and their parents will probably find out in the process that if their governor hadn't been such an asshole, they would have coverage, too.

From Joan's earlier piece on South Carolina's expanding Medicaid rolls Even in South Carolina, a state hostile to Obamacare expansion, hundreds of thousands of people are benefiting just from greater awareness of existing government programs for which theyqualify. And while most of those beneficiaries are children, those children have families who would appreciate access to similar services, if only Republicans would get out of the way.

But South Carolina is solidly Red, right? Romney won the state by 11 points, right? So it doesn't matter! Except that in raw totals, Romney won by around 204,000 votes. And Republicans assume (perhaps rightly) that every Obamacare beneficiary will become much more favorable toward the government. And if you start thinking government can help you, Republicans don't stand a chance.

So for the them, it's bad enough that nearly 200,000 South Carolina residents (mostly children) will soon be part of their so-called ""culture of dependency"". That alone has potentially negative electoral ramifications. But had South Carolina taken federal dollars to give another 340,000 of its residents access to low-cost health services, their entire GOP's existence would be imperiled.

That's why Republicans continue to fight tooth and nail against Obamacare, from seeking its repeal to sabotaging its rollout. It's an existential crisis. The more people benefit, the harder it will be for them to argue that government is irreparably broken and must be drowned in Grover Norquist's bathtub.

Acting at the request of an order of nuns in Colorado, Justice Sotomayor issued the stay just hours before the requirement was to go into effect on New Year’s Day. She gave the Obama administration until Friday to respond to the Supreme Court.

Justice Sotomayor’s order applies to the nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor, and other Roman Catholic nonprofit groups that use the same health plan, known as the Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust. The groups’ lawsuit is one of many challenging the federal requirement for contraceptive coverage, but a decision on the merits of that case by the full Supreme Court could have broader implications.

“We are delighted with the ruling,” said Mark L. Rienzi, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who represented the nuns in the lawsuit. “We are delighted that the Supreme Court will require the government to file briefs in the court on this matter.” The Little Sisters of the Poor operate nursing homes for low-income people in the United States and around the world."

After a series of technical fixes and capacity upgrades, many of which were made over the past week, HealthCare.gov is now working more than 90 percent of the time — a big improvement over October, when the site was operating only about 43 percent of the time and frequently crashed, said Jeffrey Zients, the administration official overseeing the improvements.

“Bottom line, HealthCare.gov on December 1st is night and day from where it was on October 1st,” when the site was launched, Zients said in a teleconference with reporters Sunday morning.

Even with the improved performance, some people are likely to encounter problems on the site. And there is another worry — reports sent to insurance companies about who has enrolled in health plans include errors that could cause problems when people try to use their new insurance plans next year.

Administration officials, in talking to reporters, were careful not to declare a full-fledged victory. In a report issued Sunday, officials with the Department of Health and Human Services said the next few months would require further work to “improve and enhance the website and continue to improve the consumer experience.” Officials have also said repeatedly that consumers might still encounter difficulties and urged them to use the call center and seek help from specially trained personnel.

View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points.

Still, the announcement is a milestone for the administration, which has struggled to improve the Web site since its botched Oct. 1 launch.

New challenges lie ahead. Most Americans are required to have health insurance starting Jan. 1, and the administration is racing to meet its now-tougher goal of enrolling 7 million uninsured people in health coverage by the end of March.

When the Web site launched, the uninsured, as well as people who were looking for better or cheaper coverage, were supposed to be able to go online to browse plans and rates, apply for subsidies and enroll in health plans. But many have encountered numerous technical difficulties on HealthCare.gov, the main portal for 36 states, as well as on a number of state-run Web sites.

Fixing the federal Web site was a crucial first step for the administration to restore trust in the health program, which has suffered in the polls this fall. It was also critical from a practical standpoint; people buying insurance on the marketplaces have until Dec. 23 to sign up for health plans that take effect on Jan. 1.

It may be hard to assess how well the site has met expectations until it handles a higher volume of visitors as Dec. 23 approaches.

The announcement offered some relief to Democratic lawmakers, who have struggled to defend the administration’s handling of the law.

“This is the equivalent of having a great item that you want to buy in the store but not being able to get through the front door,” Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It sounds like the front door has been opened successfully now.”

Republicans said additional flaws in the site would soon emerge.

“When this Web site gets fixed, the problems really start for this administration,” former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Zients, on his call with reporters, said the number of people on the site was higher Saturday than it had been for all but the first days after the exchange launched.

Among those who tried to log on was Sandy Kush, 49, an unemployed medical transcriptionist from Illinois who tried six times in October to use HealthCare.gov, with no success.

She tried again Sunday and, with the help of a call-center representative, was able to enroll in Medicaid — a stopgap measure, she said, until she can find a new job that offers insurance. The whole experience took about an hour and a half but “was pretty smooth,” she said.

Others reported problems getting all the way through the process. Liz Gallops, 33, a North Carolina insurance broker who has tried unsuccessfully to get coverage through the site, said that HealthCare.gov seemed to be working better Sunday but that at one point she got a message stating that the system “cannot finish your application now.”

In the HHS report, ad­ministration officials offered a harsh assessment of the HealthCare.gov project and blamed the problems on hundreds of software bugs and inadequate hardware and infrastructure, as well as poor leadership.

“The system monitoring and response mechanisms were not sufficient for identifying issues or bugs or responding to them in real time,” it said. “Inadequate management oversight and coordination among technical teams prevented real-time decision making and efficient responses to address the issues with the site.”

But the officials said they had reorganized over the past five weeks and had put one firm in charge of the fixes, held “war room” meetings on critical issues and changed the decision-

making culture so their team is “operating with private-sector velocity and effectiveness.”

Zients said workers made more than 400 bug fixes and upgraded the software used for the enrollment process. The results are additional capacity, a faster response time and much-improved stability on the Web site, he said. About 50 fixes were made Saturday night, Zients said.

“We have a much more stable system that’s reliably open for business,” he said. “HealthCare.gov can now support intended volumes.”

The HHS report concluded that most of the department’s benchmarks for this weekend had been met. The average system response time when a person calls up a page on the Web site is under one second and the rate at which people are encountering error messages is “consistently well below 1 percent,” the report said,

The online system is stable — not crashing — more than 90 percent of the time, officials said. And the report said that the site can handle as many as 50,000 shoppers at the same time and up to 800,000 visits a day.

The report said the administration has yet to meet at least one of its key goals: reducing the site’s average response time to half a second. And government officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, cautioned last week that they will not know if they have expanded the site’s carrying capacity to 50,000 users at once until they have that many users online.

Administration officials said they have set up a system to help consumers if they cannot immediately get access to the site during peak demand. If consumers visit the site when it is at capacity, they may leave an e-mail address to receive a notification from the site with a link that allows them to “go to the front of the queue when they come back to the site,” Zients said.

During the daytime Sunday, the site did not attract anywhere near the maximum number of users that HHS officials say HealthCare.gov should now be able to handle. The peak usage per hour came about noon, when 16,259 people were on the site at once, according to a government official with knowledge of the project.

Meanwhile, throughout the day Sunday, the site was meeting the administration’s target of an error rate of less than 1 percent, the official said, but the speed at which pages were loaded was roughly one per second, double the goal of a half-second.

The report did not address the “back-end” parts of the systems that consumers do not see, including the error-filled enrollment reports. Insurers have warned that if the problem is not fixed soon, some people may show up for doctor’s appointments in January only to find that the insurance company has no record of their enrollment.

“Insurers are still receiving enrollment files that are duplicative or include missing or inaccurate information,” Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry’s main lobbying group, said Sunday. “In some cases they aren’t receiving those enrollment files at all.”

In recent months, consumers having difficulty with the Web site have been turning to agents and brokers for help. But the system does not allow brokers to enter their identity numbers once a person has gotten a subsidy determination, or if the number has been added incorrectly in the past.

Without those identity numbers, brokers cannot get paid by insurers or follow up on behalf of clients if there are problems with insurance claims. Regulators cannot track down brokers if there are mistakes. As of Sunday, brokers had not been informed of any fix to this issue.

Repairing those problems is critical because “we could get a lot of people enrolled very quickly,” said Janet Trautwein, chief executive of the National Association of Health Underwriters, which represents about 200,000 agents and brokers who together serve about 2 million to 3 million clients.

In addition, when consumers turn for help to a broker, an insurer or a call center, the online system still is balking at the critical step of calculating how much each person can qualify for in federal subsidies. Without that information, these assisters cannot complete the process of enrolling most consumers for health plans.

Assuming the government shutdown doesn't get in their way, the justices also will deal with a case that goes to the heart of the partisan impasse in Washington: whether and when the president may use recess appointments to fill key positions without Senate confirmation.

The court was unaffected for the first few days of the government shutdown and there was no expectation that arguments set for October would have to be rescheduled.

The new term that starts Monday may be short on the sort of high-profile battles over health care and gay marriage that marked the past two years. But several cases ask the court to overrule prior decisions — bold action in an institution that relies on the power of precedent.

""There are an unusual number of cases going right to hot-button cultural issues and aggressive briefing on the conservative side asking precedents to be overruled,"" said Georgetown University law professor Pamela Harris, who served in President Barack Obama's Justice Department.

Paul Clement, a frequent advocate before the court and the top Supreme Court lawyer under President George W. Bush, agreed that the opportunity exists for dramatic precedent-busting decisions. But Clement said each case also offers the court ""an off-ramp,"" a narrower outcome that may be more in keeping with Chief Justice John Roberts' stated desire for incremental decision-making that bridges the court's ideological divide.

There is a familiar ring to several cases the justices will take up.

Campaign finance, affirmative action, legislative prayer and abortion clinic protests all are on the court's calendar. The justices also will hear for the second time the case of Carol Anne Bond, a woman who was convicted under an anti-terrorism law for spreading deadly chemicals around the home of her husband's mistress.

The justices probably will decide in the fall whether to resolve competing lower court decisions about the new health care law's requirement that employer-sponsored health plans include coverage of contraceptives.

An issue with a good chance to be heard involves the authority of police to search the contents of a cellphone found on someone they arrest. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said over the summer that the right to privacy in the digital age ""is bound to come up in many forms"" in the coming years.

The court may hear its first abortion case since 2007, a review of an Oklahoma law that would restrict the use of certain abortion-inducing drugs such as RU-486.

The campaign finance argument on Tuesday is the first major case on the calendar. The 5-4 decision in the Citizens United case in 2010 allowed corporations and labor unions to spend unlimited sums in support of or opposition to candidates, as long as the spending is independent of the candidates.

The new case, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, is a challenge to the overall limits on what an individual may give to candidates, political parties and political action committees in a two-year federal election cycle, currently $48,600 to candidates and $123,600 in total. The $2,600 limit on contributions to a candidate is not at issue.

Since the Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976, the court has looked more favorably on contribution limits than on spending restrictions because of the potential for corruption in large contributions. The big issue in the current case is whether the justices will be just as skeptical of limits on contributing as on spending.

Three justices, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have signaled their willingness to do so. It remains to be seen whether Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, the other two members of the Citizens United majority, are willing to go along.

Among other top cases already set for review:

— Greece, N.Y., a suburb of Rochester, is asking the court to uphold its practice of opening town council meetings with a prayer, despite an appeals court ruling that found the invocations a violation of the First Amendment because they almost always were Christian prayers. The court could use the case to rule that courts should take a more hands-off approach to religion in the public square or it could hold more narrowly that the town's practice is consistent with a 1983 decision upholding prayer at the start of government meetings.

— Mount Holly, N.J., is defending a plan to demolish and redevelop a rundown neighborhood against claims that it discriminates because it disproportionately affects African-American and Latino residents. At issue is whether there also must be an intent to discriminate under federal housing law. The issue affects a range of transactions involving real estate and applies to banks and mortgage companies as well as governments, such as the one involved in this case.

— Michigan is fighting to preserve a constitutional amendment that bans the use of racial preferences in education after a federal appeals court ruled that the constitutional ban is itself discriminatory. This case, unlike last term's look at a University of Texas admissions plan, does not involve the viability of affirmative action, but rather whether opponents of racial preferences can enshrine that ban in the state constitution.

— Massachusetts is defending a law that creates a 35-foot buffer zone at abortion clinics to limit protesters' ability to interact with patients. The court upheld a buffer zone law in Colorado in 2000, but Roberts and Alito have replaced members of that majority and are considered more sympathetic to the free-speech claims of the protesters.

While several cases call into question high court precedents, the justices will be writing on a blank slate when they take up the president's recess appointment power under the Constitution.

In that case, the court will confront an appeals court ruling that effectively would end the president's ability to make such appointments, if it is left standing.

Former Justice Department official Peter Keisler said that justices often ask a lawyer for the best case in support of his argument. ""No one is going to ask that question because 't'aint none.' No Supreme Court decisions are material here,"" said Keisler, a partner at the Sidley, Austin law firm in Washington.

The impasse that led Obama to install members of the National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard Cordray in office without Senate confirmation has been resolved. So what remains of the issue is whether Obama and his successors will be constrained in the future.

The topic splits Democrats and Republicans, but their view of the matter is almost entirely dependent on which party controls the White House.

In another area, little drama is expected. Four justices are over the age of 75, but none is expected to retire in the coming year.

Ginsburg, at 80, is the oldest member of the court. Scalia and Kennedy are 77, and Justice Stephen Breyer is 75.

Ginsburg made clear in a series of media interviews this summer that she will stay on the court as long as she is able to do the work. Before the summer, Ginsburg had said she wanted to emulate Justice Louis Brandeis and stay on the bench as long as he did, 22 years. She will reach that mark in 2015, which also coincides with what is widely believed to be Obama's last opportunity to name her replacement because the presidential election year of 2016 is an unlikely time to fill a high court vacancy, especially in the eighth and final year of a presidency."

Mark Obenshain (R) won the Republican nomination for attorney general this weekend, Think Progress dug up a bill he introduced in 2009 that would have required a woman to report her miscarriage to the police within 24 hours of it happening or risk jail time.

A spokesperson for Obenshain told HuffPost on Monday that the senator introduced the bill in response to a news story about a 20-year-old college student who allegedly disposed of her dead newborn in the trash in Rockingham County, Virginia. Jared Walczak, Obenshain's deputy campaign manager for policy, said Obenshain was trying to pass a law to enable law enforcement to prosecute a woman in that circumstance, but he ended up with a bill that threatened all pregnant women with prosecution in the event that they miscarry.

""As sometimes happens, the legislation that emerged was far too broad, and would have had ramifications that neither he nor the Commonwealth's attorney's office ever intended,"" Walczak said. ""Sen. Obenshain is strongly against imposing any added burden for women who suffer a miscarriage, and that was never the intent of the legislation.""

Walczak said Obenshain met with representatives of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia in an attempt to resolve the problem, but he was unable to come up with a solution, so he withdrew the bill.

NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia confirmed that Obenshain reached out to them about the bill in 2009, and they told him they did not support it.

Tarina Keene, the group's executive director, told HuffPost, ""In 2009 we made it clear to Sen. Obenshain that NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia vehemently opposed his bill to criminalize tragic pregnancy complications and intimidate grieving Virginian women with the threat of law enforcement -- not to mention jail time. Although Sen. Obenshain did reach out to us amidst public backlash for a 'solution,' we clearly told him we would support nothing but immediate defeat of the legislation. While I'm relieved that he eventually decided to pull his bill, it is deeply troubling that an elected official would even consider such a callous and insulting effort.""

Obenshain joins a wave of far-right social conservatives running for office in Virginia, including gubernatorial candidate and current attorney general Ken Cuccinelli and his running mate, Bishop E.W. Jackson. As a state senator, Cuccinelli co-sponsored personhood legislation that would have granted legal rights to embryos, and Jackson made a YouTube video last year in which he compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan."

The sex education amendment to the budget bill, introduced by Rep. Lynn Wachtmann (R), encourages schools to teach abstinence-only education and bans sexual education that condones ""any gateway sexual activity or health message that encourages students to experiment with sexual activity."" The amendment also prohibits teachers from distributing contraceptive materials and bans public schools from using the services of any individual or organization who “endorses student nonabstinence from sexual activity as an appropriate or acceptable behavior, or if that individual or organization promotes, endorses, advocates, or condones gateway sexual activity.”

Instructors who violate the law could be sued in court for up to $5,000.

State Democratic Chairman Chris Redfern told the Toledo Blade that Republicans are “bent on outlawing sexuality and reverting to the Dark Ages.""

""If this legislature focused on what really mattered, we could get a lot done. Instead, too many of my colleagues have this bizarre attraction to these extreme issues,"" he said.

Wachtmann did not immediately return HuffPost's calls for comment.

Another provision of the House budget bill would redirect about $1.4 million in state family planning funds from Planned Parenthood to other local health providers and crisis pregnancy centers, which are Christian-owned organizations whose mission is to convince women not to have abortions. Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio provides health and family planning services to about 100,000 women each year at 27 clinics across the state. If the bill passes, all of the Planned Parenthood clinics would be moved to the bottom of the priority list for state funding because three of them provide abortions.

All abortions provided at Planned Parenthood clinics are paid for privately by the patient, because the Hyde Amendment prohibits any federal dollars from being used to fund the procedure. But Republicans have long argued that Planned Parenthood indirectly uses public grants to pay for all of its services, including abortions.

State Rep. Ron Maag (R-Lebanon) said at a hearing on the bill last week that if Planned Parenthood wants to receive more federal funds, it should stop providing abortions at all of its clinics. “If the hang-up is abortion, and you only have three clinics that are doing it, and there are other places women could go, why do you persist in having those clinics when it is putting your good work in jeopardy?” he asked Stephanie Kight, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.

Kight said the thousands of Ohio women who use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider can attest to the fact that it is not a bottom-tier provider. “It’s interesting that they would introduce a bill that would require us to be something that we’re not, while we’re the most-trusted provider for women’s health care"" in the state, she said."

He Writes About Law', 'National Security', 'Politics']",Did Obama diss Catholic schools in Belfast?,"As a grateful product of 12 years of Catholic education, I would be bothered if President Obama heaped abuse on Roman Catholic schools. According to some critics, that is exactly what he did in some recent remarks to teenagers in Northern Ireland. One blogger linked the president’s comments about separate Protestant and Catholic schools there to his admistration’s requirement that Catholic colleges and hospitals offer contraceptive services as part of their employee health insurance programs.

Here’s what Obama said in remarks to a Belfast town hall meeting with Protestant and Catholic youngsters:

“Because issues like segregated schools and housing, lack of jobs and opportunity -- symbols of history that are a source of pride for some and pain for others -- these are not tangential to peace; they’re essential to it. If towns remain divided -- if Catholics have their schools and buildings, and Protestants have theirs -- if we can’t see ourselves in one another, if fear or resentment are allowed to harden, that encourages division. It discourages cooperation.”

On the TownHall.com website, Carol Platt Liebau complained that Obama “chose to analogize education by Catholics and Protestants to segregation” in his remarks at a Belfast meeting with youngsters.

Liebau continued: “Of course, it’s ironic that the most divisive president in American history should go to Ireland and condemn division. But it also raises questions: Does this signal hostility to Catholic education in America -- or hostility to religious education in general? It’s clear -- from his Obamacare abortifacient/contraceptive mandate to his efforts to cut charitable deductions -- that the president sees government as the only really legitimate actor in civil society. But his willingness to characterize education by religious orders as enabling division and discord is an unpleasant reminder of his hostility to any social force with potential to check the power of Big Government.”

Put aside the wing-nut notion that Obama is the “most divisive president in American history.” Was he disparaging Catholic schools in general or equating them with racially segregated schools (Liebau’s clear implication)?

I don’t think so.

Context matters here. Northern Ireland is not the United States. Even in my childhood, when Catholic kids were encouraged to attend Catholic schools and there was an arguably Protestant ethos in many public schools, Catholics and Protestants weren’t as isolated from (or as distrustful of) one another in this country as they continue to be in Northern Ireland.

Today, thanks to Vatican II and the relentless asssimilation of Catholics, it’s common for Catholics to attend public schools (where teachers no longer recite from the Protestant King James Bible). But it is also common for Protestants, Jews and others to attend Catholic schools. And a lot of children, Catholic and non-Catholic, will attend both public and Catholic schools over the course of their education.

Society in Northern Ireland is much more stratified, and the role of religiously defined schools more problematic. You can be perfectly comfortable with the role of Catholic schools in the American context and worry about their contribution to estrangement between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland.

As for the notion that Obama is hostile to private schools with a religious character, that seems unlikely. His own children attend the Sidwell Friends School, a Quaker institution. Of course, Obama’s detractors will say that simply proves he’s a hypocrite.

Russia’s family values experiment"
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/bloomberg-latest-anti-smoking-push-require-stores-hide-174231138--politics.html,,[],Bloomberg’s latest anti-smoking push would require stores to hide cigarettes,"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is pushing for a new citywide law requiring stores to physically conceal cigarettes and other tobacco products behind counters, curtains or cabinets—anywhere out of public view—as part of a new anti-smoking initiative.

The legislation would also increase penalties on the smuggling and illegal sales of cigarettes as part of an effort that Bloomberg said would help curb the youth smoking rate and promote a healthier New York City.

“New York City has dramatically lowered our smoking rate, but even one new smoker is one too many—especially when it’s a young person,” Bloomberg said at a press conference on Monday. “Young people are targets of marketing and the availability of cigarettes, and this legislation will help prevent another generation from the ill health and shorter life expectancy that comes with smoking.”

The push comes just days after a judge overturned regulation backed by Bloomberg that would have limited the sales of large sugary drinks in New York City. Among other things, the judge in that case criticized Bloomberg for enacting the so-called “soda ban” by going through the city’s Health Department instead of the New York City Council.

While the city is appealing that decision, Bloomberg signaled a different policy tactic with his latest anti-smoking measure, announcing that he will present the legislation before the City Council later this week. If approved, New York City would be the first city in the nation to ""conceal"" tobacco products, Bloomberg said.

The move is just the latest anti-smoking effort pursued by Bloomberg, an ex-smoker. In 2002, he signed into law legislation that banned smoking in New York City bars and restaurants. In 2011, Bloomberg expanded that regulation to include public parks.

Bloomberg’s latest bill is likely to face heavy opposition from the tobacco industry as well as bodegas and other stores that depend heavily on the sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products.

Story continues

City officials said any store where tobacco products make up more than 50 percent of its inventory would be exempt from the new rules.

The mayor has faced heavy criticism for his efforts to pass sweeping health regulations. At his news conference on Monday, Bloomberg bristled when he was asked about a recent illustration in the New York Daily News that depicted him as a “nanny” mayor—at first calling it a “stupid cartoon.” But Bloomberg, who was clearly irritated by the question, quickly reversed course and called the cartoon a “great badge of honor” because of “how many people are still alive” because of the health regulations he’s pursued as mayor.

“It’s the most wonderful cartoon I have ever seen,” Bloomberg insisted."

In eight years’ time, my premiums had more than doubled, and so had my deductible. But the big shock was yet to come. When my renewal letter arrived, I was politely informed to begin remitting $756 instead of $463 – a staggering 63% increase. My health insurance was going to cost more than my house payment! That was my line in the sand. I had told myself that I would drop my insurance if it ever got that expensive.

Before letting go, I did two things. I went to my doctor for a thorough checkup, including a blood test. And I applied for a very-high-deductible plan that would keep my monthly payment in the $400 range. Given that I was still insured, the insurance folks got a copy of the blood test, which they proceeded to search line by line until they found something wrong with me. Out of two pages of data, there was a single thyroid reading was outside of “normal” range (side note: there’s nothing wrong with my thyroid; it was simply their excuse to make me pay that outrageous premium). They’d found their so-called preexisting condition, and denied me access to the new plan with the lower premium. With the help of my doctor, who wrote a letter on my behalf, I appealed.

I still remember where I was when I got the phone call. I had just driven across the country to do forestry work in the Pacific Northwest for three months. It was an utterly miserable July day on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. Rain was coming down, and all the trees and underbrush were soaking wet. Water was making its way through and around my rain gear. I’m about ten miles from the nearest cell tower, and barely had a signal. My appeal had been denied, said the distant voice. My choice was to pay the $756 premium or do without insurance. I said, “Terminate the policy.”

I stood there in the rain, wondering whether I was a genius or an idiot. Only time would tell.

Fast forward to December 15, 2013. I’m at the healthcare.gov website, making my third attempt to log in. My first effort in early October, and my second try later that month, never got as far as obtaining a username. The same bizarre error message stopped me in my tracks both times. I had to settle for printing an application and mailing it to a center in Kentucky. Six weeks passed, and I heard nothing.

Now, with the deadline approaching, I was ready to try again. First, I browsed the plans. Only two insurance companies were offering plans on the exchange in this part of Georgia, but there are 18 total plans available. I selected a bronze plan offering coverage across state lines, since I travel so much.

With the plan chosen, I began the process of creating an account at healthcare.gov. As I progressed through the various steps, the system even located my paper application. Along the way, I was required to make several decisions. I was asked how much money I expect to earn in 2014. As an independent consultant, I can only guess. The earnings estimate is used to calculate your subsidy, but you are allowed to decrease the size of the subsidy you accept, in case your earnings turn out higher than expected. In my case, the subsidy was going to pay about two-thirds of my $570 monthly premium. I chose to err on the side of caution, selecting a $200 subsidy for a net cost of $370 per month. Once I made those decisions, I was set. In less than an hour, I had been approved for health insurance.

Okay, that was easier than I expected it to be. The next day brought a new mission. My Congressman, Austin Scott (R-GA08), had scheduled a noontime town hall meeting a few miles from my house. In his newsletters, he boasts about having voted to repeal Obamacare more than 40 times.

I had spoken with him once before, a few months after making that momentous decision to stop paying for overpriced health insurance. At that meeting, I reminded him of one of the GOP’s scary talking points prior to the passage of ACA: a government bureaucrat was going to come between you and your doctor. I said to Rep. Scott:



It wasn’t a government bureaucrat that came between me and my doctor; it was an insurance-company bureaucrat.

This time around, I sat in the front row. There were perhaps 50 citizens in attendance, plus staff and local reporters. Scott gave some prepared remarks, and then took questions. The questions had to be submitted in writing on a very small card. A staffer screened them and called out the questions he felt were appropriate. There was no way I could condense what I had to say onto a card, and I really wanted to talk directly with Rep. Scott anyway. I took my chances on being able to talk with him when the meeting ended.

As I began walking towards Rep. Scott, a reporter stopped me. Would I mind saying a few words into the camera, he asked. I told him that I wanted to talk to the Congressman first. I managed to be second in line to speak. He recognized me from the previous time. I was courteous, and as succinct as I could manage. My message was that the website that he had just maligned in his speech was now functioning. I had obtained health insurance for half of the cost of the plan that I dropped two and a half years ago. Rep. Scott admitted that one of his relatives had recently obtained lower-cost coverage, too. But he still thought that Obamacare is a mess and needs to be replaced with something else; and he referred back to the point he’d made in his speech about the five million people whose plans were cancelled, or had become much more expensive.

I answered him thusly:



Okay, you say that there are 5 million who are hurt in some manner by the ACA. What about the 40 or 50 million uninsured citizens, many of whom live in your district, who stand to benefit from the ACA as it is currently written? I’m one of those 50 million. Let’s make the law better instead of repealing it.

I thanked him, and walked over to the reporter who was still patiently waiting.

How many of you would be willing to stand in front of a TV camera with no prepared remarks, being asked questions by a reporter, and having just one take? I, for one, was not eager to do this. But I’d come here on a mission, and suddenly that mission had expanded. I could reach more people than the citizens who had shown up for the town hall.

The resulting two minute broadcast gave me nearly equal billing with my Congressman! The local station must have been looking for “both sides,” and I was the other side. The two quotes from me that aired:

I was able to get an insurance plan and with the tax credit, it's going to be about half of the price that it was going to be two and a half years ago. They've definitely got the website up and running now, and so you can get online and see if there is something out there that works for you.

At first I was not going to link to the broadcast, because my real name is used. Here at Daily Kos, I can hide behind the pseudo-anonymous handle of foresterbob. Last night, after having written most of this diary, I came to the conclusion that my once-again-expanded mission calls for me to make the link available for the world to see. So here it is. Perhaps it will inspire you to take action in some small way. Or maybe even in a big way.

Austin Scott town hall

I have no illusions about changing the way Austin Scott votes. But here in deep-red central Georgia, a few television viewers were able to get a positive message about the Affordable Care Act.

http://news.yahoo.com/fed-judge-texas-abortion-limits-unconstitutional-190525066.html,,[],Fed judge: Texas abortion limits unconstitutional,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A federal judge determined Monday that new Texas abortion restrictions place an unconstitutional burden on women seeking to end a pregnancy, a ruling that keeps open dozens of abortion clinics across the state while officials appeal.

The ruling by District Judge Lee Yeakel came one day before key parts of the law the Legislature approved in July were set to take effect. Lawyers for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers argued in their lawsuit that a provision requiring abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital less than 30 miles away would have effectively shuttered about a third of the state's 38 clinics that perform abortions.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, whose office argued the law protects women and the life of the fetus, immediately filed an appeal with the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

""I have no doubt that this case is going all the way to the United States Supreme Court,"" Abbott said during stop in Brownsville, Texas, as part of his campaign to replace retiring Gov. Rick Perry.

Although several conservative states in recent months have approved broad abortion limits, the Texas ones were particularly divisive because of the number of clinics affected and the distance some women would have to travel to get an abortion.

Federal judges in Wisconsin, Kansas, Mississippi and Alabama also have found problems with state laws prohibiting doctors from conducting abortions if they don't have hospital admitting privileges.

All the other appeals — including the one from Mississippi, which like Texas is within the 5th Circuit — deal only with whether to lift a temporary injunction preventing the restriction from taking effect. The Texas appeal could be the first that directly addresses the question of whether the provision violates the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.

The admitting privileges provision ""does not bear a rational relationship to the legitimate right of the state in preserving and promoting fetal life or a woman's health and, in any event, places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion,"" Yeakel wrote.

Story continues

In another part of his ruling, Yeakel, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, partially blocked the provision requiring doctors to follow an 18-year-old U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol. He found that the state could regulate how a doctor prescribes an abortion-inducing pill, but the law failed to allow for a doctor to adjust treatment in order to best protect the health of the woman taking it.

Abortion-rights supporters complained that requiring doctors to follow the FDA's original label for an abortion-inducing drug would deny women the benefit of recent advances in medical science.

Other portions of the law, known as House Bill 2, include a ban on abortions after 20 weeks and a requirement beginning in October 2014 that all abortions take place in a surgical facility. Neither of those sections was part of this lawsuit.

Amy Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Woman's Health, said the judge did not go far enough.

""Nearly 40 percent of the women we serve at Whole Woman's Health choose medication abortion and now Texas is preventing these women from the advances in medical practice that other women across the United States will be able to access,"" she said.

The law requiring admitting privileges was the biggest obstacle facing abortion clinics in Texas, and the ruling gives them a temporary reprieve until new regulations go into effect next year.

Mississippi passed a similar law last year, which a federal judge also blocked pending a trial scheduled to begin in March. Mississippi's attorney general asked the 5th Circuit to lift the temporary injunction so the law could be enforced, but the judges have left it in place signaling they believe there is a legitimate constitutional question.

Unlike the Mississippi case, Yeakel's order is a final decision, setting the groundwork for the 5th Circuit to review the merits of the law, not just an injunction against it.

The proposed restrictions were among the toughest in the nation and gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June. She is now the only Democrat in the race for Texas governor.

Davis said the ruling didn't surprise her.

""As a mother, I would rather see our tax dollars spent on improving our kid's schools than defending this law,"" she said in a statement.

During the trial, officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified that they've tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals, but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision. Many hospitals with religious affiliations will not allow abortion doctors to work there, while others fear protests if they provide privileges. Many have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility, or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.

Beth Shapiro, chairwoman of board of directors of Lubbock's Planned Parenthood Women's Health Center, said no hospital in Lubbock has granted privileges to the lone doctor from East Texas who flies in to do abortions when there are procedures scheduled. There is not incentive for hospitals to do so, she said.

""I don't see why local hospitals would give privileges to someone who's not going to admit patients,"" Shapiro said. ""I don't see what the business and financial incentive would be.""

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court vote upholds Texas abortion law,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court cleared the way Tuesday for Texas to enforce a strict new abortion regulation that opponents say prevents a third of the state’s clinics from performing the procedure.

The court, in a 5-4 vote, split along ideological lines in turning down an appeal to block the law that abortion rights advocates challenged as unconstitutional.

The measure, adopted by Texas lawmakers in July, requires that abortion providers have a doctor on their staffs who has admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic.

By rejecting the request, the justices signaled they do not think the Texas law puts an unconstitutional barrier before women seeking an abortion. The Planned Parenthood Federation said the law had forced 12 of the state’s 36 licensed abortion providers to stop offering abortions.

Justice Stephen G. Breyer said in a dissent that the action “seriously disrupts” the status quo.

“By putting Texas’ new law into immediate effect, it instantly leaves 24 counties in the Rio Grande Valley with no abortion provider,” he said, adding that “it may substantially reduce access to safe abortions elsewhere in Texas.” Breyer cited a brief from Planned Parenthood that estimated that 20,000 women in Texas would be left without service.

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Breyer’s dissent. They said the law should have been put on hold “while the lower courts consider this difficult, sensitive and controversial legal matter.”

Justice Antonin Scalia, in defending the high court’s action, said Breyer and the abortion rights advocates had no basis for “asserting that the [Texas] law is even probably unconstitutional.” He said Planned Parenthood had not “carried the heavy burden” of showing the law was unconstitutional, adding that there was “no special ‘status quo’ standard for laws affecting abortion.” Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. signed on to Scalia’s statement.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not make any comment but voted to reject the appeal.

“This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions,” Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement issued after the court’s decision. “As always, Texas will continue doing everything we can to protect the culture of life in our state.”

Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation, said: “While we are deeply disappointed, this isn’t over. We will take every step we can to protect the health of Texas women.” She said the law “demonstrates why we need stronger federal protections for women’s health. Your rights and your ability to make your own medical decisions should not depend on your ZIP Code.”

The Texas law is one of several recent state measures adopted by Republican-controlled legislatures that seek to regulate or restrict abortion without banning it. The laws are drafted in a manner that they are expected to be upheld by the Supreme Court’s conservative-leaning majority that includes Kennedy. In the past, he has voted to uphold abortion regulations, but has refused to strike down Roe vs. Wade and the right to legal abortion.

Texas state lawyers called the “admitting privileges” rule a medical regulation designed to protect the health of women and ensure that clinics had well-qualified doctors on staff who would be there if a patient faced a medical emergency.

But abortion rights advocates said that many hospitals, fearing local criticism, were reluctant to grant admitting privileges to doctors who performed abortions. Moreover, they said hospitals admit patients needing emergency care without regard to whether the patient’s doctor has admitting privileges, making the law irrelevant.

A federal judge had initially blocked the admitting-privilege rule from taking effect and said there was no “rational basis” to believe it would improve healthcare for abortion patients.

Texas Atty. Gen. Greg Abbott quickly appealed and won a reversal from the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. In a 3-0 decision, its judges said the law was valid and reasonable, and could take effect.

The judges agreed with Texas state lawyers, who argued that pregnant women in the Rio Grande Valley could drive to abortion clinics about 100 miles away. “An increase in travel distance of less than 150 miles for some women is not an undue burden on abortion rights,” Judge Priscilla Owen wrote for the 5th Circuit.

The Planned Parenthood Federation filed its emergency appeal with the Supreme Court on Nov. 4. Its attorney said the law would “render the constitutional right to abortion illusory for nearly 1 in 3 Texas women who would exercise that right.”

We know now those were all lies told repeatedly and never questioned by a media that is still looking the other way. Another promise Obama made was that ObamaCare would not fund abortions. LifeNews reports that this was also a lie:

The ObamaCare statute specifically requires the issuers of Exchange plans that cover abortion to “collect from each enrollee in the plan” a “separate payment” for the type of abortions for which funding is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment (which is all abortions other than in cases of life of the mother, rape, or incest) and a separate payment for all other services. [42 U.S.C. 18023(b)]. These separate payments are then to be deposited into separate accounts.

During the regulatory process, commenters questioned HHS on how this was to be implemented, and according to HHS, the commenters “recommended that HHS clarify . . . whether [Exchange plan] issuers may satisfy the separate payment provision by providing each enrollee with an itemized bill, and whether an enrollee’s coverage would be terminated for failure to comply with the separate payment provision.” Rather than doing so, HHS merely said that the comments would be taken into consideration in any future guidance. [77 Fed. Reg. 18430 (March 27, 2012)].

Now, despite the clear language of the ObamaCare statute, it appears that the separate check requirement is not going to be enforced by the Obama Administration. Gretchen Borchelt, director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center, told the Huffington Post that “we used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements, but that’s not the way it’s being implemented.” (Huffington Post, Sept. 3, 2013).

Likewise, a spokeswoman for Rhode Island’s Exchange told PolitiFact Rhode Island that “the customer is not billed a separate fee.” (Politifact, Oct. 2, 2013. The Rhode Island Exchange will handle the billing, not the plan issuers). As PolitiFact notes, “it turns out to be a hidden fee.”

There is nothing the media is willing to make Obama pay a political price for. Not even repeatedly lying to millions who are about to lose their insurance or forcing people to violate their conscience over the abomination of abortion.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/31/politics/religion-contraceptive-insurance/index.html,2013-01-31 00:00:00,['Dan Merica'],Obama proposal would let religious groups opt-out of contraception mandate,"Story highlights Proposed rules would permit certain groups like hospitals, schools to decline to provide contraception coverage for religious reasons But women would still get coverage; outside provider would pay for contraception separately Proposal would be shift in policy, could ease friction between Obama and religious groups NEW: One group says proposal does nothing to change current policy

The Obama administration proposed updated guidelines on Friday that would allow religious-affiliated organizations opposing contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control.

The draft rule would give women at non-profit, religious-based organizations, like certain hospitals and universities, the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge.

The compromise is consistent with last year’s announcement by President Barack Obama on the contraception mandate, administration officials said.

It also continues his administration’s attempts to resolve the contentious issue of how non-profit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty.

“Today, the administration is taking the next step in providing women across the nation with coverage of recommended preventive care at no cost, while respecting religious concerns,” Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement.

“We will continue to work with faith-based organizations, women’s organizations, insurers and others to achieve these goals,” she said.

As part of the new initiative, groups that are insured – such as student health plans at religious colleges – would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage.

“The insurer would then notify enrollees that it is providing them with no-cost contraceptive coverage through separate individual health insurance policies,” the HHS statement said.

Although the agency has not estimated final costs of the plan, it said that offering free coverage would actually lower expenses over the long term, partly due to improvement in women’s health and fewer childbirths.

Case fuels debate over when life begins

Because the insurer would be covering the costs, the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it.

An original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal healthcare law spearheaded by Obama, the Affordable Care Act. It required that insurers provide, at no cost to those insured, all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Houses of worship were exempt immediately and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations, like universities and hospitals.

That still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths, many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong, covered by the mandate. They denounced it as an infringement of religious liberty. A group of 43 Catholic organizations challenged the rules in federal court in May.

The administration had long defended the mandate, saying that it did not violate religious liberties.

The new proposal also clarifies the definition of a religious employer.

Instead of using a multi-part test that requires an employer to show “religious values as its purpose” and to “employ persons who share its religious tenets,” the proposed requirement would follow the International Revenue Code’s definition that includes “churches, other houses of worship, and their affiliated organizations.”

Following an uproar among religious institutions that didn’t want to pay for contraceptives, the Obama administration in March offered several alternatives. The plan unveiled on Friday is a result of that effort.

The updated rules proposal will be open for public comment through April 8. The administration would then decide whether to make it final.

A source with knowledge of the matter but not authorized to speak on the record said administration officials planned to discuss the new plan with faith-based organizations on Friday. The source also said the administration called key leaders, including presidents of Catholic universities, before the announcement.

Women’s groups, including Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, heralded the announcement

“Today’s draft regulation affirms yet again the Obama administration’s commitment to fulfilling the full promise of its historic contraception policy,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL. “Thanks to this commitment, most American women will get birth control coverage without extra expense.”

“This policy makes it clear that your boss does not get to decide whether you can have birth control,” said Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, took a wait-and-see approach.

Lawyers for Catholic hospital argue that a fetus is not a person

Today, the administration issued proposed regulations regarding the HHS mandate” he said in a statement. “We welcome the opportunity to study the proposed regulations closely. We look forward to issuing a more detailed statement later.”

Not all groups characterized it as a compromise, however.

Frank Pavone, National Director of Priests for Life, a group that launched a federal lawsuit against the mandate last year, said he was far from happy with the update and welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback.

“We at Priests for Life remind the administration that religious liberty does not just belong to religious groups and individuals; it belongs to all Americans,” Pavone said. “We see only one acceptable change regarding the mandate: rescind it completely.”

The Family Research Council, a conservative pro-life group, released a similar statement.

“The proposal does not expand religious freedom to all organizations and does nothing to change the current policy that forces religious entities to pay for insurance plans that include abortion-inducing drugs, sterilizations and contraception,” said Anna Higgins, director of the group’s Center for Human Dignity.

The issue of Obama’s health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot-button political issue during last year’s presidential race.

Bob McDonnell (R) introduced an amendment to the state's health insurance exchange implementation bill that would prevent insurance plans in the new health exchange from covering abortion.

While similar bills introduced in other states would allow a woman to buy a policy rider for abortion coverage, McDonnell's proposed amendment late Monday night would ban that as well.

""No qualified health insurance plan that is sold or offered for sale through an exchange established or operating in the Commonwealth shall provide coverage for abortions, regardless of whether such coverage is provided through the plan or is offered as a separate optional rider thereto,"" the amendment reads, adding that women who have become pregnant from rape or incest or whose lives are in danger would be exempt from the ban.

Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia estimates that the ban on abortion coverage in Virginia will affect about 50,000 women in Virginia -- the estimated number who will be using state-based health benefits exchange.

NARAL, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights advocacy groups condemned the amendment because it could prevent many low-income women from being able to access abortion care.

“With this amendment, Governor McDonnell has launched yet another effort to intrude in women’s health care decisions and block Virginians access to comprehensive reproductive health care,"" said Caroline O’Shea, deputy director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, in a statement. ""Coverage for safe, legal abortion care -- a procedure one in three women will access in their lifetimes - is a basic benefit that most insurance plans currently include. By banning women from using their own funds to purchase plans that include this common benefit, Gov. McDonnell is restricting Virginians’ personal economic decisions as well as their access to comprehensive care.""

McDonnell's office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.

Anti-abortion advocacy groups and state lawmakers have been lobbying McDonnell for weeks to propose the abortion coverage amendment. Virginia delegate Bob Marshall (R), who has introduced several anti-abortion bills in the House of Delegates this year that have not gone to a vote, sent out an aggressive email blast to his supporters last week.

""The Governor and Republican House and Senate leaders completely ignored any new legislative efforts to protect preborn children in the 2013 session because they wanted to avoid controversy in an election year,"" he wrote. ""If Gov. McDonnell does not hear from many principled pro-lifers like yourself, he may continue to do nothing to protect our conscience from the HHS Mandate or to prohibit abortion coverage in health exchanges."""

Cruz ends anti-Obamacare talkathon after 21 hours

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ended his marathon talking attack on President Obama’s health-care law Wednesday after 21 hours and 19 minutes — a feat of stamina that seems likely to complicate House GOP efforts to pass a funding bill aimed at averting a looming government shutdown.

The freshman senator ceded the floor — and got his first opportunity for a bathroom break — at noon, after running up against a deadline imposed by Senate procedural rules. A little over an hour later the Senate voted to choke off the first filibuster hurdle on its own version of the funding bill, which is the first step toward allowing Democrats to include funding for the health-care law that had previously been stripped out by the House.

Both houses of Congress must reach agreement on funding legislation by Monday night to avoid most federal agencies closing on Tuesday.

( Read a transcript of Cruz’s remarks on Tuesday. )

Meanwhile, a similarly contentious debate is simmering over raising the federal debt ceiling, with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warning Wednesday that the nation will exhaust its emergency borrowing capacity no later than Oct. 17.

Despite urging from some of his colleagues not to stage the talkathon, Cruz took the floor Tuesday afternoon promising to speak against the health-care law “until I am no longer able to stand.”

To most Americans, it looked like a traditional filibuster, fixed in the popular imagination by Jimmy Stewart’s performance in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” But parliamentary procedures already in place meant that Cruz eventually would have to yield the floor.

Cruz’s controversial strategy shrank the window available for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his colleagues to respond with a different version of the legislation.

(INTERACTIVE: Longest filibusters of all time )

By 5 a.m., the length of Cruz’s marathon discourse had surpassed lengthy filibusters by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in March and the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) in 1964. He earned a lead spot on all three network morning news shows, acknowledging that he was “a little bit” tired but still looking remarkably fresh. The television anchors dubbed Cruz’s effort a “talkathon,” even as they explained to viewers that his effort would not derail the legislative process.

The senator, still wearing the dark suit and light blue tie he had donned the previous day, kept his composure throughout his marathon presentation.

The Cruz talkathon was the latest example of the increasingly stark division among Republicans, both on Capitol Hill and nationally. The Texas newcomer, just 42 and nine months into his first term in office, is carrying the banner for conservatives who urge a take-no-prisoners approach in confronting the president, even if it means shuttering the government.

But the move angered senior Republicans, who complained that Cruz and the other junior senators pushing this strategy did not understand the wounds the GOP suffered during the mid-1990s shutdown battles with President Bill Clinton. Back then, the party controlled both the House and Senate, a luxury compared with its tenuous majority in the House today.

“I just don’t believe anybody benefits from shutting the government down, and certainly Republicans don’t. We learned that in 1995,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), the dean of the GOP caucus. “We’re in the minority. We have to find a way of standing up for our principles without immolating ourselves in front of everybody, in a way when we don’t have the votes to do it.”

Some suggested that the clashing approaches were the latest evidence of a party adrift, both on policy and strategic thinking. “We haven’t had much of a strategy on anything to this point. Everybody’s shooting from the hip,” said Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).

Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) originally preferred a different approach that would have required Democrats to vote for the health-care funds, while GOP senators could have symbolically opposed.

Cruz played a leading role, along with outside conservative groups, in pushing House Republicans to take a harder line. House Republicans on Friday passed a bill without funding for Obamacare, exactly as Cruz wanted.

McConnell had hoped that he could get Cruz and his band of allies to relent so that the Senate could pass something by Friday. He even convened an extra meeting, in addition to the weekly Tuesday policy luncheon, at which several senators said Cruz was urged to drop some of his delaying tactics so that Boehner could get the legislation before late Sunday or early Monday.

But Cruz would not budge.

“We don’t need fake fights. We don’t need fake votes. We need real change. We need a better economy. We need more jobs,” Cruz said early Tuesday afternoon, rejecting the original Boehner-McConnell plan.

All through the night and well into the morning, Cruz’s oratory touched on a broad mix of subjects and sources, including lyrics from a song by country music star Toby Keith; quotations from the popular reality television show “Duck Dynasty;” recollections of how his father, Rafael Cruz, used to make green eggs and ham for breakfast; and a recent acceptance speech by actor Ashton Kutcher at an awards show.

At one point Tuesday night, Cruz opted to read bedtime stories to his two young daughters, who he said were home in Texas watching television with his wife. Cruz first read King Solomon’s Wise Words from the Book of Proverbs and then the Dr. Seuss classic “Green Eggs and Ham,” which he said was one of his favorite children’s books.

Several times Cruz read supportive messages sent to his office via Twitter.

Cruz was permitted to yield to colleagues for long-form questions but could not leave the floor or sit while his effort was under way.

Several like-minded Senate conservatives took turns giving him respite Tuesday evening, including Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), two 2016 presidential aspirants. Rubio returned to the Senate floor Wednesday morning, along with Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.).

Cruz’s most frequent partner has been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who at times phrased “questions” that stretched for almost an hour and included detailed critiques of Supreme Court decisions and a series of recollections from his younger years, all designed to draw attention to his concerns about the health-care law.

The extended discourse by Cruz and Lee is the culmination of a strategy they began developing in the summer when Lee, first elected in 2010, started looking for allies to defund the health-care law by using annual spending bills for federal agencies as potential leverage.

Lee and Cruz launched a commercial campaign that targeted fellow Republicans with ads designed to pressure GOP senators to support the pair’s shutdown strategy. Senior colleagues have rejected the approach, and instead have grown more angry.

A series of junior Democratic senators presided over the Senate chamber through the night, as Cruz talked on and on and on. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) passed the time scanning her iPad. Reporters spotted Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) returning to the U.S. Capitol shortly before 11 p.m. with a Red Bull in hand.

“There’s no point to this other than advancing the career of one or two senators,” Murphy said as he wrapped up his two-hour shift around 1 a.m.

As dawn neared, Cruz began leaning more on the podium at his desk, which was surrounded by binders and stacks of paper. In case he ever lost his sense of place, a large yellow Post-it note reminded him in blue ink: “Yield only for the purpose of a question. Be careful!”
