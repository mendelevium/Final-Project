A single deputy fired at Andy Lopez, killing him on the sidewalk at the edge of an empty lot in Santa Rosa, Lt. Paul Henry of the Santa Rosa Police Department said during a news conference, according to the Press-Democrat.

“The deputy’s mind-set was that he was fearful that he was going to be shot,” Henry said.

Lopez, a Santa Rosa eighth-grader, was walking through a southwest Santa Rosa neighborhood carrying a pellet gun that resembled an AK-47 assault rifle when he was spotted about 3 p.m. Tuesday by two deputies on routine patrol, Henry said.

The teen had his back to the two deputies, said Henry, whose department is investigating the shooting.

They stopped, took cover behind the doors of their patrol car and ordered him to drop the weapon, Henry said.

Lopez was 20 to 30 feet away, he said, adding the deputies did not realize he was a boy.

The deputy, a law enforcement veteran, believed the AK-47-styled pellet gun “was an authentic weapon,” Henry said.

“He has quite a bit of experience with this kind of weapon. He’s aware of the kind of damage these kinds of weapons can do,” Henry said.

He also was aware such a weapon can fire ammunition that “can penetrate his body armor, can penetrate the metal of his vehicle, and also the sides of houses and buildings in the area,” Henry said, according to the newspaper.

Earlier Wednesday, Sonoma County Sheriff Steve Freitas said in a statement that the shooting was a “tragedy” and that he would do everything he could to ensure the investigation was thorough and transparent.

“As a father of two boys about this age, I can’t begin to imagine the grief this family is going through,” he said.

Deputies also found a plastic handgun in the boy’s waistband, said sheriff’s Lt. Dennis O’Leary. The deputies, who have not been identified, have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard after a shooting, he said.

Attorney general issues first public comment since verdict

Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in state court

Justice Department could bring civil rights charges

WASHINGTON — Attorney General Eric Holder called the death of Trayvon Martin ""unnecessary"" Monday and vowed to proceed with a civil rights inquiry after the acquittal of George Zimmerman on murder and manslaughter charges.

In his first public comments since Saturday's jury verdict in the racially charged case, Holder told a convention of the nation's largest black sorority that the federal government is ""determined to meet division and confusion with understanding and compassion – and also with truth.''

""The Justice Department shares your concern. I share your concern,"" Holder told the Delta Sigma Theta delegates to thunderous applause.

A jury in Sanford, Fla., found Zimmerman, 29, not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Trayvon, 17, in February 2012. Zimmerman, a Latino neighborhood watch volunteer, claimed self-defense. Trayvon was black.

The shooting drew nationwide attention, protests and claims of racial profiling — as did the verdict. NAACP leader Benjamin Jealous was among those who called Saturday night for the Justice Department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. Holder is scheduled to address the NAACP's national convention Tuesday in Orlando, Fla.

By Monday afternoon, more than 325,000 people have signed an online petition started by the NAACP on MoveOn.org calling on the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman. Sunday, Justice officials said they were reviewing the case.

""This tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,'' Holder told the sorority delegates. ""We must not – as we have too often in the past – let this opportunity pass.''

The attorney general urged calm in recognition of Martin's parents ""who have lost the most.''

""They suffered a pain that no parent should have to endure – and one that I, as a father, cannot begin to conceive,'' Holder said. ""Even as we embrace their example and hold them in our prayers, we must not forgo this opportunity to better understand one another and to make better this nation we cherish.''

Discussing the federal investigation, opened last year, Holder said authorities will ""continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law.''

""We are committed to standing with the people of Sanford, with the individuals and families affected by this incident, and with our state and local partners in order to alleviate tensions, address community concerns and promote healing. … And we will never stop working to ensure that – in every case, in every circumstance and in every community – justice must be done.''

Delegates said they looked forward to the federal inquiry's conclusions.

""A life was lost,'' said Roxanne Booth, 52, a New York pastor. ""To have an acquittal is to say that life didn't matter. It does matter.''

Lannie Fountain, 79, a delegate from Georgia, said the trial lacked an important voice.

""I felt like nobody spoke for Trayvon Martin.''

24/7 Wall St.

In 2012%2C violent crime rose only about 1%25 nationally

Low income and low education is oftentimes linked to higher crime rates

Tennessee tops the list in highest violent crime%2C according to 24/7 analysis

You might think that going to California, Texas or New York exposes you to a lot of crime. But in fact it was Tennessee that had the nation's highest violent crime rate last year.

The FBI's latest statewide statistics offer a snapshot of the underside of the 50 states: where violent crime is most likely to occur. According to the FBI, violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the states with the highest rates of violent crime in the country.

While violent crime rose just under 1% nationally in 2012, the trend for the past 20 years has been steady decline. Crime peaked in the late 1980s, fueled by the crack cocaine epidemic. Beginning in the early 1990s, crime began to decline. Although the exact cause remains unclear, experts have pointed to factors such as better policing, demographic changes, higher incarceration rates, a drop in cocaine use and the introduction of a variety of social programs.

In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Urban Institute senior fellow John Roman pointed out that the crime decline has not been uniform. It has improved markedly in some large cities, like New York, Dallas and Washington, D.C. However, the decline has been less impressive in cities like Baltimore and Detroit, where economic and racial segregation limit the ability of the poor to move into the middle class.

The more the population is integrated, Roman explained, the greater the chances of sizable crime declines. Most crime is committed by people at the bottom of the economic totem pole, he said.

The apparent relationship between low income, low education and higher crime rates has been well documented, although identifying the cause and effect is still a matter of debate. It is clear, though, that these states for the most part match the national trend. Of the 10 states with the highest rates of violent crime, eight have lower rates of adults with bachelor's degrees, and most of them had median income levels below the national figure in 2012.

There are notable exceptions to the national trend, however. Alaska, Delaware and Maryland all have higher educational attainment and higher income, but they still make the list. In Maryland and Delaware, this likely has to do with pockets of very high crime in the largest urban areas.

While Maryland has the ninth-highest violent crime rate in the country, it also has the third-lowest poverty rate, the highest median income and one of the highest proportions of adults with a college degree. The reason for this discrepancy is likely the concentration of high crime in Baltimore. The Baltimore metropolitan area also had the ninth highest violent crime rate in the country last year and accounted for nearly a third of all the incidents in the state that year.

On its website, the FBI instructs readers to avoid comparing state violence because rankings tend to be simplistic and ignore factors that influence crime, as well as the different ways crimes are measured and reported. For this reason, Roman cautioned against directly comparing states based on their individual crime rates. However, because the states with the highest and lowest violent crime rates have remained consistent for many years, he believes comparing state ranks was useful. ""This exercise is worth doing. I don't know how you make policy without doing this kind of thing.""

24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 states with the highest rates of violent crime per 100,000 residents. Using estimated populations and crime incidents from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, which measures incidents of eight types of violent and nonviolent crime for 2012, 24/7 Wall St. calculated the incidence of the four types of violent crime per 100,000 persons for that year: murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In addition to crime data, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed income, poverty and education statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for 2012, the most recent available year.

These are the most dangerous states in America:

1. Tennessee

> Violent crimes per 100,000: 643.6

> Poverty rate: 17.9%

> Pct. of population with bachelor's degree or higher: 24.3%

> Property crimes per 100,000: 3,371.4 (10th highest)

Tennessee has the dubious distinction of having the worst violent crime rate in the country. The state was among the top 10 in the country for murders and robberies and was first for aggravated assaults, with an estimated 479.6 for every 100,000 residents. Tennessee's 41,550 violent crimes in 2012 were up 6.8% from 2011 but down 10% from 2007, when there were 46,380 violent crimes. There were 388 murders in the state in 2012, up for a second straight year. To be fair, Tennessee's violent streak is concentrated in some of the major metropolitan areas. Memphis's violent crime rate was the nation's fifth worst, while Nashville's was the 18th worst. Like many states with high violent crime, poverty in Tennessee is acute, and high school and college graduation rates are lower than most of the country.

2. Nevada

> Violent crimes per 100,000: 607.6

> Poverty rate: 16.4%

> Pct. of population with bachelor's degree or higher: 22.4%

> Property crimes per 100,000: 2,809.4 (23rd highest)

Nevada ranks among the worst in the country for its robbery rate, motor-vehicle theft rate and aggravated assault rate. It also ranks high in categories like burglaries and forcible rape. Much of the crime, state officials maintain, comes from the swarms of tourists who visit Las Vegas, Reno and other cities with casinos and related entertainment. Factor out the casino traffic in Reno, and local crime rates are similar to the rest of the nation, Emmanuel Barthe, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nevada Reno, told the Reno Gazette-Journal. Nevada also has among the lowest high school and college graduation rates.

3. Alaska

> Violent crimes per 100,000: 603.2

> Poverty rate: 10.1%

> Pct. of population with bachelor's degree or higher: 28.0%

> Property crimes per 100,000: 2,739.4 (24th lowest)

It may seem incongruous that Alaska, which has a low poverty rate and high levels of high school and college graduates, would be among the states with the worst crime rates. It has among the worst violent crime rates in part because of its forcible rape rate: 79.7 per 100,000 residents, the nation's highest rate. (Next is South Dakota, with a rate of 70.2 per 100,000.) Also disturbing, a 2010 study suggests that 37% of women who live in Alaska say they've ""suffered some form of sexual assault in their lives,"" the Anchorage Daily News reported. Alaska is also second in aggravated assaults. While rape and assault rates are high, other crime levels are average.

Federal agents trying to stop the black Infiniti speeding between the White House and the U.S. Capitol fired seven shots at its unarmed driver, who had a toddler in the car with her, an uncommon tactic that occurred during a highly unusual chase.

A woman with a 1-year-old girl in her car was fatally shot by police near the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, after a chase through the heart of Washington that brought a new jolt of fear to a city already rattled by the recent Navy Yard shooting and the federal shutdown.

The car was registered to Miriam Carey, 34, a dental hygienist from Stamford, Conn., law enforcement officials said, adding that they believed Carey was the driver.

D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said that the driver tried to breach two Washington landmarks and that the incident was not an accident. But officials also said it did not appear to be part of any larger or organized terrorist plot.

The chase began at about 2:15 p.m. at a White House security checkpoint, where the woman struck a barrier and a Secret Service officer with her black Infiniti. The woman then sped away from that fortified icon and headed straight for another: the Capitol.

During the chase, police officers opened fire twice, both times in areas busy with tourists and office workers. The Capitol itself was locked down, as a bitter debate over the government shutdown was interrupted by echoes of shots, officers with guns and an urgent order to “shelter in place.”

The end came outside the Hart Senate Office Building, at Maryland Avenue and Second Street NE. The woman’s car got stuck. Officers fired another volley. Then, moments later, an officer emerged with the girl and carried the toddler quickly away as new waves of officers arrived.

Authorities said the woman was not armed, and although the incident was first reported as a shooting at the Capitol, the only shots were fired by officers.

Police said there was no indication that the woman was part of a larger threat. But they said little about why she had suddenly become a threat herself.

“I am pretty confident this was not an accident,” Lanier said at an evening news conference.

Lanier said that the girl was in good condition and in protective custody. Two officers were injured in the chase along Pennsylvania Avenue, but only one, a U.S. Capitol Police officer, was treated at a hospital. He was later released.

The chaotic day caught Washington at an unusually low moment. Just days after the government shut down because of a budget impasse and weeks after 12 people were killed at the nearby Navy Yard, the notion of gunfire and a car hurtling from the White House to the Capitol had the city thinking the worst.

It began with something not that unusual — a driver with out-of-state plates turning into a blocked entry near the White House.

It quickly became something else.

“Whoa! Whoa!,” Secret Service officers were shouting at the car, according to a witness, Shawn Joseph, 29. “It looked liked [the driver was] scared or lost. I thought they might have been a tourist.”

But then, witnesses said, officers tried to place a barrier in front of the car. The driver swerved. The officers moved the barrier. She hit it, and a Secret Service officer was thrown up on the hood and then off the car.

The officer was not badly hurt. The driver sped east and was stopped by police at a small traffic circle at the foot of Capitol Hill. There, video shot by the U.S.-funded Arabic TV station Alhurra shows officers with guns pointed at the car. The driver took off.

“I thought it was a motorcade,” said Ryan Christiansen, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, when he saw the black car trailed by police cars with sirens wailing. Then, Christiansen said, the car

“was pulling away, and somewhere between six and eight shots were fired,” he said.

Despite the shots, the driver continued. She went around another traffic circle and then up Constitution Avenue toward the peak of Capitol Hill.

Up there, 46-year-old tourist Edmund Ofori-Attah was walking toward the Hart building to ask if it was open for tours. With most of Washington’s top attractions shut down, touring an office building sounded better than nothing.

Then he saw a black car whiz past. It abruptly turned left, as if to make a U-turn, and lodged itself on a grassy divide.

“That’s where it got pinned,” he said. “At that point, we heard five to six rounds of gunfire and my wife and I dropped to the ground. We were hoping not to get in the way of a stray bullet — we just lay down as low as possible. We even smelled the gunpowder in the air.”

The final shots were fired on that median. Police said they were not sure how many officers had fired or how many times the woman was shot.

Inside the Capitol, legislators were in the middle of their dragging stalemate.

“It was almost like two very rapid-fire bursts, very loud,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who had been standing outside on a Capitol balcony with Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.). They heard the gunfire and saw people running.

Around the vast complex, heavily armed Capitol Police officers began banging on doors, instructing staffers for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) to shelter in place and lock their doors.

“Shelter in place. Just get to your office,” an officer said when reporters asked what they should do.

An e-mail went out: “Gunshots have been reported on Capitol Hill. . . . Close, lock and stay away from external doors and windows.” Sharpshooters took positions outside the iconic building. The House adjourned. The Senate adjourned.

Outside, after the shots had been fired, witnesses saw the girl carried from the scene. A police officer sat down on the median and appeared to struggle for breath, visibly shaken.

In the hours after that, law enforcement officials said the car had been registered to Carey. The FBI was at Carey’s apartment Thursday night.

Police said the incident showed the success of the huge security apparatus that Washington has built since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

“The security perimeters worked” at both the White House and the Capitol, Lanier said. “They did exactly what they were supposed to do.”

Both houses of Congress came back later in the day and offered thanks to the Capitol Police. The House gave officers a standing ovation. Senate staffers were distributing small black buttons reading “THANK YOU, CAPITOL POLICE” with a picture of the Capitol Dome.

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said he had called the injured Capitol Police officer, and the officer said he would be fine. Reid added that the officer said, “The only thing I do every day is to make sure you and everyone who works up here is safe.”

Funeral directors say the mass shooting last month is unforgettable

Unfathomable work for funeral service workers

Looking for solace of their own%2C funeral directors hold a service

SOUTHBURY, Conn. (AP) — As she recalled the afternoon of Dec. 14, Nicole Paquette, past president of the Connecticut Funeral Directors Association, stopped to compose herself, but the tears kept running down her face.

""I will never forget reading the fax,"" Paquette said. ""We all knew young children were killed, but when we saw their names, then the comma, and then the numbers 6 or 7 after their names, for their age, we all broke down.""

Paquette and dozens of funeral directors who served or volunteered to help the families of 20 students and six educators killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown held a moving service Saturday during which they recalled the shooting and acknowledged how they all came together for the unfathomable work before them.

About 80 funeral directors from the more than 11 Connecticut homes that served the Newtown families and others who volunteered their services shed tears and hugged each other as they gathered in Southbury for a service of remembrance and reflection.

Before the service, 26 candles were lit while people filled the room.

John F. Cascio, executive director of the funeral directors association, began the service by reading the name of each of the victims.

""In our world a lit candle signifies remembrance,"" he said. ""Let this tiny light also represent our rebirth; we reach out to each other and look to the promise of the future. Today we gather, remember and reflect.""

For the association's president, Pasquale S. Folino, the images are unforgettable.

""For all of us that were involved with Newtown, the names and faces of those children are forever etched in our memories,"" he said.

""The town of Newtown was shaken to its foundation,"" Folino added. ""Life oftentimes is not what it's supposed to be, it is what it is. But what is important is how we react to it.""

Folino, the funeral director at Neilan Funeral Home in New London, acknowledged the 160 funeral directors across the state who answered the call, saying they did whatever they had to do for the families.

Specifically recognized was Dan Honan, of Honan Funeral Home in Newtown, the only funeral home in Newtown. Fellow funeral directors called his efforts heroic.

Honan, who spent all of his life in Newtown, had the unspeakable task of laying to rest 11 first-graders in five days.

""A funeral for a child is always the most difficult,"" he said. ""Newtown is changed forever, but we are forever closer as a community.""

Monsignor Robert ""Bob"" Weiss of St. Rose of Lima Church in Newtown, where eight of the children's funerals were held, had praise for the funeral directors.

""You are truly stewards of your profession,"" he said. ""The families found hope and great consolation in your compassion and attention you paid to every last detail. You were there for those families.""

Laura Soll, communications director for the Connecticut Funeral Directors Association, said the response from funeral directors around the country was incredible. The association represents 220 funeral homes in the state.

Soll said the group got together within hours of the shooting to figure out how to offset the pressure their colleagues were facing in the wake of the tragedy."

Hadiya Pendleton%2C 15%2C performed at Obama inauguration

First lady Michelle Obama attended her funeral Saturday

Suspects%2C 18 and 20%2C were taken into custody Sunday

CHICAGO — Two men have been charged with murder in the shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton a week after she performed at President Obama's inauguration.

Michael Ward, 18, and Kenneth Williams, 20, both of Chicago, were charged with one count each of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm in the Jan. 29 attack that also wounded two other teens, the Chicago Tribune reported, citing prosecutors.

City Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy and other top police officials were expected to formally announce the charges at an evening news conference.

Citing sources, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Ward has been on two years' probation for aggravated use of a weapon in 2011. He and Williams are members of the Gangster Disciples street gang and were feuding with rival gang members at the time of the shooting, authorities said.

Police said Hadiya, an honor student and band majorette at King College Prep. was an innocent victim of a gang-related shooting.

First lady Michelle Obama attended her funeral Saturday. Other dignitaries included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush.

Hadiya was shot in Vivian Gordon Harsh Park, about a mile from the Obama home on the city's South Side. After finishing their exams she and classmates had taken shelter under a park canopy during a rainstorm. Police said a man hopped a fence, ran toward the group and opened fire with a handgun, striking Hadiya in the back as she tried to run.

Her slaying brought new attention to Chicago's homicide rate, and came in a January that was the city's deadliest in a decade. In 2012, Chicago recorded 506 homicides.

Chris Kyle, 38, a decorated Iraq war veteran, a former SEAL and author of “American Sniper,” was shot and killed Saturday. Police arrested Eddie Ray Routh, 25, a veteran authorities say may have a mental illness related to his military service.

In response to the news, Paul tweeted: “Chris Kyle’s death seems to confirm that ‘he who lives by the sword dies by the sword.’ Treating PTSD at a firing range doesn’t make sense.”

The tweet set off a chain reaction of criticism online.

Aaron Worthing (@AaronWorthing) responded: “What the Hell, @RonPaul? Are you actually blaming Chris Kyle for his own death?”

Michelle Lancaster (@SkiGarmisch) added, “Very disrespectful commentary to this man, his memory and his family. Shame on you.”

Razor (@hale.razor) wrote, “So all veterans, once done serving our nation with honor, deserve to be murdered as civilians? Wow.”

[pullquote]

Calls and emails to Paul for comment were not immediately returned. He averages about two tweets a day, typically about policy issues ranging from immigration to the Federal Reserve. Paul, who is known for his anti-war views, retired as a long-time Texas congressman earlier this year.

Kyle, the most lethal sniper in the U.S., had 160 confirmed kills. He enlisted in the Navy in February 1999 and was discharged in November 2009. He had four tours in Iraq under his belt and received 14 different awards and decorations, including two Silver Stars, five Bronze Stars with Valor and two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals. After leaving the Navy, he wrote his biography, “American Sniper.”

Last year, Kyle told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he didn’t go into the service for the money or awards.

“I did it because I felt like it was something that needed to be done and it was honorable,” Kyle said. “I loved the guys.”

Routh, a former corporal in the Marines, is being held on $3 million bond. He is also accused of killing Chad Littlefield, 35, who was at the gun range with Kyle. Routh has been charged with one count of capital murder and two charges of murder. Routh served on active duty from 2006 to 2010. He fought in Iraq in 2007 and was sent to Haiti in 2010.

The Arizona Republic

Zirbel has written two self-published books on the assassination

He believes Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates in Texas were behind killing

Zirbel says public beginning to lose interest in assassination

PHOENIX -- LBJ did it.

He didn't pull the trigger, but he was in the thick of the conspiracy, according to a Scottsdale attorney who has written two books on the subject.

President John F. Kennedy was shot dead in Dallas 50 years ago Friday, and the attorney is certain that Lee Harvey Oswald's only involvement was as the fall guy.

On a recent morning, Craig Zirbel is sitting at a nondescript office in the Scottsdale Airpark, behind a desk that he says once belonged to Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin senator famous for his claims that Communists had infiltrated the government.

Zirbel has written two books on the Kennedy assassination, and, McCarthyesque government conspiracies aside, he says the public has but two choices on deciding what to believe about that November day: Either Lee Harvey Oswald, a man with no motive did it, or another theory must be devised.

A majority of people, according to polls, believe the conspiracy idea and have for a long time.

Zirbel delivers his conclusions with enthusiasm, waving his arms and raising his voice.

""I don't believe Oswald pulled the trigger,"" Zirbel says.

The attorney has been interested in the assassination for a long time.

Zirbel was in third grade when Kennedy was killed. He got a copy of the Warren Commission report on the assassination a year later, shortly after it was published. He says he did not understand much of it at the time, but he maintained his interest over the years.

The report, based on an investigation by a select government committee, concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy. That has been the official finding ever since.

But that has not stopped conspiracy theories from persisting.

Zirbel has self-published two books on the subject, ""The Texas Connection"" in 1991 and ""The Final Chapter on the Assassination of John F. Kennedy"" in 2010. The titles have been well-received by some people, criticized by others — typical of the contentious and eccentric world of Kennedy conspiracy theorists.

One of them, political strategist Roger Stone, is the author of ""The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case against LBJ,"" which came out this year.

""Craig Zirbel did some of the earliest and most important seminal work on LBJ's involvement in the murder of JFK,"" Stone said in an email. ""I have used his book, 'The Texas Connection,' with attribution. I have tried to build on the solid foundation built by Zirbel.""

Not all assassination buffs agree. It is easy to find numerous commentators who believe Zirbel misinterpreted some of the data.

The title of the book gives away Zirbel's position: that Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates in Texas were behind the assassination.

If Oswald did not pull the trigger — and Zirbel provides a list of reasons he believes he did not — then the explanation becomes more elusive.

Those who have interest in the case know the scenarios:

-- The Central Intelligence Agency, perhaps upset by changes in the agency that followed the failed Bay of Pigs invasion aimed at ousting Fidel Castro from leadership in Cuba.

-- The Mafia, arguably because of law-enforcement moves against organized crime by the Kennedy administration.

-- Anti-Castro Cuban exile groups, upset by the Bay of Pigs failure, perhaps working closely with the previous two groups.

-- Others, including the military industrial complex, a government agency such as the FBI, Southern segregationists, the Soviet Union or American conservatives.

Zirbel makes the case that Johnson, and only Johnson, had the motive, the means and the opportunity to mount a conspiracy against the president.

The motive: political gain. There were political differences, personal issues, Johnson's involvement in several scandals and his desire to become president before he got too old.

The opportunity: Kennedy's visit to LBJ's home turf in Texas. Johnson and his associates controlled many of the trip's details.

The means: shots by multiple gunmen firing from the direction of the now infamous grassy knoll. Hired perhaps by Johnson associates in the oil business, who had ties to the Mafia, Zirbel insists, there were at least two shooters.

He also emphasizes that as president, Johnson had the means to block any serious investigation.

And Oswald? His movements, his statements and his background make no sense if he was the lone gunman, Zirbel says. Even the site of the fatal shots was out of whack: Oswald would have had a much easier target several seconds earlier, as the motorcade slowed to turn twice, Zirbel notes.

It's the awkward turns, rather than the otherwise direct route the motorcade took, that strikes Zirbel.

""It's the thing that blows my mind away,"" he says. ""It's the first time a route ever was changed from what the Secret Service had established.""

The revised route took the motorcade directly past the Texas School Book Depository building and Dealey Plaza, site of the grassy knoll, from which many theorists believe the shots were fired.

Zirbel says John Connally, then Texas governor, had insisted upon the arrangement. Connally was an ally of Johnson. He, in fact, lost a fight over motorcade seating arrangements, was forced to ride with Kennedy and was wounded in the shooting.

Zirbel also points to statements by two known participants in his conspiracy: Oswald, who shouted, ""I'm a patsy!"" to nearby reporters at the Dallas jail, and Oswald's killer, Jack Ruby, who was quoted as saying, ""If you knew the truth, you'd be amazed.""

But it has been 50 years, and no conclusive evidence has emerged. Zirbel says the public is beginning to lose interest in the assassination. He says he never had interest in the ""minutae,"" and is losing interest generally.

He has begun to sell off his assassination memorabilia, including his replica of the car the president was riding in that fateful day. Media calls have slowed down, too, bumping back up only because of the significance of the anniversary.

He still wants the public to see the case for what it is.

""All I want to get out,"" he says, ""is that there was no lone assassin, and there was a conspiracy.""

He and his like-minded investigators in the field have to be gratified with their efforts, although the numbers have slipped over the last decade.

According to a recent survey from the Associated Press, conducted in mid-April, 59 percent of Americans think multiple people were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president, while 24 percent think Oswald acted alone, and 16 percent are unsure. A 2003 Gallup poll found that 75 percent of Americans felt there was a conspiracy.

The Oswald-acted-alone results, meanwhile, are the highest since the period three years after the assassination, when 36 percent said one man was responsible for Kennedy's death."

“When he ran in I just screamed,” she said. “His mouth was just hanging off and it was just a big hole… I just threw him on the couch and laid him in my arms and put pressure on his mouth with the towel.”

He is alive and in stable condition following surgeries to stablized his injuries: he requires a breathing tube but is alert and can wink and nod. A plate has been implanted in his jaw.

The freak that shot him was found standing by his truck and was apparently nonchalant about the incident:

Gregory Taplin said he noticed Cloninger standing in the apartment complex parking lot several hours before the shooting. Taplin knew he wasn't a resident, so he went up to talk to him. ""'Do you stay here?' 'Da da da da' -- that's all he was saying,"" Taplin said. ""He was gone, man. He was spaced out. He's up there, like,"" Taplin said, blinking his eyes repeatedly. ""I said, 'What's wrong with this man?'"" Hours later, Taplin heard the gunshots and went outside. Scared residents pointed at Clonginer as he was standing near his truck. Tapline went up to him. ""Did you shoot that boy? He said, 'Yeah, I shot him.' I said, 'Why?'"" Taplin said.

He is in jail (amazingly) on a $2+ million-dollar bond.

The family, of course, is crushed

“When I first saw him in ICU I started crying,” Donald Maiden, Sr. said of his son. DJ’s father was working in Louisiana. The boy was in a medically-induced coma when Dad first saw him. “I just put my head down in his bed and was holding his hand at the same time. And he opened his eyes. And when I raised back up I looked and there were tears rolling down his eyes and it gave me a little bit of spirit in my heart. It was joy, I guess he was kind of happy to know I was there. “

As of the time of this posting I could not find any updates to the stroy that would indicate any reason this man shot this child.

Cloninger has a mugshot online from January 2012 for DUI.

Story highlights NEW: Death revised from 6 to 4; gunman also killed One man describes the gunman as calm and ''looking around'' for targets Police have a person of interest in custody, the police chief says As many as six are slain; gunman also died

(CNN) —

[Update 11:55 p.m.]

(CNN) – The gunman who went on a shooting rampage in Santa Monica, California, killed four people, police spokesman St. Richard Lewis said. Authorities said earlier that six had died, but revised the number to four. The gunman was also killed, bringing the total number of deaths to five.

The shooter began his rampage at a residence near the campus of Santa Monica College, opening fire in a house, where police later found two bodies. He then shot at a passing car before carjacking another vehicle, Lewis said. He forced the driver, a woman, to drive onto the college campus. There he shot two people in a passing vehicle. One died at the scene. The gunman also fatally shot someone outside the campus library, where he engaged police in a gunfight, Lewis said. Officers fatally wounded him.

[Earlier story]

(CNN) – Six people were killed in a shooting rampage in Santa Monica, California, that ended Friday with the gunman clad in tactical gear dead in a college library and a “person of interest” in custody, authorities said.

“We are not convinced 100 percent that the suspect who was killed operated in a solo or alone capacity,” Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks told reporters.

The comments came as police and firefighters searched the sprawling campus of Santa Monica College for other possible victims or shooters. By early evening, authorities declared the campus clear.

The gunman has not been identified by authorities, Seabrooks said. She described him as a white male between the age of 25 and 35, clad in black and wearing what appeared to be a ballistic vest. He carried a semi-automatic assault rifle, she said.

Seabrooks did not identify the person in custody, nor did she explain why authorities wanted to talk with the individual.

At least three people were wounded in the shootings, which authorities believe began with a house fire and gunshots shortly before noon in a residential neighborhood near the college.

Jerry Cunningham was home when she heard the shots, and stepped out onto her porch to see what happened.

She saw the gunman firing at a neighboring house, and then she noticed it was on fire. She saw the gunman carjack a vehicle.

As he was holding the female motorist at gunpoint, the gunman waved another car by, Cunningham said. That driver, also a woman, hesitated for just a moment, and the gunman “fired three shots directly into her and the car,” Cunningham said. The motorist was wounded in the shoulder, she said.

Inside the house, firefighters found the bodies of at least two people, Seabrooks said.

Map: Shooting in Santa Monica

Investigators believe the gunman knew the dead people in the house, but police were unsure of the connection.

The others killed in the rampage were targeted randomly, Seabrooks said.

Investigators did not immediately identify the victims, saying authorities were still making next-of-kin notifications.

It was not immediately clear whether a woman who died from wounds at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center was counted among the six deaths. Another woman wounded in the shooting remains in critical condition, Dr. Marshall Morgan, chief of emergency medicine at the medical center, said Friday evening.

Within minutes of the carjacking, authorities said, the gunman targeted a bus in Santa Monica. Two passengers were injured, Suja Lowenthal, a Big Blue Bus spokeswoman, told CNN.

A short distance later, the gunman opened fire on cars, including a patrol car, adjacent to the college.

“There was an exchange of gunfire at the time, and the suspect tried to evade,” Seabrooks said.

The gunman ran on to the campus, where he again exchanged gunfire with police.

Student Joe Orcutt saw the exchange of gunfire and fled, only to come face-to-face later with the gunman near the campus parking lot.

“He was standing there. He looked over at me, and I looked at him. He just panned his gun and trained it on me, and I just jumped behind the building and he shot at me,” Orcutt said.

Orcutt said he heard bullets “whiz by my head.”

The gunman was “very calm, not running around.” He was just “looking around for targets very casually,” he said.

“He just looked like he was standing there posing for the cover an ammo magazine or something. It was bizarre.”

The gunman exchanged gunfire at least once on the campus with police, Seabrooks said.

As he fled toward the campus library, he shot a woman, she said.

A number of students were in the library building studying for finals when the gunman burst in. More than 30,000 students are enrolled in the two-year community college.

A woman – who was shaken up by the ordeal and asked not to be identified – said she was in the building when she heard a noise, realized it was a gunshot, then took off running.

Then, in a hallway, she saw a dark-haired man whom she initially mistook for a police officer but later realized was the shooter. The man – who she said was wearing black combat boots and what appeared to be a bullet-proof vest – was quiet and walking casually.

“(He had) a big shotgun,” the woman said.

She and a colleague eventually realized something wasn’t right and ran in the opposite direction. “Multiple” gunshots rang out at one point, in an exchange of gunfire the woman described as like a war zone.

Priscilla Morales, who was also studying in the library, told CNN she looked out the window and saw people running.

She and her friends grabbed their books and belongings to leave the study room. “As we open the door, we hear three gunshots,” she said.

Morales and the others closed the door and hid.

Still, she could hear the commotion: gunshots and then the gunman screaming.

Morales also said she heard police tell the gunman to “drop it.”

“I was so scared and thought literally I was going to die,” she said.

President Barack Obama was in Santa Monica for a fundraiser just a 10-minute drive from the campus, CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported. Obama’s schedule was not affected by the shootings or police followup.

(AP) — In the weeks before Colorado's top prisons official was fatally shot after answering his front door, he carried out a variety of functions including requesting execution chemicals and speaking to legislators about security issues.

It's unknown what role Tom Clements' position as executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections might have played in the shooting Tuesday, but investigators said they aren't ruling out any possible motives, including whether it was random or a work-related attack.

Colorado corrections spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson would not comment on whether Clements had security at his home. Security was stepped up for other state officials, including Gov. John Hickenlooper, who was ashen-faced as he addressed reporters at the Capitol before signing bills placing new restrictions on firearms.

""Tom Clements dedicated his life to being a public servant, to making our state a better place and he is going to be deeply, deeply missed,"" Hickenlooper said Wednesday.

Authorities are looking for a late-model car, possibly a Lincoln or a Cadillac, that a neighbor spotted outside Clements' home around the time of the shooting Tuesday, El Paso County Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Jeff Kramer said in a report carried by the Denver Post.

Kramer also said investigators want to speak with a woman seen speed-walking near Clements' home not long before the shooting because she may have seen the suspect. The woman was wearing light pants, a dark windbreaker and possibly a hat.

While small in numbers, similar attacks on officials have been increasing in the U.S. in recent years, said Glenn McGovern, an investigator with the Santa Clara County District Attorney's office in California who tracks such incidents worldwide. He said there have been roughly as many in the past three years — at least 35 — as the entire prior decade. Revenge is usually the motive, he added.

""It's often taking place away from the office, which makes sense, because everyone's hardening up their facilities,"" he said, adding that he advises prosecutors to constantly assess the safety of their residences.

Story continues

On Jan. 31, Texas prosecutor Mark Hasse was gunned down as he left his car in the parking lot to the county courthouse. McGovern also counts the rampage by an ex-Los Angeles police officer who killed the daughter of a retired city police officer as part of a plot to avenge his firing.

In Colorado, a prosecutor was fatally shot in 2008 as he returned to his Denver home. In 2001, federal prosecutor Thomas Wales was fatally shot by a rifleman while he worked on a computer at night in his Seattle home. Both cases remain unsolved.

Attacks on legal officials are still extremely rare, said Scott Burns of the National District Attorneys Association, which counts 11 prosecutors as having been slain in the last 50 years. But he acknowledged that legal officials are vulnerable outside of protected offices and courthouses.

""If someone wants to truly harm or kill them, it's very difficult, frankly. There's not a lot we can do,"" he said.

Mike McLelland, the district attorney in rural Kaufman county east of Dallas, is a 23-year military veteran. Since his prosecutor, Hasse, was killed on his way into the office, McLelland has warned his staff to be vigilant about their surroundings and possible danger.

""The people in my line of work are going to have to get a lot better at it, because they're going to need it more in the future,"" McLelland said, adding that he carries a gun everywhere he goes.

Clements came to Colorado in 2011 after working three decades in the Missouri prison system. He began a review of Colorado's solitary confinement system and closed a new prison built specifically to hold prisoners being held in solitary — Colorado State Penitentiary II.

He lived in a wooded neighborhood of large, two-story houses on 2-acre lots dotted with evergreen trees in an area known as the Black Forest. Long driveways connect the homes to narrow, winding roads that thread the hills. After word of the shooting spread Tuesday night, some residents slept with shotguns at the ready, fearful the shooter would return.

It would have been simple to find Clements' house. It took two clicks to get his street address through a publicly available Internet locator service Wednesday morning. The listing also included his previous address in Missouri.

McGovern said he tells his prosecutors to assume that any possible assailants can find their home addresses online and to check for areas they may be especially vulnerable such as neighboring alleys and poorly lit porches.

There is no central database of attacks on legal officials and senior law enforcement executives like Clements.

McGovern has documented 133 of them in the U.S. since 1950 by searching news accounts and court cases. The total includes 41 killings of judges, prosecutors and other justice and police officials. The assaults usually come with little warning, he said.

Steven K. Swensen, a former U.S. Marshal who runs a business consulting on security for court officials, said attacks on legal staff used to occur in courtrooms. As security has been expanded to protect those rooms, then courthouses, the attacks have spilled out further and further.

""Now we're having more violence off-site, in judges' houses, on their way to and from work,"" Swensen said.

Clements' survivors include two daughters and his wife, who is director of the state Office of Behavioral Health.

While Clements generally kept a low profile, his killing comes a week after he denied a request by a Saudi national to serve out the remainder of a Colorado prison sentence in Saudi Arabia.

Clements also recently requested chemicals to execute Nathan Dunlap, who was convicted of killing four people in a 1993 shooting rampage at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant and is scheduled to become the second person executed in Colorado since the death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976.

Clements' father-in-law, Carroll Smith, told The Denver Post (http://bit.ly/YX6lLN) that Clements opposed the death penalty.

Earlier this week, Clements spoke to legislators about the need for more security staff in the department's food service areas, Department of Corrections spokeswoman Alison Morgan said. Last year, a kitchen worker at a state prison was killed and another was injured in an assault involving an inmate.

Clements is at least the second state prisons chief killed in office. Michael Francke, director of the Oregon corrections department, was stabbed to death outside his office in 1989 in what prosecutors described as a bungled car burglary. A former Oregon prison inmate was found guilty of aggravated murder in 1991 and sentenced to life in prison.

Hickenlooper ordered flags lowered to half-staff at public buildings until the day after Clements' funeral.

""Why is it that we Republicans, certain elements of our party, seem to go out of their way to inflame minority voters?"" Scarborough asked. ""Why is it that I know I can count on conservative outlets to have a one-sided view and to talk about how a dead boy had it coming and he was in -- on marijuana, he was on pot and he was this, he was that and the other, a young young man.""

""I would like in my lifetime for the Republican party to get more than 6% of the African-American vote,"" he said.

""Republicans used to get huge chunks of the African-American vote and they don't,"" the Washington Post's Eugene Robinson replied.

Former RNC chairman Michael Steele chimed in, saying that it will take more than ""politically correct"" comments about Trayvon Martin in order to get more support from blacks. Robinson added that the overwhelming white majority in the party gives right-wing outlets even more reason to ""[stoke] these flames.""

""I have a suggestion,"" Scarborough said. ""Just because Al Sharpton is doing something and you hate Al Sharpton, doesn’t mean you help your party or your cause by going in the complete opposite direction. Maybe sometimes discretion is the better part of valor. Maybe sometimes conservative outlets should sit back and not purposefully antagonize African Americans.""

Scarborough's comments expanded on his latest column for Politico, which addressed the George Zimmerman verdict announced Saturday. In it, he wrote that ""conservative commentators were offensive in their reflexive defense of Zimmerman, as well as their efforts to attack the integrity of a dead black teenager.""

The MSNBC host has criticized conservative media outlets before. In December, he accused conservative media of ""destroying"" the Republican party, and before that, he said that

said that GOP donors were ""lied to"" by conservative media during the 2012 election."

The information was released Monday in the most detailed account yet of the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting that left 20 first-graders and six school employees dead and galvanized calls nationwide for stricter gun control.

The report from the Connecticut state’s attorney in Danbury, Stephen Sedensky III, also gave a chilling account of shooter Adam Lanza’s downward mental spiral and of his increasingly antisocial behavior in recent years.

Among other things, it said Lanza, 20, kept a spreadsheet of mass murders, hated to be touched, and did not allow anyone — including his mother, Nancy Lanza — into his bedroom. He covered his bedroom windows with black trash bags, disliked birthdays and holidays, would not let his mother put up a Christmas tree, and made her get rid of a cat because he didn’t want it in the house.

WHO THEY WERE: Newtown shooting victims

As time went by, he only spoke to his mother via email, even though they lived together.

But the 48-page report, a summary of the police investigation that includes 78 photographs of the school and the Lanza home, does not offer a reason for Lanza’s rampage or his decision to target the school.

“The obvious question that remains is: Why did the shooter murder 27 people, including 20 children? Unfortunately that question may never be answered,” it said.

The report provided a detailed timeline of the events that Friday morning, based on interviews with witnesses, including children who survived. It delved into Lanza’s childhood and mental problems and noted that nobody considered him a threat, despite his odd behavior. Toxicology reports showed no sign of prescription medication or any other drugs or alcohol in Lanza’s system at the time of the shooting.

According to police, Lanza shot his mother sometime between 8 and 9 a.m., using a .22-caliber rifle. Someone living near the Lanzas’ home in a hilly, upscale neighborhood reported hearing “two or three” gunshots during that time.

Then Lanza got into his car and drove a few miles to the school. He parked outside the low-slung building and approached the front entrance armed with a Bushmaster rifle, a Glock 10-millimeter pistol, a Sig Sauer 9-millimeter pistol and a “large supply of ammunition,” according to the report. The doors were locked because classes had begun, so Lanza shot open the plate-glass window on the door leading into the lobby.

Wearing a hat, sunglasses, yellow earplugs and black fingerless gloves, he began strolling down the hallway. “The shooter walked normally, did not say anything, and appeared to be breathing normally,” the report said.

Lanza’s first victims were principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, who were in Room 9 when they heard glass shattering and “loud banging.” They went into the hallway and quickly were shot to death, but not before Hochsprung warned a third staffer behind her, “Stay put!”

That staffer was also shot but survived. She crawled back into Room 9 and dialed 911.

By now, other staff members had taken shelter in the school’s main office. Lanza was heading toward classrooms 8 and 10, where he killed 20 children and four adults.

As the gunfire raged, staff and students hid wherever they happened to be. The staff used various ways to keep the children calm, reading to them or having them color or draw pictures.

The first 911 call was made about 9:35 a.m. Less than four minutes later, the first police arrived at the school, according to the report. Less than five minutes after that call, Lanza shot himself.

PHOTOS: Newtown school shooting

“In fewer than 11 minutes, 20 first-grade pupils and six adults had lost their lives,” the report said. It noted that all the weapons found in Lanza’s home or with him at the school had been legally purchased by his mother.

Nancy Lanza, who was divorced from Adam’s father, “took care of all the shooter’s needs,” according to the report, and indicated that she didn’t work because of his condition. Nonetheless, she allowed Adam easy access to firearms, and one of the items found in their home was a check, written by Nancy Lanza to Adam and dated “Christmas Day,” with a notation that it was for him to buy himself a CZ 83 pistol.

Those who knew Adam Lanza offered varying descriptions of him including “nice” but “withdrawn” as a young boy to “antisocial” and “a loner” by high school. An acquaintance who socialized with him from 2011 to June 2012 said he was “capable of laughing, smiling and making jokes” and enjoyed nature and hiking.

Nobody said Lanza indicated a desire to be violent.

His taste in video games reflected the puzzle of his personality. Items in his bedroom and on his computer desktop included violent games, including “Grand Theft Auto” and “Battlefield,” and information on mass killings and the topic of pedophilia. But Lanza was also a huge fan of “Dance Dance Revolution,” in which a player on a platform moves his feet as directed by a video. In 2011 and until a month before the shooting, he went to a theater and played the game “most every Friday through Sunday” for up to 10 hours at a stretch.

In 2005, Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome and had “significant social impairments and extreme anxiety,” the report said, but he refused medication or therapy. By 2006, Nancy Lanza noted “marked changes” in her son’s behavior. He stopped riding his bike, hiking and playing the saxophone and became more reclusive.

By November 2012, he was not speaking to her and had not left the house in three months. Nancy Lanza told friends she planned to sell the Newtown house and move to Washington so Adam could attend a special school.

On Dec. 10, four days before the shooting, Nancy Lanza told a friend that her son had bumped his head badly but that he was OK. Then she left for a planned trip to New Hampshire, after cooking some of his favorite foods for him to eat while she was gone. She returned from her trip the night of Dec. 13.

Some state and Newtown officials, as well as families, had argued against releasing even the summary of what is expected to be a much larger official police report on the crime, saying it would only dredge up painful memories just as the city braces for the anniversary of the massacre.

Relatives of slain teacher Victoria Soto said the report’s release was “yet another blow” to them.

“While others search for the answer as to why this happened, we search for the how. How can we live without Vicki? How do we celebrate Christmas without Vicki? How do we go on every day missing a piece of our family?” the family said in a statement. “Those are the questions we seek the answers for. There is nothing in the report that will answer those for us.”

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he hoped the report would “add momentum to the push to prevent gun violence.”

“The lessons of this report are simple,” he said. “We must improve school security, increase mental health services and require background checks for all gun purchases so we can keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous people.”

USA TODAY

Officials have identified seven of the 12 victims in Monday's fatal shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard.

They are, according to Washington's Metropolitan Police Department: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61.

Details about their lives are beginning to emerge.

None of the victims have been identified as active-duty military personnel, officials said.

Officials still need to notify the loved ones of the five remaining victims.

An additional victim was identified by the Washington Post as Arthur Daniels, 51.

Michael Arnold's uncle, Steven Hunter, told the Associated Press that his nephew was an avid pilot who was building a light airplane at his home. ""It would have been the first plane he ever owned,"" Hunter told the AP in a telephone interview from Rochester, Mich., Arnold's hometown. ""It's partially assembled in his basement.""

According to the AP, citing a LinkedIn profile in her name, Sylvia Frasier had worked at Naval Sea Systems Command as an information assurance manager since 2000.

Frasier studied at Strayer University, earning a bachelor of science in computer information systems in 2000 and a master's in information systems in 2002. Her duties at NAVSEA included providing policy and guidance on network security, and assuring that all computer systems operated by the headquarters met Department of Navy and Department of Defense requirements.

Kathy Gaarde, a financial analyst from Woodbridge, Va, was a Washington Capitals fan, and devoted wife and mother of two, neighbor and friend Patrick Bolton told the Post.

""The mother was just the kindest lady in the world,"" Bolton told the news organization. ""I've never seen her do anything but nice things for people.""

Gaarde's husband, Douglass, wrote an email to the AP early Tuesday. ""Today my life partner of 42 years (38 of them married) was taken from me, my grown son and daughter, and friends,"" he wrote. ""We were just starting to plan our retirement activities and now none of that matters. It hasn't fully sunk in yet but I know I already dearly miss her.""

No information was immediately available for John Roger Johnson.

A neighbor of Frank Kohler's in St. Mary's County, Md., on the Chesapeake Bay, told the Post Kohler was married with two daughters.

Kenneth Proctor worked as a civilian utilities foreman at the Navy Yard, his ex-wife, Evelyn Proctor, told the AP. He spent 22 years working for the federal government, Evelyn Proctor said.

""He just went in there in the morning for breakfast,"" she told the AP, speaking Monday of the building where the shooting took place. ""He didn't even work in the building. It was a routine thing for him to go there in the morning for breakfast, and unfortunately it happened.""

Online records identified a Vishnu Pandit in his 60s living in North Potomac, Md. A person who answered the telephone at the address said, ""Please tell your colleagues not to call.""

Neighbor Mike Honig told the Post that Pandit was ""a very nice man with an Irish setter.""

The Navy established two telephone numbers for families to call for information about their loved ones: (202) 433-6151 and (202) 433-9713.

Joan was informed that the men were protesting her concert about an hour before it was due to begin and she immediately walked out onto the street to talk to them. When she approached, one of the first things they said was ""We appreciate the work you did on civil rights and women's rights."" They wanted to make that point clear.

She listened closely as they discussed their views. Primarily, they wanted to express the way they felt betrayed by anti-war protesters when they returned from combat. Joan assured them that she stood by them then and now. They had mixed reactions as she explained her actual positions and her support for all veterans, across the board.

At this point, Joan's merchandise salesman, Jim Stewart, who was a Captain in the US Army during Vietnam, approached the group. Jim is one of the most kind-hearted people you could ever meet. He is not one to speak lightly of what he went through in Vietnam. He took Joan's arm and said to these four men, ""I stand by this lady 100%. She did the right thing then, and she stood by us when we got home. She even recorded a song at that time from which 100% of the proceeds went to us vets.""

Here Jim listens, then engages in conversation:

Unbelievably, one of the four protesters began to question Jim in an accusatory fashion, pressing him for details about what division he was in and and where he served, as if, somehow, he were making it up. It brings tears to my eyes, as I write this, to remember Jim being questioned in this way. These protesters were there, theoretically, to lament the poor treatment of American soliders and yet they belittled and questioned the service of a veteran because he did not agree with their views.

Jim played their game for a bit before seeing it for what it was and disengaging. Joan stood by his side and said, ""Oh, he's got the stories all right. But he doesn't feel the need to talk about them.""

Ironically, a man on his way to the concert approached at this moment and, without really following all that had gone on, interjected, ""Those who don't realize that what they did in Vietnam was wrong are kind of SLOOOOOOW."" I watched Jim's face as he heard that statement - literally getting it from both sides within less than a minute.

At this point I engaged in conversation with the man holding the sign accusing liberals, rather than soliders, of killing babies. He said ""I never killed any babies and I don't believe in guilt by association."" I asked him how in the world he could justify holding a sign with Joan Baez's name on it that basically implied she killed babies if he didn't believe in guilt by association. He replied ""It's an analogy, you probably wouldn't understand it!""

Uhhhh.... yeah.

Jim said he should destroy the sign and he then claimed we were trying to trample his Constitutional right to free speech. We replied that we weren't questioning his right, by any means, but rather his sense of decency, considering that he was there having a conversation with Joan and she was clearly not a baby killer. Since his entire point was that guilt by association was wrong, it made sense to us. But he replied ""I'm Pro-Life and I'm proud of this sign."" With those words, he held it higher.

As we discussed these things, one of them repeated, ""Soldiers don't kill babies."" I said that so many horrible things happen in war that it's impossible to make such a blanket statement, especially when bombs get dropped from the sky, and I said it all comes down to the truth that ""War is hell.""

I continued, saying, ""And you all know that far better than me.""

They were suprised by this statement, as if shocked that anyone on the ""other side"" recognized what they'd been through. It seemd to render them speechless for a moment.

At this point, Joan's continuing acceptance of their stories and her willingness to hear them out began to melt their anger. In a twist that seems hard to fathom, they then asked her to SIGN THEIR POSTERS! She replied that she would sign the back but not the front of ""those horrible things."" Incredibly, the man with the baby-killing sign replied that he would take her name off the poster if she would sign it.

She did end up signing them, and also getting copies of her book for each of them, and offering tickets to the show, which they did not accept. She signed the back of the poster about her encouraging the killing of American soldiers - ""All the very best to you, Joan Baez.""

When we got back inside the theatre, Joan broke down in tears. I said to her ""You are so brave to face people like that."" She wasn't crying about the way she had been treated, however, but about the way Jim Stewart had stood up for her. ""Did you hear his voice shaking?"" she said. ""That was bravery...""

And she was right. Stepping back into the mire of Vietnam was not something he did lightly - he bore the literal denigration of his service by another veteran in order to defend her.

During the concert afterwards Joan dedicated a song to the protesters and said ""You know, they just wanted to be heard. Everyone wants to be heard. I feel like I made four new friends tonight.""

She took the high road, as always. It wasn't my name on those signs, yet I gave into anger. She never did. As we deal with tea parties and increasingly violent right wing protests it would do us all good to remember the example of non-violence and compassion that Ms Baez has exemplified for the 50-plus years of her career.

Her heroes are Gandhi and Martin Luther King. In my book, she's right there with them, leading the timeless and essential march along the high road.

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for the recs! I'm so happy that this story has inspired members of this community. You may want to check out the version of ""We Shall Overcome"" that Joan recorded in her kitchen in June, with some lyrics in Farsi, in the hope of directly inspiring the people of Iran as they stand up for real democracy against real oppression.

Now, in a protest against that retaliation , 9 former and one current Walmart workers and two allies have been arrested in planned acts of civil disobedience outside a Washington, D.C., Walmart office Thursday afternoon. The workers are setting a deadline of Labor Day for Walmart to reinstate fired workers and raise wages or face an escalation of worker activism.

Walmart wants to turn this into an argument about labor law, claiming that the workers' actions constitute ""intermittent strikes"" that aren't protected by law. However, Josh Eidelson reports:



Asked in June about Walmart claims that workers were fired for threatening customer service by violating attendance rules, former Obama-appointed NLRB Chair Wilma Liebman said, “the case law doesn’t sustain that as a valid defense” against the charge of illegally punishing strikers. As for the lack of legal protection for “intermittent strikes,” Liebman told The Nation, “I think it would be hard on the facts so far to say that the conduct constitutes intermittent striking.”

Another of the fired workers arrested today, Brandon Garrett, yesterday told The Nation that his termination had taken a toll in his Baker, Louisiana, store: “When we came back from striking and we wasn’t fired right away, even more associates wanted to join the organization. But I guess Walmart got a sense of that, and when they terminated me, they kind of scared a lot of them off.” Now, said Garrett, “they’re still behind us,” but “a lot of them are scared to be retaliated against. So that’s another reason I’m standing up like I am.”

@ForRespect Lucas, gay, out and proud, faced discrimination at #walmart and was fired for speaking out. 'Today I take a stand.'

By turning this into a dispute about the specifics of labor law, Walmart can both drag things out for months or years before potentially being forced to reinstate the workers and can try to shift the conversation from Walmart's own rampant abuse of workers and damage to the economy . They'd like to shift the conversation from the workers' voices, while letting workers who haven't yet joined the protests and strikes know the cost of doing so:These efforts to change the subject and silence workers are why it's important to hear what the workers had to say at Thursday's protest:"

The suspect was identified by five law enforcement sources in Washington and Los Angeles as John Zawahri, in his 20s.

Other sources with knowledge of the investigation said detectives believe the shooting was sparked by a family dispute of some kind but emphasized that the investigation was still in its early stages.

The suspect’s past mental health issues occurred when he was juvenile, the law enforcement source said, but no further details were offered.

The sources all spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was ongoing.

These sources said the alleged gunman’s first victims were his father and brother, whose bodies were found in a burning home.

One thing the investigators were trying to figure out is why the suspect wanted to be driven to Santa Monica College, where he was ultimately killed by police.

Police have stressed that the rampage was not a “school shooting” and that the violence occurred in many places and happened to end on the campus.

But a woman who was carjacked by the alleged gunman said he specifically asked to be taken to the college.

“You’re going to drive me to Santa Monica College and let me out,” Laura Sisk, 41, of Culver City recalled the suspect saying in an interview with The Times.

As of Saturday morning, law enforcement sources said they did not believe the college was the target.

Police were expected to hold a news conference at 1 p.m. Saturday.

The first signs of trouble came about 11:50 a.m. Friday, when gunshots rang out in the vicinity of Kansas and Yorkshire avenues, in a quiet neighborhood near the 10 Freeway.

Jerry Cunningham-Rathner had just watched her son walk out the front door of her home a few minutes earlier when she heard the shots. She rushed outside, fearing he had been hit.

Instead, looking across the street, she saw a house engulfed in flames. A man standing in front of the house was dressed all in black, with an ammunition belt around his waist and a large rifle in his hands, she said.

“He looked like a SWAT officer,” she said.

Firefighters later found the bodies of two men inside the house. Police sources said the men were Samir Zawahri, 55, the owner of the house and the father of the alleged gunman, and one of his adult sons.

Cunningham-Rathner looked on in horror as two cars approached. She said the man pointed his weapon at the first, a Mazda hatchback, and yelled at the driver to stop. Cunningham-Rathner said he motioned for the woman driving the second car to keep moving. When she hesitated, the man opened fire on her silver Infiniti, wounding the driver slightly.

Sisk, the driver in the first car, froze, she said. She knew President Obama was in town for an event a few miles away and thought momentarily the man might be a Secret Service agent. She quickly realized that wasn’t the case.

She begged him to take the car instead. “No. You’re driving,” he said.

Before getting into the passenger’s seat next to Sisk, witnesses said, the gunman fired several shots around the neighborhood with what authorities later said was an “AR-15-style” semiautomatic rifle.

Other than telling her where to turn, the man said little during the mile drive down Pico Boulevard toward the college campus, Sisk said. He was calm, she said.

Sisk said she was crying and shaking as she drove. The gunman reassured her. “He told me to calm down,” she said. “He said he’d let me go if I didn’t do anything stupid.”

Near Cloverfield and Pico boulevards, the gunman allegedly fired at a city bus from front to back, shattering the windows. Passengers dived to the floor for cover, said Marta Fagerstroem, a student from Sweden who was on the bus and studying for an exam.

A woman sitting in the back row was grazed in the head by a bullet, witnesses said.

“It happened so fast,” said Fagerstroem, her voice quavering. “You don’t expect this.”

Sisk said that after shooting at the bus, the gunman shouted at her to “ ‘Go! Go! Go!’ So I drove, drove, drove.”

They continued toward the campus. At a school parking lot at 20th and Pearl streets, the gunman shot two in a Ford Explorer, police said. The driver died at the scene, and the passenger was badly wounded. Shortly afterward, Sisk said, the man ordered her to let him out. After he exited, she sped down the block and then got out of her car and ran.

By that time, officers from the Santa Monica Police Department and the college’s police force had received numerous 911 calls reporting the chaos.

The calls took on an even sharper edge with the president in town attending an event at the same time nearby. Federal authorities were quickly made aware of the situation.

Campus police intercepted the alleged gunman on the edge of campus and exchanged gunfire with him, authorities said. They continued to trade shots as the man ran toward the school’s library and shot a woman outside the building’s entrance before disappearing inside.

The woman outside the library later died at a hospital.

During the rampage, five people were wounded, two seriously, police said.

The library was filled with students studying for year-end exams and the gunman “accosted” several of them, Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said, as he unleashed another barrage of bullets. Hearing the shots, panicked students ran from the building or hid in rooms and under tables.

Officers confronted the man, wounding him. They carried him outside, where he died on a sidewalk.

As police and rescue crews from several agencies descended on the campus, Santa Monica Airport became an impromptu staging area for helicopters ferrying in officers and waiting in case there were injured to be evacuated.

That forced a change in plan for Obama, who was scheduled to be flown by helicopter from Santa Monica Airport to Los Angeles International for departure on Air Force One. Instead, he was driven.

The investigation into the shooting led police to an apartment building on South Centinela Avenue in Los Angeles, where the alleged shooter was believed to have lived with his mother, sources said.

Mykel Denis, who lives in the next apartment, was questioned by police Friday afternoon. He said they asked whether he knew his two neighbors. He described the woman as “pleasant” and her son as “angry.” Court records show that Zawahri, the owner of the burned house, had divorced a woman named Randa Abdou, who now lives next door to Denis.

Advertisement

“Sounds really travel in the building and he had a very distinct voice,” Denis, 46, said of the son. “It was very low and loud. He was a very angry person.”

Denis said he would often hear the man through the walls “yelling, screaming and cursing.”

A few years ago, Denis said, he witnessed a particularly hostile exchange between the mother and son. As the young man screamed at his mother and stormed past Denis, Denis said he threatened to call police, and the young man replied: “Go ahead.”

At least one gunman and possibly more burst into the party Sunday evening and opened fire with assault rifles on about 30 people who were marking the tournament win of the Cardinals baseball team, the regional prosecutor’s office said.

Prosecutors said they did not know the motive behind the massacre. But it bore grim resemblance to the 2010 killing of 15 mostly young people at a soccer party, the kind of violence once commonplace along the border.

In that event, one of the drug gangs operating in Ciudad Juarez mistook the celebrants for a rival cartel. It was a time when traffickers were fighting for control of Juarez and its lucrative smuggling passageways to the U.S., turning the border city into the deadliest in the Americas.

The killings subsided significantly last year, after the Sinaloa cartel and its allies prevailed over other gangs. Although homicides are down, other cartel-related crimes, including kidnapping and extortion, continue largely unabated.

Sunday’s slaughter, however, revived dark memories.

Bodies lay strewn outside the modest house in the Juarez suburb of Loma Blanca, suggesting some had tried to flee when the shooting started. Survivors identified the victims as a 7-year-old girl, her mother and at least one 15-year-old boy. Several seemed to be from the same family, gathered to celebrate a rare baseball victory.

“They never won, never, and then suddenly yesterday they win, 19-3, and look how this all ended up,” the sister of the slain 15-year-old, Luis Alonso Frayre Alarcon, told El Diario newspaper.

Alberto Carrillo Fuentes, named by Mexican authorities as a leader of the Juarez cartel, was captured late last month. Known by the alias “Ugly Betty,” Carrillo Fuentes was remanded to prison on weapons charges and had been considered the head of an effort to revive the cartel after its recent losses.

The bombers, he said, were “small, stunted individuals who would destroy instead of build, and think that somehow makes them important.”

For President Bill Clinton, the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995 helped him reclaim the mantle of leadership after a dispiriting period in which the Democrats were trounced in midterm elections and Mr. Clinton had seemed almost marginalized by House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

The Boston bombings could allow Mr. Obama to achieve a different goal: moving the country’s response to acts of terrorism away from the sense of national crisis that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to a narrower focus on effective law enforcement.

“Boston is not big enough to change the narrative about President Obama,” Mr. Feaver said, “but it might be big enough to change the public’s response to terrorism.”

With the loss of the gun vote, by contrast, the president does not have a clear path forward. The Senate’s rejection of even a watered-down system of background checks, experts say, all but extinguishes the chances to pass new legislation, and from here on, any significant action on gun-safety laws will be at the state level.

For Mr. Obama, the loss is especially stinging because it came after the national revulsion at the schoolhouse slaughter in Newtown raised hopes for a once-in-a-generation change. Devastated personally, the president pledged at a memorial service to use “whatever power this office holds” to turn the tide on gun regulations.

As they debated what Mr. Obama should do, administration officials said they were well aware that it would be an uphill struggle. But they believed that it was better to try and lose, than to appear cynical."

Really.","These people aren't right in the head.

These people aren't right in the head.

In the aftermath of horrible tragedies like Newtown, the government desperately wants to do something--even if that something is the wrong thing. There seems to be this notion, at least among liberals, that more laws will protect us--but as we all witnessed in Boston, that isn't necessarily the case. The government can't make us safer until it recognizes that the problem isn't the instruments of violence--but the environment of it. […] If Congress wants to stop these tragedies, then it has to address the government's own hostility to the institution of the family and organizations that can address the real problem: the human heart. As I've said before, America doesn't need gun control, it needs self-control. And a Congress that actively discourages it--through abortion, family breakdown, sexual liberalism, or religious hostility--is only compounding the problem.

The far-far-right Family Research Council is out with their own take on the Boston bombing and Newtown. As expected, it's so insane that you'd be hard pressed to even parody it. Now, I really would like everyone here to just pause for a moment and contemplate how very effed up in the head you would have to be to look at Newtown, and look at Boston, and think ""the problem here is sexual liberalism."" Or ""abortion."" And we're not even going to get into ""religious hostility,"" coming from a crowd that is very aggressively hostile to religion, if that religion is not one very specific one, and a narrow ideological sub-sect of that religion at that. ""Family breakdown"" is a lovely catch-all, yes, let's all be on the lookout for ""family breakdown."" But sexual liberalism, now that is a hum-effing-dinger. If you really think the manhunt for two or more terrorists is because people are using birth control or not hating gay people enough nowadays, you are, well, deranged.

So the Family Research Council is certain that it's not access to ""the instruments of violence"" that's the problem (a curious phrasing, but at least we've gotten an acknowledgement that yes, we are talking about ""instruments of violence"")—it's sex. It's sex, and the womenfolk, and the government telling you you can't demand your employees not take birth control.

That's Alex Jones levels of conspiracy theorizing, right there. That's being so unhinged from common sense that people want to cross to the other side of the street when they see you coming toward them. Is there any supposedly ""respectable"" conservative group left that is not just a haven for outright cultists at this point?

Sandy Hook? Call it 12,"I have had to call people outside of CT on multiple occasions since 12/14. I cringe a bit inside when I need to tell them where I am calling from.

It's not because I am ashamed of my town; far from it. The heroism shown on 12/14 was awesome, in every sense of that overused word. The teachers, the first responders, my fellow pediatricians, everyone involved—how can you not be inspired by them? They saved lives, though not enough of them.

No, I cringe because I'm not angling to elicit the ""Oh. Oh, my. I'm so sorry!"" response that identification of the location so often brings. In fact, the genuine emotion of grief and sorrow that I've received in that and other settings is heartwarming, just as it has been from commenters right here at Daily Kos. But it belongs in another setting, at another time, and like other townsfolk, I can be grateful while still wishing there were some way for the name to not invoke that kind of response, especially when I'm calling to transact some routine and mundane business and get on about it as efficiently as I can.

It's hard to tell people what to say and how to label things. It's always been one of my objections to the idea of ""framing"". Framing isn't unimportant, but in so many contexts people decide for themselves how they label things, rather than take advice from others. I can't see myself calling for it the way MaryAnn did, but I can see myself using it.

Nonetheless, MaryAnn advances an interesting thought. To call it 12/14 does depersonalize it a bit, or ""de-town"" it, if you will.

As a native New Yorker, I have always had an easier time thinking about 9/11 rather than the World Trade Center (another still-painful event that involved people I knew). That date, that set of events also involved more than just one locale, and it was a convenient shorthand to recognize the Pentagon and Flight 93 as well as the two towers. But now that Newtown gets mentioned so often, I can see the attraction of thinking of it as 12/14.

In any case, give it some thought. It's not an idea that will universally catch on, all at once. But the original 9/11 didn't catch on immediately either. And yes, I can already see that apologies are due to those born on that date (there's been at least one comment to that effect). In that regard, I'm sure my friend Markos Moulitsas, publisher of this web site and born on September 11, has his own opinion.

Here's an example from this week's Newtown Bee, the local paper. In a story about a grassroots support group called Sandy Hook Promise, it's mentioned that

""People who go through [this kind of trauma] don't even know for a long time what they need,"" Ms DeYoung said. How people change from an event like 12/14 is something that may have to be addressed down the road.

You'll hear 12/14 in town, and perhaps we'll hear it elsewhere.

Well, however you think of the idea, think on Newtown kindly. The generosity from outside has been overwhelming, but at this stage in our post-traumatic recovery, the intent is to get back to normal rather than try to remain unique. Keep that in mind when you discuss the 12/14 concept.

Of course, there's another way you can remember Newtown and 12/14, and that's to participate in the national dialogue about gun rights, gun safety and gun violence. Do it in a way that respects all sides of the issue and all points of view. That Sandy Hook Promise group I mentioned is doing the same.

Sandy Hook Promise will reach out to gun advocacy groups as they explore a position to take on gun responsibility, they said. ""You have to talk to both sides,"" Mr Makris emphasized. ""We're saying we need dialogue with people to see where is the resistance,"" he said. All subjects are open to discussion. By bringing in people with divergent viewpoints, understanding may come about. In a country of ideas and innovation, Mr Shull said, they are looking for new ideas to old problems. They see it as a positive sign that Sandy Hook Promise has attracted a diverse group of people. ""We have gun owners, and non-gun owners. We have people who belong to the NRA. There are Republicans and Democrats here,"" Mr Shull said.

Remember that the goal isn't to win an argument, it's to stop more children from being killed. If what you're saying or doing isn't furthering that aim, you're not learning from Newtown's experience and what happened on 12/14.

On the other hand, if you hear what everyone has to say, if you truly listen, and maybe learn, we will perhaps do the right thing and have the courage to act to honor those who acted with courage on 12/14.

Now, that would be something."

No motive for shootings determined yet

Security and police response draw controversy

Navy secretary orders reviews of Alexis%27 four-year naval career

The Washington Navy Yard reopened Thursday in an atmosphere of sadness for those lost in Monday's shooting spree, mystery over why it happened and controversy over the law enforcement response to it.

The FBI says Navy contractor Aaron Alexis, 34, assembled a shotgun in a men's room and killed 12 people before he was fatally shot in a gunfight with law enforcement.

FBI Director James Comey said Thursday that Alexis appeared to be moving with ""no discernible"" pattern as he rampaged through Building 197 of the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters.

""It appears to me that he was wandering the halls and hunting people to shoot,"" Comey said.

He said Alexis entered the building and went to the fourth floor, carrying a bag. He went into a bathroom and emerged with a Remington 870 shotgun. Both the barrel and stock of the weapon had been shortened.

Comey said Alexis almost immediately began blazing away on the fourth floor, before going to the third floor where he repeated his actions. The building has an atrium, but, contrary to earlier reports, he was not shooting down from upper floors into the atrium.

He said Alexis went to the lobby where he shot a security guard and took his weapon, a Beretta semiautomatic pistol. He resumed moving through the building, focusing mainly on the 3rd and 4th floors, Comey said.

When Alexis ran out of ammunition for the shotgun, he started using the Beretta. He was killed by responding officers. Comey said his motive remained unknown.

A government official with knowledge of the investigation told USA TODAY that investigators from the FBI's computer forensics team were examining a computer at the Residence Inn where Alexis stayed. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity, said investigators found undisclosed ""digital evidence.""

WUSA-TV Washington reported that security at the scene and the response by Capitol Police has raised questions.

Anthony Meely, chairman of the Fraternal Order of Police Naval District Labor Committee, says a minimum of 11 Navy police officers were supposed to be working at the Navy Yard on Monday, but only seven were at the site. Because six had to continuing manning gates, only one could immediately respond to the attack at Building 197, Meely said.

""People died because of management rights, the right to make a decision to save money,"" Meely says.

""I take our response to this tragedy and our support to law enforcement partners very seriously,"" Capitol Chief Kim Dine said in a statement. ""While I am the chief of Police, at my core I am a police officer who feels strongly about our shared commitment and responsibilities. ... I place a high priority on law enforcement agency relationships and law enforcement coordination and communication.""

Navy Secretary Ray Mabus ordered reviews of Alexis' four-year naval career to determine whether his conduct warranted his security clearance and fit-for-duty status. Mabus also ordered rapid assessments of the rules for when contractors are required to notify the Navy that they've reviewed an employee's clearance and of the Navy's broader security clearance system.

Building 197 remained off-limits Thursday, but employees elsewhere at the Navy Yard were reporting for work. Some said it was too soon for them to talk about the tragedy.

""It's a little surreal, I guess,"" Brooke Roberts, an engineer who works across the street from Building 197, told the Associated Press. ""You don't think this sort of thing can happen to you at your workplace, so you're just not prepared for it.""

Newport Police Lt. William Fitzgerald said Wednesday that officers had faxed a copy of their report to the Newport Naval Station after Alexis told them on Aug. 7 that he was being threatened by unseen people and feared that “some sort of microwave machine” was penetrating his body.

“We faxed it to them that same day, an hour after we spoke to Mr. Alexis,” Fitzgerald said. “They said they would look into it, that they would follow up on it. It was a routine thing for us to give them a heads-up.”

A Navy official in Washington said Navy security agents in Newport had reviewed the allegations and decided Alexis was not a threat to the installation or to himself. He called the notification “routine” and said security personnel apparently did not interview Alexis or revoke his security clearance.

While in Newport, Alexis contacted human resources for his employer, the Experts, multiple times to complain about hearing voices in his hotel room, company spokesman Lou Colasuonno said. Company employees thought he was referring to actual voices, Colasuonno said, and moved him to new hotels twice.

The firm also contacted police to ask about Alexis but were told the department had no information about him, Colasuonno said, even though a police report had been filed. No one from the Navy or the Pentagon contacted the Experts about Alexis, he added.

The Department of Veterans Affairs said Alexis had been treated on Aug. 23 in the emergency room at the VA Medical Center in Providence, R.I., “complaining of insomnia.” He was given “a small amount” of medicine to help him sleep and instructed to see his primary care provider. Five days later, he received a small refill from the emergency room at the VA Medical Center in Washington.

“On both occasions, Mr. Alexis was alert and oriented, and was asked by VA doctors if he was struggling with anxiety or depression, or had thoughts about harming himself or others, all of which he denied,” VA officials said in a statement.

They added that he enrolled in VA healthcare in February 2011 — after his discharge from the Navy — but “never sought an appointment from a mental health specialist.”

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel acknowledged that officials had missed many warning signs.

“When you go back in hindsight and look at all this, there were some red flags — of course there were,” Hagel said at a Pentagon news conference. “Why they didn’t get picked up, why they didn’t get incorporated into the clearance process, what he was doing — those are all legitimate questions that we’re going to be dealing with.”

Adding that “obviously something went wrong,” he announced a series of reviews into base security.

On Monday morning, six weeks after the Newport incident, Alexis appeared at the Washington Navy Yard, where he was working as a computer technician for the Experts, a contracting firm. Hidden in a bag in the trunk of his blue vehicle was a Remington 870 Express shotgun he had purchased two days earlier, federal officials said.

According to one federal law enforcement source, Alexis carved two cryptic messages into the weapon’s wooden stock: “Better Off This Way” and “My ELF” — messages that appear to be a clue into his possible motive for killing 12 people and wounding several others.

The messages were carved with a knife or some other sharp instrument, the source said. The My ELF message could have been a reference to “extremely low frequency” and could refer to his hallucinations in Newport, the source said. Or, the source said, it could mean “executable and linkable format,” a common computer coding term that Alexis would have known.

When Alexis opened fire with the shotgun, the source said, he was confronted by a Navy security officer armed with a .40-caliber Beretta semiautomatic. Alexis shot the guard, took the handgun and continued to fire at employees, the source said. The gunfire lasted more than half an hour, until police killed Alexis.

“He was a loner,” added the official, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was still underway. “Who knows what was in his mind? He told people he was crazy.”

Alexis bought the shotgun Saturday at the Sharpshooters Small Arms Range in Lorton, Va. A lawyer for the range, J. Michael Slocum, said Alexis had also tried to purchase a pistol, but store clerks refused to sell it to him because he was not a Virginia resident. Residency was not required to buy the shotgun.

In New York on Wednesday, Alexis’ mother apologized to the victims’ families as she spoke publicly for the first time since his rampage in the nation’s capital.

“I don’t know why he did what he did, and I will never be able to ask him why,” Cathleen Alexis said, reading from a statement outside her Brooklyn home. “Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone, and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims, I am so, so very sorry that this has happened. My heart is broken.”

Dressed in black and flanked by two local pastors, she did not address the question of her 34-year-old son’s mental stability. But his father, Algernon Alexis, told Seattle police in 2004 that his son suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after helping rescue people from the rubble of the World Trade Center after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001.

There has been no verification that Alexis was among the first responders. Barry Rosen, a spokesman for the Borough of Manhattan Community College, where Alexis worked from February 2001 to February 2003, said his work record “does not indicate anything at all, good or bad or otherwise,” to hint at problems.

Rosen added: “There is no indication that he was present at 9/11 and no record of him being a first responder. The college was close enough to ground zero that it provided a rest haven for first responders. But we have nothing to indicate that Alexis was involved in 9/11.”

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Washington (AP) — An Army sergeant pleaded guilty Monday to killing four other soldiers and a Navy officer in 2009 at mental health clinic in Baghdad during the Iraq War, describing how he gunned down the men and saying he was in a ""rage"" when he began his rampage.

The plea agreement in a military court at Joint Base Lewis-McChord means Sgt. John Russell will avoid the death sentence. His maximum sentence would be a life term. He testified Monday to persuade Army judge Col. David Conn to accept the agreement. Conn agreed.

Russell went on a shooting spree at the Camp Liberty Combat Stress Center near Baghdad in May 2009. It was one of the worst instances of soldier-on-soldier violence in the Iraq war.

In court, Russell said he was in a ""rage"" when he opened fire.

""I wanted the pain to stop,"" Russell testified in court at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, talking in a husky voice. He read a written statement detailing his memories of the killings.

Russell was nearing the end of his third tour when his behavior changed, members of his unit testified in 2009. They said he became more distant in the days before the May 11, 2009, attack and that he seemed paranoid that his unit was trying to end his career.

On May 8, Russell sought help at a combat stress clinic at Camp Stryker, where his unit was located. On May 10, Russell was referred to the Camp Liberty clinic, where he received counseling and prescription medication.

The following day witnesses saw Russell crying and talking about hurting himself. He went back to the Camp Liberty clinic, where a doctor told him he needed to get help or he would hurt himself. Russell tried to surrender to military police to lock him up so he wouldn't hurt himself or others, witnesses said.

Military prosecutors say Russell left the clinic and later returned with a rifle he took from his unit headquarters and began firing.

Russell said he wanted to hurt a doctor who he thought had earlier encouraged him to commit suicide. He didn't find that doctor, but still carried out the shooting.

Of the dead, Russell had interacted only with Springle, who tried to help him a couple of days before the attack.

Yates raised a gun at him after Russell killed Springle and Houseal, but Yates dropped the gun and ran.

Yates ""ran and I ran after him, and I shot him,"" Russell said.

Yates' mother, Shawna Van Blargan, joined Springle's wife and son in court. They held each other tightly as Russell talked about killing their family members.

Van Blargan cried out when Russell described killing her son. She left the courtroom.

Russell also remembered finding Barton hiding under a table. Russell shot him in the head.

Bueno-Galdos tried to grab Russell's rifle. Russell testified he shot Bueno-Galdos in the chest, then shot him once more while he lay face down on the ground.

Two evaluations presented during a 2009 hearing said Russell suffered from severe depression with psychotic features and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. A March 2011 evaluation said the major depression with psychotic features was in partial remission."
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/02/10/seagal-sheriff-train-arizonans-to-guard-schools/,2013-02-10 00:00:00,[],"Arizona sheriff, actor Steven Seagal conduct training on school safety","The self-proclaimed ""America's Toughest Sheriff"" joined forces this weekend with action movie star Steven Seagal to train volunteer armed posse members to defend Phoenix-area schools against gunmen.

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio announced the controversial plan in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting that left 27 people dead, including the gunman and 20 first-graders.

The exercise took place Saturday at a closed school site in suburban Fountain Hills, outside Phoenix, where sheriff's SWAT members acted as shooters and teenagers played the part of students during mock scenarios involving up to three gunmen.

Seagal, best known for his roles in movies such as ""Above the Law"" and ""Under Siege,"" planned to lead training on hand-to-hand defense tactics, among other techniques, drawing from his expertise in martial arts, according to a sheriff's office news release.

Arpaio's office didn't respond to requests for comment Friday and Saturday, and Seagal representatives also did not return telephone messages from The Associated Press.

When faced with criticism in January about the school posse plan, Arpaio snapped back, ""Why would people complain about my posse being in front of schools to act as prevention?""

He boldly announced the plan on the grounds of an elementary school, saying at the time he wanted the patrols publicized.

""I want everyone to know about it for the deterrence effect,"" Arpaio said, adding that no taxpayer money would be spent on the patrols and volunteers will be supervised over the radio or telephone byar about the initiative.

""A lot of people sit around and watch these things happen, watch key signs and no one wants to do anything about it,"" she said when Arpaio announced the plan. ""Nobody wants conflict, nobody wants to be out in the limelight. And he doesn't care. He wants to do the right thing.""

Andrew Sanchez, however, a town council member in Guadalupe, said he wants nothing to do with posse members patrolling schools in his community, which spends about $1.2 million annually for Maricopa County sheriff's patrols.

""We are paying him to have certified deputies here, not to bring a circus and not to use our town as a political platform,"" Sanchez has said.

The volunteers, dressed in uniforms and driving patrol vehicles, some authorized to carry guns after training, won't go onto school grounds unless they spot danger, but will instead patrol around the facilities, Arpaio said.

Seagal is already a volunteer posse member in Maricopa County and has been deputized with sheriff's offices in New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana, where a film crew followed the actor on ride-alongs with Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies for the reality TV show ""Steven Seagal: Lawman.""

Arpaio says other notable people also have joined his more than 3,000-strong volunteer armed posse, including ""The Incredible Hulk"" star Lou Ferrigno and actor Peter Lupus of TV's ""Mission: Impossible.""

, by three African American teenagers

The issue exposed by Jarrett and Henry? The fact that President Obama has not made any public statements on the murder of college baseball player Christopher Lane, who was white. (See my update below: The teenagers who murdered Lane weren't all African American.)

Why do they think this is notable? Because Obama did offer public comments after Trayvon Martin was killed, and after (in Jarrett's words) ""the black Harvard professor"" got arrested inside his home (Jarrett might not know it, but that professor—Henry Louis Gates—has a name).

In the Jarrett-Henry world, this is is hypocrisy, and it proves that President Obama is a virulent anti-white racist who secretly supports the random murder of white people—as long as the murders are committed by non-whites. Never mind the fact that Obama's mother was white, or that his comments on Gates and Jarrett came in response to questions from reporters. Clearly, Paul LePage was right: Obama hates white people.

Of course, Gates and Jarrett completely ignore the fact that when Trayvon Martin was killed, George Zimmerman—the admitted killer—wasn't arrested until weeks after the murder. Lane's murderers were arrested within 24 hours. That's exactly as should be. His murder was awful, and nothing can change that. But the justice system is working. Without the outrage following Martin's murder, Zimmerman never would have had to defend himself in a court of law.

Jarrett and Henry aren't alone; Fox has spent much of they day posing various forms of the ""where's the outrage question"" and much of the rest of the conservative media is joining in as well. But these guys don't care about Christopher Lane, or really even about what President Obama did or didn't say. As James David Dickson writes in the Detroit News:



The “where’s the outrage?” argument comes in another form: Why don’t black people protest black-on-black violence? What about all those dead kids in Chicago and Detroit? Where’s the march for them? This is an argument steeped in ignorance. If the people who make it spent even a minute researching, they’d see their premise was faulty. The reason they don’t know that people do care and do march to stop black-on-black violence is because they don’t care about black-on-black violence. They’re trying to use dead black kids in Chicago to stop you from caring about a dead black kid in Florida, when in reality they care about neither.

That's exactly right. Ultimately, this outrage is manufactured to make the Fox audience feel good about themselves when they turn their heads to injustice. It's about making sure they don't forget that they are the real victims here, because who knows what terrible things might happen to the Republican Party if one day Fox viewers woke up and lost that chip on their shoulder.

*Well, not so much truth as stupid and dishonest race-baiting propaganda.

Wow, it turns out that Fox was even worse than I thought—and that I stupidly fell for part of it. It turns out that the one of the three individuals who murdered Lane was white. So (a) my initial post got that fact wrong, for which I apologize and (b) Fox is even loopier than I originally stated.

Sign our petition demanding that Fox News correct their factual mistake, and cease the despicable race-baiting that has resulted."

HOOD, TEXAS — A military judge decided Monday to grant a request by accused Ft. Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan to represent himself at his court-martial, finding him competent to waive his right to counsel after a doctor testified that he is physically capable of handling his defense during what’s likely to be a lengthy trial.

The military judge, Col. Tara Osborn, had ordered Hasan to undergo a physical exam last week and ruled Monday after summoning the doctor who performed the exam to testify about Hasan’s health.

Hasan, 42, an Army psychiatrist, is charged with killing 13 and wounding 32 during the 2009 mass shooting at this sprawling Texas military base. If convicted, he could face a death sentence. He has been represented by military attorneys since he fired his civilian attorney two years ago, but last month asked to represent himself.

On Monday, he appeared in court wearing his uniform and a full beard, his head shaved. He remained calm throughout, taking notes and only objecting to the doctor’s report being submitted as evidence, saying “that is information between me and my physician,” but the judge overruled him.

Osborn had questioned whether Hasan was physically capable of representing himself — during the attack, he was shot by police and paralyzed from the chest down; he now uses a wheelchair and his attorneys have said he is unable to participate in the courtroom for more than five hours a day. Hasan’s previous medical exam was a year ago this month, and since then, nursing staff where he is housed at Bell County Jail have addressed his medical needs.

But the doctor who testified Monday, Maj. Prasad Lakshminarasimhiah, a rehabilitation physician based at San Antonio Military Medical Center, said Hasan has the stamina to concentrate for hours at a time, that he can sit upright for up to 12 hours a day with stretch breaks every four hours, can write with his right hand (his left hand suffered nerve damage) and do limited typing.

Lakshminarasimhiah said the only medicine Hasan takes is occasional over-the-counter painkillers and that he has suffered no recurring pain or other major complications. He said Hasan would suffer no cumulative complications from sitting for extended periods in court defending himself.

Osborn barred the doctor from discussing comments Hasan made during the exam last Thursday, saying she did not want to know why Hasan requested to defend himself, other than whether it was “a strategic decision.”

“Yes,” Hasan said. “There’s multiple factors.”

TIMELINE: Trial of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan

Three years ago, a three-person board of military medical professionals determined Hasan was competent to stand trial. The findings of the report have never been released, but Osborn referred to it Monday, saying it showed Hasan is competent to understand legal proceedings.

But she spent most of the hearing urging Hasan to retain his military counsel and not defend himself, which she said was “unwise” given his lack of legal experience -- he said he had never defended himself, even against a traffic ticket. She noted that lead military lawyer prosecuting him, Col. Michael Mulligan, has been practicing since 1987.

She questioned Hasan for about an hour.

“How are you, with no formal legal training or education, going to know what to do when the other side has that level of education?” Osborn said.

“I’m going to do the best I can do,” Hasan replied, his voice calm.

Osborn also questioned how Hasan would be able to write and type enough to defend himself. He said he had a lot of experience typing and could compensate for his injured hand.

“You would be better off with a trained lawyer who would know the rules of court-martial, the rules of evidence, the rules of law,” she said, offering Hasan the option of seeking other lawyers. He declined.

At one point, the judge asked Hasan to list the charges against him, and he faltered, conferring with his lead military attorney before responding.

“If you are convicted, you could be sentenced to what, what is the maximum punishment in this case?” Osborn said.

“Death,” Hasan murmured.

In granting Hasan’s request, Osborn stipulated that his three military attorneys remain to advise him as standby counsel, with two sitting at the defense table; a third, whom Hasan had asked not to remain as standby counsel, will be seated in the gallery.

Osborn noted that if Hasan violates the rules of the court, making statements instead of cross-examining witnesses or himself, “I will consider revoking your pro se status” -- reinstating his military attorneys.

Monday’s ruling will allow Hasan to question soldiers and civilians he allegedly shot and who have told the Los Angeles Times they dread facing him in court.

Additionally, the judge also noted that Hasan will not have access to classified information previously reviewed by his attorneys and the military prosecutors as part of discovery.

Court was due to reconvene to discuss logistics Monday afternoon. It was not immediately clear how Osborn’s decision will affect the trial schedule.

Osborn has worked to expedite the trial, which under a previous judge had stretched on with repeated delays and appeals, the latest due to Hasan’s refusal to shave his beard due to his religious beliefs as an American-born Muslim. Jury selection was scheduled to start Wednesday with testimony expected to begin in July, and officials had already added two walls of security barriers around the courthouse in preparation for the trial.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/obama-end-long-fight-over-gun-violence-research-201708897.html,,[],Can Obama end the long fight over gun violence research?,"As part of his 23 executive actions addressing gun violence, President Barack Obama announced on Wednesday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must begin researching the causes of that violence.

“We don't benefit from ignorance,” Obama said at the White House. “We don't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence.” The president also asked Congress to infuse the agency with an extra $10 million for this research, which will include studying whether violent video games and other media images have an effect on violence levels.

For those who didn't tune in to the congressional battles of the '90s, this announcement might seem odd. Why doesn't the CDC, which is dedicated to helping Americans prevent disease and injury, already study the causes and effects of firearm-related violence?

As with most highly charged political battles, it depends on which side you ask.

The CDC used to conduct extensive research into gun violence, but comments by CDC officials about the dangers of guns sparked a backlash. In 1994, A CDC official who oversaw the section of the agency that researched gun violence told the Washington Post, ""We need to revolutionize the way we look at guns, like what we did with cigarettes. Now it is dirty, deadly and banned."" Around the same time, a CDC-funded nonprofit published a pamphlet encouraging people concerned about gun violence to “organize a picket at gun manufacturing sites” and write to their local politicians about gun control.

By 1996, outraged House Republicans had had enough: They led the effort to defund the part of the CDC that researched gun violence, and added a special rule preventing the agency from engaging in any activity that promoted gun control.

After the defunding, the CDC's spending on gun research dropped from a few million dollars a year in the 1990s to zero dollars today, and a larger message was sent to agencies that wading into gun research or data collection could lead to trouble with Congress. Separate federal actions limited other agencies' ability to collect data on gun ownership.

Story continues

Over the years, pro-gun advocates and some social science researchers have contended that public health researchers who worked for or were funded by the CDC had a clear anti-gun agenda that led to sub-par and politically motivated research. That bias has not changed even though the CDC funding has dried up, they say.

""The ideology of the medical/public health researchers has not changed, and the quality of their research has not improved,"" says Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. Kleck contends that his research on gun ownership and violence, which is often cited by the pro-gun rights side, is ignored by public health gun researchers.

In the public health research world, however, there's a near consensus that a gun lobby-backed campaign against the CDC has purposely suppressed research on the subject for political reasons, a setback that has left the field decades behind. Published academic research on firearm violence fell 60 percent between 1996 and 2010, according to a report by the pro-gun control group Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Justice Department's research arm all completely stopped or dramatically reduced their funding for gun-related research over the same period.

Researchers, many of whom depend upon federal grants, moved to other topics or reduced their firearms-related output.

""It's been very hard for people on soft money like myself to get funding for a lot of research,"" says David Hemenway, director of Harvard University's Injury Control Research Center. (""Soft money"" means researchers are responsible for raising their own funds.)

Larry Cohen, founder of the nonprofit Prevention Group and a leader in the movement to define violence as a preventable public health issue, says the defunding of the CDC had a ""chilling impact"" on research in the gun violence field. After the defunding, ""for the most part the research went away, so it had its desired effect,"" he says.

Questions including the safest way to store weapons in the home and whether firearm safety classes work have not been addressed, public health researchers say. ""We're nearly 20 years behind in our ability to really ask these kinds of important questions,"" said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.

It's unclear how much of an effect the president's announcement will have on the field, however. A spokeswoman from the CDC said the agency will not begin doling out gun research funds until financial year 2014. Without the additional funds from Congress, it's unclear how much the CDC would be able to give out. If Congress complies with Obama's request to hand over $10 million for gun violence research, however, a bigger impact could be made.

""It would be a very needed breath of fresh air for Congress to allow the CDC to study this issue,"" Cohen says. The move may also remove a climate of fear around the research, public health researchers hope.

But those who pushed for the defunding in the 1990s worry the CDC could now push for more restrictions on guns through their research. ""I'm concerned that if President Obama's recommendation to restore funding to the CDC is implemented that we are going to see once again the same thing that we saw back in the 1990s,"" says Dr. Tim Wheeler, a retired physician and the head of Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership. ""We're going to see a very powerful and very prominent federal agency using tax money to advocate for gun control and generating these pseudo-scientific studies to back it up.""

Many public health researchers do believe gun ownership can be a health hazard, especially when it comes to suicide. Cohen says he hopes the surgeon general will release a report on suicides and firearms.

A National Academy of Sciences review of gun-related research in 2004 found that higher gun-ownership rates are associated with higher suicide rates. The report did not find evidence that right-to-carry laws lead to either an increase or decrease in violent crime.

The report also noted that researchers are hog-tied by a lack of good data on firearms collected by the government, including data on gun ownership. Without this data, it's hard for researchers to make strides, even with federal funds."

A week of protest outside the White House, pressure building on him inside the White House pushed him to that podium. So I'm glad he finally arrived.

But when he left the podium, he still had not answered the most important question, that King-ian question, where do we go from here?

The statement noted the “limited” nature of federal civil rights laws, which typically involve acts by public officials, such as police officers. A 2009 federal law, the Matthew Shepard Act, allows prosecution in some cases of people who commit crimes of violence that are motivated by bias, which could include a victim’s race. But the law carries a high burden for proving intentional discrimination.

Last year, administration officials first announced the federal investigation of the case, which is being conducted by the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, the U.S. Attorney’s office for the middle district of Florida, and the FBI. Officials continue to review evidence generated from their investigation into the death of the Florida teen and are expected to evaluate evidence presented at the trial in state court.

“Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department’s policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,” the Justice Department said.

Earlier in the day, President Obama said in a statement that the February 2012 death of Martin, 17, was a tragedy for the nation, but that “a jury has spoken.”

He called on Americans to reflect on whether “we’re doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.”

Some members of Congress and the NAACP have called for the Justice Department to pursue a civil rights case against Zimmerman.

“We hope that once everything has happened that can happen here in Florida … that DOJ will act and will hold Mr. Zimmerman accountable for what he has done,” Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP, told CBS Sunday. “What you have to do there is show that race was a factor in his decision-making. And there seems to be plenty of evidence that suggest that race may have been a factor.”

“There’s a precedent here that I think is very dangerous, that not only did the jury find Zimmerman innocent, even of lesser charges, but, you also validated the stand-your-ground kind of laws that are in other states,” Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), a leader of the House Progressive Caucus, told CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“Clearly there are grounds for civil rights charges here,” the Rev. Al Sharpton said on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “We always said there would be a Plan B.”

The summary report, issued by Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice and lead investigator, State Attorney Stephen Sedensky III, states that Lanza shot and killed the principal and school psychologist as they responded to calls of a man with a gun in the school.

""The shooter then went into the main office, apparently did not see the staff who were hiding there, and returned to the hallway,"" the report states.

The report continues:

""After leaving the main office, the shooter then went down the same hallway in which he had just killed two people and entered first grade classrooms 8 and 10, the order in which is unknown. While in those rooms he killed the two adults in each room, fifteen children in classroom 8 and five in classroom 10. All of the killings were done with the Bushmaster rifle. He then took his own life with a single shot from a Glock 20, 10 mm pistol in classroom 10.""

The report does not establish a conclusive motive for the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting that left 20 children, six school staff members and the gunman dead. It does, however, highlight Lanza's ""preoccupation with mass shootings, in particular the Columbine shootings, and a strong interest in firearms.""

Items found within digital evidence seized from Lanza's possessions include:

Bookmarks pertaining to firearms, military, politics, mass murder, video games, music, books, Army Ranger, computers and programs, ammunition, candy, economic books

Two videos showing suicide by gunshot

Commercial movies depicting mass shootings

The computer game titled “School Shooting” where the player controls a character who enters a school and shoots at students

Images of the shooter holding a handgun to his head

Images of the shooter holding a rifle to his head

Five-second video (dramatization) depicting children being shot

A spreadsheet listing mass murders by name and information about the incident

Materials regarding the topic of pedophilia and advocating for rights for pedophiles (not child pornography)

Large amount of materials relating to Columbine shootings and documents on mass murders

The report also states that authorities recovered a New York Times article from February 18, 2008, regarding the school shooting at Northern Illinois University and photocopied newspaper articles from 1891 pertaining to the shooting of school children.

Authorities found Lanza ""dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,"" according to the report. He was wearing nearly all black and had a yellow earplug in each ear.

Monday's release is only a partial collection of evidence contained in a several thousand-page file belonging to the Connecticut State Police, according to the Associated Press. Sendensky wouldn't say why the full evidence file is being withheld from the public. Previously, police have cited consideration for victims' families and the sheer size of the investigation as reasons for keeping the file private.

Critics say that withholding information demonstrates the secrecy of the state's investigation.

""What I found troubling about the approach of the state's attorney is that from my perspective, [Sedensky] seems to have forgotten his job is to represent the state of Connecticut,"" Dan Klau, a Hartford attroney, told the AP. ""His conduct in many instances has seemed more akin to an attorney in private practice representing Sandy Hook families.""

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated the date of the Sandy Hook shooting as December 12. This has been corrected to reflect that the shooting was in fact on December 14, 2012."

A little more than a week after performing with the King College Prep band in Washington during President Barack Obama's inauguration festivities, Hadiya was fatally shot Tuesday afternoon in a park about a mile north of Obama's Kenwood home. Two other teens were wounded.

At a White House press briefing Wednesday, Obama spokesman Jay Carney was asked about Hadiya's death. ""It's a terrible tragedy any time a young person is struck down with so much of their life ahead of them, and we see it far too often,"" he said.

Hadiya's slaying also came up in an interview Obama did with Telemundo. The president was asked whether the example of Chicago, with strict gun control laws, gave credence to the National Rifle Association's position that more gun laws don't necessary mean less gun violence.

""Well, the problem is that a huge proportion of those guns come in from outside Chicago,"" Obama said. The president said it was true that creating a ""bunch of pockets of gun laws"" without a unified, integrated system of background checks makes it harder for a single community to protect itself from gun violence.

Police announced an $11,000 reward for information leading to the killer's capture and conviction during a Wednesday afternoon news conference at the North Kenwood park where Hadiya was shot.

""I want this closed now,"" said police Supt. Garry McCarthy, who was among the police chiefs in Washington on Monday to meet with Obama on gun control. ""I don't want to wait.""

Hadiya was the 42nd homicide victim this year in Chicago, where killings last year climbed above 500. Mayor Rahm Emanuel spoke with Hadiya's mother Wednesday morning and later, at an unrelated news conference, said the teenager represented ""what is best in our city.""

""A child going to school, who takes a final exam, who had just been to inaugural,"" said Emanuel, looking down at the podium for several seconds to collect himself before continuing. ""And I think if anybody has any information, you are not a snitch, you're a citizen. You're a good citizen in good standing if you help.""

Hadiya's father, Nathaniel Pendleton, pleaded for someone to step forward and bring the 15-year-old's killer to justice.

""She was destined for great things,"" he said.

Hadiya was a majorette with the band at King, one of the city's elite selective-enrollment schools. She dreamed of going to Northwestern University and talked about becoming a pharmacist or a journalist, maybe a lawyer.

She had just finished her final exams at King, where she was a sophomore, and was hanging out with friends from the school's volleyball team Tuesday afternoon in a park in the 4400 block of South Oakenwald Avenue. The group sought shelter from a rainstorm under a canopy at the park about 2:20 p.m. when a gunman jumped a fence, ran toward them and opened fire, police said.

As the teens scattered, Hadiya and two teenage boys were shot. Hadiya was hit in the back and pronounced dead at Comer Children's Hospital less than an hour after the shooting. The wounds suffered by the boys were not life-threatening.

McCarthy stressed that neither Hadiya nor anyone in the group she was with were involved with gangs. But it appears the gunman mistook the students for members of a rival gang, he said.

""This guy, whoever he was, the gunman … you took the light of my life,"" Hadiya's father said. ""Just look at yourself and just know that you took a bright person, an innocent person, a non-violent person.""

No bullet casings were found by investigators at the crime scene, leading them to believe that Hadiya may have been shot with a revolver, according to McCarthy. While it took a while to gather witnesses, McCarthy said police were making ""a lot of progress.""

At King on Wednesday, classmates created a memorial at Hadiya's locker with pictures, teddy bears and balloons, said Jayla Rufus, 16, a junior who also traveled to D.C. with the King band. ""A lot of people are saying, 'Why Hadiya? Why did it have to be her?'"" Rufus said.

During the band's three-day trip to Washington, the students visited the Washington Monument and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, Rufus said. Hadiya and the majorettes performed with the band in the Presidential Inauguration Heritage Festival.

The school won multiple awards while at the competition, including a first place honor for the band's auxiliary team that included the majorettes, according to Benjamin Washington, the school's director of bands.

Washington said Hadiya was a dedicated and enthusiastic member of the squad. She competed with nearly 100 students during her freshman year to land one of 12 spots.

""She was one of our bright, shining stars,"" Washington said. ""She had a very outgoing personality, always eager to perform.""

King's principal, Shontae Higginbottom, said Hadiya was ""a wonderful student.""

""She was well-loved by her friends, well-adored by her teachers,"" Higginbottom said. ""We are going to miss her. Our hearts are so heavy.""

Relatives of the girl said she was in an anti-gang violence video while she was attending the Carter G. Woodson Elementary School.

""So many children are out there in gangs and it is your job as students to say no to gangs and yes to a great future,"" Hadiya says in the 54-second clip."

Convicted killer Todd Ashker and three other inmates — representing the Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia and the Black Guerrilla Family — called for a mass hunger strike July 8, largely to protest indefinite incarceration in solitary confinement.

More than 30,000 prisoners answered.

Though segregated from others, the leaders, who dub themselves the Short Corridor Collective, have kept the protest going, with more than 600 inmates still refusing food.

Among the four, Ashker is the most outspoken of the collective and the legal brains behind the strike.

Some prisoner-rights advocates describe the intense and sometimes volatile man as a brilliant champion for California’s 130,000 prisoners.

Armed with a prison law library and a paralegal degree earned behind bars, Ashker, 50, has filed or been party to 55 federal lawsuits against the California prison system since 1987, winning the right for inmates to order books and collect interest on prison savings accounts.

“There’s an element within [the Department of Corrections] who would celebrate some of our deaths with a party,” Ashker wrote to The Times in March after prison officials denied access to him.

But others say Ashker is a danger, accusing him of being an Aryan Brotherhood member bent on freeing gang leaders from solitary confinement so they can regain their grip on the prison system.

“We’re talking about somebody who is very, very dangerous … who has killed somebody in a pre-meditated way,” said Philip Cozens, Ashker’s court-appointed defense lawyer in a 1990 murder trial.

Terri McDonald, who ran California’s 33 prisons until a few months ago and now runs the Los Angeles County jail system, said Ashker and his compatriots in the Short Corridor Collective are not fighting for rights, but power.

“From my perspective, they are terrorists,” she said.

Ashker has spent nearly all his adult life in California’s prison system — and much of that time, he has been in solitary confinement.

Born outside Denver, he wound up in Northern California after his father ran afoul of the law. Lewis Ashker is serving a life sentence in South Dakota for the 1985 murder of a retired police officer during a botched attempt to steal the man’s gun collection.

Advertisement

Ashker’s mother remarried and moved away in the late 1970s, leaving her son with a friend in Contra Costa County, according to his parole transcripts.

Ashker was 13 when he threatened another student to get his lunch money. It was the first of a long series of transgressions — among them truancy, DUI and burglary — that put him in juvenile halls and boys ranches for most of his youth.

Advertisement

Ashker ascended to state prison in 1982 at age 19 after being convicted of burglary. Five years later, housed at New Folsom State Prison near Sacramento for a second burglary, he stabbed another inmate 17 times.

According to testimony at his murder trial and a subsequent parole hearing, Ashker attacked the Aryan Brotherhood gang member while another inmate held a mattress over the door to block the guards’ view. Prosecutors said the killing was a hit ordered by the white supremacist gang. Ashker contended he was acting in self-defense.

During the trial, a defense witness — another prisoner and member of the Aryan Brotherhood — pulled an 8-inch shank and stabbed Ashker’s attorney four times.

Cozens, the attorney, believes the attack was an attempt to provoke a mistrial. The judge ordered the wounded lawyer to finish the case. Ashker drew a 21-years-to-life sentence for second-degree murder.

In the 1980s, the Department of Corrections started building high-security prisons with isolation blocks called “security housing units” — known by inmates as the SHU, pronounced “shoe.” California now has four SHU prisons, holding more than 4,500 men whom the state calls “the worst of the worst.”

The toughest facility was built at Pelican Bay State Prison near the Oregon border. Ashker arrived there in 1990.

Advertisement

The Pelican Bay SHU is divided into pods of eight cells stacked four-wide and two-high, facing a blank wall. There are no bars. Each steel door is perforated to let in air and light.

Once a day, that door slides open. The prisoner can enter an empty concrete “dog run” for 90 minutes to exercise.

Kept indoors for years, men in the SHU take on a ghostly pallor, as if dusted with flour. They get less canteen food than do other inmates, less clothing, and are allowed limited belongings, fewer visits and no phone calls. Every privilege, from mail to medical care, is rationed.

For those accused of gang involvement, the SHU is an indefinite sentence. More than 400 have been inside Pelican Bay’s SHU for more than a decade; 78, including Ashker, have been held there for more than two decades.

Advertisement

They have common complaints of anger, anxiety, depression, insomnia, inability to concentrate and loss of a sense of time, according to report by a psychiatrist retained by civil rights lawyers challenging the use of long-term solitary confinement.

“Conditions in the SHU may well hover on the edge of what is humanly tolerable,” U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson wrote in1995.

Advertisement

An air of brutality hangs over the SHU. Present on a recent visit was a drawing on guard lockers of a large and bloody Homer Simpson clad in the uniform of an officer. The grinning figure held a dripping knife in his meaty fist.

Some of those working with Ashker say that within this harsh environment he has changed, leaving behind violence to become an activist for inmate rights.

Prison officials “are so stuck in the gang business they can’t think people have evolved,” said Anne Weills, a former Black Panther activist who represents Ashker and other Pelican Bay inmates in a federal lawsuit tied to the hunger strike, alleging that long-term isolation is torture.

Prison officials reject the idea of Ashker’s change.

The top prison gang leaders of California are held together in one wing of Pelican Bay, called the Short Corridor, on the theory that it is easier to control them in one place, corrections officials said.

Advertisement

As a result, the leaders of the strike have shared adjacent cells.

In addition to Ashker, the collective includes Antonio “Chuco” Guillen, described in court papers last week as a top general of Nuestra Familia, and Arturo “Tablas” Castellanos, a Mexican Mafia leader. California corrections officials say the fourth is Ron Dewberry, a member of the militant Black Guerrilla Family who calls himself Sitawa Nantambu Jamaa.

Ashker, in a message to The Times, described the group as “a collective effort initiated by a multiracial group of long-term, similarly situated (SHU) prisoners who decided enough is enough.”

Advertisement

In August 2012, the collective issued a two-page “agreement to end hostilities” between racial groups in the prisons, focusing inmates against a common enemy — the Corrections Department — and “informers, snitches, rats and obstructionists.”

“We can no longer allow CDCR to use us against each other for their benefit!!” the agreement said.

The isolation of Pelican Bay helps break down racial and ethnic barriers, said Denis O’Hearn, a sociology professor at Binghamton University in New York who had Ashker and other Pelican Bay inmates correspond with students in his classes.

“It created some idea where [the prison system] is ‘them,’ and we as prisoners are ‘us,’ ” he said.

Advertisement

In 2009, O’Hearn sent Ashker a copy of his book on the prison hunger strike of Irish Republican Army member Bobby Sands, who died after 66 days of his fast. The book made the rounds of the Short Corridor.

After a group of Ohio inmates staged their own hunger strike in early 2011, Ashker said, the idea of a California protest was launched and “spread via the grapevine.”

Advertisement

Inside the SHU, the grapevine typically means communicating cell-to-cell by “fishing,” slinging a note to the cell next door with thread or shouting into the drain pipes that run beneath the prison and connect the pods.

The hunger strikers also relied on prison activists and lawyers who could carry messages to the outside.

Advertisement

For months leading up to the hunger strike, prisoner-rights organizations reprinted strike leaders’ writings in newsletters and mailed the publications to inmates across California.

Two hunger strikes staged by the Short Corridor Collective in 2011 ended after three weeks. Ashker vowed that this one would be different.

Advertisement

“We’re at war,” he wrote in a 2012 letter published by a prisoner advocacy group, “and the people in power are scared to death, and they should be.”

Since the protests began, Ashker and the other leaders have been put into even deeper isolation at Pelican Bay.

Sandy Hook? Call it 12,"I have had to call people outside of CT on multiple occasions since 12/14. I cringe a bit inside when I need to tell them where I am calling from.

It's not because I am ashamed of my town; far from it. The heroism shown on 12/14 was awesome, in every sense of that overused word. The teachers, the first responders, my fellow pediatricians, everyone involved—how can you not be inspired by them? They saved lives, though not enough of them.

No, I cringe because I'm not angling to elicit the ""Oh. Oh, my. I'm so sorry!"" response that identification of the location so often brings. In fact, the genuine emotion of grief and sorrow that I've received in that and other settings is heartwarming, just as it has been from commenters right here at Daily Kos. But it belongs in another setting, at another time, and like other townsfolk, I can be grateful while still wishing there were some way for the name to not invoke that kind of response, especially when I'm calling to transact some routine and mundane business and get on about it as efficiently as I can.

It's hard to tell people what to say and how to label things. It's always been one of my objections to the idea of ""framing"". Framing isn't unimportant, but in so many contexts people decide for themselves how they label things, rather than take advice from others. I can't see myself calling for it the way MaryAnn did, but I can see myself using it.

Nonetheless, MaryAnn advances an interesting thought. To call it 12/14 does depersonalize it a bit, or ""de-town"" it, if you will.

As a native New Yorker, I have always had an easier time thinking about 9/11 rather than the World Trade Center (another still-painful event that involved people I knew). That date, that set of events also involved more than just one locale, and it was a convenient shorthand to recognize the Pentagon and Flight 93 as well as the two towers. But now that Newtown gets mentioned so often, I can see the attraction of thinking of it as 12/14.

In any case, give it some thought. It's not an idea that will universally catch on, all at once. But the original 9/11 didn't catch on immediately either. And yes, I can already see that apologies are due to those born on that date (there's been at least one comment to that effect). In that regard, I'm sure my friend Markos Moulitsas, publisher of this web site and born on September 11, has his own opinion.

Here's an example from this week's Newtown Bee, the local paper. In a story about a grassroots support group called Sandy Hook Promise, it's mentioned that

""People who go through [this kind of trauma] don't even know for a long time what they need,"" Ms DeYoung said. How people change from an event like 12/14 is something that may have to be addressed down the road.

You'll hear 12/14 in town, and perhaps we'll hear it elsewhere.

Well, however you think of the idea, think on Newtown kindly. The generosity from outside has been overwhelming, but at this stage in our post-traumatic recovery, the intent is to get back to normal rather than try to remain unique. Keep that in mind when you discuss the 12/14 concept.

Of course, there's another way you can remember Newtown and 12/14, and that's to participate in the national dialogue about gun rights, gun safety and gun violence. Do it in a way that respects all sides of the issue and all points of view. That Sandy Hook Promise group I mentioned is doing the same.

Sandy Hook Promise will reach out to gun advocacy groups as they explore a position to take on gun responsibility, they said. ""You have to talk to both sides,"" Mr Makris emphasized. ""We're saying we need dialogue with people to see where is the resistance,"" he said. All subjects are open to discussion. By bringing in people with divergent viewpoints, understanding may come about. In a country of ideas and innovation, Mr Shull said, they are looking for new ideas to old problems. They see it as a positive sign that Sandy Hook Promise has attracted a diverse group of people. ""We have gun owners, and non-gun owners. We have people who belong to the NRA. There are Republicans and Democrats here,"" Mr Shull said.

Remember that the goal isn't to win an argument, it's to stop more children from being killed. If what you're saying or doing isn't furthering that aim, you're not learning from Newtown's experience and what happened on 12/14.

On the other hand, if you hear what everyone has to say, if you truly listen, and maybe learn, we will perhaps do the right thing and have the courage to act to honor those who acted with courage on 12/14.

Now, that would be something."

It's only relevance is that according to her, George was capable of hiding every aspect of his secret advances on her using charm and a pleasant demeanor to make her dad feel that George was the ""son he never had"".

Many have pondered that her father may have been the uncle who testified that as soon as he heard the Lauer 9-11 call ""I knew it was Georgie.""

As result of George's close relationship with he dad, she knew they'd never believe it if she ever told them. But eventually she did tell them and there was a confrontation with George where he didn't exactly admit to everything - he did however say them ""I'm Sorry"" and then left. (This is included in the audio provided at Huffington Post)

Add to this the fact that we know George is an expert at deception as we saw him and his wife lie to the court about his ability to pay bail without showing a trace of deception.

Getting back to the racism charges it appear that Witness #9 was not alone in bringing this point up. George's ex-fiance confirmed these allegations about George's Mother.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...



At family gatherings, she said, much of the conversation centered around ""financial status and material things."" Zimmerman's mother would often talk about ""marrying into white families in order to improve one's status."" But the woman said Zimmerman never got along with his mother and that the women in his family ""exercised a lot of control over"" him. At one point, the woman told investigators, after she'd gotten into a particularly heated argument with his mother, Zimmerman retaliated by turning off the electricity to his mother's house. ""[Zimmerman] locked the electrical box and departed leaving his mother without electricity,"" according to the report. ...

Zimmerman was estranged from his mother and other members of his family, according to the report. His mother was ""very strict and dominant"" the friend told investigators. ""His father did not discipline and did not stick up for the kids as they were abused by their mother.""

""Zimmerman began to exhibit overly protective and territorial behavior,"" she said. At one point he agreed to go to counseling, and did so each week for a year. Then one day as the two were driving back from a session, she said he hit her in the mouth because she was chewing gum. In a later incident that occurred after the pair had separated, the woman said that Zimmerman became physically aggressive after she refused to let him stay the night at her apartment. The two began pushing each other and at one point he pushed her to the bed, according to earlier reports. The next day she filed an injunction against him. In retrospect, the woman told FBI agents, Zimmerman's relationship with his family, and his mother in particular, was the source of a lot of his torment.

Previously, Zimmerman Sr. “believed generally racism was a thing of the past.” He says that, personally, he hadn’t encountered much racism , even though his wife is Hispanic. But after his son shot and killed Trayvon Martin, however, Zimmerman learned that racism is “flourishing at the insistence of some in the African American Community.” He then goes on to list various black leaders and organizations that he believes are racist: Congressional Black Caucus. “[A] pathetic, self-serving group of racists… advancing their purely racist agenda.” He later adds that “all members of Congress should be ashamed of the Congressional Black Caucus, as should be their constituents.” And finally: “ They are truly a disgrace to all Americans. ” The NAACP “[S]imply promotes racism and hatred for their own, primarily finical, interests” and “without prejudice and racial divide, the NAACP would simply cease to exist.” NAACP President Benjamin Jealous. “[W]hat I would expect of a racist.” Trayvon Martin’s funeral director. A “racial activist and former head of the local NAACP.” Benjamin Crump, Natialie Jackson and Darrly Parks, attorneys for Travyon Martin’s family. “The scheme team.” The National Basketball Players Association. Black Chamber of Commerce. National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers. National Black United Fund. United Negro College Fund.

So it's not just one person saying this, it's two. Now this doesn't necessarily mean that George himself is a bigot, because it appears he and his mother - have been estranged for some time according to his ex-fiance and family friends.So we have a fairly dysfunctional arrangement here. One which may have been part of what led to the physical violence between George and his ex.Going beyond George's mom we have his dad who claims ""he never thought of race"" until the trial and now all of sudden he can see nothing but Racism Coming from Black People. So, we're supposed to believe, despite the several witnesses who talked to prosecutors (meaning if they were lying, they're potentially subject tojust as so many claim Rachel Jeantel was for lying about why she didn't go to Trayvon's funeral) that two different witnesses independently confirm that his, but that somehow he ""hasn't been exposed to much racism""?

He's married to Racism. That Racism raised his kids.

And then, and then, we're supposed to believe he came to this view that ""All the Racists are Black"" just suddenly? Just now? If this is such a brand new idea to him, how did he muster up enough thoughts about it to Publish His Own E-Book on the subject?

Florida v. Zimmerman: Uncovering the Malicious Prosecution of my Son, George

And then you have Robert Zimmerman Jr. whose comments seem to eerily echo those of his father when it comes to accusing black people of being ""Race Hustlers"" in the direct aftermath of the verdict.

http://youtu.be/...





Robert Zimmerman Jr at 5:51: These people who I think exploited very pure grief, and other Race Profiteers like the NAACP, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton - I wouldn't give them a hug, but I would give [Sybrina Fulton & Tracy Martin] a hug.

Zimmerman, according to the witness, targeted him because he was Middle Eastern. He repeatedly called the man a “fucking moron” and mocked him using the voice of “Achmed the terrorist.” Zimmerman’s stories about the man would involve “bombing,” “I’ll kill your family” and other “jokes” about “Middle Eastern stuff.” According to the man, this went on “for days and days.”

The one indicator that we have that George himself may not have assimilated these types of attitudes as expoused by his mother, father and now brother is the fact that one witness who talked to prosecutors about George included a co-worker of his who said George relentlessly and mercilessly taunted him Racially for days and days

There's also another interesting tidbit about George's habits.



After a few months, Zimmerman was terminated. According to the witness, “he was fired for calling HR hotline so many times…he would complain about each and every manager and employee.”

Just like he would call the police non-emergency line -- to complain about the ""those assholes"" and ""punks"" who always managed to be Black Kids , in his neighborhood.

Conclusive evidence of Racism on his part in the killing of Trayvon Martin? Possibly not enough for a Civil Rights Conviction, but if Trayvon can be Convicted In Death for being a ""Thug"" on the basis of some smack-talking text messages and a fight video (where he seems to be breaking up the fight at the end) it does seem to be a good place to start an Civil Rights investigation and begin to dig deeper into George's Life.

The DOJ Has established a Tip Line for those with information on possible Civil Rights Violations by George Zimmerman, so in the end, they don't seem to be limiting themselves just to this case.



http://www.orlandosentinel.com/...



The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday afternoon appealed to civil rights groups and community leaders, nationally and in Sanford, for help investigating whether a federal criminal case might be brought against George Zimmerman for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, one advocate said.

The DOJ has also set up a public email address to take in tips on its civil rights investigation. “They were calling on us to actively refer anyone who had any information,” that might build a case against Zimmerman for either a civil rights violation or a hate crime, Arnwine said. “They said they would very aggressively investigate this case.” Arnwine said the call was convened at about 3:30 p.m. by Tom Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice, and included representatives from the FBI, and several federal prosecutors, she said. DOJ officials also said they would open a public email address so people could send in tips on the case. That email address, which is now in operation, is Sanford.florida@usdoj.gov

I don't believe this is guilt by association, it's an examination of the environment George was raised in. It's possible that part of George's estrangement with his mother is because he differs with her on this issue. That does seem to be the source of his tension with is ex-fiance, who as I understand it was a Latina, someone who Glady's wouldn't have approved of. Still, it may be telling the George ultimately married a White GIrl, so mother ideas may have had some influence or they may not. What strikes me most is, as with many families with racists streaks, they've learned to hide it well. That may be true of George too, as he apparently his advances on his cousin quite well. This isn't conclusive, but it probably worth investigating as the DOJ is now with their tip line.

Many families have both secrets, and lies.

If you can I really suggest you listen to the interviews by Witness #9 (the Cousin) and Witness #22 (the ex-coworker), but of them describe a George Zimmerman of many sides and many faces. One who was cold and predatory with them, but congenial and gregarious with others, ingratiating himself with them and disguising his other ""face"" so well that Witness #22 said..



When confronted by the Managers he was so smooth and self-assured, I almost doubted myself. ""Did I get this guy wrong?""

That's one twistedright there. Very likely this is the George we saw in the police interviews and walk-thru, a practiced, accomplished, sociopathic Liar. When you add in George's history of domestic violence and attacking an undercover cop , and then lying about to get off, ""I didn't hear him say he was a Cop""- although the Officer said that George told him """" when he identified himself, and his History of ""Snapping"" and throwing a woman against a wall , when he was a bouncer - if the DOJ brings all cards in the deck, this could be a humdinger.

Zimmerman, cleared late Saturday by a Florida jury of six women in the shooting death of the unarmed Martin, still faces public outrage, a possible civil suit and demands for a federal investigation.

In Washington, the U.S. Justice Department said it was evaluating whether it has enough evidence to support prosecution of Zimmerman in federal court after his acquittal in Florida.

Civil rights activists have been pressuring the Obama administration to bring civil rights charges in federal court.

Critics contend Zimmerman wrongly suspected 17-year-old Martin of being a criminal because he was black, making it a civil rights issue. At a rally in New York’s Union Square, more than 200 protesters turned out Sunday, chanting “No justice, no peace.” Some held signs calling for “Justice for Trayvon, Jail for Zimmerman.”

Similar rallies were held or expected to start later in other cities including Boston, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento.

Obama, who once said, “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” called for a peaceful response to a case that polarized the U.S. public from the beginning, raising issues of racial profiling and gun control.

“We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,” the first black U.S. president said in a statement. “I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.”

The jurors who deliberated for 16 hours over two days found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. If found guilty of the most serious charge, Zimmerman could have faced life in prison.

Zimmerman’s lawyers argued he acted in self-defense the night of February 26, 2012, when he and Martin met inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford. They accuse civil rights advocates of wrongly injecting the issue of race.

“It was such a shame. The whole case nearly destroyed George from Day One ... . That they put a racism spin on this prosecution just hurt him very deeply,” said John Donnelly, a close friend of Zimmerman who testified in the trial.

In Sanford at the largely black Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, pastor Valarie Houston dedicated a Sunday morning prayer service to Martin.

“I am hurt. I am sad. I am disappointed and my heart is overwhelmed with pains,” Houston said. “I thought in my heart that justice would be served.”

Civil rights leaders including Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Benjamin Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), urged the Justice Department to pursue federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

Jealous said Martin’s family may bring a civil suit against Zimmerman but said federal criminal charges should be filed because evidence suggests race was a factor in the case.

A Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday it would determine whether “the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction.”

‘WE DON’T GET JUSTICE’

The jurors, who were sequestered during the three weeks of testimony and remained anonymous by court order, have declined to speak with reporters since handing down the verdict in one of the highest-profile trials of the year.

Zimmerman, who showed little reaction when the decision was read, was unshackled from a monitoring device he had been wearing while on bail. He previously only left home in a disguise and body armor, his lawyer said.

His brother said he would remain out of public view for some time, but friends said the former neighborhood watch volunteer had recently spoken about the possibility of entering law school.

The tense drama that climaxed with the verdict had been building for more than a year, since police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman for shooting Martin, whose gray hooded sweatshirt has become a symbol of injustice for many.

Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, spotted Martin from his car and called police, believing Martin to be suspicious. The teenager, who was staying in the neighborhood at the home of his father’s fiancee, was walking back from a convenience store where he had bought candy and a soft drink.

Minutes later, after Zimmerman got out of his car, the two engaged in a fight that left Zimmerman with a bloody nose and head injuries. The encounter ended when Zimmerman shot Martin once through the heart with a 9mm pistol.

Prosecutors had to prove that Zimmerman committed a crime in pursuing and killing Martin and that he did not act in self-defense, a bar they failed to clear with jurors.

The acquittal will weaken any wrongful death civil lawsuit that Martin’s family might bring. Zimmerman’s lead defense lawyer, Mark O’Mara, predicted Zimmerman would seek and win immunity from a civil suit.

Around Sanford, some residents expressed relief at the verdict, while others said they failed to see how Zimmerman could have been acquitted.

“You said he’s not guilty, but why would you say he’s not guilty?” said 28-year-old Robyn Miller. “It’s crazy.”

At rallies in Boston and New York, several hundred demonstrators expressed a similar sense of frustration. “I feel we don’t get justice when it’s needed,” said Kabrina Oliver, 18, a Boston high school student."

http://news.yahoo.com/ark-governor-didnt-know-fugitives-health-231713310.html,,[],Ark. governor didn't know about fugitive's health,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe on Wednesday defended his request to have a 63-year-old fugitive returned from Michigan, even though the convicted killer is in poor health.

Beebe told The Associated Press he wasn't aware of Lester Stiggers' health issues when he sought to have him brought back to the Arkansas prison system he fled in 1970.

""We can't pick and choose which laws that we like and which laws that we don't like,"" Beebe told the AP. ""And once the Department of Correction was given information about his whereabouts, and ... they requested me to sign an extradition warrant, then that's my duty and that's the law and that's what we did.""

Stiggers was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for killing his father as a teenager in 1965. When he was granted a five-day leave from prison for good behavior, he headed to Michigan, where his mother lived. He's been there ever since — thanks to a governor who, in 1971, refused to send him back to Arkansas and its then-notorious prison system.

The AP recently found Stiggers living in a one-bedroom apartment along a busy road in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Mich. He gets by on $700 a month in Social Security benefits, usually making trips outside only to see a doctor. He needs an inhaler and 10 pills a day for his diabetes, high blood pressure and other ailments. A stocky man with thick arms, Stiggers grappled with sewer lines as a plumber until two strokes ended his working days and made his speech difficult to understand.

He was astounded to learn that Arkansas has renewed its efforts to bring him back to prison — more than four decades after then-Gov. William Milliken blocked the state's initial request.

Beebe, a Democrat, sent a letter this year to Republican Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, seeking Stiggers after his Social Security benefits put him back on Arkansas' radar.

State prison officials said they didn't know that Stiggers was sick, either. But Department of Correction spokeswoman Shea Wilson told the AP that it's not the agency's role to make judgments about whether Stiggers should be brought back to Arkansas.

Story continues

""It's our job to carry out the mandates of the court,"" Wilson said. ""And that's simply what we're doing in our efforts to seek him.""

Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, said the matter was still under review and ""there's not currently a timeframe for when that may be concluded.""

After Judge Debra Nelson ruled against a defense motion for acquittal late Friday afternoon, the prosecution announced it was resting and the defense began by calling Zimmerman's mother, Gladys.

She testified the voice heard screaming for help on the 911 call was her son's and she knew it was him ""because he's my son."" The recording was made during a fight between Zimmerman and Martin minutes before the neighborhood watch volunteer shot the teen.

Zimmerman's uncle, Jorge Meza, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, then testified that he overheard the 911 screams while watching television and, "" It was Jorge screaming for his life.""

Court was then recessed until Monday morning.

More On This...

Earlier Friday, Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, testified that her 17-year-old son could clearly be heard on the tape recorded Feb. 26, 2012.

[pullquote]

After the 911 audio was played, prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda asked Fulton, ""Who do you recognize that to be?""

""Trayvon Benjamin Martin,"" she replied.

Defense attorney Mark O'Mara suggested during cross-examination that Fulton may have been influenced by others who listened to the 911 call, including relatives and her former husband.

O'Mara also asked Fulton hypothetically whether she would have to accept it was Zimmerman yelling for help if the screams did not come from her son. O'Mara also asked if she hoped Martin didn't do anything that led to his death.

""I heard my son screaming,"" Fulton said. ""I would hope for this to never have happened and he would still be here.""

Earlier Friday, Fulton posted on Twitter: ""I pray that God give me the strength to properly represent my angel Trayvon.""

Trayvon's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, 22, also testified Friday that he recognized Trayvon's voice on the 911 calls.

O'Mara then asked Trayvon's older brother why last year he had told a reporter that he wasn't sure if the voice belonged to Martin.

""I didn't want to believe it was him,"" Jahvaris Fulton testified.

Zimmerman’s father, in contrast, has said the screams were from his son rather than Martin. The screams are considered to be crucial pieces of evidence because they could determine who was the aggressor in the confrontation. An FBI expert testified earlier in the week that a person familiar with a voice is in the best position to identify it.

Shiping Bao, who performed Martin’s autopsy a day after he was killed, testified that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the chest. The manner of death was a homicide, he said.

Bao testified that Martin was in pain and suffered for up to 10 minutes after being shot by Zimmerman. The fatal bullet went from the front to the back of the teen's chest, piercing his heart.

""There was no chance he could survive,"" Bao testified.

Under questioning by defense attorney Don West following Friday’s lunch recess, Bao said he changed his opinion regarding the length of time Martin lived after being shot from his original estimate during a deposition he gave in November of 1 to 3 minutes to up to 10 minutes. He changed his opinion following another autopsy roughly three weeks ago that was “very similar” to that of Martin’s, Bao testified.

Bao also testified that the marijuana found in Martin’s system coul have had no effect or some effect in the confrontation with Zimmerman.

When asked if Martin would be able to move his arms or hands after being shot, Bao responded that “only one person in this court knows.”

On Wednesday, an expert witness testified that none of Zimmerman's DNA was found under the fingernails of Martin, despite defense attempts to portray Zimmerman as only firing his gun in self-defense.

Crime lab analyst Anthony Gorgone also testified that two different DNA profiles were found on the pistol grip. One was Zimmerman's but the other could not be identified. However, Gorgone said he was able to determine that it did not match Martin's DNA sequence.

Prosecutors spent most of Wednesday's proceedings painting Zimmerman as a police wannabe, amid testimony that featured technological glitches, forensic evidence and a prosecution witness who greeted Zimmerman from the stand.

Zimmerman faces life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. The state argued during its opening statement that Zimmerman profiled and followed Martin in his truck and called a police dispatch number before he and the teen got into a fight.

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-house-panel-chairman-consider-gun-bills-232642640--politics.html,,[],GOP House panel chairman will consider gun bills,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Friday that he's interested in writing legislation this year improving background checks for gun buyers and cracking down on illegal firearms sales.

In an interview, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., provided little detail about his plans. But he said the federal background check system should be fixed to make sure more people with serious mental illnesses don't get firearms.

Criminals and people with significant mental problems are among those barred by federal law from buying guns. States are supposed to supply the federal background check system with purchasers' mental health records, but often they do not because of privacy rules and other barriers.

""We want to improve that system to try to screen out people who should not be able to possess firearms,"" Goodlatte said.

Until now, House GOP leaders have only said they will wait to act until the Democratic-run Senate produces legislation. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., could begin writing its own gun curb measure in the next week or two.

Goodlatte did not say when his panel might write legislation, but he said he would not necessarily wait for the Senate to pass legislation.

President Barack Obama has proposed near-universal background checks. Currently, the checks are only required for purchases from federally licensed gun dealers, not sales between private individuals at gun shows, online or elsewhere.

Goodlatte said his legislation would be unlikely to require private background checks for private gun sales between people.

Obama also wants to ban assault weapons and ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds. Goodlatte said he opposes those ideas.

Goodlatte did not say when his panel might write legislation. His comments that the House would begin acting on gun legislation were first reported by Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Congress.

Details remain unclear about the mental health of Adam Lanza, who shot 26 people to death at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school in December. But shooters in some recent mass shootings have been afflicted with mental problems, including those involved in the Virginia Tech killings in 2007 and the 2011 Tucson attack that killed six people and wounded 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.

As other congressional Republicans have done, Goodlatte also complained that current gun laws are not being enforced sufficiently. He and other GOP members of the Judiciary Committee wrote letters Friday to Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, asking for data on federal firearms prosecutions for the past 11 years."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/19/obama-trayvon-martin_n_3624483.html,2013-07-19 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Reporter'],Obama Takes Over White House Press Briefing To Speak On Trayvon Martin (VIDEO),"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama made an unexpected appearance at Friday's White House press briefing to talk about the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case and, more broadly, how the United States continues to grapple with racial bias.

""When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" Obama said.

Obama said he understands why people are so upset that George Zimmerman was found not guilty for shooting and killing Martin, an unarmed teen who was walking down the street in Sanford, Fla., in February 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman, pursued Martin for no clear reason and ultimately shot him in what he said was self-defense.

The president urged the nation to accept the court's verdict, saying the judge conducted the trial ""in a professional manner"" and that the jury had made its decision.

But in an unusually personal moment, he began talking about the broader context of the case and the need to better understand the experiences of black men in this country.

""I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,"" Obama said. ""There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.""

He went on to recount instances when he had heard ""the locks click on the doors of cars"" as he walked down the street. African-American men are used to getting into an elevator and seeing a fellow passenger ""clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off,"" he said.

""I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,"" Obama said. ""And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.""

Obama also pointed to the fact that young African-American men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, both as perpetrators of violence and as its victims. And that violence, he noted, often takes place in poor black neighborhoods that are ""born out of a very violent past in this country."" The poverty and dysfunction in those communities ""can be traced to a very difficult history,"" he said.

Obama said he's going to be thinking about what steps he can take as president in the wake of the ruling. He put forward the idea of meeting with local and state officials to come up with ways to provide more training to law enforcement on racial bias, and he also suggested that he plans to examine certain states' Stand Your Ground laws.

More generally, Obama lent support to the idea of creating a coalition -- of business leaders, elected officials, celebrities, athletes -- to address the need for African-American men to feel that they are ""a full part of this society.""

Obama's decision to speak on the verdict was a bit of a surprise. Several days had passed since it was issued on Saturday, and he had already put out an official statement. The conventional wisdom was that the president was wary of bringing more politics to an already sensitive issue. But both he and his advisers wanted to offer a bit more.

Speaking after the president finished his remarks, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that the process behind putting the impromptu speech together wasn't all that complicated. The president had been prepared to address the jury verdict in Zimmerman's trial had he been asked about it in one of the interviews he did this week, but he wasn't asked. Eventually, Obama met with the press office and decided to just address the issue. A Friday statement before the press corps was as good a time as any other.

""This is not hard at all,"" said Carney. ""The president wanted to say something, and he opened the briefing today so he could say something."""
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/liveblog-live/liveblog/shots-fired-at-capitol/,,['Mark Berman'],Shots fired at Capitol,"Ed O’Keefe sent this report on what happened at the Capitol after shots were reported on Thursday afternoon:

It was about 2:19 p.m., just as the House was wrapping up a series of votes on short-term spending bills.

That’s when Capitol Police radios began squawking and officers were seen rushing out of the Capitol. At the basement-level House Carry-Out, three officers were seen heading toward stairs to the first floor.

Up on the first floor, some of those officers ran outside while others helped guard a door that had been locked, sealing people inside and keeping others out. Within moments another rush of officers arrived in the first-floor corridor as police radios continued broadcasting information.

The officers began banging on doors, telling staffers for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) to shelter in place and lock their doors. When reporters standing in the hallway asked what they should do, an officer froze for just a moment. “Shelter in place. Just get to your office,” the officer said.

Around the corner near the crypt of the Capitol below the Rotunda, officers dressed in business suits were seen sprinting towards the exits carrying suitcase-sized bags. Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.) stood confused at the base of a winding staircase leading up to the Rotunda. Up in the rotunda, officers were seen closing large wooden doors facing East.

The situation seemed more under control on the Senate side, where Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) were seen walking around with staffers. Schumer, as head of the Senate Rules Committee, confirmed that shots had been fired near the Capitol but said he didn’t know anything else. Klobuchar said she had been told that shots were fired near the Hart Senate Office Building and that she had already heard from her concerned daughter.

The Senate remained in session for at least 15 minutes after the first reports of trouble, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) presiding. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was speaking about the situation in Syria at the first reports came in, according to Senate transcripts. He yielded to Sen. Benjamin Cardin (D-Md.), who when told about what was happening asked that the Senate adjourn.

From windows in the storied Ohio Clock Corridor outside the Senate Chamber, two sharpshooters could be seen on the West Front of the Capitol, near the spot where presidential inaugurations are held. One of the sharpshooters was on bended knee with his weapon aimed toward the Mall."

If you don't understand how deeply and viciously racist has been the official and right-wing reaction to the murder of Trayvon Martin, all you have to do is consider what would have been the official and right-wing reaction had the races of Martin and his killer been reversed.

Imagine a lanky white teenager was walking in a strange neighborhood at night. He's a good kid—according to one of his teachers ""an A and B student who majored in cheerfulness""—although he's not above making the foolish teenaged mistake of getting caught with an empty baggie with marijuana residue inside it. But he has no criminal record. The worst anyone can say about him is that he smokes some pot, which puts him in the company of nearly half of all American high school students, something more than half of all American adults would legalize. But he's a good student and has no criminal record. In other words, he's a pretty typical teenager. A good kid.

Then one night this typical teenager is walking alone in a strange neighborhood, munching on some junk food and talking on his cell phone. And remember that we're reversing the races here, so now he's a white kid walking alone in a strange neighborhood, and it's a black man who steps out of an SUV and starts following him. A black man who outweighs the teen by nearly a hundred pounds. A black man who steps out of an SUV, pulls up a hoodie, and starts following the teen. The kid tells his friend on the cell phone that someone is following him. He tells her because he doesn't understand why someone is following him. He's nervous. He's just walking along, munching on junk food, and someone has started following him.

Finally, he decides to confront the guy. Even though he is nervous, he probably can't imagine that simply walking in a strange neighborhood would lead to someone shooting him dead. He's standing up for himself, but the thought of violence, the thought of gunfire, doesn't even enter his head. But when he confronts the big guy who had been following him, and asks why he has been following him, the big guy pulls a gun. It happens so suddenly, the teen probably barely has time to realize that something serious is now happening. This was just an innocent evening stroll, a big guy had started following him for no reason, and now his life is being threatened. This was just an innocent evening stroll, and now he's looking at a gun. Pointed at him. By a big guy who had been following him for no reason. A big guy who now shoots him dead.

Three witnesses later report having heard the boy's desperate cry for help. The police report (pdf) says he was found face down, with his hands under him. He was carrying no weapon. He was carrying no drugs. He was carrying the type of junk food typical teenagers carry. In our reversal of races scenario, the story then is that a lanky white teen was walking in a strange neighborhood, snacking on junk food, talking to a friend on his cell phone, when a large black man stepped out of an SUV, started following him, frightened him, and shot him dead. Imagine the reaction.

Now suppose we find out that the teen's killer had a history of race-based paranoia. Suppose we find out that the teen's killer's neighbors had complained of his aggressive behavior. Suppose we find out that the teen's killer had once been arrested for ""resisting arrest with violence and battery on an officer."" Suppose we find out that the teen's killer that night had ignored a police dispatcher who had told him to stop following the teen. And suppose that after all that, the much larger black man who had stepped out of an SUV, pulled up a hoodie, and started following the white teen had ended up shooting the white teen dead. What would have been the official response? What would have been the right-wing reaction?

Would a police officer have tried to coach a witness to change her story? Would the local state attorney and police chief have overruled even the lead homicide investigator, who recommended that the killer be charged with manslaughter? Would the police have neglected even to give the killer a routine drug and alcohol test? Would the police have neglected to contact whomever the kid was talking to on the phone just moments before he was shot, ignored the witnesses who contradicted the killer's story, and later reported that the killer had been bloodied in a confrontation with the dead teen, even though the real time reports suggested no such thing, and even though the police surveillance video shows the killer had no discernible wounds or discomfort, and even though the funeral director who prepared the dead teen's body for burial says there was no evidence he had been in a fight?

If Trayvon Martin had been white and George Zimmerman black, this would not have become a national story. If they had reported it at all, the right-wing media would have praised Martin for trying to stand his ground before a dangerous violent thug. It defies credulity to think they would be dismissing the killer's behavior, making despicable excuses such as blaming the kid's clothing, or if— unthinkable in this reversing-the-races scenario—there had been no criminal charges filed against the killer, dismissing the story altogether. The questions here don't even need answers. The questions answer themselves.

Had Trayvon Martin been white and George Zimmerman black, Zimmerman would be headed for death row. Right-wing media would be hailing Martin as a hero. A martyr who had stood his ground against a dangerous predator. They would be saying that it's too bad Martin hadn't somehow fought back against Zimmerman, and that if he had somehow succeeded in fighting a man so much larger than him, it would have been justifiable if he had left Zimmerman dead.

There is no polite way to explain what has happened. There is no polite way to explain the reflexive defensive rationalizations by the right-wing media and their right-wing fans. This was a racist killing with a racist cover-up and the right wing's reaction has been virulently and viciously racist. To understand the depth of the right wing's racist depravity, all it takes is to consider the very different reaction to this horror had the races of the victim and his killer been reversed.

Welcome to post-racial America."

(CNN) —

You know things in Chicago are bad when 70 murders in the first quarter can be seen as a good thing. But context is everything: Last year at this time there had been more than 120 murders, so I guess we should thank God for small favors.

It seems inconceivable that the city President Barack Obama calls home is also the city where his family may be least safe. Just this Monday a 15-year-old boy was found shot dead in a backyard only four blocks from the president’s house.

ESPN LZ Granderson

What’s responsible for the bloodshed? Gang violence, as usual. Police estimate that of the 532 murders in 2012 – nearly 1.5 a day – about 80 percent were gang related. And yet, despite that rather staggering statistic, the national outcry is muted at best – nothing, to say the least, like the kind we saw last week in Boston. What is it about the word “gang” that brings out the apathy in us? Would we view Chicago differently if we called the perpetrators something else?

In Chicago, nurses dodge bullets to provide care

I’m not saying the people of Boston do not deserve our sympathy; they do. Nor am I suggesting the apprehension of Boston terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not essential. But how do we explain our habit of greeting terrorists with 24-hour news coverage and relentless wrath while overlooking the gangs that terrorize our streets daily – as if terrorism were only an enemy state and not a concept.

The murder numbers may be slightly better in Chicago, but they do not fully communicate the city’s state of siege. In February CNN reported that some children living in gang-ridden parts of the city carry guns because, to them, getting caught and serving time for possession of a gun is better than getting caught without one and dying.

Last month, city officials announced the closure of 54 “under-resourced” schools, which will force some kids to walk across warring gang territory to get to school. For example, in the seven blocks between George Manierre Elementary and Jenner Elementary there are three gangs fighting over territory: Black P Stones, Conservative Vice Lords and Gangster Disciples.

Kids and guns: ‘These are not isolated tragedies’

If it all sounds scary, it’s only because it is.

And if the name attached to all of this violence were al-Qaeda instead of Gangster Disciples; or if instead of “gang violence” the bloodshed were called “terrorism;” or if instead of calling the people spreading fear and mayhem gangs we were to call them what they really are – terrorists – the nation would demand more be done.

After all, if children are afraid to walk to school because they might get killed or if residents are afraid to identify perpetrators for fear of retaliation, I think it’s safe to say they are being terrorized.

What seems like a linguistic shell game is really an exercise in empathy. The thought of elementary school kids walking across areas of a city controlled by three terrorist groups becomes unacceptable to everyone, not just their parents. Hearing that 25 Chicagoans were shot in one weekend becomes a threat to national security, and not just the mayor’s problem.

The story of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was caught in the crossfire of a turf war days after performing during the presidential inauguration, was of interest briefly but her story has since faded. She, too, died just a few blocks from the Obama’s home. Jonylah Watkins, a 6-month-old girl, was shot in March while sitting on the lap of her father, Jonathan, the intended target and a gang member.

Opinion: Chicago’s violence took my dad, friends

Last week, millions watched as an entire city was shut down to look for one guy. Every major news station was covering the pursuit of one guy. We all know the face and relatives of this one guy. And it’s all because he is an alleged terrorist. But more American were murdered in the south and west sides of Chicago than there were U.S. servicemen killed in Afghanistan last year, and yet for some reason we don’t view those neighborhoods as terrorized.

Last week, Abdella Ahmad Tounisi was arrested at O’Hare Airport because the FBI believed he was on his way to Syria to join a terrorist organization. Tounisi reportedly thought he was in contact with a recruiter for a jihadist militant group, but it was actually an FBI agent. I would love to see the FBI’s anti-terrorism resources used in that matter to stop would-be gang members from flooding the streets of the country’s third-largest city. Maybe Cornelius German, the boy found dead down the street from Obama’s house, would still be alive.

Maybe Pendleton, who was playing in a park with her friends, would still be alive. Maybe Watkins, who was sitting on her father’s lap, would have had a chance to live.

Their deaths wouldn’t be considered “Chicago’s problem” if authorities suspected terrorists were involved. But it’s “gang-related,” so…

Chris Kyle, 38, a former Navy SEAL and author of “American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History,” and a friend, Chad Littlefield, 35, were found dead with multiple gunshot wounds at a secluded gun range at the Rough Creek Lodge southwest of Fort Worth.

There were multiple semiautomatic rifles, handguns and revolvers at the range, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by WFAA-TV. The man suspected of killing Kyle and Littlefield, 25-year-old Marine veteran Eddie Ray Routh, was gone, along with the semiautomatic handgun he’d likely used in the slayings, police said.

But he didn’t get far. His sister, Laura Blevins, called the Midlothian Police Department to report that Routh had come by her and her husband’s home and confessed to killing Kyle and Littlefield, according to the affidavit.

He had a big black truck they’d never seen before, and he “told the Blevinses that he had ‘traded his soul for a new truck’ ” before he drove away, headed for Oklahoma to avoid Texas police, according to the affidavit.

Routh had been hospitalized in September for “threatening to kill himself and his family,” according to a Lancaster, Texas, police report obtained by the Dallas Morning News. In that incident, police said they’d found him shoeless and smelling of booze when he told them “he was hurting and that his family does not understand what he has been through.”

“Police spoke with Routh’s mother, Jodi, who told police that he had been drinking and that he had become upset when his father said he was going to sell his gun,” the Morning News reported.

On Jan. 19, police took Routh to another mental hospital after a North Dallas woman called police saying she feared for Routh’s safety, the Morning News reported.

Kyle took veterans to gun ranges as part of his own style of therapy -- to some, controversial. At a Sunday news conference, Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said Routh’s mother, a schoolteacher, may have reached out to Kyle to get help for her son.

Investigators have said that they don’t know what Routh’s motives might have been. He reportedly became violent with jailers on Sunday evening, and he was shocked with a stun gun, strapped to a chair and put on suicide watch, officials said.

In his book, Kyle wrote that gun-range therapy was meant to be easygoing and fun, with teasing, jokes and bonding over beers and stories.

“What wounded veterans don’t need is sympathy,” Kyle wrote. “They need to be treated like the men they are: equals, heroes, and people who still have tremendous value for society. If you want to help them, start there. In a funny way, bustin’ back and forth shows more respect than asking ‘Are you OK?’ in a sickly sweet voice.”

Rev. Al Sharpton calls verdict %22an atrocity%22

NAACP urges Justice Department to pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman

Leaders appeal for calm

Angry civil rights groups on Sunday were pressing for new criminal charges following George Zimmerman's acquittal on second-degree murder and manslaughter in a Florida courtroom.

The NAACP website featured an online petition -- also posted on the liberal site MoveOn.org -- asking the Justice Department to bring federal charges against Zimmerman in the February 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin.

""The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,"" the petition says. ""We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights (criminal) charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.""

Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson issued a statement Sunday saying federal prosecutors were continuing to review evidence in the case, including testimony from the state trial.

""Prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,"" Iverson said.

Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, pressed for those charges, blasting the state verdict as a ""tragic miscarriage of justice."" She also urged Trayvon's family to pursue a civil lawsuit.

""No matter how you look at this situation, if it were not for the actions of Mr. Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin would still be alive with his family today,"" Arnwine said.

She said she hoped the verdict would spark a national conversation about racial profiling and the ""broken criminal justice system.""

After the verdict was announced Saturday night, a clearly shaken NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said, ""This is a heartbreaking moment. This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the old South.""

He referenced another killing of a black youth that many have compared to the Trayvon Martin slaying, the 1955 killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was killed in Mississippi for allegedly flirting with a white woman. ""Trayvon Martin's case has focused a generation the same way that the Emmett Till case focused a generation 60 years ago. I had hoped that this time we would get a verdict that fit the gravity of the case.""

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who led thousands of protesters in Sanford seeking a prosecution of Trayvon's killer, called the verdict ""a sad day in the country"" and ""a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country.""

""I think this is an atrocity,"" Sharpton said. ""It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.""

Jesse Jackson called the verdict ""Old South justice.""

""I'm disappointed and I'm saddened for the family,"" Jackson said.

While the jury's verdict was a crushing blow for many, there were no reports of serious unrest by early Sunday morning. Authorities in Martin's hometown of Miami and in Miami Gardens, where his father lives, said the streets were quiet.

Demonstrators took to the streets of four California cities, and there were reports of protesters breaking windows and damaging cars in Oakland, officials said early Sunday.

In Chicago, about 40 people chanted ""Justice for Trayvon!"" as they marched through the streets Saturday evening, according to The Chicago Tribune.

In Sanford, Tristan Bailey, 15, who was outside the Seminole County courthouse, was stunned after hearing the verdict. ""I don't know what to say,"" said the teen, who identifies with Trayvon Martin. ""He was just a teen, trying to live his dreams.""

Shannon Mickey, 41, was also disappointed. ""We were all nervous when we knew the verdict was coming down,"" Mickey said. ""It was a sense of shock. And unbelievable sadness.""

In Detroit, the Rev. Charles Williams II, president of the National Action Network of Michigan and pastor of Detroit's Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, said he planned a special prayer service at the church to pray for the Martin family.

""In the South, it's still hard for an African American to get justice,"" Williams said. ""Mr. Zimmerman deserved at least manslaughter and the jury wouldn't even do that. There is not faith in the jurors or in the diversity of the process.""

Williams said that National Action Network will examine legal options. ""We're going to continue our calls for justice for Trayvon Martin,"" he said.

In Fort Myers, Fla., people voiced feelings of anger, dismay and concern about keeping the peace immediately following the verdict.

""Oh my goodness, this is unreal to me. I'm very upset,"" said Antoinette Anderson, 48, a school district employee who is African American. ""It shows we're not equal in the justice system.""

Joe D'Alessandro, a 74-year-old former state attorney who now has a private legal practice, had a different take: ""I never thought the state had a second-degree murder case,"" he said. ""Self-defense trumps all. I just hope there's no violence.""

Despite his disappointment with the verdict, Jealous urged calm. ""It's important that the public focus on the fact that there are still additional avenues for holding this man accountable and bringing him to justice,"" he said. ""It is critical that people keep the peace and focus their energy on encouraging the federal authorities to make sure that Zimmerman is held accountable for taking young Trayvon Martin's life.""

Jackson also called for calm. ""I hope there will be dignity and discipline, and not street justice,"" he said. ""We cannot dishonor the innocent blood of Trayvon Martin with acts of violence.""

Tampa resident Craig Woodord brought his 13-year-old son, Dante, to the courthouse Saturday afternoon to watch history in the making. Dante wore a blue hooded sweatshirt and carried a bag of Skittles candy and a can of watermelon Arizona Iced Tea.

""My son's 13,"" Craig Woodord said. ""And it could have been him. So my heart really, really goes out to the Martin family, who lost their son that was doing absolutely nothing wrong.

""But nobody wins tonight. George Zimmerman is free, but he has to come out into society – living with a lot of people that don't like him.""

Pastor Ronald J. Harris was preaching when he was shot by the gunman

The gunman surrendered to the police and is charged with second-degree murder

LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) — A Louisiana pastor was fatally shot as he preached to a crowd of more than 60 during a revival service and a suspect has been arrested, law enforcement officials said Saturday.

The shooting at about 8:20 p.m. Friday was at Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center in Lake Charles, Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kim Myers said Saturday. Sixty-five people were inside at the time, including the victim's wife, Chief Deputy Stitch Guillory said.

Deputies have no information on a motive or on whether the preacher and suspect knew each other, Myers said.

Myers said Ronald J. Harris was shot twice by the gunman. He walked into the church while Harris was preaching and shot him, then hit him again when Harris fell to the floor.

The gunman ""walked up to him and shot him at close range,"" Myers said.

Harris was pronounced dead at the scene.

Woodrow Karey, 53, of Lake Charles is charged with second-degree murder and was held in the parish jail Saturday, Myers said. Karey's bond has been set at $1 million.

The gunman left the church, but Myers said Karey called the sheriff's office and surrendered.

Myers said after picking up Karey, deputies found two guns in a wooded area — one was a shotgun, the other a .22-caliber pistol.

Myers said Karey has no known criminal history.

Deputies were ""interviewing everybody who was there at the church,"" Myers said.

Family members who answered the telephone Saturday at the Harris home in Lake Charles said there would be no comment. There was no answer at a telephone listing for Karey or at Tabernacle of Praise."

An Orlando Sentinel article detailing how the Department of Justice’s secretive Community Relations Service worked to bring about Sheriff Lee’s ouster raises troubling questions about the Obama administration’s involvement, especially when coupled with the cozy relationship that Attorney General Eric Holder has with one of the lead Trayvon Martin agitators, the Rev. Al Sharpton.

What is the DOJ’s Community Relations Service? The Sentinel article, entitled “DOJ ‘peacemakers’ helped Sanford stay cool amid rising tension,” paints a generally rosy, if slightly creepy, picture of the organization and its role during the Trayvon Martin shooting and the aftermath:

In their Navy blue windbreakers, polo shirts and dark sunglasses, they look like federal agents. Their caps are embroidered with the Justice Department’s seal. They watch and listen silently. But they say little publicly. When reporters try to chat them up, they remain stoic, saying simply they cannot talk to the media. The peacekeepers have a specific mandate outlined in the 1964 Civil Rights Act to go into conflict zones within American communities that perceive discrimination or feel wronged because of their particular race, color or national origin.

However, the original mandate of the CRS was expanded with the passage of recent hate crime legislation. A 2010 article by liberal journalist Ryan Reilly on Main Justice quotes former Community Relations Service director Ondray T. Harris as saying the CRS had become more ‘preventative’.

Others give a less positive view of the CRS. One source familiar with the division describes them as “federal spies, federal muscle, all in the guise of mediation.”

The Sentinel quotes a number of people saying positive things about the CRS and their role in Sanford, but all of them appear to be people or organizations who were calling for George Zimmerman’s arrest, such as the Seminole County NAACP.

Despite claiming to be unbiased, DOJ head Eric Holder recently spoke in praise of Al Sharpton, one of the main agitators in the Trayvon Martin story, at an event hosted by Sharpton’s Nation Action Network–at the same time Sharpton was calling for increased civil disobedience.

According to the Sentinel, the Department of Justice and CRS had a hand in bolstering Rev. Al Sharpton’s claim of Police Department bias by helping to facilitate the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee Jr. from the Stanford Florida Police Department, just two days before President Obama’s Rose Garden statement about Trayvon Martin.

As the Orlando Sentinel reported:

They helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee, said Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. “People are more relaxed and satisfied when they know they have someone from the outside, like the DOJ who have no ties to the community to try and relax the emotions,” Clayton said

We have previously reported that in 2006, then Senator Barack Obama was involved in a Florida case with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump and Rev. Sharpton that acted as the publicity blueprint for the Martin case.

That connection has still not been reported in the mainstream media, and itself raises serious questions about the level of coordination between the Obama administration, Mr. Crump and Rev. Sharpton."

AB 109 enshrined “realignment” into law – a plan to place supposedly “non-violent, non-serious, and non-sex offenders” in county jails rather than state prisons. In other words, local governments were handed the problem of prisoners the state didn’t want to hold. On January 8, 2013, Brown said, “we’ve gone from serious constitutional problems to one of the finest prison systems in the United States.”

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation calls the realignment plan “historic legislation that has helped enable California to close the revolving door of low-level inmates cycling in and out of state prisons.” But in reality, realignment has created a revolving door for criminals: they cycle in, they leave, and they harm innocent citizens across the state.

David Mulder, 43, was shot and killed by police on Sunday night after stabbing a woman to death in a car near the San Bernardino Freeway. He had been released from prison early under realignment in September.

Last week, a felon with convictions for grand theft auto, drug possession, receiving stolen property, and robbery was arrested for an alleged rape in Fontana. The former inmate, Juan Francisco Aguilera, 30, had been turned over to county supervision.

In February, 34-year-old Raoul Leyva was convicted of attempted voluntary manslaughter after beating his girlfriend, 21-year-old Brandy Marie Arreola, nearly to death. She still sits in a wheelchair, and has brain damage. She spent three months in a coma. Leyva was released early under realignment. He had already spent time in the system for domestic violence and parole violation.

These are not isolated incidents. They are evidence of a broad trend. According to statistics provided to Breitbart News by the office of Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, 11,473 criminals have been sent to Los Angeles County jails rather than state penitentiaries since realignment kicked in. Over 43,000 inmates are doing their time in local jails rather than state pen. By 2014, that number will skyrocket to 54,000. Now here’s the kicker: under the Brown realignment plan, Los Angeles county misdemeanor offenders will serve approximately 10-15% of their sentences. Then they will be released. That number will drop as jails become more crowded.

More criminals, more crime. According to statistics from the Los Angeles County Sheriff and Probation Departments, burglaries have increased dramatically, from 175% in Hawaiian Gardens to 45% in South Los Angeles to 50% in Compton; auto theft is up 365% in Artesia, 100% in Marina Del Rey, and 92% in Bellflower. The Criminal Justice Legal Foundation reports that in the six-month period after realignment, California’s crime rates rose across the board, including a 7.6% jump in homicide. The recent Northridge boarding house murderer, who killed four people execution style, was out thanks to realignment. Tobias Dustin Summers, wanted for kidnapping a 10-year-old Southern California girl, was out due to realignment.

For his part, Jerry Brown maintains that we don’t need more prisons. “I don’t think that’s smart, and I don’t think the law requires it, and moreover, management of a prison is quintessentially an executive function,” he said in January. The proof is in our hands, and it is bloody.

Suspects%2C 18 and 20%2C were taken into custody Sunday

CHICAGO — Two men have been charged with murder in the shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton a week after she performed at President Obama's inauguration.

Michael Ward, 18, and Kenneth Williams, 20, both of Chicago, were charged with one count each of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm in the Jan. 29 attack that also wounded two other teens, the Chicago Tribune reported, citing prosecutors.

City Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy and other top police officials were expected to formally announce the charges at an evening news conference.

Citing sources, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Ward has been on two years' probation for aggravated use of a weapon in 2011. He and Williams are members of the Gangster Disciples street gang and were feuding with rival gang members at the time of the shooting, authorities said.

Police said Hadiya, an honor student and band majorette at King College Prep. was an innocent victim of a gang-related shooting.

First lady Michelle Obama attended her funeral Saturday. Other dignitaries included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush.

Hadiya was shot in Vivian Gordon Harsh Park, about a mile from the Obama home on the city's South Side. After finishing their exams she and classmates had taken shelter under a park canopy during a rainstorm. Police said a man hopped a fence, ran toward the group and opened fire with a handgun, striking Hadiya in the back as she tried to run.

Her slaying brought new attention to Chicago's homicide rate, and came in a January that was the city's deadliest in a decade. In 2012, Chicago recorded 506 homicides.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/05/Zimmerman-brother-Obama-bullied,2013-02-05 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Exclusive–Zimmerman Brother: Obama 'Bullied' My Family,"George Zimmerman was back in court today for a hearing on the start date for his trial on murder charges. Zimmerman, of course, was the Hispanic neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Florida, who trailed a young black man named Trayvon Martin after calling 911, got into an altercation with Martin in which Martin ended up pounding Zimmerman’s head into the pavement, and then ended up shooting Martin in the chest. The media used the Zimmerman case as an opportunity to bully Americans over their supposed racial intolerance. Even the President of the United States weighed in in the midst of an election cycle, suggesting that if he had a son, he’d look like Trayvon Martin.

Breitbart News had the opportunity to sit down for a one-on-one interview with George’s brother, Robert, in Los Angeles. Excerpts of that interview played tonight on Fox News’ Hannity.

Robert didn’t pull any punches about President Obama’s role in raising the threat level to his brother – and to his family. “We do feel that we’re threatened,” Robert told Breitbart News. “There’s not been a legal resolution in this matter. And even the day that there is legal resolution in this matter, the day that happens I don’t think that every single fear of some kind of retribution will simply just go way, but we’re coping as bets we can, day by day.”

Robert saved especially harsh criticism for President Obama, who inserted himself in the Zimmerman case, even inviting race-baiter Al Sharpton to the White House shortly after Sharpton threatened the town of Sanford over the Police Department’s decision not to arrest Zimmerman originally. When the President was asked about the Zimmerman case in the Rose Garden, Robert said, “Here was this president, from the backdrop of the Rose Garden, making comments about someone based on his skin color. I think we felt bullied, we were a little let down initially, and that disappointment grew because if you don’t have the support of at least the law on your side, of the most powerful man in the Western Hemisphere reminding the world that it is entitled to watch, reminding Americans that the world is watching and that we will get through this with due process, but instead bringing up statements about his skin color … it was alarming to say the least.”

Robert went further: “I don’t think a white president would have been able to get away with the same thing from the Rose Garden in an election season.”

The fallout to the Zimmerman family has been extreme. According to Robert, they often require security for everyday tasks. They have had to move around to avoid targeting. And now, George faces a trial in a case where many legal observers agree there is no evidence to support the prosecutor’s second degree murder charge. No matter what happens, George Zimmerman will, thanks to the President and the media, remain a racist in many Americans’ minds. “If you can’t rebut assertions of racism,” said Robert, “the noise kind of drowns you out. You’re really left defenseless, and you have no other choice but to go into hiding.”

1. McClelland was a trained former soldier who no doubt had the skills to use a firearm quickly and effectively, but that apparently had no impact whatsoever on the ability of his and his wife's murderer to get to them. The claims of the gun lobby that being armed is an effective deterrent or defense against murder are by now a laughable, sick joke discredited by a long and growing line of bodies, including those of bystanders shot in crossfire, as well as many people with in-depth firearms training. Now that one of the victims is a former soldier and Texas prosecutor acutely aware of a present danger, and surrounded by a community of similarly-armed people, the final nail has been hammered into the coffin of NRA Big Lies.

2. The fact that a white supremacist organized crime organization is so powerful and brazen in Texas, while it fits the Lone Star state's culture of violence and hate, still somehow manages to be shocking. Apparently the pervasive gun culture in the state has done nothing more than create terrorist groups who can murder public officials with impunity, and not one of the millions of firearms in the state stopped one or a handful of assailants from executing a prosecutor, and then two months later doing it again along with the second victim's wife in their own home.

This is what fascism looks like: A state that murders and imprisons people by the bushel (many of them innocent) out of sheer sadism, but can't and/or won't protect even its own prosecutors from the violence of murderous white supremacist terrorists. In fact, they won't even call it terrorism because the suspected perpetrators are part of the same extended political culture of racist, lawless, anti-government white conservative gun nuttery as the Republicans who control the state with an iron fist.

Apparently the Aryan Brotherhood has decided to exercise a ""2nd Amendment solution"" as the NRA routinely suggests, and its victim's own attempt to do so proved fruitless against superior firepower, superior malice, and the inherent advantage of the attack. Congratulations, Texas - you have now gone where only Sicily and Russia in all of Western civilization have gone in modern times: A state where public officials can be murdered with impunity. The difference is, Sicilians and Russians aren't proud of it.

According to a Huffington Post report, the assassinations may be linked to another that occurred in Colorado two weeks ago by another suspected white supremacist who later died in a shootout with police in the same region of Texas.

A quick perusal of media coverage of the murders doesn't find the word ""terrorism"" anywhere, and Texas media seem to be downplaying the fact that McClelland was armed.

A number of sources are reporting that an assault rifle was used in the assassination.

A comment below, attributed to a previous diary by another Kossack, makes a brilliant observation: ""A gun will not protect you from bullets."" Indeed, it seems gun anarchy is as stupid and insane a solution to criminals having guns than arming yourself with vials of smallpox would be if criminals had biological weapons.

Remember when Republicans were outraged about the Homeland Security Department investigating right-wing domestic terrorism, and had the report suppressed? Many of the political leaders involved in the outcry were Texas Republicans. Now we see more of the fruits of their politics.

As far as I can find, Texas - gun capital of the United States - is now the only state in US history to have had two prosecutors assassinated within months of each other."

So the weeklong programming effort titled “After Newtown,” arriving two months after the mass killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., represents a major effort in high-metabolism reporting and producing for a network accustomed to moving at a more deliberate pace.

And it’s hard to imagine an ambitious package about gun violence anywhere else on television, with the possible exception of premium cable. It would never make it past the talking stage in the advertiser-supported realm, even though several of the broadcast networks have plenty of underperforming prime-time shows they could pre-empt. It’s painfully obvious, but let’s not miss the chance to say it: a lot of television organizations could do something like this, but PBS is just about the only one that would.

That leaves the question of whether the effort — which includes nightly segments on “PBS NewsHour,” which began on Monday, and will encompass episodes of “Frontline” and “Nova” as well as a pair of new documentaries, “Guns in America” and “The Path to Violence” — was worth it. The answer, based on the four centerpiece programs available for review, is a qualified yes."

They named the show “Politics Nation” and positioned the nightly broadcast as a left-leaning political show focusing on national politics as a natural lead-in to “Hardball.” It was a well-orchestrated PR strategy to distance Sharpton from his controversial and odious past as a race-baiting advocate for proven liars Tawana Brawley and the antagonist in the Duke Lacrosse case.

The message was clear: Sharpton isn’t the charlatan race-baiter you’ve grown to loathe; he’s now a power player in the Democratic Party and is here to bring his unique, seasoned perspective to the national political conversation.

Oh what a difference a year makes.

These days, Politics Nation has turned into the Trayvon Martin Show as Sharpton goes right back to his roots as a sensationalist willing to advocate for any victim of a crime as long as they are the right race and the alleged perpetrator is white (or “white hispanic” in this case).

Friday night Sharpton had Trayvon Martin’s family attorney on to discuss the George Zimmerman trial scheduled to begin in 10 days. Understand that Martin’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, has no actual standing in this case as it is the state of Florida against Zimmerman in these criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, Sharpton allowed Crump to lay out the state’s case against Zimmerman with Sharpton cheering and participating in the multi-media opening and closing arguments. By the time the segment was done, Zimmerman was all but tried and convicted with the most inflammatory and defamatory language possible:

Crump: When you really think about it in the totality of circumstances, George Zimmerman as this neighborhood watch patrol volunteer going around the neighborhood with a gun on prescription medication is every parent’s worse nightmare, because God help you if he comes up to your teenage child and says ‘what are you doing around here’ and your teenager doesn’t answer the question right. Then you have a Trayvon Martin situation at your doorstep. And we can’t have that in a law-abiding society.

Hearing that un-refuted and damning narration, no jury in the world would move to acquit Zimmerman. And that’s the point. Sharpton is using his NBC News platform to set the Zimmerman case up as an open and shut case of 2nd degree murder, and if anything short of a conviction comes from the Florida jury, well, you know the reason why.

At that point, if Zimmerman is acquitted, get ready for Politics Nation to then be used to advocate for social justice and political unrest until there is “justice for Trayvon.”

NBC News might as well replace Sharpton’s microphone with a bullhorn now.

Defense attorney Mark O'Mara asked that the witnesses be allowed to testify out of the public eye because of concerns for their safety about testifying at the trial, which starts next week. He said their testimony could impact the jury's decision.

Prosecutors and attorneys for media groups objected to the request.

Circuit Judge Debra Nelson also heard testimony about whether a voice recognition expert will be allowed to testify at the trial. Cries for help can be heard in the background of 911 calls that Zimmerman's neighbors made during a struggle between the neighborhood watch volunteer and Martin before the unarmed teen was shot. Experts have reached mixed conclusions about whose voice is crying for help.

FBI voice expert Hirotaka Nakasone, who was testifying for the defense, said there wasn't enough clear sound on the 911 recording to determine whose voice it was. He also said the concept that individuals have unique voice-prints that could identify them was misleading.

""No one can speak in the same way twice,"" Nakasone said.

Testimony was to continue Friday and the judge didn't issue a ruling.

Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, claiming self-defense, in the racially charged case. A delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to protests nationwide. Martin was black. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Hispanic.

The trial is expected to last more than a month.

The judge also considered a request from defense attorneys to sanction prosecutors for what the defense said amounts to withholding evidence. Zimmerman's attorneys alleged that prosecutors withheld deleted photos and text messages that came from Martin's cellphone. An attorney for a technology worker in the State Attorney's Office testified that he first brought the evidence to the attention of Zimmerman's attorneys after he was contacted by the technology worker.

The judge decided to suspend further testimony on sanctions, and any decision, until after the trial."

(CNN) —

To many of his neighbors, Colorado school gunman Karl Pierson was the wholesome boy next door who liked achievement and ran on the cross country team. He even worked on an Eagle Scout project two years ago.

To schoolmates, Pierson was known for his outspoken intelligence that served him well on the debate team. But at times, he acted “weird” and alienated peers with rants about communism and his aggressiveness to win every argument, they said.

One neighbor described him as bright but a social misfit whose peers ridiculed him. His mother had transferred him from another high school because of the mockery and altercations, the neighbor said.

Pierson, 18, opened fire Friday inside Arapahoe High School, where he was a senior. Claire Davis, 17, was wounded in a point-blank shooting, and Pierson, who apparently didn’t know Davis, then killed himself in the library, Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson told reporters Friday.

“He was a really smart kid. He was intelligent. He knew how to speak; he really did. I don’t think I ever won an argument with that kid,” junior Daylon Stutz said in the school parking lot on Saturday, when students were allowed to retrieve their cars.

Stutz, an offensive tackle on the football team, had known Pierson since the two shared a human behavior class when Stutz was a freshman and Pierson a sophomore. They worked on a class experiment together in which they went into the community and tried breaking unwritten rules, Stutz said.

“I did think he was a little weird, but I didn’t think he was, like, bad weird,” Stutz added. “He always kind of talked about how America was a communist country, how the government was, like, trying to take us over and stuff. I don’t know, just some weird stuff that I didn’t really pay close attention to, but nothing that alarmed me.

“He was definitely kind to me. I never saw him mean to anybody. He wasn’t condescending to anyone,” he said.

In Friday’s shooting, Pierson was armed with a shotgun, a bandolier stocked with ammunition, a machete and three Molotov cocktails, Robinson said. Pierson fired five shots within 1 minute and 20 seconds, he said.

Pierson entered his school looking for the debate team’s coach, CNN affiliate KUSA reported, citing Robinson. Pierson was apparently seeking revenge against a faculty member because of a “confrontation or disagreement,” the sheriff said.

High school senior Frank Woronoff said he had known Pierson since they were freshmen.

“He was the last person I would expect to shoot up a high school,” Woronoff said.

“He was pretty geeky and nerdy but in a charming way, one of the nicest, most humble people I know,” he added.

Senior Chris Davis, 18, was among many students Saturday trying to make sense of Pierson’s shooting rampage.

“He was a weird kid,” Davis said. “He’s a self-proclaimed communist, just wears Soviet shirts all the time.”

Pierson became easily aggravated, “always liked to be right” and didn’t like losing, Davis said.

“It seems realistic, now, that he did it,” Davis added.

The home where authorities believe Pierson armed himself is five miles from his school and appeared vacant Saturday. Its front door was sealed and boarded a day after federal agents raided the property and executed search warrants.

Why? Sheriff wants to know reason for Colorado school shooting

A man who declined to be identified in an CNN interview lives a few doors away and said he has known Pierson since he was a boy. In the last few days, the neighbor noticed Pierson driving at excessive speeds throughout their normally quiet, modest middle-class suburb.

The neighbor said Pierson’s mother, Barbara, transferred her son to Arapahoe High School from nearby Highland Ranch High School because her son had been subjected to constant ridicule and physical altercations.

“He was socially awkward and just didn’t seem to fit into the larger teenage groups, and I think that weighed on him,” the neighbor told CNN.

Lessons of Columbine and other school shootings helped in Arapahoe

The neighbor said Pierson’s parents had been separated for years, and Karl was living with his mother and younger sister.

“While Karl was socially a misfit around kids his age, he was intellectually bright and loved to debate in school,” the neighbor said. “If he was disciplined in a debate class, that must have meant everything to him. It may have been trigger point.”

Pierson was active in his community, KUSA reported.

He took pride in how he routinely won contests on his speech and debate team, the station reported. He showed off his first place and second place trophies online.

One neighbor described him as a “nice young man,” the affiliate said.

In fact, the TV outlet interviewed him seven years ago about the design of a quarter commemorating Colorado.

Pierson submitted questions to the station in 2008 for a show about the Colorado Supreme Court and asked a question at a U.S. Senate debate in 2010, the news outlet said.

“It is certainly tragic and it rises up to one of Detroit’s more violent incidents,” Police Chief James Craig said at a televised news conference Thursday. “It is certainly a violent act and what I am calling, urban terrorism.”

One “person of interest” has been apprehended, Craig said.

Craig told reporters that he could not give many details because the case is under investigation. But he gave the broad outlines of the shooting that began Wednesday evening at Al’s Barber Shop on the city’s east side. Between 20 to 30 people were in the store engaging in gambling activity when a man wearing body armor entered and began shooting. At least one person inside the shop returned fire.

The exchange of gunfire seems to be connected to a feud involving the gunman and several members of the gambling party, Craig said, avoiding details.

“We cannot comment on specifics of this case,” he said. “We are very much early in the investigation.”

Police responded within one minute of receiving the emergency call, Craig said. The shootings were probably over in about the time it took police to respond.

The shooter fled but was apprehended later in Rochester, part of metropolitan Detroit. The unidentified man is being held on an unrelated felonious assault warrant and is considered a person of interest in the barbershop shooting but has not been charged, Craig said. He is being held by officials on the charge outlined in the warrant.

Initial reports indicated that there may have been more than one gunman. Craig said police were still investigating the number of shooters involved and how many rounds had been fired.

Craig would not discuss why the gambling had been going on at the barbershop. Nor would he say whether any gambling charges were pending.

He did say that police were interviewing witnesses who had seen at least one gunman wearing body armor and that could lead to a federal charge.

“It’s unusual and tends to suggest things,” Craig noted. “Police officers wear body armor. Why a community member would, raises a number of questions.”

Speaking outside Department of Justice headquarters, Reverend Al Sharpton announced a National Justice for Trayvon Day for Saturday with rallies outside federal buildings and court houses in more than 100 cities nationwide.

“People all over the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit,” said the civil rights firebrand, flanked by more than a dozen other African-American clergy members.

“This is a social movement for justice.”

Sharpton added that “tens of thousands” would converge on Washington for a protest march on August 24, the Saturday before the 50th anniversary of the late Martin Luther King’s historic mass march on the US capital.

Saturday’s acquittal of gun-toting neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed Florida teenager Martin has stirred anger and unrest across the African-American community.

Sharpton is pressing the Department of Justice to reopen a civil rights investigation into the incident that was suspended when Zimmerman was arrested six weeks after the killing.

US Attorney General Eric Holder, calling Martin’s death “tragic and unnecessary,” called Monday for a dialogue on the racially-charged issues it raises, but he stopped short of announcing civil proceedings.

Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, pledged a major campaign against so-called stand-your-ground laws in Florida “and 29 other states” that allow citizens who feel threatened to use lethal force in self-defense.

“The stand-your-ground law was not used directly at this (Zimmerman) trial, but it had everything to do with what happened at this trial,” he said, adding that such laws represented “a new threat to civil and human rights.”

“Let us be clear. It is now because of these laws where anyone walking, committing no crime, can be followed or approached by another civilian, and they can use deadly force and say it was self-defense,” he said.

“That is something that is frightening and cannot be allowed to sustain itself in this country.”

Setting out a strategy against stand-your-ground laws — including a boycott of corporations known to support such legislation — will be the topic of a three-day meeting of faith leaders in Miami next week, he said.

Separately, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday that pop music legend Stevie Wonder has vowed never to perform in any state or country with a stand-your-ground law on its statute books.

“I decided today that until the stand-your-ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,” it quoted Wonder as saying Sunday in Quebec City, where he was playing the Canadian city’s summer festival.

“As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.”"

(CNN) —

In the emotional aftermath of the Trayvon Martin killing last year, Attorney General Eric Holder signaled the unlikelihood of filing federal hate crimes charges against admitted shooter George Zimmerman.

“For a federal hate crime, we have to prove the highest standard in the law,” Holder said in April 2012, 45 days after Zimmerman shot the African American teenager in what was depicted by civil rights groups as a racially motivated killing.

In words that now sound prescient, Holder described to reporters that day how “something that was reckless, that was negligent does not meet that standard.”

“We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind,” he said.

Zimmerman’s acquittal of state murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday showed the Florida jury rejected that he intended to kill Martin for any reason, including the racial motivation necessary for federal charges that he violated Martin’s civil rights.

The Department of Justice opened an investigation into the Zimmerman case last year, and a statement from the agency on Sunday said it was ongoing and will now include evidence and testimony from the Florida trial.

In a speech in Washington on Monday, Holder said the Justice Department would “continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law” in examining what he called “the tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon Martin.”

“Independent of the legal determination that will be made, I believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,” Holder said. “We must not - as we have too often in the past - let this opportunity pass.”

Separately, the White House said President Barack Obama would play no role in deciding whether federal charges are filed.

“Cases are brought on the merits and the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice,” White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.

The president on Sunday called Martin’s killing a tragedy for America, but said in a written statement that the jury had spoken. He acknowledged the case had “elicited strong passions,” but urged “calm reflection.”

Still, political pressure for a federal case is mounting.

Demonstrators around the country are calling for Zimmerman to be punished, and hundreds of thousands of people have signed online petitions by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) that call for federal charges.

However, legal experts make the same point Holder did last year in saying the law limits the federal government’s options.

Watch Holder’s speech

Because Zimmerman is a private citizen, he can only be charged with a hate crime in terms of civil rights violations under federal law, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who now is in private practice.

To successfully prosecute Zimmerman, the Department of Justice would have to show that Zimmerman “caused the death of Trayvon Martin solely motivated by/because of his race or color,” Weinstein told CNN in an e-mail, adding: “This element was absent from the state trial and quite frankly doesn’t exist.”

Five Reasons for acquittal

CNN Legal analyst Paul Callan agreed Monday that federal prosecutors are “in sort of a tough spot.” The hate crimes statue is generally applied to cases involving police officers or other government agents, Callan said, adding that using it in a case involving a lone private citizen is “very, very rare and I think in this case, it’s going to be very hard to prove.”

A federal hate crimes violation in a killing carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Even if the federal charges were identical to the state charges, it would not be double jeopardy for Zimmerman because the federal government is a separate and sovereign entity.

Those seeking federal charges say the killing was racially motivated, arguing that Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, targeted Martin for special scrutiny because the teenager was an African-American. Regardless of how the shooting occurred, they say, the fight occurred because of Martin’s race.

“The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,” says the petition on the NAACP website.

Petition to White House

Rep. Marcia Fudge, the Ohio Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said racial profiling like what Zimmerman did to Martin “continues to make communities of innocent individuals fear a justice system designed to protect them.”

“Men and women wonder if merely walking or driving justifies being followed, stopped, or questioned,” Fudge said in a statement Monday. “This practice and the presumption of guilt so often associated with people of color must come to an end.”

A crush of petitioners crashed the NAACP website during the night, causing the group to set up a parallel petition drive on the liberal MoveOn.org website, said Derek Turner of the NAACP. A separate petition effort on the White House website generated nearly 15,000 supporters.

Such political pressure evokes memories of the Rodney King case in 1991, when videotape of white Los Angeles police officers clubbing an African-American man after a car chase prompted race-tinged national furor.

When a criminal court failed to convict the officers of police brutality, riots ensued in Los Angeles over alleged racial discrimination.

The Justice Department then filed a civil rights suit against the officers, alleging “deprivations of federal rights under color of law,” and two were convicted in 1993. A court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison.

Weinstein said the Justice Department can’t file similar charges against Zimmerman because he is a private citizen instead of a police officer or government official of any kind.

“There are no other relevant sections under which to prosecute him” other than the hate crime statute, which covers “offenses involving actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin,” Weinstein added.

However, Martin’s family can still file a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Zimmerman to seek penalties and damages. Such a legal move carries no criminal penalty or prison time.

Terrie Ann Campbell, 38, who works for the school district in Orlando, looked on from a lawn chair on the courthouse lawn where she had propped up her “Justice 4 Trayvon” sign in the damp grass on what had already become a hot and humid day.

About 50 people gathered in the morning to protest as jurors deliberated the fate of Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer who identifies himself as Latino and who is charged with second-degree murder in connection with the Feb. 26, 2012, fatal shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin.

Zimmerman maintains he shot Martin in self-defense after Martin suddenly attacked him in a confrontation on that rainy night in Sanford.

“It was peaceful in the beginning, but it seems like there are certain people out here trying to provoke a reaction,” said Campbell, who is black and was hoping for a guilty verdict in the Zimmerman trial that has transfixed the nation.

As the six-woman jury continued their second day of deliberations Saturday, local authorities staffed the emergency operations center and sheriff’s deputies lingered at the edge of the courthouse lawn, where metal barricades had been erected.

“Shouting at each other -- it’s not going to do anything,” Campbell said.

As the white-haired man made his way through the crowd, a chorus of angry voices trailed him.

“Zimmerman’s a killer!”

“He’s a murderer!”

“You’re a racist!”

Eventually, half a dozen protesters surrounded the man with signs, chanting. One of the young women wore a T-shirt that said, “What if it were your son?” They talked about the O.J. Simpson case, one holding a sign that said, “The glove don’t fit.”

GRAPHIC: Who’s who in the Trayvon Martin case

They tried to convince the white-haired man that he was wrong, but the man just shook his head.

“He has a right to self-defense,” he said of Zimmerman.

Tempers flared. Voices rose. But no one came to blows.

In the end, the old man walked away to talk to more Martin supporters, including a young black man wearing a T-shirt with Zimmerman’s face in the cross-hairs.

Across the barricade, a few Zimmerman supporters held signs that said “Not guilty” and “Free George.” They did not tangle much with the other group.

The white-haired man, Casey Kole, who is white, wanted to talk to the other side.

Kole, 66, a retired oil executive and chauffeur from Orlando, described himself as “the silent majority type.” A conservative and a Navy veteran, he insisted he’s not racist. Like many across the country, he watched the trial on television. Watching, he came to believe Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was in the right when he shot the unarmed teen.

“He’s a man who’s patrolling an area without being paid, an area that had had a number of burglaries,” Kole said. “I don’t think the prosecution offered any evidence that he’s guilty.”

Kole said he’s not worried about clashes in the streets after the jury issues its verdict, nothing like the 1992 Los Angeles riots, he said.

“I would expect law enforcement would make sure there is peace,” he said. “That’s why it’s remarkable that you see me on this side, the opposition side, and there’s no confrontation. We can disagree. We can do it in a courteous manner. That’s the great benefit of this country -- we don’t resort to mob violence.”

Cynthia Bradford, of Syracuse, N.Y., was among the crowd and said her nephew, 13-year-old Jerell Montgomery, was killed 19 years ago at Syracuse University. “It’s not about black or white, she said. “This type of killings has to stop.”

Nearby, Army veteran Tatiandra Taylor, of Orlando, Fla., was calling for free speech. “They want us to take down our signs,” she said. “They should do it themselves.”

Laurie Isom, 38, a stay-at-home mom, brought her two children to the protest, ages 9 and 3. They all held signs and chanted. Last year, they marched through downtown Sanford to demand that Zimmerman be charged, as he eventually was -- not by local police, but by a special prosecutor appointed by the governor.

Isom, who is white, grew up in Sanford, and said the case has not divided the town along racial lines. But she wished it had united the town more.

“Our town is pretty shaken, but I believe justice will be served,” she said as television camera operators recorded the crowd and news helicopters buzzed overhead. “Regardless of how the verdict will go, people will be peaceful. They’re saying it’s going to be an L.A. riot but I don’t believe that. If I did, I wouldn’t have my kids out here.”

[For the record 11:44 a.m. July 13: An earlier version of this post reported that George Zimmerman fatally shot Trayvon Martin in 2011. The shooting occurred in 2012.]

“It is certainly tragic and it rises up to one of Detroit’s more violent incidents,” Police Chief James Craig said at a televised news conference Thursday. “It is certainly a violent act and what I am calling, urban terrorism.”

One “person of interest” has been apprehended, Craig said.

Craig told reporters that he could not give many details because the case is under investigation. But he gave the broad outlines of the shooting that began Wednesday evening at Al’s Barber Shop on the city’s east side. Between 20 to 30 people were in the store engaging in gambling activity when a man wearing body armor entered and began shooting. At least one person inside the shop returned fire.

The exchange of gunfire seems to be connected to a feud involving the gunman and several members of the gambling party, Craig said, avoiding details.

“We cannot comment on specifics of this case,” he said. “We are very much early in the investigation.”

Police responded within one minute of receiving the emergency call, Craig said. The shootings were probably over in about the time it took police to respond.

The shooter fled but was apprehended later in Rochester, part of metropolitan Detroit. The unidentified man is being held on an unrelated felonious assault warrant and is considered a person of interest in the barbershop shooting but has not been charged, Craig said. He is being held by officials on the charge outlined in the warrant.

Initial reports indicated that there may have been more than one gunman. Craig said police were still investigating the number of shooters involved and how many rounds had been fired.

Craig would not discuss why the gambling had been going on at the barbershop. Nor would he say whether any gambling charges were pending.

He did say that police were interviewing witnesses who had seen at least one gunman wearing body armor and that could lead to a federal charge.

“It’s unusual and tends to suggest things,” Craig noted. “Police officers wear body armor. Why a community member would, raises a number of questions.”

The defense team in the Phoenix courtroom rested at the start of the day without calling any additional witnesses to testify.

""At this point, the defense rests,"" attorney Kirk Nurmi told the judge.

The decision came after about 2 1/2 months of testimony.

Prosecutor Juan Martinez started the states rebuttal by calling Arizona clinical psychologist Janeen DeMarte.

DeMarte testified she conducted an evaluation of Arias and administered several tests on reading, intelligence and memory.

""She performed well on it,"" DeMarte said of the memory test she gave Arias.

In regard to the IQ test, DeMarte said Arias scored a 119.

Arias, a 32-year-old photographer, is accused of shooting Alexander in the face, stabbing him 27 times, and slitting his throat from ear to ear in the shower of his Mesa apartment on June 4, 2008. She has pleaded not guilty to murder, contending that she killed Alexander in self-defense.

Prosecutors allege Arias was jealous and did not want Alexander to see other women.

DeMarte said she reviewed an evaluation of Arias by Dr. Cheryl L. Karp, the Vice-Chairperson for the State of Arizona Board of Psychologist Examiners. DeMarte said Arias indicated more episodes of alleged abuse to Dr. Karp than she did to herself and the other defense experts.

""She told me there were four distinct episodes of alleged abuse,"" Demarte said of her evaluation of Arias.

Martinez then asked DeMarte how many incidents of alleged abuse Arias recounted to Dr. Karp.

""I can't even count [them] ... there was numerous reports of frequent abuse and threatening behavior,"" DeMarte said.

DeMarte said she diagnosed Arias with borderline personality disorder. She also testified she found no evidence to believe Arias' claims about her memory problems or that she was a victim of domestic violence and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.

""There wasn't symptoms that were consistent with that diagnosis,"" she said of the PTSD.

During cross-examination by defense attorney Jennifer Willmott, DeMarte stood her ground. She did not flinch when the attorney suggested she was too young or lacked experience. At one point Willmott asked DeMarte about her knowledge of Alyce LaViolette, the defense teams domestic violence expert.

Willmott pointed out that DeMarte had not been born when LaViolette got her Masters degree in 1980.

Willmott is expected to continue her redirect of DeMarte on Wednesday, at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time.

In a heated 129-page decision, Judge Kurt D. Englehardt of Federal District Court here declared that federal prosecutors had created a “prejudicial, poisonous atmosphere” in making anonymous online comments before and during the trial at nola.com, the Web site of The Times-Picayune, and ordered a new trial for all five officers.

The decision represented the collapse, for now, of a case that was seen as symbolizing both the profound breakdown of law and order after the hurricane and a deep rot within the city’s police department that dated back well before the storm.

While a scandal over anonymous online commenting had already cut short the federal careers of two local prosecutors and the United States attorney himself, Tuesday’s decision identified another, previously unknown commenter: a veteran lawyer in the Department of Justice in Washington who had a role in preparing the case for trial."

You need a tactical vest? A bayonet that would clip neatly onto an M-4? Bill Fulton was your man.

“We do bad things to bad people,” his company jackets said.

Fulton was also a go-to guy for Republican politicians who occasionally needed to reach out to the far right fringes of the party — those who spent weekends in the woods in camo gear and considered the 2nd Amendment an expression of divine intent.

When then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was plotting a move against the Republican Party chief at the state convention in 2008, Fulton was there strategizing over whiskey and cigars with Palin staffer Frank Bailey and Joe Miller, who later made a well-publicized run for the U.S. Senate as a tea party conservative.

That was the meeting where Fulton was introduced to Schaeffer Cox, an up-and-coming young firebrand of the far right who was running for the state Legislature and had, as it turned out, plans that went well beyond upending the Republican Party in Alaska.

It was a meeting that opened the door to a dangerous cat-and-mouse game that would transform the two men’s lives and leave them at opposite ends of one of the federal government’s biggest prosecutions of right-wing extremism on the West Coast.

Cox, 28, was sentenced Tuesday to 25 years in prison for heading a militia that plotted to kill judges and other government employees and conspired to accumulate the firepower needed to do it from Fulton. And Fulton, who became one of two key informants the FBI used to gather evidence against Cox and his cohorts, went from being the Alaska Peacemakers Militia’s “supply sergeant” to its most celebrated snitch.

Today, Fulton, 37, is nowhere to be found in Alaska.

The very moment that Cox and his associates were being arrested in Fairbanks in 2011, an FBI-paid moving van showed up at Fulton’s door in Anchorage — stunning his wife, who until then had known nothing about his double life — and the family relocated to another state. Fulton transferred his surplus store to his partners, sold his house at a loss, changed his appearance and went dark.

“They would have killed me immediately,” Fulton said at a cafe in his new hometown, as he sipped cappuccinos between furious smoking breaks outside. “If they found out I was working for the feds? I knew everybody up there in that right-wing militia area.... So there were quite a few people that would have liked to have offed me at some point.”

Advertisement

The story of Fulton’s foray as a militia arms supplier ended with not just Cox behind bars. Three codefendants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 to 25 years. From his new base, Fulton is continuing to work with the FBI on other gun-related cases and writing a book about the improbable events that transpired in Anchorage over the last two years.

“If you look at it from a sane standpoint?” he said. “Even I sometimes look at the whole story and how it unfolded and I think, this is unbelievable.”

Fulton and the other FBI informant, former drug runner J.R. Olson, offered the FBI an inside look at a group that seemed to be moving from right-wing, antigovernment rants — perfectly legal under the 1st Amendment — to something more dangerous. Cox had been boasting that his militia planned to set up common-law courts that would try people under principles they saw as more faithful to the U.S. Constitution. Those found guilty of serious offenses could be hanged or sold into slavery.

Fulton, who had long worked with Army criminal investigators through his surplus shop, had gone to the FBI in 2010 about a potential domestic terrorism case when the FBI learned he knew Cox.

“The wheels started turning: How can we use this to our advantage, to try to get more information? Is Cox really going down that path? Which inevitably, he was,” said Sandra Klein, a supervisory special agent who became Fulton’s chief handler.

Fulton’s first assignment was to attend a gun and military surplus sale intended as a fundraiser for the Interior Alaska Conservative Coalition, which Cox had helped establish in Fairbanks. Cox had been trying to get in touch with Fulton, who had ignored him “because I thought he was an idiot.” The night before the event in August 2010, Fulton invited Cox to meet him at his hotel. The militiaman arrived with Les Zerbe, a retired missionary ranked as a captain, and another associate.

Cox had been accused of assaulting his wife, and worried that state authorities were trying to take his son away. He talked about Fulton serving what he called common-law warrants on the officials he thought were out to get him.

“He said these guys need to be arrested and brought to trial,” Fulton recalled. “I said, ‘What are you going to do with them?’ He said, ‘We’ll either fine them, or we’ll hang them.’”

Advertisement

Cox and company discussed how they were going to go to the homes of selected enemies, cut the electricity to the house, and make enough noise to lure their main target onto the front porch, where he could be shot. Then the windows and doors would be boarded up, and the house, with the rest of the family inside, would be set on fire. “Collateral damage” is the way Fulton said they described it.

After Cox left, Fulton phoned Klein. “I’m like, ‘Help! What am I supposed to do? Do I need to get my family out of here?’ And she’s like, ‘We’ll handle it. Just try to figure out as much as you can.’ She was really good at calming me down, but even for her, I could tell it was stressing her out.”

The next day was the gun show, and Fulton again met with Cox, along with others from various militias.

“We walk into this meeting, and they’re wanding everyone. If you had a gun that was fine. They were looking for electronic listening devices,” Fulton recalled.

Fulton said he sensed that he needed to make it apparent to everyone that he was a tough guy who could be counted on, and he went on the offensive with Cox.

“I said, ‘Listen, you’re a piece of.... You brought all these people in this room. You said you had a plan; you don’t have a plan.’”

Zerbe walked up to him. “He says, ‘You were never going to help us anyway,’” Fulton recounted. “I saw the doubt start to come up.... If they had for a minute mistrusted what I was saying, I probably would have been dead.” He walked toward Zerbe. “I said, ‘If you ever question me, I’ll slit your throat and bleed you out at my feet.’”

Someone intervened and calmed everyone down. Fulton said he told Cox not to worry — he’d help him get what he needed.

At the next meeting, several months later in Anchorage, Fulton was playing the role of arms dealer. With FBI agents eavesdropping nearby, both Fulton and Olson — neither knew the other one was working as an informant — met with militia members, with Cox joining in by speaker phone.

“We discussed their shopping list. Explosives: C4, Semtex, fragmentation grenades … machine guns, silenced weapons. Pretty much a laundry list of bad things,” Fulton said.

Within a month, in March 2011, Fulton flew up to Fairbanks and handed over some of the illegal armament to Olson, who then met up with the defendants in a parking lot. He was about to hand over pistols, silencers and grenades when the parking lot owner walked up to the vehicle and asked what was going on. FBI agents rushed in and made the arrests.

By this time, Fulton was already on his way back to Anchorage.

“I flew home and tried to explain to my wife why there was a moving van at my home,” he said. “We knew that once the arrests went down, it was going to be literally days before people figured out who at least one of the informants was. We needed to be gone by the time those questions even started to be asked.”

Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven Skrocki, who prosecuted the case, scoffed at the assertions of Cox and others that Fulton scared them into talking about plans to kill federal officials. “The argument that Bill Fulton was a danger to Mr. Cox comes only from Mr. Cox,” Skrocki said.

Advertisement

Did Fulton need to go into hiding? Are there people in Alaska who’d like to kill him?

Klein and her co-agent, Derek Espeland, seem dubious. But they say they’ve been in enough investigations to know what it feels like to operate undercover with bad guys.

Advertisement

“You go somewhere and you try not to be detected. And yeah, you have a little bit of fear,” Klein said.

Fulton is trying to finish his book, which he hopes will earn some money. He collected $39,000 from the federal government for his work on the Cox case, but figures he lost a lot more, what with his house, his business and the money he spent playing the big guy in the militia movement.

Still, he’s getting monthly disability payments for an old Army injury. His wife has a job. And for the first time in several years, he’s spending the winter in some place that isn’t Alaska.

[twitter-follow screen_name='BurkeCNN']

(CNN) - The son of a Florida megachurch pastor who is close to President Barack Obama has died, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to local police.

Isaac Hunter, 36, died Tuesday, according to Northland and Summit churches, two Orlando-area congregations with deep ties to his family.

Altamonte Springs Police Department spokesman Robert C. Pelton said officers responded to a call to check on the well-being of Hunter at 10:45 a.m. Tuesday. They found him dead, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Pelton said. The investigation is ongoing, and no foul play is suspected, he added.

Hunter is the son of Joel Hunter, an evangelical who has been a spiritual adviser to Obama since his 2008 presidential campaign. The president and the pastor speak nearly once a week, and Joel Hunter was an adviser to the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships.

Isaac Hunter and his wife, Rhonda, were going through a divorce, according to Florida court records. Hunter resigned as senior pastor of Summit Church in 2012 after acknowledging a three-year affair with a member of the church staff.

""All of us are grieving for the Hunter family, and we will deeply miss Isaac. Words cannot express the sorrow we're feeling,"" said a statement by Vernon Rainwater, a pastor at Northland, which is based in Longwood, Florida.

""We love this family and are so grateful for the impact they have had on each of our lives. I have loved Isaac since he was a child, and I know this ... Isaac loved Jesus. And we are assured of his continuing relationship with Christ now in heaven.""

With several campuses in central Florida, Northland is one of the largest evangelical churches in the state. Like his father, Isaac Hunter had been an evangelical megachurch pastor, a leader of Summit Church in Orlando.

""By now you may have heard that our former Senior Pastor, Isaac Hunter, died today,"" Pastor Jeff Kern wrote on Summit's website. ""As I write these words, it is hard to express the deep sorrow we as a staff team are feeling for this tragic loss.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Rhonda, their three children and their extended family. We love them and it is our desire to support them in any way we can during this difficult time,"" Kern continued.

""As we look back on Isaac’s ministry here at Summit, we are profoundly grateful for the impact he had in all of our lives. We know that Isaac is deeply loved by Jesus, even in a time of brokenness ...,"" he wrote.

Cameron Strang, the founder of an Orlando-based evangelical magazine, described Isaac Hunter as a friend and former pastor who had ""some significant struggles.""

""Isaac was my pastor for several years. He was an amazing teacher,"" Strang, founder of Relevant magazine, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday evening.

""Around this time last year, Isaac resigned his position at our church amid some very public scandals. He had a wife of 13 years and (three) young kids, and the time since then has been incredibly difficult for our church. His family lives around the corner from me, and I see them often,"" Strang continued.

""Isaac loved Jesus and was a talented and dedicated pastor for more than a decade. But he had some significant struggles. The unfathomable news today is devastating for many. Please pray for his family. Please pray for our church. Pray for his kids,"" Strang said.

Friends of the Hunter family also expressed condolences on Twitter on Tuesday night.

Joshua DuBois, former director of the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships, wrote:

Security concerns have prompted a federal prosecutor in Houston to withdraw from a big racketeering case involving the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, which has been a focus of the investigations into the slayings of the Kaufman County district attorney and an assistant.

Assistant U.S. attorney Jay Hileman on Tuesday notified attorneys representing 34 defendants, The Dallas Morning News and TPM reported. A Justice Department prosecutor in Washington, D.C., who is already involved in the case will take over.

Neither the Morning News nor TPM specified the security issues or say whether Hileman or his family had been threatened.

""He's obviously made a decision based on something,"" said defense attorney Richard O. Ely II, who added that he had been threatened when he was a prosecutor.

One of the group's former top leaders, Terry Sillers, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate in the case, which is being prosecuted in Houston. Authorities have him in protective custody.

The neo-Nazi gang has come under renewed scrutiny since Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found dead in their home Saturday. Investigators said he had been shot 20 times. In January, country prosecutor Mark Hasse was gunned down in a parking lot not far from the courthouse.

KTVT-TV reported Tuesday that investigators found evidence near the McLellands' home indicating they may been watched before the killings.

The Anti-Defamation League has ranked the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, a white supremacist prison gang, as the nation's most violent extremist group. The Texas Department of Public Safety lists the brotherhood as a ""significant"" threat.

Here's some of what the ADL said in in a report last year:

Since 2000, ABT members and associates have committed at least 29 murders in the United States, all in Texas or neighboring states. The true number is likely considerably higher, as most murders that occur behind prison walls do not get reported by the media. The 29 known killings are all ""street"" killings, more evidence of the growing presence of racist prison gangs on the streets of America.

Also Tuesday, KSAT-TV reported that one of the racketeering defendants, James Francis Sampsell, is a ""general"" for the group. Federal agents said they recorded him in late January selling a quarter pound of methamphetamine in a Walmart parking lot in Conroe, Texas, and arrested him after a chase."

Dr. Vincent Di Maio, an expert testifying for the defense, gave a version of events that was consistent with the defense’s theory of the deadly confrontation between Zimmerman, 29, and Martin, 17, on Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford, Fla.

Zimmerman, charged with second-degree murder, maintains he shot Martin in self-defense after the teenager attacked him.

PHOTOS: The controversial case in pictures

Di Maio said that he had examined the autopsy, toxicology and photographic evidence and concluded that the evidence was consistent with Zimmerman’s statements to authorities that Martin was straddling him and that Zimmerman fired his gun with his right hand. The path of the bullet ran from Martin’s left side through part of his heart and into a portion of the right lung, Di Maio testified.

“The medical evidence ... is consistent with his statement,” Di Maio said of Zimmerman’s version of events.

Di Maio also testified that the hole in Martin’s shirt showed that the muzzle of Zimmerman’s gun was touching the clothing, and that the wound on Martin’s chest showed that his skin was two to four inches from the muzzle.

Di Maio said he based his conclusions on analysis of debris from the gunshot, including what he called “powder tattoo marks” surrounding the wound, which give the appearance of a reddish, circular rash on the skin. Such marks, he said, would not be present if the muzzle had been held against Martin’s skin.

“So … the muzzle of the gun was against the clothing. But the clothing itself had to be two to four inches away from the body at the time Mr. Martin was shot,” he said.

“This is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman’s account – that Mr. Martin was over him, leaning forward at the time he was shot,” Di Maio said.

WHO’S WHO: The Travon Martin case

Di Maio was the first witness on the 11th day of the trial, the second full day of the defense presentation. The defense could finish its case this week. The trial began June 10 with jury selection.

Di Maio also said that there was “definite evidence” of six impacts that caused wounds to Zimmerman’s nose, the back of his head and his forehead. Those injuries were also consistent with Zimmerman’s account of events, Di Maio said.

Di Maio differed with the state’s expert witness on how long Martin was alive after the shot. Di Maio said Martin lived from one to three minutes. The state’s forensic expert, Dr. Shiping Bao, originally gave a similar estimate, but changed his testimony last week, saying that Martin could have been alive for up to 10 minutes.

Earlier, Judge Debra S. Nelson held an evidentiary hearing on whether to admit a defense animation of the confrontation. The prosecution objects to the animation, saying it isn’t accurate.

The judge could rule on admissibility as soon as Tuesday afternoon.

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Washington (AP) — An Army sergeant pleaded guilty Monday to killing four other soldiers and a Navy officer in 2009 at mental health clinic in Baghdad during the Iraq War, describing how he gunned down the men and saying he was in a ""rage"" when he began his rampage.

The plea agreement in a military court at Joint Base Lewis-McChord means Sgt. John Russell will avoid the death sentence. His maximum sentence would be a life term. He testified Monday to persuade Army judge Col. David Conn to accept the agreement. Conn agreed.

Russell went on a shooting spree at the Camp Liberty Combat Stress Center near Baghdad in May 2009. It was one of the worst instances of soldier-on-soldier violence in the Iraq war.

In court, Russell said he was in a ""rage"" when he opened fire.

""I wanted the pain to stop,"" Russell testified in court at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, talking in a husky voice. He read a written statement detailing his memories of the killings.

Russell was nearing the end of his third tour when his behavior changed, members of his unit testified in 2009. They said he became more distant in the days before the May 11, 2009, attack and that he seemed paranoid that his unit was trying to end his career.

On May 8, Russell sought help at a combat stress clinic at Camp Stryker, where his unit was located. On May 10, Russell was referred to the Camp Liberty clinic, where he received counseling and prescription medication.

The following day witnesses saw Russell crying and talking about hurting himself. He went back to the Camp Liberty clinic, where a doctor told him he needed to get help or he would hurt himself. Russell tried to surrender to military police to lock him up so he wouldn't hurt himself or others, witnesses said.

Military prosecutors say Russell left the clinic and later returned with a rifle he took from his unit headquarters and began firing.

Russell said he wanted to hurt a doctor who he thought had earlier encouraged him to commit suicide. He didn't find that doctor, but still carried out the shooting.

Of the dead, Russell had interacted only with Springle, who tried to help him a couple of days before the attack.

Yates raised a gun at him after Russell killed Springle and Houseal, but Yates dropped the gun and ran.

Yates ""ran and I ran after him, and I shot him,"" Russell said.

Yates' mother, Shawna Van Blargan, joined Springle's wife and son in court. They held each other tightly as Russell talked about killing their family members.

Van Blargan cried out when Russell described killing her son. She left the courtroom.

Russell also remembered finding Barton hiding under a table. Russell shot him in the head.

Bueno-Galdos tried to grab Russell's rifle. Russell testified he shot Bueno-Galdos in the chest, then shot him once more while he lay face down on the ground.

Two evaluations presented during a 2009 hearing said Russell suffered from severe depression with psychotic features and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. A March 2011 evaluation said the major depression with psychotic features was in partial remission."

That’s not a phrase that Carol Champommier ever expected to see. She’s a schoolteacher, not an activist; a rule follower, not a renegade.

But Champommier is suing the United States because a federal agent shot her son to death in a parking lot encounter that played out like a scene from an action movie, where two unrelated story lines coalesce in violent tragedy.

Government lawyers contend the shooting three years ago was reasonable — that 18-year-old Zac Champommier tried to run down an officer with his car, creating a “deadly, immediate threat” that justified gunfire.

Carol Champommier blames poor training, reckless conduct and a coverup by officers unwilling to acknowledge they killed a panicky kid, not a criminal.

Zac had driven to the parking lot in Studio City to meet a young man he’d chatted with online. But when Zac arrived, he saw the acquaintance scuffling with what seemed to be a bunch of middle-aged toughs. Apparently, the acquaintance had been looking for Zac, and the men had seen him peering into parked cars and thought he might be a thief.

The men were part of an undercover law enforcement task force: sheriff’s deputies, LAPD officers and DEA agents, in leather jackets and T-shirts. They’d just completed a narcotics raid and were “debriefing” in the public lot, with the drugs and cash they’d confiscated still in their unmarked cars.

It’s too late now to ask what Zac thought as he stepped on the gas of his mother’s Toyota and the car struck a deputy holding a gun. A DEA agent nearby responded by firing off three shots.

Advertisement

Was Zac trying to mow down officers to keep them from arresting his acquaintance? Or was he just trying to maneuver a balky stick shift to flee men dressed like hoodlums and armed with guns?

Testimony in Champommier’s lawsuit ended this week in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald. Her friends and neighbors from Porter Ranch showed up. So did Zac’s friends, who were on spring break. Champommier counseled them on her Facebook page: “Attire is business casual, no flip-flops.”

Attorneys will make closing statements later this month. Then the judge — who heard the case without a jury — will determine if the use of deadly force by officers was “objectively reasonable” under the circumstances that night.

It’s a question of both perception and facts, and the trial offered plenty of both.

A customer at the Chipotle restaurant nearby described two men with guns in the parking lot. One “looked like a biker person” in a leather jacket. The other held his weapon “like in the movies, very professionally” before firing “boom, boom, boom” at Zac’s car.

Advertisement

“I thought they were all biker gangs,” the witness testified. He was so unnerved by the violence, he rushed his children into his car and drove off with their seat belts unfastened.

Crash and ballistics experts spent days on the stand parsing details: the trajectory of the bullets, the speed of Zac’s car and how many seconds it takes to unholster a weapon, draw, aim and fire.

Advertisement

Champommier sat in the front row each day, staring at photos of her car with bloodstains and a bullet hole in the driver’s spot, listening to witnesses and lawyers spar over the final moments of her son’s life, watching DEA agent Peter LoPresti demonstrate how he pointed his gun at the car’s driver and fired the fatal shots.

I wondered as I watched LoPresti on the stand, earnest and unemotional, how many times he must have privately replayed that evening in his mind, trying to recall exactly what he felt, thought and did in the moments that changed so many lives.

Advertisement

LoPresti fired, he testified, because Zac’s car rammed the deputy hard enough to thrust the lawman onto its hood. Things happened so fast he didn’t have time to think. “It was simply a reaction” to his perception that officers’ lives were in danger, he said.

We “had to have that threat stopped. That’s why I shot.”

Advertisement

::

It’s not hard to imagine that in the context of that night, the unexpected might have felt like a threat.

Advertisement

That the officers, amped up on adrenaline, might have been primed to respond with firepower to trouble in the parking lot. That the public might have presumed that the dressed-down cops were actually gun-toting criminals.

Reasonableness can be a squishy concept; your view depends on your prism.

Advertisement

The government seems determined to blame Zac for his own demise, questioning, in finger-wagging style, even the young man’s choice to meet up with a stranger he’d connected with online. The judge, to his credit, shut that avenue down.

The issue is not what brought Zac to that parking lot but what circumstances led to the fatal shots.

Advertisement

“These agents and officers have a tough job,” acknowledged Champommier’s lawyer, Cara Eisenberg. But they created an unnecessary danger by debriefing in a crowded public parking lot.

“Our position is that they shouldn’t set up a situation where they can’t take the time to discern the difference between a minor traffic accident ... and a threat of deadly force,” she said. “Nobody hates the cops. We just want them to be as fair as possible, and not do harm to the rest of us.”

Advertisement

It’s not uncommon, DEA agents testified, for undercover officers to assemble in a public spot and leave their cache of seized guns, narcotics and cash unguarded in their unmarked cars.

It’s also courting trouble. Isn’t it reasonable to expect that officers would log that evidence at the station and lock it down before heading off to discuss the case?

Advertisement

The nature of much of law enforcement is making split-second choices in life-or-death situations. That’s why it troubles me that the government seems so cavalier about how that evening turned out.

Maybe those officers need to believe they were not responsible for what happened in that parking lot. It must be tough to contemplate the possibility that a frightened young man who meant no harm was gunned down for no good reason that night.

Fort Hood shooting suspect apologizes for taking part in what he calls U.S. war against Muslims.

Army Maj. Nidal Hasan says he regrets serving in the U.S. military.

Hasan%27s trial on 45 counts of premeditated and attempted premeditated murder is set to begin Aug. 6.

FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) — The Army psychiatrist charged in the 2009 Fort Hood mass shooting said in a statement to Fox News that the U.S. government is at war with Islam.

""My complicity was on behalf of a government that openly acknowledges that it would hate for the law of Almighty Allah to be the supreme law of the land,"" Maj. Nidal Hasan said in a lengthy statement released to Fox News (http://fxn.ws/1cafkA2) on Saturday. He then says in reference to a war on Islam, ""I participated in it.""

Hasan, 42, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the November 2009 attack at the Texas Army post. His trial is scheduled to start Aug. 6. He faces the death penalty if convicted.

The American-born Muslim is serving as his own attorney and hasn't spoken much in pre-trial hearings or jury selection. Fox News reported that Hasan didn't directly address the shooting in his statement, which it said is more than six pages long.

Hasan also said in the statement that he regrets serving in the Army.

""I would like to begin by repenting to Almighty Allah and apologize to the Mujahideen, the believers, and the innocent. ... I ask for their forgiveness for participating in the illegal and immoral aggression against Muslims, their religion and their lands,"" he told Fox News in the statement.

Hasan also has objected to the judge's denial of his ""defense of others"" strategy, which must show that killing was necessary to prevent the immediate harm or death of others. Col. Tara Osborn has barred him from telling jurors that he shot U.S. troops because they were an imminent threat to Taliban leaders in Afghanistan.

At a hearing earlier this month, Hasan, who is paralyzed from the abdomen down after being shot by police the day of the Fort Hood shooting, said he wanted jurors to know that he was being forced to wear a camouflage uniform that he believes represents ""an enemy of Islam."""

Editor’s Note: Jeffrey Bellin, an assistant professor of law at Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, formerly served as a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.

(CNN) —

The tragic killing of Trayvon Martin and the initial decision by the police not to arrest George Zimmerman for that killing have focused public attention on Florida’s “stand your ground” law.

According to police, Zimmerman claims self-defense, but many observers can’t understand how a grown man with a gun can plausibly claim that he was forced to kill a teenager armed only with some candy.

If that’s the law of self-defense in Florida (and elsewhere), these observers argue, the law needs to change.

Courtesy Jeffrey Bellin Jeffrey Bellin

The law of self-defense is at its core about reasonableness. If a person reasonably perceives a serious threat of harm, and uses reasonable force to meet that threat, the law justifies even deadly force, and it does so even if it turns out that the perceived threat was illusory.

People have differing views of what’s reasonable and, as a consequence, self-defense laws (which vary by jurisdiction) have always attempted to further define the concept. Until very recently, Florida’s definition of reasonableness, as in many states, incorporated a longstanding principle, the “duty to retreat.”

This principle required that someone who found themselves in a violent confrontation had to try to defuse the situation and retreat “to the wall” before resorting to deadly force.

In other words, deadly force was only permitted as a last resort. The basic idea was simple: If more people backed down, retreated or stepped aside, fewer people would be killed.

The “duty to retreat” also made it easier for prosecutors to prove that a killing was not in self-defense. The facts that can be proven are often murky (particularly when of the two people who know what happened, one is the defendant and the other is dead) and prosecutors could often, by pointing to a defendant’s failure to retreat, obtain a conviction even without establishing the precise facts.

In American jurisdictions there has long been an exception to the duty to retreat called the “Castle Doctrine.” As then-Judge (and later U.S. Supreme Court Justice) Benjamin Cardozo explained in 1914: “It is not now and never has been the law that a man assailed in his own dwelling is bound to retreat. If assailed there, he may stand his ground and resist the attack. He is under no duty to take to the fields and the highways, a fugitive from his own home.”

In recent times, “stand your ground” laws extended this concept in many states beyond the home to any place where a person might lawfully be found, such as a bar or a public sidewalk. Florida’s version enacted in 2005 (over the objection of many in law enforcement) is one of the most far reaching.

The law states that a person “who is attacked” anywhere he is lawfully present has “no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm.”

Importantly, a person cannot invoke this provision if he is “engaged in unlawful activity” or “initially provokes the use of force against himself.” Finally, in Florida, once self-defense becomes an issue at trial, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense – a heavy burden.

This is the legal backdrop against which Florida’s prosecuting authorities must assess all claims of self-defense, including Zimmerman’s. In an ideal world, law enforcement would make this assessment by thoroughly investigating the case and, after determining the provable facts, comparing those facts to the law.

Critical to this determination will be evidence reflecting: how the confrontation began and how the suspect acted after the confrontation (prosecutors often look for actions such as flight or a cover-up that indicate a “consciousness of guilt”). Perhaps most critically, investigators will compare all the evidence (physical and otherwise) with the suspect’s statement (if any) about what happened.

If the investigation reveals sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Zimmerman was not acting in self-defense (as Florida law defines that concept), he can be prosecuted. If not, charges are unwarranted.

Depending on the facts that ultimately emerge, the “stand your ground” law may ultimately control the legal outcome of the Trayvon Martin case. If, as a result, Florida’s citizens and legislators (and those in other states) see that law in a new light, they can change the law, perhaps leading to fewer tragic outcomes in the future.

As the country searches its soul in the wake of the recent wave of questionable killings by police, Americans of all races are struggling with a distressing sense of deja vu. This is not the first time we have struggled with this anguish and it will not be the last. But there may be a new prospect for hope this time.

Robert Baleshot dead 16 Afghan civilians before turning himself in Bales pleaded guilty in June, sparing him the prospect of a death sentence

(CNN) —

On Friday, a military jury decided U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will get life in prison without parole for killing 16 Afghan villagers.

Yet victims left behind – some bearing physical scars, others with emotional ones from seeing their kin indiscriminately, brutally gunned down – say that, with that sentence, they don’t feel they got justice.

Friday’s decision was not entirely unexpected. In June Bales’ pleaded guilty to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts, spared himself from the prospect of a death sentence. He also pleaded guilty to charges related to illicit steroid and alcohol use.

But it still remained up to a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel to decide whether Bales should be eligible for parole.

They decided Friday he is not, according to Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield with Joint Base Lewis-McChord. That means the 39-year-old will spend the rest of his life in a military prison.

That’s not punishment enough for Haji Wazir. Now 40, Wazir was inside his home in the Panjwai district of Afghanistan’s southern Kandahar province in the pre-dawn hours of March 11, 2012, when Bales barged in.

What followed was a nightmare, ending with bloodied, limp and in some instances scorched bodies.

“We wanted this murderer to be executed, but we didn’t get our wish,” Wazir said through an interpreter Friday from the Washington state U.S. Army base where the sentence was handed down.

The sentence was not just, he added, before appealing to the U.S public to put themselves in his shoes.

“I’m asking the average American right here: If somebody jumps into your house in the middle of the night and kills 11 members of your family and tries to burn them, what punishment would you be passing on that person?”

Wazir and his family weren’t the only ones torn on that horrific morning some 18 months ago.

Bales slipped away from Camp Belambay, the remote outpost where he was stationed, and into one village, where he began shooting at civilians. After that, he returned to the base, reloaded and went out again to target another village.

He left a trail of blood and gore in both villages, with nine children among the dead. Witnesses claimed that the U.S. soldier dragged some bodies of his victims’ outside and set them ablaze.

The horror ended when Bales returned, once again, to Camp Belambay and turned himself in.

In the subsequent hours and days, some spoke highly about Bales, such as attorney Emma Scanlan who described him as a “devoted husband, father and dedicated member of the armed service.”

Yet in Afghanistan and around the world, the massacre quickly spurred outrage.

The Taliban vowed to retaliate “by killing and beheading Americans anywhere in the country.” Afghan President Hamid Karzai suggested, after meeting with villagers who’d seen the carnage and wanted Bales to be tried there to “heal our broken hearts,” that the incident had put U.S.-Afghan relations at a breaking point.

“It is by all means the end of the rope here,” Karzai said then. “The end of the rope that nobody can afford such luxuries anymore.”

Bales was identified as the culprit days later and eventually put in solitary confinement at the U.S. military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

The military announced last December that Bales faced a court-martial.

The Army soldier spoke at this week’s sentencing, calling what he’d done “an act of cowardice.”

“I hid behind a mask of Bravado,” Bales said, according to a tweet from court from Drew Mikkelsen of CNN Seattle affiliate KING. Also admitting he’d taken steroids and drank sporadically, the soldier apologized to his victims.

“I am responsible,” he said.

Because of him, some in Afghanistan are still suffering the consequences.

Haji Mohammad Naim saw Bales come into his southwest Afghanistan home around 2 a.m. and kill women there, as well as some of his children. Bullets struck him in the neck and the face.

That incident and others in which U.S. soldiers have killed civilians – including another of Naim’s sons, in a separate incident, he says – have disgraced American forces in the eyes of many Afghans. Children in his village used to run toward U.S. troops, Naim said; now, they “run away and try to hide.”

If America is to improve its image, there must be accountability, he said. And if Washington wants to help rebuild Afghanistan, “try to send the right people, not maniacs and psychos like (Bales).”

Still, even if the U.S. governments acts differently, some pain and suffering can’t be undone.

Recalling tears shed by Bales’ mother during the legal proceedings, Naim said, “But at least she can go and visit him.

“What about us?” he asked rhetorically. “Our family members are actually 6 feet under, and there’s no way that we can visit them at all.

“They’re gone.”

USA TODAY

Details continue to emerge Tuesday surrounding yesterday's Washington Navy Yard shooting spree. Key facts we now know:

How it began

The Navy first reported via Twitter that there was an ""active shooter"" at Building 197 at the Navy Yard, and that shots had been fired at 8:20 a.m. ET.

What happened

In a newly revised sequence of events, federal investigators said they believe Alexis cleared a security checkpoint with his contractor identification and carried a shotgun into building 197. An official said that investigators now believe that Alexis stopped in a men's room where he assembled the weapon and proceeded to site on the third or fourth floor of the building that overlooked an interior atrium.

Alexis, the official said, began firing indiscriminately on the people below with the law enforcement-style shotgun. After firing several rounds, the official said Alexis ran down a flight of stairs where he confronted and shot a security officer. It is believed that Alexis took the officer's handgun and returned to the overlook where he continued to shoot.

At some point, the official said, Alexis again left the overlook and confronted a victim described as a maintenance person or building staffer. Alexis allegedly shot that person and returned one last time to the overlook where he was ultimately killed in a confrontation with police.

The victims

Thirteen people, including the shooter, died in the one-man assault, according to Washington Mayor Vincent Gray. One person died at the hospital; the rest died at the scene, he said. Those killed ranged in age from 46 to 73. Gray said eight other people were injured, three of whom were shot.

The shooter

Aaron Alexis, 34, was confirmed as the shooter by the FBI. Alexis had a history with guns. From 2008 to 2011, Alexis served with Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 46 at the Naval Air Station in Fort Worth. He lived in that area and was arrested at least once in 2010 for firing a gun through the ceiling of his apartment. He told police it had been an accident.

Seattle police released details a shooting incident from 2004 in which Alexis shot the rear tires of a vehicle owned by a construction worker doing work in his neighborhood. Alexis told police he had an anger-fueled ""blackout"" but added that he felt he had been ""mocked"" by the workers and ""disrespected"" by the workers.

Weapon

Alexis purchased the 12-gauge shotgun in recent days at a gun store in Virginia and took it with him to the Navy Yard shortly before authorities believe he carried out the assault.

Contrary to earlier reports provided by law enforcement officials, Alexis was not believed to be in possession of an AR-15 rifle.

The location

Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters is in Building 197 at the Washington Navy Yard. The headquarters is the workplace for about 3,000 people.

The command is responsible for engineering, building, buying and maintaining ships, submarines and combat systems for the fleet. The sea systems command is the largest of the Navy's five system commands, with an annual budget of nearly $30 billion.

Local fallout

• The White House announced it will postpone Michelle Obama's Musica Latina event.

• The Senate complex was briefly on lockdown.

• Marine Barracks Washington was on partial lockdown.

• Washington Nationals baseball game against the Atlanta Braves was rescheduled.

• Flights in and out of Washington Reagan National Airport were stopped Monday morning but resumed before 11 a.m."

No motive for shootings determined yet

Security and police response draw controversy

Navy secretary orders reviews of Alexis%27 four-year naval career

The Washington Navy Yard reopened Thursday in an atmosphere of sadness for those lost in Monday's shooting spree, mystery over why it happened and controversy over the law enforcement response to it.

The FBI says Navy contractor Aaron Alexis, 34, assembled a shotgun in a men's room and killed 12 people before he was fatally shot in a gunfight with law enforcement.

FBI Director James Comey said Thursday that Alexis appeared to be moving with ""no discernible"" pattern as he rampaged through Building 197 of the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters.

""It appears to me that he was wandering the halls and hunting people to shoot,"" Comey said.

He said Alexis entered the building and went to the fourth floor, carrying a bag. He went into a bathroom and emerged with a Remington 870 shotgun. Both the barrel and stock of the weapon had been shortened.

Comey said Alexis almost immediately began blazing away on the fourth floor, before going to the third floor where he repeated his actions. The building has an atrium, but, contrary to earlier reports, he was not shooting down from upper floors into the atrium.

He said Alexis went to the lobby where he shot a security guard and took his weapon, a Beretta semiautomatic pistol. He resumed moving through the building, focusing mainly on the 3rd and 4th floors, Comey said.

When Alexis ran out of ammunition for the shotgun, he started using the Beretta. He was killed by responding officers. Comey said his motive remained unknown.

A government official with knowledge of the investigation told USA TODAY that investigators from the FBI's computer forensics team were examining a computer at the Residence Inn where Alexis stayed. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity, said investigators found undisclosed ""digital evidence.""

WUSA-TV Washington reported that security at the scene and the response by Capitol Police has raised questions.

Anthony Meely, chairman of the Fraternal Order of Police Naval District Labor Committee, says a minimum of 11 Navy police officers were supposed to be working at the Navy Yard on Monday, but only seven were at the site. Because six had to continuing manning gates, only one could immediately respond to the attack at Building 197, Meely said.

""People died because of management rights, the right to make a decision to save money,"" Meely says.

""I take our response to this tragedy and our support to law enforcement partners very seriously,"" Capitol Chief Kim Dine said in a statement. ""While I am the chief of Police, at my core I am a police officer who feels strongly about our shared commitment and responsibilities. ... I place a high priority on law enforcement agency relationships and law enforcement coordination and communication.""

Navy Secretary Ray Mabus ordered reviews of Alexis' four-year naval career to determine whether his conduct warranted his security clearance and fit-for-duty status. Mabus also ordered rapid assessments of the rules for when contractors are required to notify the Navy that they've reviewed an employee's clearance and of the Navy's broader security clearance system.

Building 197 remained off-limits Thursday, but employees elsewhere at the Navy Yard were reporting for work. Some said it was too soon for them to talk about the tragedy.

""It's a little surreal, I guess,"" Brooke Roberts, an engineer who works across the street from Building 197, told the Associated Press. ""You don't think this sort of thing can happen to you at your workplace, so you're just not prepared for it.""

The shooter at the Navy Yard was a former Navy reservist who since leaving the military had been working as a defense contractor. Fox News has learned that Navy Secretary Ray Mabus on Tuesday plans to order a review of security at all Navy and Marine installations.

But Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee, revealed late Monday that a forthcoming inspector general report will address security procedures at Navy installations. Though that report has not yet been released, Fox News confirms that it determines the Navy is not taking enough security precautions when it comes to outside contractors.

The audit was expected to look at the Navy Installations Command, which is part of the Washington Navy Yard, among other locations. The details of the audit were first reported by Time.

Turner wrote to the Department of Defense inspector general on Monday calling for an ""immediate briefing"" on the findings.

More On This...

""Given the disturbing events of today, I am highly concerned that the access control systems at our nation's military installations have serious security flaws,"" he wrote.

""It is my understanding the IG report indicates the Navy may have implemented an unproven system in order to cut costs. I also learned that potentially numerous felons may have been able to gain unrestricted access to several military installations across the country due to the insufficient background checks, increasing the risk to our military personnel and civilian employees.""

According to an inspector general memo, the audit began in September 2012. Officials were looking at how Navy facilities were ""mitigating access control risks to Navy installations.""

Details are still emerging about how and why Aaron Alexis, 34, walked into a single building at the Navy Yard and started shooting, killing 12. Alexis also died.

It is unclear whether any changes in security protocol made a difference. Time reported that the forthcoming audit shows many felons have gotten unauthorized access and bypassed Navy security.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/14/us/colorado-school-gunman-karl-pierson/,2013-12-14 00:00:00,"['Michael Martinez', 'Stan Wilson']","School gunman Karl Pierson liked debate, running, but acted ""weird""","Story highlights Colorado school gunman Karl Pierson liked debate and cross-country running But he alienated peers with talk about communism and winning every argument ""He was pretty geeky and nerdy, but in a charming way,"" friend says One neighbor describes him as bright but a social misfit whose peers ridiculed him

(CNN) —

To many of his neighbors, Colorado school gunman Karl Pierson was the wholesome boy next door who liked achievement and ran on the cross country team. He even worked on an Eagle Scout project two years ago.

To schoolmates, Pierson was known for his outspoken intelligence that served him well on the debate team. But at times, he acted “weird” and alienated peers with rants about communism and his aggressiveness to win every argument, they said.

One neighbor described him as bright but a social misfit whose peers ridiculed him. His mother had transferred him from another high school because of the mockery and altercations, the neighbor said.

Pierson, 18, opened fire Friday inside Arapahoe High School, where he was a senior. Claire Davis, 17, was wounded in a point-blank shooting, and Pierson, who apparently didn’t know Davis, then killed himself in the library, Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson told reporters Friday.

“He was a really smart kid. He was intelligent. He knew how to speak; he really did. I don’t think I ever won an argument with that kid,” junior Daylon Stutz said in the school parking lot on Saturday, when students were allowed to retrieve their cars.

Stutz, an offensive tackle on the football team, had known Pierson since the two shared a human behavior class when Stutz was a freshman and Pierson a sophomore. They worked on a class experiment together in which they went into the community and tried breaking unwritten rules, Stutz said.

“I did think he was a little weird, but I didn’t think he was, like, bad weird,” Stutz added. “He always kind of talked about how America was a communist country, how the government was, like, trying to take us over and stuff. I don’t know, just some weird stuff that I didn’t really pay close attention to, but nothing that alarmed me.

“He was definitely kind to me. I never saw him mean to anybody. He wasn’t condescending to anyone,” he said.

In Friday’s shooting, Pierson was armed with a shotgun, a bandolier stocked with ammunition, a machete and three Molotov cocktails, Robinson said. Pierson fired five shots within 1 minute and 20 seconds, he said.

Pierson entered his school looking for the debate team’s coach, CNN affiliate KUSA reported, citing Robinson. Pierson was apparently seeking revenge against a faculty member because of a “confrontation or disagreement,” the sheriff said.

High school senior Frank Woronoff said he had known Pierson since they were freshmen.

“He was the last person I would expect to shoot up a high school,” Woronoff said.

“He was pretty geeky and nerdy but in a charming way, one of the nicest, most humble people I know,” he added.

Senior Chris Davis, 18, was among many students Saturday trying to make sense of Pierson’s shooting rampage.

“He was a weird kid,” Davis said. “He’s a self-proclaimed communist, just wears Soviet shirts all the time.”

Pierson became easily aggravated, “always liked to be right” and didn’t like losing, Davis said.

“It seems realistic, now, that he did it,” Davis added.

The home where authorities believe Pierson armed himself is five miles from his school and appeared vacant Saturday. Its front door was sealed and boarded a day after federal agents raided the property and executed search warrants.

Why? Sheriff wants to know reason for Colorado school shooting

A man who declined to be identified in an CNN interview lives a few doors away and said he has known Pierson since he was a boy. In the last few days, the neighbor noticed Pierson driving at excessive speeds throughout their normally quiet, modest middle-class suburb.

The neighbor said Pierson’s mother, Barbara, transferred her son to Arapahoe High School from nearby Highland Ranch High School because her son had been subjected to constant ridicule and physical altercations.

“He was socially awkward and just didn’t seem to fit into the larger teenage groups, and I think that weighed on him,” the neighbor told CNN.

Lessons of Columbine and other school shootings helped in Arapahoe

The neighbor said Pierson’s parents had been separated for years, and Karl was living with his mother and younger sister.

“While Karl was socially a misfit around kids his age, he was intellectually bright and loved to debate in school,” the neighbor said. “If he was disciplined in a debate class, that must have meant everything to him. It may have been trigger point.”

Pierson was active in his community, KUSA reported.

He took pride in how he routinely won contests on his speech and debate team, the station reported. He showed off his first place and second place trophies online.

One neighbor described him as a “nice young man,” the affiliate said.

In fact, the TV outlet interviewed him seven years ago about the design of a quarter commemorating Colorado.

Pierson submitted questions to the station in 2008 for a show about the Colorado Supreme Court and asked a question at a U.S. Senate debate in 2010, the news outlet said.

He Left The Newspaper In']","Renisha McBride, killed on porch while seeking help, buried in Detroit","Less than a week after she was killed by a shotgun blast to the face while seeking help for a car accident, Renisha McBride went to her final resting place on Friday, the latest civil rights figure in a panoply of slain young African Americans.

A steady stream of people entered the House of Prayer and Praise church in Detroit on Friday for the funeral of McBride, 19, who was shot to death about 2:30 a.m. on Saturday on the porch of a home in Dearborn Heights, Mich. Civil rights leaders have called for an investigation of the shooting using language that recalls the racially charged deaths of Trayvon Martin, Emmett Till and Yusef Hawkins.

The family and her supporters say the woman, who was a recent graduate of Southfield High School and had just gotten a job at Ford Motor Co., was in a car accident in the early morning hours. Her cellphone battery was dead so she walked several blocks seeking help at a house. The person inside, a man who has not been named, went to the door and fired a shotgun in her face, according to police reports.

“It’s hard to be believe it’s an accident when a gun is in her face and the trigger is pulled,” the family’s attorney, Gerald Thurswell, told reporters.

“It appears this young woman was merely seeking help following a car accident as her cellphone went dead,” said a statement by leaders of the Detroit branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. “After knocking on a neighbor’s door, instead of being aided in the situation or police called for an investigation, she was shot fatally in the head. Have we become a society where we are no longer our neighbors’ keeper?

“This shooting must be investigated at every level,” said the civil rights group, one of several involved in the case.

All have called for an investigation into the shooting and the familiar refrain of “No Justice, No Peace” was chanted by about 50 people protesting at the Dearborn Heights police station this week. That slogan was frequent battle cry during the protests over the acquittal of George Zimmerman who shot unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.

“We are in prayer for the family of Renisha McBride but we are also urgently calling for justice,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, also involved with Martin family, said in a statement. Sharpton’s National Action Network is one of the groups calling for an investigation in Michigan.

No charges have been filed in the case, but authorities have said they were investigating. According to police, the man told investigators that he thought someone was trying to break into his home and accidentally discharged the gun.

Earlier this week, police said they requested a warrant in the case. The Wayne County prosecutor’s office sent the request back to police Wednesday for additional investigation before making a charging decision.

“We will not be able to make a charging decision until the requested work has been completed,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement.

“I’m confident when the evidence comes it will show that my client was justified and acted as a reasonable person would who was in fear for his life,” Cheryl Carpenter, one of two lawyers representing the unnamed man, told the Detroit News.

Town officials ask media to respect community%27s request for quiet reflection on Saturday

Town asks residents for acts of %22service and kindness%22 to honor those killed in last year%27s attack

Some media groups%2C including USA TODAY%2C will honor request and stay away

NEWTOWN, Conn. — Local government officials are urging the news media to stay away Saturday, the first anniversary of the Dec. 14 shootings that killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

""The community is choosing to remember and honor those who lost their lives in the Sandy Hook tragedy in ways that are quiet, personal and respectful — centered on themes of kindness, love and service to others,"" Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra said in a written statement Monday.

Llodra said the town will not be hosting any memorial events and requested that the public and the press allow Newtown residents ""the time to be alone and quiet with time for personal and communal reflection.""

USA TODAY Editor-in-Chief David Callaway said the news organization will not report on the anniversary from Newtown on Saturday. ""We'll respect the wishes of the people of Newtown,"" he said.

Some other media organizations, including CNN, have announced that they also will not be in Newtown to cover the anniversary of the tragedy.

""While CNN plans to cover the one-year anniversary across our networks and platforms, we are respecting the wishes of the families, and we are not reporting from Newtown on Saturday,"" CNN spokeswoman Bridget Leininger said.

Craig Duff, professor of journalism at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, says each media outlet has to make up its own mind whether to be in Newtown Saturday to report the tragic anniversary. Journalists, he says, should ask themselves whether being in Newtown is essential to reporting their stories. ""If the answer is no, don't go there,"" Duff says.

Media outlets that decide to go to Newtown should consider the footprint they will make, he says. They should be respectful and, for example, ""not bring in three live broadcast trucks when a small crew can cover any news that may happen.""

Llodra said she is encouraging every Newtown resident to use the days leading up to the anniversary ""as a time to formally commit to acts of service and kindness to honor those who lost their lives at Sandy Hook.""

Before killing 26 people at the school, gunman Adam Lanza shot to death his mother, Nancy Lanza, at their Sandy Hook home on the morning of Dec. 14. The gunman later committed suicide at the school.

Newtown churches and other houses of worship will hold special services Saturday to reflect on and honor those who were killed.

Llodra said she and other Newtown officials met with the local print media last week and the national TV media Monday and will meet with USA TODAY and other national media Tuesday. She said the same message is being provided at each meeting: The public and the media should stay away from Newtown on Saturday.

""There is nothing new in the town's position to respectfully request the media to not come to Newtown to cover the first anniversary,"" Llodra told USA TODAY.

At a press conference Monday, 14 families of children and educators killed at Sandy Hook school said they plan to light a candle this weekend in memory of their loved ones.

In a joint statement, the families said the tragedy forever changed their lives, and they thanked the world for its outpouring of support. The families said they have established a new website, MySandyHookFamily.org, for all 26 families who lost a relative in the shootings at the school.

""In the midst of our grief, we have come to realize that we want our loved ones to be remembered for the lives they lived and how they touched our hearts,"" the website says. ""We have been uplifted by the support of so many people, and we would like to keep that spirit of unity and love alive in all we do to remember those we so dearly miss.""

The site asks the public to understand that each family is unique in its own experiences following the tragedy and has its own voice and perspective. ""By creating this website, we hope to offer an opportunity to communicate with our families and honor our loved ones, while at the same time respecting each family's individual journey and unique experiences,"" it says."

Neighbors in Connecticut said Ms. Carey had a child, but it was unclear if the toddler in the car was hers.

The chase began at 2:12 p.m. when Ms. Carey, who was driving a black two-door Infiniti with Connecticut plates, tried to ram through a White House checkpoint at 15th and E Streets Northwest. “The guys ran to try to stop her, and she wasn’t going to slow down, so they jumped aside,” said B. J. Campbell, a tourist from Portland, Ore., who was standing near the White House. “One of the guys grabbed one of those little metal fence sections and shoved it in front of her, across the driveway. She hit the brakes slightly and tried to get around it on the right, but the guy shoved it in front of her again, to try to keep her in.”

Mr. Campbell said the woman “hit the gas, ran over the barricade” and hit the officer, who flipped onto the hood of the car and “rolled off into the gutter.”

“After she ran him down, she gunned it, and she just went screaming down Pennsylvania Avenue,” he said. “They were busy calling on their phones, on the radios. It was like poking a hornet nest. There were guys everywhere. I didn’t see anyone with their guns out, but they were sure busy.”"

Miriam Carey, who had been diagnosed with postpartum depression and psychosis, told officers who responded to her Stamford apartment on Dec. 10 that President Barack Obama communicated with her and had set up cameras to record her life for national news outlets, police said.

""She stated that President Obama put Stamford in lock down after speaking to her because she is the Prophet of Stamford,"" a police report said.

Carey, a 34-year-old dental hygienist, tried to ram her car through a White House barrier on Oct. 3 before leading police on a chase that ended with her being killed. Her 1-year-old daughter was in the car but escaped serious injury.

Carey's relatives have challenged law enforcement accounts that she was delusional and raised questions over whether police used an appropriate level of force. A lawyer for Carey's sister didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

Stamford police said in incident reports released Thursday under a public records request that officers had dealt several times with Carey and issues including her belief that she was the subject of a reality television show for the government.

The police visit on Dec. 10 followed a call from Carey's boyfriend, Eric Francis, who said he was afraid for their daughter's safety because Carey wasn't speaking rationally and had taken the girl outside in the cold and rain wearing only pajamas.

""Miriam, she's outside now with the baby without any coat. She's just like physically ... I mean they definitely need to take her somewhere to get some help,"" Francis said in a 911 call. ""She locked herself in the bathroom, and the baby's crying. It's been going on for a week now.""

Police said Carey struggled with officers and was escorted away in handcuffs.

Later that month, Francis called police twice in one night to report that Carey was acting irrationally and having delusions. The officers who responded said they found milk spattered around the apartment and said Carey was acting violently, saying she refused to go to the hospital. They said Carey tried to kick one of them and was taken to an emergency room for an evaluation.

The report said officers were aware of Carey's condition and ""the boyfriend Eric was attempting to care for her and the child the best he can.""

Francis didn't respond to messages left Thursday at a phone number listed for him."

The man allegedly continued to try to get the woman’s attention after she’d called 911. Police arrived at the scene minutes later, at which point the deceased, former Florida A&M football player Jonathan Ferrell, “immediately charged towards the three officers, one in particular. That officer fired his weapon several times, striking individual multiple times.” Ferrell died at the scene.

And what did police discover right after the ""suspect"" died at the scene?

That he had apparently just been in a ""serious"" car accident.



hortly thereafter, police found what they “believe to be the vehicle that belonged to the individual who was shot. It’s quite possible he was seeking assistance. Based on the accident, it was a pretty serious accident.” Chief Monroe said that Ferrell would have been forced to climb out the back window of his vehicle, and that the property he approached was the nearest house to the scene of the accident.

Police insist this was just an ""unfortunate accident"" however their investigation has found that the shooting of Mr. Ferrell was ""Excessive"" and the officer involved

Ok, suppose you're in Ferrell's situation. You've just crashed your car - apparently had to crawl out of it through you back window. You're disoriented. Perhaps concussed. Probably Confused. You stagger to the very nearest house and try to get someone's attention, someone who can perhaps help you - maybe someone to call for help.

And they do call for help, but not to help You.

So then when the help arrives and you go rushing toward them, in desperation, perhaps not exactly in your right state of mind, not exactly a wise strategic more - but then again you're frantic.

The first immediate response is....

BANG!!

Ok, now play that scenario again in your head and this time - make the very recent accident victim who gets shot dead while seeking assistance - not a young Black former Florida A&M Football player barreling down on an apparently nervous, edgy and trigger-happy COP.

Just imagine it. Just imagine if you were that desperate, confused accident victim? Blurry vision. Head ache. Ears ringing. Vertigo. You Need H.E.L.P.!

Is this the kind of treatment you would expect?

Can you see all of that still happening? Is that something you might expect as even conceivable? Doors closed in your face. Windows locked. PANIC Alarms and Police Called in Fear of you? Ferrell had no weapon, just himself, but when Police arrive there was No warning? ""Stay Back. FREEZE. Halt or we'll Shoot!"" No taser? (Maybe a Taser, but it didn't work? Not clear yet) No club? No kettling? No Pepper-spray? No nothing - just BANG?

Yeah, I can't see it either.

It's seems almost as though his very existence was threat enough, and that had to be ended. Period.

But as I said before it - probably - has nothing to do with race. Yes, of course not. Although you can find 20 More Cases of Unarmed Black Men being Killed by Law Enforcement Here (and the list doesn't include Trayvon Martin) and you can find a recent study estimating that nearly 150 Unarmed Black Men were shot down by police and/or vigilantes in 2012 HERE.

But Yeah. we can all be rest assured that since the police said so - Race didn't have a thing to do with it. Nope, not a thing.

Vyan

P.S. Just to back up the ""Aint' Racism"" view - the Charlotte Police Chief is Black (although for the record the officer who fired the fatal shots is not)

More from Huffpo: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...











Ok, I've looked over all the comments and this is what I think.

The entire problem with this story is presumption. The woman in the house, using incomplete information, made a presumption. That isn't to say the aftermath and results are her fault - per se - only that her's was the first in a series of wrong presumptions. Whether she had a duty or responsibility to find out who was at the door before opening it, or once discovering it wasn't who she thought it was asking why he was there is debatable - however both hitting her Panic Alarm and calling 9-1-1 to report an attempted burglar was sending the police into a situation with wrong information. (If a former Florida A&M Football player wants to get into your house, he'd be IN YOUR HOUSE not knocking at the door) Her's was the snowball at the top of the hill, and the police made it an avalanche. It might have gone differently without her claims, or it might not - that isn't clear. Certainly they had a duty to determine the facts, but there is also something called ""Officer Safety"" which dictates their own self-defense parameters and responses when they've been told that their dealing with a potential criminal.

They all made a wrong presumption and consequently Farrell lost his life. Exactly why isn't clear. Was Farrell unable to communicate? Did they fail to listen? Were they unwilling to listen? It's fair to say their original presumption of his criminality wasn't illogical or completely unfounded, and neither would be the presumption that their failure to recognize the truth was founded in their own biases and possible bigotry - but it would be just as wrong to cling to the presumption of bigotry despite the facts as it was for them to cling to their original ""criminal"" presumption despite the facts.

That's where I started with this diary in the first place. That's why I started without the presumption that this was yet another case of bigotry gone wild. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. The problem is letting presumption and fear, even ""reasonable and logical"" fear, overrule the truth. The only solution for that is to have the courage to find the truth, even if doing so sometimes just might put you or the people around you at potential risk. No, the law doesn't require people to do that, but sometimes decency does, because without that courage and yes, RISK to find the Facts, tragedies like this happen, and they will continue to happen..

If only one person in this situation had been willing to take that risk to find out what was going on with Ferrell - to try and communicate with him and listen first - which, yes, would have meant putting finding out what was going on possibly ahead of their own immediate personal safety, the outcome here could have been different. No one is required to that, but IMO this is exactly what can and does happen when they don't.

Having that courage is what it's going to take to change things. It's the only thing IMO that works.

Aaron Alexis “had a pattern of misconduct,” the official said.

Law enforcement officials have identified Alexis as the shooter who went on a two-hour rampage at the sprawling naval base in Washington, but have not yet said what they believe was his motive.

Alexis, a native of New York, who served in the Navy from 2007 to 2011 as an aviation electrician’s mate 3rd class, entered the base early Monday morning, authorities said, perhaps using another man’s identification card to pass through the gates.

Once inside, officials said, he headed for the massive Building 197, the headquarters of the Navy Sea Systems Command. Armed with three weapons, including an AR-15 assault rifle, he went to the building’s fourth floor, according to officials. About 8:15 a.m., according to witness accounts and police dispatch recordings, the gunman began shooting down into a crowded atrium that houses an employee cafeteria.

Washington police and Navy security officials engaged in “multiple” exchanges of fire with Alexis over the next two hours, Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier told reporters, eventually shooting and killing him.

In addition to the 12 people killed, three others were treated at a hospital, with two requiring surgery. All three are expected to recover, hospital officials said. Officials said other people may have suffered injuries that did not require hospitalization.

From 2008 until his discharge in 2011, Alexis was a member of an aviation support squadron based in Fort Worth, Texas, where he worked on C-40s, a military version of the Boeing 737 that the Navy uses as a cargo plane. Law enforcement officials said that he was more recently working as a military contractor.

On Sept. 5, 2010, he was arrested in Fort Worth on suspicion of discharging a weapon. Alexis reportedly told officials that the gun had discharged accidentally when he was cleaning it. The Tarrant County district attorney did not prosecute.

Earlier Monday, Lanier had said that investigators were seeking two other men. One, a white man dressed in military-style clothing who had reportedly been seen with a handgun in the vicinity of the shooting on the base, was cleared in mid-afternoon.

D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray said the police department still wanted to speak to a second man who some witnesses had reported seeing, a black man in his 50s dressed in olive fatigues. But he played down the possibility that the man was involved in the shooting.

“We don’t know that there is a second gunman on the loose,” Gray said at a news conference, adding that police wanted to talk to the man.

Gray also repeated earlier statements that police had no evidence linking the attack to terrorism.

About 3:30 p.m., officials began to allow people to leave the base, which had been on lockdown.

President Obama, speaking at the White House, praised the victims as “patriots” who “know the dangers of serving abroad” but faced “unimaginable violence they wouldn’t have expected at home.” He promised that federal and local law enforcement officials would work together to investigate.

Dr. Janis Orlowski, chief operating officer at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, reported three shooting victims at the hospital but added that they expected to admit more victims.

“From the reports of the victims, it had to be a semiautomatic,” she said. “They’re talking about gunshots that they heard in rapid succession.”

One woman admitted to the hospital had a gunshot wound to the head and her hand, Orlowski said. Another woman had a wound to her shoulder, Orlowski said, and a D.C. police officer had multiple gunshot wounds to his legs.

The three were in critical condition, she said, but she described their chances for survival as good.

The incident began at about 8:15 a.m. at the headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command at the sprawling naval base on Washington’s Anacostia River waterfront.

Patricia Ward, a logistics management specialist, was in Building 197 when the shooting started. She told reporters she was in the lobby using the ATM when she heard three shots and started “panicking.” Then she heard four more shots. A security guard with a gun drawn told people to run, she said, and “I just ran. I thought of my family and I just ran.” Someone pulled the fire alarm.

Roughly two hours later, witnesses reported hearing more shots.

A federal law enforcement official monitoring the situation said that conflicting reports of more than one gunman came from a situation where a “second building” was being checked for reports of shots fired.

Officials ramped up security in all federal buildings in the Washington area. As a precaution, U.S. Capitol Police added personnel and increased security measures in the Capitol Building.

As helicopters hovered above the base, first lowering stretchers to airlift victims to hospitals and later circling the base in an apparent search effort, air traffic was briefly grounded at the nearby Reagan National Airport. Several area schools were put on lockdown.

About 3,000 people, both civilian and military, work at the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters.

Navy Capt. Danny Hernandez said he was in an adjoining Navy Yard building when the shooting started.

“Everybody rushed in” to the building where he was, and security guards locked down the facility. “It was pretty orderly,” he said.

Minneapolis was nicknamed %27Murder-apolis%27 during the 1990s

Progress Minneapolis has made reducing gun violence caught Obama%27s attention

Still%2C Minneapolis city leaders are working to implement tougher gun laws

MINNEAPOLIS — This city has managed to shed the moniker of ""Murder-apolis,"" the ugly nickname it was tagged with during the worst days of the crack and gang wars of the 1990s, when it had a homicide rate that rivaled New York City.

The progress Minneapolis made reducing gun violence in the past few years has caught the attention of President Obama, who will visit the city Monday for his first trip outside the Beltway to tout his plan to overhaul the nation's gun laws.

Even as Minneapolis is being held up by the White House as a community that's been ahead of the curve in pushing the conversation on gun violence, city leaders here are clamoring for Congress and state lawmakers to implement tougher gun laws. They say it is a necessity to further reduce the epidemic of gun violence in their city.

""We have done so much, and we're committed to doing more,"" said Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, a Democrat. ""But there is also only so much you can do at this level to prevent illegal guns from getting into the hands of kids, the mentally ill and people who shouldn't have them.""

The White House has praised Minneapolis for a youth violence initiative the city launched in 2008 that has had success. And a bipartisan push by sheriffs in Minnesota to improve the state's background check system for gun buyers — including speeding up the input of felony and drug convictions, along with mental-health court orders — has also piqued administration interest.

""If you want to get right down to it, we have an access problem,"" said Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek, a Republican who is backing the push for bolstering background checks. ""Those who should not have guns is what we should focus on.""

The president's visit comes as the Democratic Farm Labor-controlled state Legislature begins debate this week on a slew of proposals to change gun regulations, including bills calling for a statewide ban on assault weapons and a limit on the size of ammunition clips.

Those proposals mirror some of what Obama wants to do on the federal level. Backers of the gun control proposals face stiff opposition from some state lawmakers in rural areas as well as gun owner groups.

Joe Olson, who heads the Minnesota Gun Owners Civil Rights Alliance, said that much of the legislation being proposed is unnecessary and has little chance of making it through the Legislature. ""The legislation is coming from the Democratic-wing that wishes they lived in Boston or New York,"" Olson said. ""They are trying very hard to bring values to Minnesota that don't fit.""

The violence here in Minneapolis, the state's largest city, peaked in 1995, when the city saw 99 murders, a spike of more than 50% from the previous four years. After leveling off in the late 1990s and early 2000s, this city of 387,000 faced another troubling trend. In a stretch between 2003 and 2006, some 80 Minneapolis residents ages 15 to 24 were killed — mostly by gunfire — making homicide the leading cause of death for young people in the city.

""The difference between the surge of violence in the 1990s and the surge we saw a few years ago was that those involved were much younger and much less predictable,"" Rybak said.

In response, the city launched a series of initiatives targeting youth in the most violent neighborhoods in the city. Among the steps the city has taken to reduce violence are: connecting high-risk youth with mentors, establishing a tip line where young people can call or text in tips about illegal weapons and mandating psycho-social assessments of every youth who comes into a city hospital with a violent injury.

Rybak says the initiatives have helped reduce the city's crime rate, which was up in 2012 after hitting a 30-year low in 2011. Minneapolis has also seen a 66% decrease in the number of youths involved in gun-related incidents and a 41% drop in youth injured by gun violence over the past five years.

But gun violence remains a serious problem here.

Obama will visit the north side of the city, a poor and predominantly African-American area where nearly two-thirds of the city's gun violence took place in 2012.

On Friday, a 17-year-old gang member, Stephon Shannon, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for the shooting death of 5-year-old Nizzel George. Nizzel was struck by a bullet as he slept on a couch in his grandmother's house, just blocks from a police outpost where Obama will deliver his remarks.

Six months before Nizzel's killing, another north Minneapolis boy, 3-year-old Terrell Mayes, was fatally wounded by a stray bullet, when he went scurrying for cover after he heard the sound of gunfire outside his house. Gunfire incidents were so frequent in his neighborhood that his family had developed a protocol. Mayes was running to his safe spot — with a spaghetti dinner in hand — when he was struck.

And in September, the city was shaken when a 36-year-old man with a history of mental illness opened fire at the north Minneapolis business Accent Signage System after he was fired from his jobs. He killed six before he turned the gun on himself. Police later found thousands of rounds of ammunition at the gunman's home.

""Newtown was a tragedy that shocked America,"" said City Council member Don Samuels in an interview at his home in one of the city's most violent neighborhoods. ""What is happening in north Minneapolis is a slow-moving massacre.""

Sami Rahamim, 17, the son of one of the victims of the last year's mass shooting incident in Minneapolis, recalled having a conversation about gun control with his father, Reuven Rahamim, weeks after the July mass shooting at the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting that left 12 dead and wounded dozens of others.

His father was astonished that no new laws were passed after then-representative Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., was grievously wounded and six others were killed at a constituents' event in January 2011.

Reuven and five of his employees would be killed weeks after that conversation, and less than three months later 20 children and six adults would be killed in Newtown.

After the Newtown shooting, Rahamim said he was moved to act, and he's spent the weeks since the tragedy roaming the halls of the state capital in St. Paul, lobbying lawmakers to act. ""It may be impossible the fully end gun violence, but we can do something to reduce it,"" Rahamim said. ""This is the way I can honor him."""

WASHINGTON — An off-white jacket. A casual long-sleeve shirt. A turquoise- and-orange wool blanket. A wallet that contains a Social Security card and family snapshots.

While these relics from the early '60s sound like everyday items, they are priceless pieces of history tied to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Beginning April 12, visitors to the Newseum in the nation's capital will have the rare chance to view these never-before-displayed artifacts belonging to Lee Harvey Oswald, the presumed gunman, as part of an exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's death. Oswald, who wore the shirt and carried the wallet when he was arrested on Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas, was himself shot and killed two days later by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby, a crime that was caught live on TV.

The jacket was found at a gas station near the Texas Theater, where Oswald was captured. Oswald's rifle, which was kept wrapped in the blanket in a friend's garage, was found at the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas shortly after JFK was shot.

""This is a pretty incredible opportunity to work with the National Archives and be able to display these pieces,"" says Carrie Christoffersen, Newseum curator and director of collections.

Christoffersen says the purpose of ""Three Shots Were Fired,"" an exhibit of more than 100 artifacts, including the first UPI report about the attack on the presidential motorcade, ""is to tell the story of how news media responded and how it fulfilled its responsibility to the public. It was a unique time in American and journalism history. The shooting led to unprecedented TV coverage over four days on the networks commercial-free. This was at a time when nightly newscasts had only just expanded from 15 minutes to a half-hour.""

A collection of photos, ""Creating Camelot: The Kennedy Photography of Jacques Lowe,"" as well as a Newseum-produced film, A Thousand Days, will bring to life the youthful glamour that the first family brought to the White House, as well as newsworthy moments of JFK's short presidency.

The exhibit, which runs through Jan. 5, 2014, will include an interactive feature that allows visitors of all ages to share the defining ""JFK moment'' in their life, whether it was the bombing at Pearl Harbor or memories of 9/11."

They live in Newtown, Conn.

Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence is the latest in a series of events following the Dec. 14shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our 7-year-old son, Daniel, 19 of his first-grade classmates and six educators were killed in the tragedy. We believe this hearing is an opportunity to rise above the hard-line rhetoric and intransigence that too often lead to inaction and hopelessness, and we hope that our leaders and our nation will start a new conversation with a chance of achieving real change.

Our Daniel was a constant source of laughter and joy. He was intelligent, articulate, incredibly affectionate, fair, thoughtful toward others and unfailingly polite. Daniel believed in holding doors open for strangers. He talked to the person sitting alone. He loved to help clean up a mess, and he made sure there was enough milk for everyone before adding it to his cereal.

His kindergarten teacher recently wrote to us: “He is the kind of student that should come wrapped in ribbon because he is a gift to his teachers. I can remember leaving notes for our substitute to ‘ask Daniel’ if she or he needed help with anything.”

Motivated by Daniel’s empathy and kindness, one of our relatives created a Facebook page, “What Would Daniel Do?,” to inspire others to reach out as our youngest son did.

As lawmakers and others discuss what can be done to curb gun violence, we hope Americans will ask, What would Daniel do?

Daniel would listen and be respectful. Our country needs a new dialogue, one that doesn’t follow the tired script of political squabbling. Any improvement to our laws, no matter how small or reasonable, should not be decried as the forward wave of an attempt to “ban guns” or “take away rights.” Even those of us who have lost the most are suggesting no such thing.

Daniel would be honest. We know that there are no easy answers to these multifaceted issues. Anyone who suggests that a single law would “solve the problem” isn’t telling the truth. But neither is anyone who says that changes in our laws can’t make a difference.

Daniel wouldn’t give up hope. We refuse to accept the status quo. Making our society safer will require sustained, comprehensive action by individuals as well as by communities and government. As parents, there is nothing more important to us than our relationship with our children. Every parent can start right there, in their own home. On a broader level, it is urgent that we address the gaps in our mental health system and examine school security. We must have the same open dialogue about gun responsibility and accountability. The parental desire to love and protect our children is common ground for gun owners and non-gun owners alike.

We have joined with other families, neighbors and friends in making the Sandy Hook Promise (www.sandyhookpromise.org). We hope every member of Congress and Americans nationwide will join us in pledging to honor the lives lost last month by coming together to end these violent tragedies.

Our Daniel wanted to be a fireman like his uncles. He played drums in our family band, and he could run like the wind. Until Dec. 14, Daniel’s future was limited only by the size of his dreams.

Our son’s future was stolen from him: There will be no firehouse, no more rock band, no Boston Marathon.

But if our nation uses this moment to make the future brighter for other children, Daniel’s life and the lives of his classmates and educators will have meaning for years to come.

Our nation’s ability to deal with gun violence is limited only by the civility of our discourse, the scope of our ambitions and — as Daniel would have done — our willingness to come together and take action."

(CNN) —

The picture emerging of the dead gunman in Monday’s rampage at the Washington Navy Yard is a study in contrasts, one of a man who practiced languages and meditated, and another of a cold-blooded killer.

The gunman was identified as 34-year-old Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist and a current military contractor, the Washington FBI Field Office told CNN. His identity was confirmed by fingerprints and a picture ID card, the FBI said.

Authorities have not released a possible motive in the morning shooting at the headquarters for Naval Sea Systems Command that left 12 people – and the gunman – dead. But a friend said Alexis was locked in a dispute over money with the company that contracted him to work for the Navy.

Investigators also learned that Alexis had recently made contact with two Veterans Affairs hospitals for apparent psychological issues, law enforcement sources told CNN on Tuesday. However, other sources said Alexis sought help from the VA for sleep-related issues.

Authorities said earlier that they are confident that Alexis was the lone gunman, after a daylong police search for a possible second suspect.

Gaining access

Alexis was carrying a military-contractor ID that matched his appearance, a D.C. Metropolitan Police official told CNN on condition of anonymity.

Alexis used that ID to gain access to the Navy Yard, according to a U.S. law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation.

He drove onto the installation and parked before walking a short distance to Building 197. Once inside, according to the official, Alexis made his way to an overlook above the atrium and opened fire into the cafeteria.

What is security like at Washington Navy Yard?

Initial reports said Alexis used an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle during the attack, but by Tuesday, law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation said that was not the case.

It is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15, but returned it before Monday’s shooting, the officials said. Investigators have recovered three weapons from the scene, including a shotgun that Alexis is believed to have brought into the compound. The other two weapons – handguns – the sources say, may have been taken from guards.

While the FBI was urging anyone with information about Alexis to come forward, investigators were focusing on reported incidents, including police run-ins, that portray a man with increasingly violent tendencies.

Employment

Alexis was believed to have arrived in the Washington area last week, when he reportedly checked into a hotel, according to someone who met him at the hotel. The person, who declined to be identified, said Alexis indicated that he planned to be in the area for several weeks.

Who are the victims?

At the time of the shooting, Alexis was working for The Experts, a subcontractor of HP Enterprise Services that was contracted to “refresh equipment used on the Navy Marine Corps Intranet network,” according to a statement released by the company.

Alexis, who had Department of Defense security clearance, worked from September 2012 through January refreshing computer systems in Japan, said Thomas E. Hoshko, the CEO of The Experts.

His security clearance was renewed in July to carry out the same type of contract work at the Navy Yard, Hoshko said.

Alexis returned to work with The Experts that same month, he said. He worked at facilities in Rhode Island, North Carolina and Virginia for weeks at a time upgrading computer systems, Hoshko said.

No one reported having any problems with him during those assignments, the chief executive said.

Alexis began working at the Navy Yard last week, though it was unclear whether he had actually begun working or was still securing his base clearance, Hoshko said.

Many surprised

There were no indications that Alexis had any ideological differences with the Navy or any disagreements with anyone at the Navy Yard, the U.S. law enforcement official said.

Alexis’ family reeled at the news that he was believed to be the man behind the killings.

“What I do know is he wasn’t that type of person,” Anthony Little, who identified himself as Alexis’ brother-in-law, told reporters outside his home in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. “I didn’t really hear anything that would make me feel, as a newcomer to the family, that somebody should be watching him.”

He said the family’s initial reaction was “very distraught, very stressed out, tears.”

“You know, they didn’t see it coming,” said Little, who is married to Alexis’ sister Naomi. “Their hearts are going out more to the victims and the people that got hurt because, you know, there’s more lives lost and we don’t need that right now. We really don’t.”

Opinion: What could have prevented Navy Yard carnage?

Navy reservist

Alexis, who was from New York City, served as a full-time Navy reservist between 2007 and 2011, according to military records.

In the Navy, he achieved the rank of aviation electrician’s mate 3rd class, working on aircraft electrical systems, the records show.

Alexis was honorably discharged after a “pattern of misconduct,” a U.S. defense official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on condition of anonymity. The official did not detail the misconduct.

Most recently, Alexis worked as an information technology contractor with the Navy, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.

Legal run-ins

Alexis appeared to have had sporadic run-ins with the law, dating back to at least 2004 when he was arrested in Seattle, accused of shooting out the tires of a man’s truck in an anger-fueled “blackout,” according to a Seattle Police Department report.

He told investigators he believed the man, a construction worker, was mocking him, but had no memory of shooting out the tires, the report said.

Investigators later spoke with Alexis’ father, who told police that his son had anger management problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, which he suffered after working “as an active participant in rescue attempts” during the 9/11 attacks, the report said.

Alexis was arrested in August 2008 on a charge of disorderly conduct in DeKalb County, Georgia, county police said Tuesday.

And in 2010, Alexis was arrested by Fort Worth, Texas, police but never charged over an allegation that he fired a gun through the ceiling of his apartment. According to records, he told police he accidentally fired it while cleaning it.

Witness: “He aimed his gun at us”

Good friends

His last known address was outside of Fort Worth, where he was roommates for three years with Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, who described Alexis as his best friend.

Alexis befriended Suthamtewakul four years ago after he emigrated from Thailand.

Alexis taught him about American culture, Suthamtewakul told CNN. Alexis, he said, was fluent in Thai and attended a Buddhist temple.

When Suthamtewakul opened the Happy Bowl Thai Restaurant, Alexis would occasionally help out, waiting tables, he said.

The two were roommates until five months ago, when Suthamtewakul got married and Alexis had to move out.

Toward the end, Alexis spent a lot of time holed up in his room, keeping to himself, Suthamtewakul said.

On Monday, Suthamtewakul was stunned by the news that Alexis was said to be the shooter in the rampage at the Navy Yard.

“I can’t believe he did this,” he said. “He never showed any sign of violence.”

Frustrations

But there were signs that Alexis was unhappy.

He was having a hard time trying to get on his feet, said Suthamtewakul’s wife, Kristi. He helped out at the restaurant but not for pay.

“He was using this as an educational experience to help learn Thai,” she said. He enjoyed making deliveries to homes, where the language was spoken. He talked about moving to Thailand.

But to Suthamtewakul, Alexis seemed “frustrated with life.”

She is grieving. “He was like one of our best friends, like a brother to us and always willing to go out of his way to help us out with things,” she said.

He was very frustrated with the company that contracted him to work for the Navy, according to another friend.

Alexis claimed he wasn’t paid properly by the company after returning from a months-long assignment to Japan last year, said Michael Ritrovato, another former roommate.

It was unclear whether the dispute was over salary or expenses. Alexis just felt the company owed him money and had not paid him, Ritrovato said.

Gun knowledge

He is in shock over his friend’s actions.

“He was an easygoing guy. I don’t know of any reason for this,” he said.

But Ritrovato knew Alexis was fascinated by guns. “He was … knowledgeable with military rifles and handguns. At least he led us to believe he was. But nobody ever had the idea that he would use them in a derogatory way,” he said.

It is not clear whether Alexis was still living in Fort Worth area at the time of the shooting.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/26/Media-ignore-racially-motivated-shooting-spree,2013-09-26 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],Media Ignore Racially-Motivated Shooting Spree,"When the media can aid Obama’s re-election through the fabrication of a divisive and completely phony black vs. white racial narrative, then the media are very interested in hate crimes and American racism. But when the media are handed an actual hate crime that involves a black man accused of gunning down four white people because they are white, the media collectively shrug.

The media also claim to be interested in mass-shootings. For days and sometimes weeks, we have seen our media turn their outlets over to obsessive coverage of one mass shooting after another. So you would think a racially-motivated mass-shooting would explode in the media.

But according to our media, not all racially-motivated crimes and mass shootings are alike. In fact, if the media see no political upside, some racially-motivated mass-shootings are ignored as though they never even happened.

In Greenville, North Carolina, it is now official. According to the Grand Jury indictments, a black man named Lakim Faust entered a Walmart in June with more than a hundred rounds of ammunition, and targeted white people based on their race:

Police said Faust’s first victim on June 21 was an insurance adjustor in the parking lot of a law firm. He then crossed a five-lane highway and shot three more people in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart, investigators said.

Three of the four people wounded in the shooting suffered permanent and debilitating injuries, according to the indictments. Details of those injuries were not specified.

In a just world, a local crime such as this would not deserve national coverage. One man does not in any way say anything larger about our society as a whole. But I do not write the rules, the media does; and the media poses as an objective institution concerned with hate crimes — so concerned, in fact, that they went so far as to manufacture evidence as a way to falsely accuse the Hispanic George Zimmerman of being both white and a racist.

But an actual, official hate crime in North Carolina is completely ignored by this very same media.

The reason is obvious: the objective, unbiased, not-at-all-liberal media see no political upside in a hate crime that can’t be used to gin up the left’s version of white guilt, push gun control, or falsely portray America as a country where white people still oppress minorities and therefore need a larger government to right these wrongs.

The media ignoring this racially-motivated murder spree also has nothing to do with protecting black people.

Sadly, the media don’t care about black people. This is why Chicago is ignored. Hundreds of black people are gunned down every year in Chicago. But the national media refuse to pressure the politicians in charge of that city and state to do anything, because on paper Chicago is a Liberal Utopia. The city also enforces some of the strongest gun control laws in the country.

If the media questions what is happening in Chicago, that would be mean questioning the very foundation of liberalism. And the media simply doesn’t believe a few hundred dead black people is worth doing anything that might undermine their political agenda.

The president delivered extensive remarks during a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room. He suggested race may have played a strong role in the case, saying that if a ""white male teen"" were involved, ""both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.""

He went far beyond his remarks a year ago in which he stirred controversy by saying if he had a son, he'd look like Martin.

""Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" Obama said.

The president used the highly personal comments to, in his words, put the angst in the black community in ""context."" And he also appeared to give his support to Attorney General Eric Holder's call earlier in the week for a review of ""stand-your-ground"" laws.

The laws allow people to use lethal force if they feel threatened -- even if they might have the option of retreating.

""If we're sending a message as a society ... that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see?"" Obama said.

The president acknowledged that the law was not part of the Zimmerman defense, but suggested the laws might still ""encourage"" violence. In a provocative statement, the president also questioned whether Martin, if he had a gun, could have been ""justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman because he felt threatened.""

The NRA has defended the stand-your-ground laws, saying they are vital to self-defense.

George Zimmerman's defense team put out a statement late Friday saying they ""acknowledge and understand"" the racial context of the case, and that it took ""courage"" for the president to say what he said.

But they also said ""those who look at the facts of the case without prejudice will see that it is a clear case of self-defense, and we are certain that those who take a closer look at the kind of person George Zimmerman is -- something we understand the Department of Justice is currently doing -- we are confident they will find a young man with ... a diverse ethnic and racial background who is not a racist, a man who is, in fact, sensitive to the complex racial history of our country.""

George Zimmerman's brother Robert Zimmerman responded to Obama's comments in an interview with Fox News, saying a lot of people wanted to hear from the president and ""I'm glad he spoke out today.""

He said he agrees that there should be ""teachable moments."" At the same time, he voiced concern that leaders may be responding to ""pressure"" as the Justice Department probes his brother to see if federal civil rights charges should be brought.

Obama appeared to manage expectations on that front during his remarks on Friday. He said he understands that protests may have to ""work (their) way through,"" but said these cases are traditionally handled by state and local authorities.

He said Holder is reviewing, but that people should have ""clear expectations.""

Obama reiterated that the jury -- at the state level -- has spoken.

He also offered personal details that harkened back to the speech he gave on race as a candidate in 2008. Obama said: ""It's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences, and a history that doesn't go away.""

Obama said there are ""very few"" black men who haven't been followed while shopping at a department store -- ""that includes me.""

""I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,"" Obama said.

The comments from the president -- particularly comments this extensive -- were not expected. It's unclear whether they will serve to fuel the debate or potentially ease tensions.

24/7 Wall St.

In 2012%2C violent crime rose only about 1%25 nationally

Low income and low education is oftentimes linked to higher crime rates

Tennessee tops the list in highest violent crime%2C according to 24/7 analysis

You might think that going to California, Texas or New York exposes you to a lot of crime. But in fact it was Tennessee that had the nation's highest violent crime rate last year.

The FBI's latest statewide statistics offer a snapshot of the underside of the 50 states: where violent crime is most likely to occur. According to the FBI, violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the states with the highest rates of violent crime in the country.

While violent crime rose just under 1% nationally in 2012, the trend for the past 20 years has been steady decline. Crime peaked in the late 1980s, fueled by the crack cocaine epidemic. Beginning in the early 1990s, crime began to decline. Although the exact cause remains unclear, experts have pointed to factors such as better policing, demographic changes, higher incarceration rates, a drop in cocaine use and the introduction of a variety of social programs.

In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Urban Institute senior fellow John Roman pointed out that the crime decline has not been uniform. It has improved markedly in some large cities, like New York, Dallas and Washington, D.C. However, the decline has been less impressive in cities like Baltimore and Detroit, where economic and racial segregation limit the ability of the poor to move into the middle class.

The more the population is integrated, Roman explained, the greater the chances of sizable crime declines. Most crime is committed by people at the bottom of the economic totem pole, he said.

The apparent relationship between low income, low education and higher crime rates has been well documented, although identifying the cause and effect is still a matter of debate. It is clear, though, that these states for the most part match the national trend. Of the 10 states with the highest rates of violent crime, eight have lower rates of adults with bachelor's degrees, and most of them had median income levels below the national figure in 2012.

There are notable exceptions to the national trend, however. Alaska, Delaware and Maryland all have higher educational attainment and higher income, but they still make the list. In Maryland and Delaware, this likely has to do with pockets of very high crime in the largest urban areas.

While Maryland has the ninth-highest violent crime rate in the country, it also has the third-lowest poverty rate, the highest median income and one of the highest proportions of adults with a college degree. The reason for this discrepancy is likely the concentration of high crime in Baltimore. The Baltimore metropolitan area also had the ninth highest violent crime rate in the country last year and accounted for nearly a third of all the incidents in the state that year.

On its website, the FBI instructs readers to avoid comparing state violence because rankings tend to be simplistic and ignore factors that influence crime, as well as the different ways crimes are measured and reported. For this reason, Roman cautioned against directly comparing states based on their individual crime rates. However, because the states with the highest and lowest violent crime rates have remained consistent for many years, he believes comparing state ranks was useful. ""This exercise is worth doing. I don't know how you make policy without doing this kind of thing.""

24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 states with the highest rates of violent crime per 100,000 residents. Using estimated populations and crime incidents from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, which measures incidents of eight types of violent and nonviolent crime for 2012, 24/7 Wall St. calculated the incidence of the four types of violent crime per 100,000 persons for that year: murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In addition to crime data, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed income, poverty and education statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for 2012, the most recent available year.

These are the most dangerous states in America:

1. Tennessee

> Violent crimes per 100,000: 643.6

> Poverty rate: 17.9%

> Pct. of population with bachelor's degree or higher: 24.3%

> Property crimes per 100,000: 3,371.4 (10th highest)

Tennessee has the dubious distinction of having the worst violent crime rate in the country. The state was among the top 10 in the country for murders and robberies and was first for aggravated assaults, with an estimated 479.6 for every 100,000 residents. Tennessee's 41,550 violent crimes in 2012 were up 6.8% from 2011 but down 10% from 2007, when there were 46,380 violent crimes. There were 388 murders in the state in 2012, up for a second straight year. To be fair, Tennessee's violent streak is concentrated in some of the major metropolitan areas. Memphis's violent crime rate was the nation's fifth worst, while Nashville's was the 18th worst. Like many states with high violent crime, poverty in Tennessee is acute, and high school and college graduation rates are lower than most of the country.

2. Nevada

> Violent crimes per 100,000: 607.6

> Poverty rate: 16.4%

> Pct. of population with bachelor's degree or higher: 22.4%

> Property crimes per 100,000: 2,809.4 (23rd highest)

Nevada ranks among the worst in the country for its robbery rate, motor-vehicle theft rate and aggravated assault rate. It also ranks high in categories like burglaries and forcible rape. Much of the crime, state officials maintain, comes from the swarms of tourists who visit Las Vegas, Reno and other cities with casinos and related entertainment. Factor out the casino traffic in Reno, and local crime rates are similar to the rest of the nation, Emmanuel Barthe, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nevada Reno, told the Reno Gazette-Journal. Nevada also has among the lowest high school and college graduation rates.

3. Alaska

> Violent crimes per 100,000: 603.2

> Poverty rate: 10.1%

> Pct. of population with bachelor's degree or higher: 28.0%

> Property crimes per 100,000: 2,739.4 (24th lowest)

It may seem incongruous that Alaska, which has a low poverty rate and high levels of high school and college graduates, would be among the states with the worst crime rates. It has among the worst violent crime rates in part because of its forcible rape rate: 79.7 per 100,000 residents, the nation's highest rate. (Next is South Dakota, with a rate of 70.2 per 100,000.) Also disturbing, a 2010 study suggests that 37% of women who live in Alaska say they've ""suffered some form of sexual assault in their lives,"" the Anchorage Daily News reported. Alaska is also second in aggravated assaults. While rape and assault rates are high, other crime levels are average.

Speaking outside Department of Justice headquarters, Reverend Al Sharpton announced a National Justice for Trayvon Day for Saturday with rallies outside federal buildings and court houses in more than 100 cities nationwide.

“People all over the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit,” said the civil rights firebrand, flanked by more than a dozen other African-American clergy members.

“This is a social movement for justice.”

Sharpton added that “tens of thousands” would converge on Washington for a protest march on August 24, the Saturday before the 50th anniversary of the late Martin Luther King’s historic mass march on the US capital.

Saturday’s acquittal of gun-toting neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed Florida teenager Martin has stirred anger and unrest across the African-American community.

Sharpton is pressing the Department of Justice to reopen a civil rights investigation into the incident that was suspended when Zimmerman was arrested six weeks after the killing.

US Attorney General Eric Holder, calling Martin’s death “tragic and unnecessary,” called Monday for a dialogue on the racially-charged issues it raises, but he stopped short of announcing civil proceedings.

Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, pledged a major campaign against so-called stand-your-ground laws in Florida “and 29 other states” that allow citizens who feel threatened to use lethal force in self-defense.

“The stand-your-ground law was not used directly at this (Zimmerman) trial, but it had everything to do with what happened at this trial,” he said, adding that such laws represented “a new threat to civil and human rights.”

“Let us be clear. It is now because of these laws where anyone walking, committing no crime, can be followed or approached by another civilian, and they can use deadly force and say it was self-defense,” he said.

“That is something that is frightening and cannot be allowed to sustain itself in this country.”

Setting out a strategy against stand-your-ground laws — including a boycott of corporations known to support such legislation — will be the topic of a three-day meeting of faith leaders in Miami next week, he said.

Separately, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday that pop music legend Stevie Wonder has vowed never to perform in any state or country with a stand-your-ground law on its statute books.

“I decided today that until the stand-your-ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,” it quoted Wonder as saying Sunday in Quebec City, where he was playing the Canadian city’s summer festival.

“As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/ex-navy-seal-remembered-servant-others-232814773.html,,[],Ex-Navy SEAL remembered as servant to others,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — As military service members carried the flag-draped coffin out of Cowboys Stadium, the sounds of bagpipes echoed and people saluted Chris Kyle, an ex-Navy SEAL sniper who dedicated his post-military career to helping other veterans.

Widow Taya Kyle spoke through tears earlier, surrounded by her husband's military friends, her voice trembling as she described to a crowd of thousands what ""my slow-talking Texas man"" had meant to his family, friends and country.

""Chris, there isn't enough time to tell you everything you mean to me and everything you taught me,"" the widow said Monday during a two-hour memorial service for Kyle, a decorated sniper and best-selling author who was slain earlier this month at a gun range.

She described herself as broken but said the family will ""put one foot in front of the other"" to get through their grief. She told her two children that they will remember Kyle's silly side, Texas twang and prayers they prayed together.

Nearly 7,000 people, including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and her husband, attended the service. Dozens of military personnel and others were seated in front of the podium near the Dallas Cowboys' star at midfield, where Kyle's coffin was placed at the beginning.

His friends and fellow service members told mourners that Kyle was more than an excellent sniper feared by U.S. enemies — he was a dedicated family man known for his sense of humor, compassion, selflessness and generosity. Kyle completed four tours of duty in Iraq and wrote the best-selling book ""American Sniper.""

Some who served with him said that Kyle was a man, myth and legend because he would do anything for his fellow SEALs.

Childhood friends recalled his mischievous side, and one said he and Kyle played with BB guns as kids — and Kyle ""wasn't a good shot back then.""

Bo French, an executive at Craft International, the security training company Kyle started after he left the Navy, told those gathered that Kyle had a passion for helping others. Kyle also founded a nonprofit, FITCO Cares, that provides at-home fitness equipment for emotionally and physically wounded veterans.

Story continues

Pictures of Kyle with his family and SEALs were shown on a large screen in the stadium. The back page of the memorial service program included copies of handwritten notes from Kyle's young kids: ""I will miss your heart. I will love you even if you died"" from his daughter, and ""I miss you a lot. One of the best things that has happened to me is you"" from his son. The children signed them ""Baby Girl"" and ""Bubba.""

After Taya Kyle's eulogy, country singer Randy Travis sang ""Whisper My Name,"" which he said Taya Kyle had told him was a meaningful song for the couple, and ""Amazing Grace.""

Kyle's funeral service is scheduled for Tuesday. He will be buried at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin after a 200-mile funeral procession.

Iraq War veteran Eddie Ray Routh, 25, has been charged in the Feb. 2 killings of Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield at a North Texas gun range. Routh is being held in Erath County on $3 million bond.

Taya Kyle spoke kindly of Littlefield during the service Monday, saying he was the ""effortless, no expectations"" friend that her husband needed.

Many said before Monday's service that they didn't know the 38-year-old Chris Kyle. Air Force Master Sgt. Kevin Phillips said he came from his Fort Worth home to honor ""a brother in arms.""

Esperanza Meza, who is in the Texas State Guard, said: ""I'm here to pay my respects to him, and also for all of those who have fallen while serving this country.""

Travis Cox, director of FITCO Cares, has said the men apparently had been helping Routh work through post-traumatic stress disorder.

Kyle, Littlefield and Routh arrived together at the Rough Creek Lodge shooting range, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, authorities say. Routh later fled in Kyle's truck and went to his sister's home.

According to a search warrant, Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that the men ""were out shooting target practice and he couldn't trust them so he killed them before they could kill him."" Routh's sister called the police, describing her brother as ""psychotic."" Routh was arrested after a short police chase.

Routh's brother-in-law told authorities that Routh had recently been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

One of Routh's attorneys, J. Warren St. John, said his client had been released from the Dallas Veterans Affairs hospital against his family's wishes just two days before the shootings.

Littlefield's funeral was held Friday in Midlothian. Afterward, Littlefield's relatives said the outing with Routh was intended to be therapeutic."

Officials had previously disclosed finding materials pertaining to Norwegian mass-killer Anders Breivik -- a right-wing ultranationalist who killed 77 people in July 2011 -- in Lanza’s home, where he lived with his mother, Nancy Lanza.

Breivik’s shooting rampage on Utøya Island, which followed a bombing near government offices in Oslo, targeted teenagers belonging to a left-leaning political party.

TIMELINE: Deadliest U.S. shootings

Lanza shot his mother in the head four times before proceeding to the school, where police said he used an AR-15-style rifle to do his killing. He shot himself in the head with a pistol.

The Hartford Courant reported that Lanza fired 152 bullets in five minutes at the school and had hundreds of more rounds with him and in his car. At one point, six children escaped Lanza when his AR-15 jammed or failed to fire, sources said.

The Stamford Advocate, citing an unnamed source, said officials found documents on “virtually every mass murder” in the United States and elsewhere after searching the Lanza home.

The source said they found “a lot of material” in particular on Charles Carl Roberts IV, who attacked an Amish schoolhouse in 2006, killing five girls.

The Associated Press also reported that literature on other mass shootings was found at his house.

Connecticut State Police have kept a tight lid on the investigation, whose search warrant affidavits and applications have remained sealed over concerns that the investigation could be impeded.

Investigators last issued a news release on Feb. 19 to denounce media leaks and to say they would not release more information before the conclusion of the investigation, which did not have a given end date.

http://news.yahoo.com/newtown-911-tapes-audio-203405752.html,,[],"Newtown 911 tapes: 'They're still running, they're still shooting'","

""I think there's somebody shooting in here,"" says an unidentified woman calling from inside the school.

""What makes you think that?"" a 911 dispatcher asks.

""Because somebody's got a gun, I saw a glimpse of somebody running down the hallway,"" she replies, her voice shaking. ""They're still running, they're still shooting.""

Harrowing 911 calls made from Sandy Hook Elementary School to police in Newtown, Conn., were released Wednesday, giving the public a small but chilling window into the mass shooting that killed 26 people, including 20 children, last December.

Authorities released seven audio-enhanced calls made as 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza shot his way into the school and began his killing spree.

Newtown police dispatchers can be heard urging school administrators to take shelter amid the massacre.

""Keep everyone down, keep everyone away from the windows,"" a female dispatcher calmly tells a teacher. ""Try to lock down the school.""

A male dispatcher stayed on the line for several minutes with Rick Thorne, the school's custodian.

""There's still shooting going on, please!"" Thorne shouts. “I keep hearing shooting. I keep hearing popping.” The sound of gunshots can be heard in the background.

The dispatcher picks up several calls in a row while keeping the custodian on the line for updates on the shooting.

""Guys, we've got a shooting in Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,"" the dispatcher says to his colleagues. ""That's why 911 is ringing off the hook right now.""

Stephen Sedensky III, a state's attorney, fought against the release of the calls, arguing that the tapes — which were ""being made on the murder of children as it occurs"" — were too gruesome for residents to bear.

""If the public never hears those cries for help during this process, they won't be harmed,"" Sedensky said last month.

Nathan C. Zezula, attorney for the Newtown Police Department, said the department wanted to keep the tapes away from ""voyeuristic interests.""

Story continues

But Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott ruled that the 911 tapes be released under the Freedom of Information Act so the public could judge the police response to the killings.

On Tuesday, Newtown School Superintendent John Reed sent an email to Newtown parents, warning that the recordings could serve as an ""emotional trigger.""

Newtown First Selectman Patricia Llodra, who supported making the calls public, released a statement Wednesday:





The release of the tapes will create a new layer of pain for many in the Newtown community. Hearing those calls takes us back to a day of horror and tragedy. My plea is for the media to treat us kindly ... to recognize that there is great personal pain in this event and little public good to be garnered through the general release. Imagine yourself as a parent of a child who was killed, or a family member of one of the six educators. Imagine yourself as a teacher or staff member in that building desperate to save the lives of children. Imagine you are the parent of a child who was able to escape. Then ask yourself, media person, what is the public good and how do I balance that against the hurt?



Last week, Sedensky released a summary of the state's nearly yearlong investigation into the massacre, shedding no new light on Lanza's motive. Lanza, who killed his mother at their Newtown home before his rampage at the school, killed himself as police arrived.

""The obvious question that remains is: 'Why did the shooter murder twenty-seven people, including twenty children?'"" the report states. ""Unfortunately, that question may never be answered conclusively.""

http://news.yahoo.com/critics-complain-sandy-aid-tied-other-projects-001741367--politics.html,,[],Critics complain Sandy aid tied to other projects,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Conservatives and watchdog groups are mounting a ""not-so-fast"" campaign against a $50.7 billion Superstorm Sandy aid package that Northeastern governors and lawmakers hope to push through the House this coming week.

Their complaint is that lots of the money that lawmakers are considering will actually go toward recovery efforts for past disasters and other projects unrelated to the late-October storm.

A Senate-passed version from the end of the last Congress included $150 million for what the Commerce Department described as fisheries disasters in Alaska, Mississippi and the Northeast, and $50 million in subsidies for replanting trees on private land damaged by wildfires.

The objections have led senior House Republicans to assemble their own $17 billion proposal, that when combined with already approved money for flood insurance claims, is less than half what President Barack Obama sought and the Senate passed in December

That $17 billion package will be brought to the floor by the House Appropriations Committee, and Northeast lawmakers will have a chance to add $33.7 billion more.

House Speaker John Boehner intends to let the House vote on both measures. He's responding both to conservatives who are opposed to more deficit spending, and to Govs. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., and Chris Christie, R-N.J., who are irate that the House hasn't acted sooner.

Critics are taking the sharpest aim at $12.1 billion in the amendment for Department of Housing and Urban Development emergency block grants. Any state struck by a federally declared major disaster in 2011, 2012 or this year would qualify for the grants, and that's just about all the states, said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group. Only South Carolina, Arizona and Michigan would not qualify, he said.

""That's not a bad chunk of change, particularly if you are trying to get other lawmakers to vote for the bill,"" Ellis said.

Story continues

State and local governments like block grants because they provide more flexibility in how the money is spent. The money can go toward a variety of needs, including hospitals, utilities, roads, small businesses and rent subsidies.

The Northeast lawmakers' $33.7 billion amendment also includes more than $135 million to help the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration improve weather forecasting.

""A lot of the money goes to government agencies to rebuild rather than helping people actually afflicted by Sandy,"" Ellis said.

Before getting to the aid measures, the House on Monday planned to consider legislation intended to streamline Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations that critics blame for slowing down recovery efforts. That bill would let FEMA make limited repairs instead of lease payments to provide housing that might be less expensive than traditional agency trailers.

A $60.4 billion storm aid package passed by the Senate in December included $188 million for an Amtrak expansion project with an indirect link to Sandy: Officials say that new, long-planned tunnels from New Jersey to Penn Station in Manhattan would be better protected against future flooding.

The Club for Growth, a conservative group, complained the Senate bill was overpriced, full of pork and would swell the federal deficit because other government programs weren't being cut to cover the costs of the legislation. That bill expired with the old Congress on Jan. 3. So whatever additional aid package the House passes would have to go back to the Senate for its approval.

Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, two frequent critics of government spending, tried unsuccessfully to strip the Senate version of $125 million for an Agriculture Department program to restore watersheds damaged by wildfires and drought, $2 million for roof repairs at Smithsonian Institution museums in the Washington area and the $50 million in tree planting subsidies.

McCain also targeted $15 million to repair storm-damaged NASA facilities, saying the agency had called its Sandy damage ""minimal.""

""An emergency funding bill should focus on the emergency needs of the victims, not the needs of politicians,"" said Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, the senior Republican on Senate Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security. ""Loading up a massive $60.4 billion package with unrelated projects and earmarks for other states is not the way we should use taxpayer dollars.""

Coats' scaled-back $23.8 billion Sandy aid bill was rejected by the Senate.

Republicans also criticized $13 billion in the Senate bill for projects to protect against future storms, including fortification of mass transit systems in the Northeast and building new jetties in vulnerable seaside areas. While maybe worthwhile, those projects don't represent emergencies and shouldn't be exempt from federal spending caps, GOP lawmakers said.

The basic $17 billion before the House on Tuesday is aimed at immediate Sandy recovery needs, including $5.4 billion for New York and New Jersey transit systems and $5.4 billion for FEMA's disaster aid fund. The $33.7 billion amendment would bring the total up to the more than $60 billion sought by Obama and passed by Senate Democrats.

It includes the block grants for previous disasters, weather forecasting improvements and measures to minimize damage from future storms, but not the $188 million for the Amtrak expansion project.

""We know it's going to be a heavy lift for the $33 billion, but we'll find the votes,"" said Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., whose Staten Island district was heavily damaged by Sandy.

But conservatives clearly prefer the smaller, $17 billion version. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., a frequent critic of Boehner after losing his seat on the House Budget Committee, said the Sandy aid legislation should be focused on storm-related recovery.

""Conservatives want to see a real plan that addresses real needs for Sandy,"" he said.

Obama has signed a $9.7 billion replenishment of the national flood insurance fund to help pay claims from 115,000 homeowners, businesses and renters.

FEMA has spent more than $2 billion in disaster relief money for shelter, restoring power and other immediate needs arising from Sandy. The Oct. 29 storm that pounded the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina to Maine with hurricane-force winds and coastal flooding. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were the hardest hit."

The inquiry, disclosed by a senior Pentagon official, comes amid questions about how the gunman, Aaron Alexis, was able to obtain and keep a security clearance despite a record that included numerous disciplinary infractions while in the Navy; three arrests over the last decade, two of which involved guns; and mental health problems for which he sought treatment at a veterans healthcare facility, according to law enforcement officials.

Hagel’s review will examine access given to contractors and other non-military personnel, among other issues, the Pentagon official said. The review is expected to be announced officially Wednesday.

The firm for which Alexis worked, The Experts, based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., said in a statement Tuesday that he had been employed by the company for approximately six months over the last year.

WHO THEY WERE: Navy Yard shooting victims

The firm hired another company to do two background checks on him, “and we confirmed twice” with the Defense Department that he held a security clearance at the secret level, the statement said.

“The latest background check and security clearance confirmation were in late June of 2013 and revealed no issues other than one minor traffic violation,” the statement said.

“To my knowledge we were never made aware of any criminal or health issues,” said Thomas E. Hoshko, chief executive of The Experts. “I have more questions than you, and I am working to find out what can be done to improve security on bases, as well as the security process.”

A secret level clearance is relatively low-level, below top secret level and even higher clearances. But it is sufficient to gain unescorted access to most military facilities.

Now, in a protest against that retaliation , 9 former and one current Walmart workers and two allies have been arrested in planned acts of civil disobedience outside a Washington, D.C., Walmart office Thursday afternoon. The workers are setting a deadline of Labor Day for Walmart to reinstate fired workers and raise wages or face an escalation of worker activism.

Walmart wants to turn this into an argument about labor law, claiming that the workers' actions constitute ""intermittent strikes"" that aren't protected by law. However, Josh Eidelson reports:



Asked in June about Walmart claims that workers were fired for threatening customer service by violating attendance rules, former Obama-appointed NLRB Chair Wilma Liebman said, “the case law doesn’t sustain that as a valid defense” against the charge of illegally punishing strikers. As for the lack of legal protection for “intermittent strikes,” Liebman told The Nation, “I think it would be hard on the facts so far to say that the conduct constitutes intermittent striking.”

Another of the fired workers arrested today, Brandon Garrett, yesterday told The Nation that his termination had taken a toll in his Baker, Louisiana, store: “When we came back from striking and we wasn’t fired right away, even more associates wanted to join the organization. But I guess Walmart got a sense of that, and when they terminated me, they kind of scared a lot of them off.” Now, said Garrett, “they’re still behind us,” but “a lot of them are scared to be retaliated against. So that’s another reason I’m standing up like I am.”

By turning this into a dispute about the specifics of labor law, Walmart can both drag things out for months or years before potentially being forced to reinstate the workers and can try to shift the conversation from Walmart's own rampant abuse of workers and damage to the economy . They'd like to shift the conversation from the workers' voices, while letting workers who haven't yet joined the protests and strikes know the cost of doing so:These efforts to change the subject and silence workers are why it's important to hear what the workers had to say at Thursday's protest:"

Authorities say the former Navy reservist, who had been living in Fort Worth, was the dead gunman at the Washington Navy Yard.

Authorities say the Navy veteran, who had been living in Fort Worth, was the dead gunman at the Washington Navy Yard.

Aaron Alexis lived for a time in a bungalow in the woods near a Buddhist temple in Fort Worth, where he occasionally joined Thai immigrants in meditation. Aaron Alexis died Monday in a gun battle with police at the Washington Navy Yard after he allegedly killed at least 12 people.

Along the way, the man named as the shooter in Monday’s mass killing at Building 197 was discharged from the Navy Reserve, arrested after firing a bullet through his upstairs neighbor’s floor and then asked to leave his Fort Worth apartment.

One Navy official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Alexis was discharged in January 2011 for “a pattern of misconduct” and that the 2010 gun incident in Texas played a role in his departure.

But Alexis, 34, had no trouble landing a civilian job. He moved from Fort Worth to Washington about a month ago, friends said, and was hired as an hourly tech employee for The Experts, a Hewlett-Packard subcontractor that is updating computer systems at Navy and Marine Corps installations worldwide. He was scheduled to begin work at the Washington Navy Yard this month.

Those who knew Alexis in recent years describe him as a “sweet and intelligent guy” (a regular customer at the Thai restaurant where he had been a waiter) and “a good boy” (his landlord), but also as “very aggressive,” someone who seemed as though he might one day kill himself (a lay worker at the Buddhist temple where Alexis worshiped).

That angry streak flared often enough to create an arrest record in three states.

In 2004, Alexis was arrested in Seattle after he fired three shots from a Glock pistol into the tires of a Honda Accord that two construction workers had parked in a driveway adjacent to Alexis’s house. Alexis’s father told detectives then that his son “had experienced anger management problems that the family believed was associated with PTSD,” or post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the police report. The father said Alexis had been “an active participant in rescue attempts of Sept. 11, 2001.”

Alexis’s explanation for his behavior that day: The construction workers had “mocked” and “disrespected” him and then he had “a black-out fueled by anger.”

He was arrested but not charged, Seattle police said. The paperwork apparently was lost.

“That report never got to the Seattle city attorney’s office,” said Kimberly Mills, a spokeswoman for the city attorney. “Consequently, we never filed charges.”

In 2008, Alexis was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge in DeKalb County, Ga. He spent two nights in jail, police said, but they had no other details.

More recently, Alexis struck those who crossed his path as a man of sharp contrasts. He was learning the Thai language, visited Thailand for a month, was studying for an online degree in aeronautical engineering, and enjoyed conversing with diners, according to friends, customers and fellow worshipers. But some said he had an aggressive streak that made them keep their distance and avoid personal questions.

“He’s a 13-year-old stuck in a 34-year-old body,” said Oui Suthamtewakul, owner of the Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White Settlement, Tex., and a friend who lived with Alexis for most of the past three years. “He needs attention.”

Alexis often worked as an unpaid waiter for Suthamtewakul and his wife, Kristi, but lived with them rent-free. The couple described Alexis as a helpful, chatty guy who liked to watch cooking shows on TV.

“He always hit on girls,” Suthamtewakul said, adding that he had to scold his friend for being too forward with female customers.

Suthamtewakul said Alexis “had a gun at all times” and fired a bullet through the wall of his room in the summer of 2012. “You’re gonna kill me,” the restaurateur told his friend. Alexis apologized and said it was an accident.

Alexis drank alcohol frequently and in large quantities, Suthamtewakul said: “He can start drinking at 9:30 in the morning. He drinks often and for fun, but it was never a problem.” Asked what he will remember about his friend, Suthamtewakul said, “Him with a Heineken.”

Alexis grew up in Brooklyn with his parents, Cathleen and Anthony Alexis, said his aunt Helen Weekes. “We haven’t seen him for years,” she said.

He spent nearly four years in the Navy as a full-time reservist from May 2007 until January 2011, according to the Navy. A Navy official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Alexis received a general discharge for “misconduct” and that the 2010 firearms incident in Texas played a role in his departure.

Alexis achieved his final rank — aviation electrician’s mate 3rd class — in December 2009.

He spent the bulk of his service time — 2008 to 2011 — assigned to the Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 46 at Naval Air Station Fort Worth, records show. He received the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the National Defense Service Medal, awards of minor distinction.

Despite the circumstances surrounding his discharge, Alexis apparently was issued a government contractor access card that would have allowed him into the Navy Yard and other military installations, said Thomas Hoshko, chief executive of The Experts. His security clearance was updated in July.

“There had to be a thorough investigation,” Hoshko said. “There is nothing that came up in all the searches.”

Alexis had finished a contract in Japan for the company at the end of 2012, Hoshko said.

“Nobody could have done anything to prevent this except Aaron Alexis,” he said. “Maybe he snapped. I don’t know.”

In Fort Worth, Alexis lived for a time in a gated townhouse community called Orion at Oak Hill. In September 2010, police were called to Apartment 2023 after Alexis’s upstairs neighbor complained that a bullet had been fired through her apartment. Police determined that Alexis had fired a round that went up through her floor and into her ceiling.

The woman told police that Alexis had complained several times that she was too loud. She said he had confronted her a few days earlier in the complex’s parking lot “about making too much noise,” according to a police report.

The woman said that “she is terrified of Aaron and feels that this was done intentionally,” the police report said.

Police tried three times to contact Alexis by knocking on his apartment door, but he didn’t respond. Only after they called in firefighters to force entry did he emerge. He told police that he had been cleaning his gun while cooking and that it accidentally discharged because his hands were greasy, according to the police report.

“He told me that he began to take the gun apart when his hands slipped and pulled the trigger, discharging a round into the ceiling,” the officer wrote. Alexis was arrested for improperly discharging a firearm, but the county district attorney’s office said Monday that there was not enough evidence to pursue the case. Alexis’s mug shot from that arrest shows a clean-shaven man with soft eyes and an impassive expression.

A couple of weeks later, the apartment complex began eviction proceedings against Alexis, according to county records.

Soon after, Somsak Srisan, a Thai immigrant in Fort Worth, met Alexis at the Wat Busayadhammavanaram Meditation Center, where Alexis had occasionally practiced meditation starting in the summer of 2010. Alexis said he needed a place to stay, and Somsak offered him a two-bedroom white bungalow a short walk away — if he promised not to smoke or drink. Alexis rented the place for $600 a month and never missed a payment, said Somsak, 57.

“He’s a good boy,” said Somsak, who spoke halting English. “Everybody would say, ‘He’s a good boy.’ ”

Alexis occasionally meditated at the temple and helped there when needed, said Somsak, who was impressed that his tenant studied the Thai language and visited Thailand.

On Monday, as word spread about the shootings, the temple filled with members eager to share recollections of Alexis. “They don’t believe it that he could kill 12 people like that,” Somsak said. “I think probably somebody tried to put him down. I don’t know. Did somebody try to discriminate against him?”

Somsak asked Alexis only once why he had left his job at the naval base. It was a brief conversation.

“I asked him, ‘Why you quit the job with the government?’ ” Somsak said. “He said, ‘Somebody doesn’t like me.’ ”

Somsak left it there, he said, because “I don’t want to go too deep with him.”

Alexis visited the center about twice a week and was known as a quiet, if tightly wound, participant, a temple staff member said.

“He would help people if they came in carrying heavy things,” said J. Sirun, an assistant to the monks. “From the outside, he was a quiet person. But on the inside, I think he was very aggressive. He did not like to be close with anybody, like a soldier who has been at war.”

Sirun said he avoided Alexis, who preferred to keep to himself. But Alexis was no loner; he had many Thai friends and spoke Thai “very well,” Sirun said. “He understood about 75 percent of the language.”

Customers saw him studying Thai at a table there during his off hours. Alexis stopped showing up at the Buddhist center early in 2011, he said. “I didn’t think he could be this violent,” he said. “I would not have been surprised to hear he had committed suicide. But I didn’t think he could commit murder.”

Relatives contacted by reporters were stunned to hear that Alexis was suspected in the shootings. “I’d be shocked if it was him, but I don’t know,” said Weekes, his aunt, her voice trailing off.

Even as he worked for the defense contractor, Alexis was pursuing a bachelor’s degree in aeronautics as an online student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The university, in Daytona Beach, Fla., said he enrolled in July 2012 via the school’s Fort Worth campus. He remained a student in good standing, said Melanie Hanns, director of university communications.

“He was enrolled for this semester,” she said.

FBI Assistant Director Valerie Parlave asked the public to call 1-800-CALL-FBI with any details about Alexis.

But the trip ended in tragedy when the 15-year-old King College Prep sophomore was fatally shot about a week after she attended President Barack Obama’s inauguration and performed at inaugural events with the King College Prep band and drill team.

Penldeton and a16-year-old boy wounded in the attack were shot in a park near the school about 2:20 p.m., in the 4500 block of South Oakenwald Avenue, police said.

Most of those who were in the park were gang members, and those in the group did not stay on scene to help after the shootings, according to police. The shooting occurred around 2:20 p.m. in the 4500 block of South Oakenwald Avenue.

They boy remained in serious condition Tuesday night. He was also a student at King, according to Pendleton’s friends, though her relatives weren’t sure what school the boy attended.

One of the teens was taken in serious to critical condition to Comer Children's Hospital, according to Chicago Fire Department spokesman Will Knight.

The other victim also was taken to Comer and police at first believed both victims' conditions had stabilized by a little after 3 p.m., said Chicago Police News Affairs Officer Veejay Zala.

At Comer this evening, a group of young people sat and stood inside the entrance to the hospital's emergency room, along with the principal of King high school.

Many hugged as they brushed tears from their eyes and consoled each other and Pendleton's parents.

""She was awesome,"" one girl said of Pendleton outside the hospital's ER.

Friends of the slain girl said King was dismissed early today because of exams, and students went to the park on Oakenwald--something they don't usually do.

Friends said the girl was a majorette and a volleyball player, a friendly and sweet presence at King, one of the top 10 CPS selective enrollment schools. Pendleton performed with other King College students at President Barack Obama’s inaugural events.

Neighbors said students from King do hang out at Harsh Park, 4458-70 S. Oakenwald Ave., and that students were there this afternoon before the shooting took place. A group of 10 to 12 teens at the park had taken shelter under a canopy there during a rainstorm when a boy or man jumped a fence in the park, ran toward the group and opened fire, police said in a statement this evening.

The attacker then got into an auto and left the area, police said.

Neighbors reported hearing shots about 2:20 p.m.

Desiree Sanders said she heard six gunshots and called 911 after a neighbor told her that some teens had been shot. Neighbors told her as many as 10 young people had been hanging out at the small park, and most scattered after the shooting, though a few stayed behind with the victims.

Those in the group were not cooperating with police, however, and investigators had no detailed descriptions yet of either the attacker or the vehicle in which he left. Central Area detectives were investigating, and they had no one in custody as of about 8:20 p.m.

Police crime data show no serious crimes happened in the 4400 or 4500 blocks of South Oakenwald Avenue Dec. 19 to Jan. 20.

“It’s a great neighborhood. Nothing like this has happened since I’ve been here,” on the block, said Roxanne Hubbard, who has lived in the neighborhood for 19 years.

As a matter of policy, Chicago Board of Education officials refuse to confirm whether any child is a student at Chicago Public Schools because a policy on student identification passed by the board several years ago has never been implemented.

Senate will hold key procedural vote Thursday on gun legislation

President Obama has been pushing for gun-control measures in wake of several massacres

Deal would close loophole on purchases made at gun shows and online

WASHINGTON — Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., announced a compromise bill Wednesday that would expand background checks for gun buyers, possibly paving the way for votes this week on a key piece of legislation aimed at reducing gun violence.

They announced the deal as the Senate gets ready for its most intense debate on gun control since 1994.

""I don't consider criminal background checks to be gun control. It's just common sense,"" Toomey said at a Capitol Hill news conference. ""If you pass ... you get to buy a gun. It's the people who fail that we don't want having guns.""

The deal would expand background checks to purchases made at gun shows and online sales of firearms. It would impose penalties on states that do not add records of felons and the mentally ill to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

The agreement would not require private citizens to keep records of gun sales. It would specifically ban ""the federal government from creating a national firearms registry"" — a key sticking point for the pro-gun rights community.

The bill would also create a commission ""to study the causes of mass violence in the United States, looking at all aspects of the problem"" including guns, school safety, violent video games and mental health.

Background checks are currently required for purchases made through licensed gun dealers.

""We strengthen rights of law-abiding gun owners,"" Manchin said, explaining that the background checks are designed ""to keep people from having guns who shouldn't have them.""

Manchin, a red-state Democrat, and Toomey, a blue-state Republican, represent neighboring Appalachian states with strong gun cultures. Manchin said that common ground helped forge a compromise.

But the deal didn't win over the National Rifle Association, which remains opposed to any expansion of background checks. ""Expanding background checks at gun shows will not prevent the next shooting, will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA. But he did say the private sale exemption in the compromise amendment was a ""positive development.""

The NRA did support a second agreement, brokered by Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, to strengthen the penalty for straw purchasers and firearm trafficking.

That came in response to concerns about whether a law aimed at straw buyers — people who intentionally buy guns for those banned from owning them — would ensnare law-abiding citizens who legally buy guns as gifts or raffle prizes.

""We worked with the NRA and with several other senators to ensure that nothing in our bill infringes on the Second Amendment rights of lawful gun owners and purchasers, while still providing a strong new set of tools for law enforcement officials,"" Leahy said in a statement.

The proposed amendments come as the Senate prepares to hold a key procedural vote Thursday to allow a vote on the gun legislation, which has been pushed by President Obama in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and six adults dead.

Obama has been pushing for expanded background checks for gun buyers, as part of a package of new gun legislation aimed at reducing the kinds of gun violence seen in massacres in Newtown on Dec. 14 and a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last July.

Other elements of Obama's package — particularly a ban on assault weapons and a limit on high-capacity ammunition clips — passed the Senate Judiciary Committee but are not included in the gun bill heading to the Senate floor. Most Republicans and even some Democrats from red states, such as Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, were opposed to the measure.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the assault weapons ban did not have the votes to pass, but he will allow it to be offered as an amendment.

Obama said in a statement Wednesday, ""This is not my bill, and there are aspects of the agreement that I might prefer to be stronger. But the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress. It recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue, and we don't have to agree on everything to know that we've got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence.""

He added, ""The Senate must overcome obstruction by defeating a threatened filibuster, and allow a vote on this and other commonsense reforms to protect our kids and our communities. ""

Thursday's procedural vote is aimed at ending a threatened filibuster by more than a dozen Republicans, led by Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. Lee said a filibuster would allow ""three more days to assess how the bill would impact the rights of law-abiding citizens.""

""This debate is not just about magazine clips and pistol grips,"" he said on the Senate floor. ""It's about the purpose of the Second Amendment."" Such far-reaching legislation should be subjected to a 60-vote majority to ensure bipartisan consensus, he said.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, declined to comment on the Senate compromise, or whether it would get a vote in the U.S. House.

Boehner has said the House will not take up any gun legislation until the Senate passes a bill. ""I want to wait and see what actually passes over in the Senate,"" Boehner said, when asked about the Manchin-Toomey compromise. ""I've made it clear: If the Senate passes a bill, the House will review it.""

Among supporters of stricter gun-safety laws, the Manchin-Toomey deal was reason for optimism.

As the families of Sandy Hook victims wept in the Senate gallery, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., took the floor this morning to commend their work to lobby Congress on the gun-safety legislation.

He called the Manchin-Toomey deal ""a promising and profoundly constructive turning point in this process"" that makes a vote much more likely.

Pistorius said that he thought Steenkamp was a burglar and he shot her under that assumption. Prosecutors say he knew it was Steenkamp, who was locked in a bathroom at the time of the shooting.

Here, supplied by the Associated Press, are excerpts from the affidavit made by Pistorius and read in court during Pistorius’ bail hearing by senior defense lawyer Barry Roux in a bail hearing Tuesday.

“On the 13th of February 2013 Reeva would have gone out with her friends and I with my friends. Reeva then called me and asked that we rather spend the evening at home. I agreed. … By about 22h00 on 13 February 2013 we were in our bedroom. She was doing her yoga exercises and I was in bed watching television. My prosthetic legs were off. We were deeply in love and I could not be happier. I know she felt the same way. She had given me a present for Valentine’s Day but asked me only to open it the next day.

“After Reeva finished her yoga exercises she got into bed and we both fell asleep. I am acutely aware of violent crime being committed by intruders entering homes … I have received death threats before. I have also been a victim of violence and of burglaries before. For that reason I kept my firearm, a 9 mm Parabellum, underneath my bed when I went to bed at night.

“During the early morning hours of 14 February 2013, I woke up, went onto the balcony to bring the fan in and closed the sliding doors, the blinds and the curtains. I heard a noise in the bathroom and realized that someone was in the bathroom .… I felt a sense of terror rushing over me. …

“I believed that someone had entered my house. I was too scared to switch a light on.

“I grabbed my 9 mm pistol from underneath my bed. On my way to the bathroom I screamed words to the effect for him/them to get out of my house and for Reeva to phone the police. It was pitch dark in the bedroom and I thought Reeva was in bed. I noticed that the bathroom window was open. I realized that the intruder/s was/were in the toilet because the toilet door was closed and I did not see anyone in the bathroom .…

“It filled me with horror and fear of an intruder or intruders being inside the toilet .… As I did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable, I knew I had to protect Reeva and myself. I believed that when the intruder/s came out of the toilet we would be in grave danger .…

“I fired shots at the toilet door and shouted to Reeva to phone the police. She did not respond .… Everything was pitch dark in the bedroom and I was still too scared to switch on a light. Reeva was not responding.

“When I reached the bed, I realized that Reeva was not in bed. That is when it dawned on me that it could have been Reeva who was in the toilet. I returned to the bathroom calling her name. I tried to open the toilet door but it was locked. I rushed back into the bedroom and opened the sliding door exiting onto the balcony and screamed for help.

“I put on my prosthetic legs, ran back to the bathroom and tried to kick the toilet door open. I think I must then have turned on the lights. I went back into the bedroom and grabbed my cricket bat to bash open the toilet door .… Reeva was slumped over but alive.

“I battled to get her out of the toilet and pulled her into the bathroom. I phoned Johan Stander who was involved in the administration of the estate and asked him to phone the ambulance .… I carried her downstairs in order to take her to the hospital .… I tried to render the assistance to Reeva that I could, but she died in my arms .…

“I cannot bear to think of the suffering I have caused her and her family, knowing how much she was loved. I also know that the events of that tragic night were as I have described them and that in due course I have no doubt the police and expert investigators will bear this out.”

Three inmates escaped%2C all have been apprehended

The inmates stopped their stolen car and threatened a small-town mayor during a police chase

The mayor defied their command to get in their car and fled

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Two inmates who fled a Kansas prison face several charges in Missouri where they're accused of trying to ambush the officers pursuing them and of attempting to kidnap the mayor of the small town where they were eventually captured after less than a day on the run.

Platte County Prosecutor Eric Zahnd said Allen M. Hurst and Scott A. Gilbert were in the county jail on $5 million cash bond after being charged with 12 felonies Saturday. Hurst, 31, and Gilbert, 49, are accused of escaping from the minimum-security unit at the Lansing, Kan., Correction Facility on Friday, stealing a pickup truck and leading law enforcement on a 30-minute chase to a community across the Missouri River.

Zahnd said the men briefly stopped the stolen truck during the police chase and pointed a gun at Edgerton Mayor James Snook Jr., who was watching the pursuit from a street in his town, about 30 miles north of Kansas City. One of the men ordered Snook to get in the pickup, but Snook refused and safely fled the area.

""I don't know what he said, but he obviously declined. ... and he ran,"" Zahnd said of the mayor.

Snook, reached at home Saturday, declined comment.

A third inmate, Randy Ridens, 57, who also escaped with the pair from the northeast Kansas prison located across the Missouri River about 30 miles southwest of Edgerton, was captured late Friday in Topeka, Kan. Authorities didn't provide further details about how Ridens was apprehended.

Jeremy Barclay, spokesman for the Kansas Department of Corrections, said Saturday that Ridens has been returned to the Lansing prison. Additional charges have yet to be filed against him, Barclay said.

Corrections officials are investigating how the three inmates escaped from the large prison complex, which houses about 2,400 inmates. Barclay said the department will interview all three men about the escape.

""Inmates are usually helpful in detailing all of what they did,"" he said.

Authorities used GPS signals to locate the stolen pickup in Platte City, according to a probable cause statement. Officers tried to stop Hurst and Gilbert after they left a McDonald's, and the men eventually fired shots at four officers, hitting their cars, the statement said.

The officers, who were not injured, believed the two men were trying to ambush them, the probable cause statement said.

""At one point, officers radioed they perceived the suspects were luring officers into a trap by shooting the pursuing vehicles coming over a hill,"" the statement said. ""Within moments of that radio transmission, the fleeing vehicle had slowed on the blind side of a hill, allowing the passenger to take closer and more accurate shots at officers.""

Hurst and Gilbert stopped the truck at a rural home and bailed out of the vehicle after it became stuck in the yard of the house. They broke into the home, which had no one inside it at the time, the statement said.

After several hours of negotiations, Hurst and Gilbert walked out of the home and into police custody Friday about 5 p.m.

They're each charged with several counts of first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer and armed criminal action, and one count each of attempted kidnapping, resisting arrest and tampering.

The men, who had been serving sentences for crimes including burglary and theft, could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of the new charges, Zahnd said.

""The state of Missouri owes it to our law enforcement officers to do everything we can to protect those who are sworn to protect the rest of us,"" the prosecutor said."

The defense team in the Phoenix courtroom rested at the start of the day without calling any additional witnesses to testify.

""At this point, the defense rests,"" attorney Kirk Nurmi told the judge.

The decision came after about 2 1/2 months of testimony.

Prosecutor Juan Martinez started the states rebuttal by calling Arizona clinical psychologist Janeen DeMarte.

DeMarte testified she conducted an evaluation of Arias and administered several tests on reading, intelligence and memory.

""She performed well on it,"" DeMarte said of the memory test she gave Arias.

In regard to the IQ test, DeMarte said Arias scored a 119.

Arias, a 32-year-old photographer, is accused of shooting Alexander in the face, stabbing him 27 times, and slitting his throat from ear to ear in the shower of his Mesa apartment on June 4, 2008. She has pleaded not guilty to murder, contending that she killed Alexander in self-defense.

Prosecutors allege Arias was jealous and did not want Alexander to see other women.

DeMarte said she reviewed an evaluation of Arias by Dr. Cheryl L. Karp, the Vice-Chairperson for the State of Arizona Board of Psychologist Examiners. DeMarte said Arias indicated more episodes of alleged abuse to Dr. Karp than she did to herself and the other defense experts.

""She told me there were four distinct episodes of alleged abuse,"" Demarte said of her evaluation of Arias.

Martinez then asked DeMarte how many incidents of alleged abuse Arias recounted to Dr. Karp.

""I can't even count [them] ... there was numerous reports of frequent abuse and threatening behavior,"" DeMarte said.

DeMarte said she diagnosed Arias with borderline personality disorder. She also testified she found no evidence to believe Arias' claims about her memory problems or that she was a victim of domestic violence and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.

""There wasn't symptoms that were consistent with that diagnosis,"" she said of the PTSD.

During cross-examination by defense attorney Jennifer Willmott, DeMarte stood her ground. She did not flinch when the attorney suggested she was too young or lacked experience. At one point Willmott asked DeMarte about her knowledge of Alyce LaViolette, the defense teams domestic violence expert.

Willmott pointed out that DeMarte had not been born when LaViolette got her Masters degree in 1980.

Willmott is expected to continue her redirect of DeMarte on Wednesday, at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time.

A steady stream of people entered the House of Prayer and Praise church in Detroit on Friday for the funeral of McBride, 19, who was shot to death about 2:30 a.m. on Saturday on the porch of a home in Dearborn Heights, Mich. Civil rights leaders have called for an investigation of the shooting using language that recalls the racially charged deaths of Trayvon Martin, Emmett Till and Yusef Hawkins.

The family and her supporters say the woman, who was a recent graduate of Southfield High School and had just gotten a job at Ford Motor Co., was in a car accident in the early morning hours. Her cellphone battery was dead so she walked several blocks seeking help at a house. The person inside, a man who has not been named, went to the door and fired a shotgun in her face, according to police reports.

“It's hard to be believe it’s an accident when a gun is in her face and the trigger is pulled,” the family's attorney, Gerald Thurswell, told reporters.

“It appears this young woman was merely seeking help following a car accident as her cellphone went dead,” said a statement by leaders of the Detroit branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. “After knocking on a neighbor’s door, instead of being aided in the situation or police called for an investigation, she was shot fatally in the head. Have we become a society where we are no longer our neighbors’ keeper?

“This shooting must be investigated at every level,” said the civil rights group, one of several involved in the case.

All have called for an investigation into the shooting and the familiar refrain of “No Justice, No Peace” was chanted by about 50 people protesting at the Dearborn Heights police station this week. That slogan was frequent battle cry during the protests over the acquittal of George Zimmerman who shot unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.

“We are in prayer for the family of Renisha McBride but we are also urgently calling for justice,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, also involved with Martin family, said in a statement. Sharpton's National Action Network is one of the groups calling for an investigation in Michigan.

No charges have been filed in the case, but authorities have said they were investigating. According to police, the man told investigators that he thought someone was trying to break into his home and accidentally discharged the gun.

Earlier this week, police said they requested a warrant in the case. The Wayne County prosecutor's office sent the request back to police Wednesday for additional investigation before making a charging decision.

“We will not be able to make a charging decision until the requested work has been completed,” the prosecutor's office said in a statement.

“I'm confident when the evidence comes it will show that my client was justified and acted as a reasonable person would who was in fear for his life,” Cheryl Carpenter, one of two lawyers representing the unnamed man, told the Detroit News."

Ever imagined what it would be like to be someone else for a day? How about for the rest of your life?

That’s the reality for the thousands who have entered the federal witness protection program since it started in 1971.

Officially called the Witness Security Program, it provides protection for government witnesses who are at risk due to testimony they’ve given about terrorists or criminals.

“No one knows what we do to protect witnesses, and it’s good for us,” said David Harlow, associate director for operations with the U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees the vast program.

“It’s about taking people and changing their way of life,” Harlow added. “These people truly are in danger.”

More than 18,400 men, women and children have participated in it, and not one of the 8,500 witnesses or the 9,900 family members has been harmed, according to the U.S Marshals Service. “It’s a big feather in our cap,” Harlow said.

The program has made some limited information available to the public on its website: It provides 24-hour protection to all witnesses while they are in a high-threat environment; witnesses receive financial assistance for housing and subsistence for basic living expenses and medical care; the program also provides for job training and employment assistance.

In an interview with CNN, Gerald Shur, who created the program, offered insight into the inner workings of this secretive government service.

Shur was an attorney in what was then the Justice Department’s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section in the 1960s when he developed the idea to protect witnesses.

“It occurred to me that we have to have a way that if a guy is in danger because of his testimony, we have to get him out of there, and in a second,” said Shur, 79, who is now retired.

But the transition to a new life doesn’t always come easily, he said.

“It takes time for them to adjust, ” Shur said. “(A witness) not only has to deal with leaving his entire family, but he has caused his wife to leave her family; he’s caused his children to leave their grandparents. They can’t communicate. They can’t see each other. But the driving force is ‘If I go back, I’ll be murdered.’ ”

Most witnesses who enter the program are not law-abiding citizens, according to Shur.

“Ninety-five percent of them are what we call criminals,” he said. “Not everybody is a killer or a member of the Hell’s Angels or the mob, but there are people who are doing business with criminals.

“They might say they were legitimate businessmen, but they would bribe people,” Shur said, recalling the case of an engineer who bought off a mayor.

“He said it wasn’t bad because that’s how you do business in the city. In his mind, he wasn’t doing anything criminal,” Shur said.

While most witnesses are familiar with the criminal justice system, their loved ones are not and often must accept being completely cut off from everyone they know. “You’re talking about wives, children, grandchildren – they are the really innocent people,” Shur said, “They are in it for life, as far as I was concerned.”

The program is also completely voluntary. While witnesses and their family members are free to return to their former identities, they do so at their own peril, Shur said.

“I’ve had witnesses ask me if it’s safe to go home. I never said yes. I always felt there was a risk still there,” Shur said, “and that if a defendant against whom they testified is dead, there may be a family member out to get revenge or somebody within his organization who wants to be a hero of some sort and kill him.”

Shur recalled two instances when witnesses refused protection. “(One witness) went back to his home and turned the doorknob and it blew up. And there was another witness – we tried to talk her into it. She refused and she was murdered.”

Henry Hill, the gangster who was the inspiration for the 1990 film “Goodfellas,” opted out of the witness protection program, as did mob turncoat Sammy “the Bull” Gravano.

But those witnesses’ decisions to leave the program make them the exception to the rule, Shur said.li

After a witness agrees to testify for the prosecution, he or she may be eligible to start receiving protection. Shur described an effective way of choosing where to relocate a witness.

“I would say to them, ‘Tell me what’s your favorite place in the U.S.?’ ” Shur said, “and they’d say, ‘I always wanted to go to Hawaii,’ or that they had family in Texas or Florida. And in my mind that’s three places that they are not going. Because when you tell me you want to go to Hawaii, I know you have told all your friends that.”

Deputy marshals take the witness and the witness’ family and move them to another area, Shur said. Sometimes, they start in a hotel. Sometimes, they are near other witnesses – although they’d never know it, he added.

“In the beginning when the witnesses were moved off to another city, we’d run into the problems you would expect – what to do about a driver’s license, Social Security cards, how do you get him a job, money, what happens if you need Medicare care, what about the house he owns, the furniture, and so on.”

Witnesses get help finding a job, but they aren’t always compensated.

“The program has nothing to do with reward money, nothing. They get money for a period of time, and then it stops,” Shur said. “We used a formula. If you are a family of four in New York, you would get more money than a family of four from Corpus Christi. It’s based on cost of living, and it wasn’t based on the value of the testimony.”

Shur said his work protecting witnesses put his family’s life in danger. “There was a threat against my wife. I was told that there was an individual who had my name and my wife’s name in his address book and that he had a contract from the Medellin Cartel to kidnap my wife and learn where a particular witness was living. And I immediately asked for protection for my wife.”

Today’s witness protection program faces the added burdens of the digital age. Facebook, Google, texting and the instant access to information via the Internet and smartphones provide new challenges to keep the identities of witnesses a secret.

“The modern world of technology, because there is more information out there, it’s that much more important for our people to be vigilant and for us to be vigilant,” said Harlow of the U.S. Marshals Service.

Vigilance plays a role, but Shur suggested another factor may also play an important role.

“Luck, you have to throw in some luck,” he said. “You can’t go this many years with this many witnesses without some luck in this thing.”"

An elite Capitol Police tactical team is based just a few blocks from the Navy Yard

They responded quickly but were ordered away by a Capitol Police watch commander%2C one officer says

The Capitol Police are launching an investigation into the allegation

The U.S. Capitol Police have launched an investigation into whether an elite tactical team was abruptly recalled from responding to Monday's Navy Yard shooting massacre before D.C. Metropolitan Police officers confronted the shooter.

Two Metropolitan Police officers entered the Navy Yard without the Capitol Police team and one was wounded by the gunman, Aaron Alexis.

Capitol Police spokesman Shennell Antrobus said Wednesday that Chief Kim Dine ordered the independent inquiry, which is to report its findings and recommendations by Oct. 21.

The elite Capitol Police Containment & Emergency Response Team is based just a few blocks from the Navy Yard. A law enforcement source told WUSA-TV the unit was less than 30 seconds from the gate and responded as Metropolitan Police pleaded for help.

A Capitol Police watch commander ""wouldn't let them go in and stop people from being slaughtered,"" one officer told the Washington TV station, which is owned by Gannett, USA TODAY's parent company.

An officer toldThe Washington Post that the officers' union had filed a complaint. The Capitol Police have launched an investigation into the allegation

""We were definitely the closest tactical team in the city,"" the unidentified officer told the newspaper. ""It was at the scene very early on, within a couple of minutes. They were ordered to disengage and turn back. For what reason, we don't know.""

Capitol Police acknowledged that the department had ""offered and provided mutual support and assistance.""

""I take our response to this tragedy and our support to law enforcement partners very seriously,"" Dine said in a separate statement. ""While I am the Chief of Police, at my core I am a police officer who feels strongly about our shared commitment and responsibilities. ... I place a high priority on law enforcement agency relationships and law enforcement coordination and communication.""

Dine, a former D.C. district commander , said that he ""personally offered assets"" to D.C. Chief Cathy Lanier. He also said he was ""in close & constant coordination"" with D.C. police, the Capitol Police Board, the FBI, Park Police and other responding agencies, ""while focused on the security of the Capitol Complex.""

Dine became the Capitol's top cop in December 2012.

The CERT, created in 1978, consists of three ""cells"" — two assault teams of at least six officers each, plus and a counter-sniper unit. Two teams were on duty Monday and the third was training at Fort Meade, the Post reported.

The Capitol Police say ""their primary mission consists of rescuing Congressional members, their staff, and visitors who have been taken hostage by terrorists. Secondary missions include, countering threats made against dignitaries, responding to critical incidents and providing security for major events, such as the Presidential Inauguration.""

Congress created the Capitol Police in 1828 to provide security for the Capitol building. Today, the department's duties include protecting members of Congress and their families in addition to policing congressional buildings, parks and streets covering about 25 city blocks."

(CNN) —

Since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the death of Trayvon Martin, everyone has had an opinion about the verdict.

I am not about to second-guess the jury’s decision or pass judgment on them. Our judicial system is operating as it was designed. The jurors reached their conclusion based on the evidence placed before them and their interpretation of the law as it was explained.

As human beings, we see the world through the lens of our own experiences. Both science and history prove that we all have unconscious biases that impact the decisions we make.

There are some who say that the Zimmerman-Martin case had nothing to do with race. There are others who say that the case was all about race.

Al Vivian

One idea that has come up: “What if we reverse the races so that Martin was white and Zimmerman was black?” That exercise, while potent, doesn’t prove or disprove the relevance race played in the case.

A more powerful approach is to totally remove race as a factor by creating a scenario in which both the perpetrator and the victim are of the same race and then see whether people change their views. For example: “What if Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman were both white? Or both black?”

If Zimmerman and Martin were both white, ask yourself:

• Would it have taken 44 days and a national protest to merely justify the arrest of a known killer? A killer who shot an unarmed child, initially stalked that child, was charged with two previous felonies – “battery of law enforcement officer” and “resisting officer with violence” – was accused of domestic violence (both charges were reduced, though some would say that’s the benefit of Zimmerman having a father who is a retired judge) and disobeyed the authorities when told not to follow the person he eventually killed.

• Would authorities have not drug tested the killer but instead drug tested the victim?

• Would hordes of people have donated money to help the killer hire a strong defense team that eventually got him acquitted?

• Would society have given so much credibility to the killer’s version of the events?

Many have tried to deflect the discomfort of this scenario by focusing on black-on-black crime. While such crime is a very serious issue that must be addressed by our society and especially the black community, turning to black-on-black crime is a form of avoidance. The uncomfortable truth is that very likely, most people would see the case differently if the killer and victim were both white.

When will we reach a day when we don’t have to refer to crimes in racial terms?

In light of how much we know about ourselves on a scientific level, it is a shame that people are still so divided by race. In 2003, the mapping of the human genome code proved that there are no significant genetic differences between what we call “races.” Every human being on the planet is 99.9% genetically identical to every other human being. But as societies, we live in constructs.

For those who fear the average random black male wearing a hoodie, I can empathize with you. But statistically, you should be more afraid of the person you see every day in the mirror. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, suicide is one of the top causes of death for white Americans (PDF). Homicide is not. So, your chance of killing yourself is greater than your chance of being killed by anyone, of any race.

Let’s turn back to the question: “If the victim and the killer were both white, would society have given so much credibility to the killer’s version of events?”

I doubt that a jury so heavily made up of white mothers would have related to or felt empathy toward a man who had stalked and killed an unarmed child who could have very easily been one of their own.

Lowry makes the indisputable point that the same media that have spent years attacking the Tea Party, and months savaging the NRA, are now revealing brazen hypocrisy when it comes to protecting their own rights. In spirit and goal, the media are now one with the Tea Party and NRA.

What animates the Tea Party and NRA is a legitimate concern that the government — especially under President Obama — has made a disturbing pivot from their Constitutional requirement to protect our liberties, to infringing upon our liberties. In turn, Obama and his media label us as anti-government crazies suffering from paranoid delusions.

But look at the reaction this week from that very same media in the wake of the Associated Press scandal. Suddenly the media don’t like Big Government doing to them what ObamaCare and background checks will do to the rest of us. Moreover, the very same media that suggest not trusting the government is a form of extremism, is now demanding a law be immediately passed to shield them from government intrusion.

The media don’t trust the government anymore than we do. Who is the paranoid crazy now?

Lowry:

At his briefing, Carney hung to the word “unfettered” like a drowning man. He said over and over again things like the president believes in an “unfettered ability to pursue investigative journalism” but that there should be “balance.” The implicit reaction in the room was: “Balance? Don’t give us any stinkin’ balance. Give us our rights.”

In this, the reporters exhibited a healthy impulse toward vigilance about liberty. The phrase “chilling effect” has been bandied about often. A chill comes not necessarily from what government is doing to you but from what it might do to you. Very few reporters will ever have their records secretly subpoenaed by the government, but it is intolerable to them that it could happen. On top of everything else, it is the principle of the thing — an infringement, or even a potential infringement, on the constitutional rights of even a handful of reporters is an affront to all.

There are lots of people who share this way of thinking about rights and government. Some of them gather every year at places like CPAC and the National Rifle Association annual convention.

We have just gone through a period when scorn was heaped on the NRA for opposing new gun rules out of the very same logic that compels reporters to react so strongly against the AP subpoena. The NRA will not abide an infringement on anyone’s legitimate right to bear arms, and it fears what could come of enhanced state power. Like the reporters, it casts a jaundiced eye on the reassurances of government. What they are to the First Amendment, it is to the Second.

Read it all.

At his Politico perch, Lowry is writing one of the best columns around. Keep an eye out for it.

Harrowing 911 calls made from Sandy Hook Elementary School to police in Newtown, Conn., were released Wednesday, giving the public a small but chilling window into the mass shooting that killed 26 people, including 20 children, last December.

Authorities released seven audio-enhanced calls made as 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza shot his way into the school and began his killing spree.

Newtown police dispatchers can be heard urging school administrators to take shelter amid the massacre.

""Keep everyone down, keep everyone away from the windows,"" a female dispatcher calmly tells a teacher. ""Try to lock down the school.""

A male dispatcher stayed on the line for several minutes with Rick Thorne, the school's custodian.

""There's still shooting going on, please!"" Thorne shouts. “I keep hearing shooting. I keep hearing popping.” The sound of gunshots can be heard in the background.

The dispatcher picks up several calls in a row while keeping the custodian on the line for updates on the shooting.

""Guys, we've got a shooting in Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,"" the dispatcher says to his colleagues. ""That's why 911 is ringing off the hook right now.""

Stephen Sedensky III, a state's attorney, fought against the release of the calls, arguing that the tapes — which were ""being made on the murder of children as it occurs"" — were too gruesome for residents to bear.

""If the public never hears those cries for help during this process, they won't be harmed,"" Sedensky said last month.

Nathan C. Zezula, attorney for the Newtown Police Department, said the department wanted to keep the tapes away from ""voyeuristic interests.""

Story continues

But Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott ruled that the 911 tapes be released under the Freedom of Information Act so the public could judge the police response to the killings.

On Tuesday, Newtown School Superintendent John Reed sent an email to Newtown parents, warning that the recordings could serve as an ""emotional trigger.""

Newtown First Selectman Patricia Llodra, who supported making the calls public, released a statement Wednesday:





The release of the tapes will create a new layer of pain for many in the Newtown community. Hearing those calls takes us back to a day of horror and tragedy. My plea is for the media to treat us kindly ... to recognize that there is great personal pain in this event and little public good to be garnered through the general release. Imagine yourself as a parent of a child who was killed, or a family member of one of the six educators. Imagine yourself as a teacher or staff member in that building desperate to save the lives of children. Imagine you are the parent of a child who was able to escape. Then ask yourself, media person, what is the public good and how do I balance that against the hurt?



Last week, Sedensky released a summary of the state's nearly yearlong investigation into the massacre, shedding no new light on Lanza's motive. Lanza, who killed his mother at their Newtown home before his rampage at the school, killed himself as police arrived.

""The obvious question that remains is: 'Why did the shooter murder twenty-seven people, including twenty children?'"" the report states. ""Unfortunately, that question may never be answered conclusively.""

""For more than a year, we have been listening to the conversation about this case -- from voices on every side -- and we have become very sensitive to the racial context that surrounds this case.

We would like to stress that the verdict was reached fairly and justly and that it reflects the letter of the law and represents the law’s proper application to the facts.

EXCLUSIVE: An Alabama family recounted to FoxNews.com a chilling airport encounter they had last month with the man they believe went on to gun down 12 people at a Washington military facility, and said the confrontation was triggered by the hearty laugh of a 75-year-old matriarch.

“We were just laughing and talking and he came over and said we were laughing at him,” Rosalind Baugh told FoxNews.com, speaking of Aaron Alexis, the troubled former Navy Reservist and government contractor who went on a shooting spree in the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters in southeast Washington Monday.

Since the shooting, in which Alexis was killed by police, several reports have surfaced about his anti-social behavior, mental problems and record of arrests for gun offenses. As soon as he was identified as the shooter, Baugh and other family members present at Norfolk Airport for the Aug. 4 incident have been reliving the frightening encounter daily.

[pullquote]

According to Rosalind Baugh, Wallis Boyd and Glynda Boyd, the incident began when Baugh laughed at an innocent joke among loved ones and the man they now believe be Aaron Alexis angrily approached the group. Things quickly escalated, with Alexis screaming profanities and motioning at his side as though he were carrying a weapon. Unable to calm the stranger down, family members called security, who spoke with Alexis in front of a terminal of terrified travelers.

“Everyone in the airport was scared, we were all scared,” Glynda Boyd told FoxNews.com.

Three days later, Alexis told police in Newport, R.I., that he believed people he had gotten into an argument with at an airport were following him and laughing at him from another room. Newport police provided the report, along with their concerns about Alexis’ mental instability, to local Navy officials. The Navy has not commented on what steps were or were not taken.

According to the Newport police report, Alexis said “while getting onto his flight from Virginia to Rhode Island he got into an altercation with an unknown party in the airport. [He] believes that the individual that he got into an argument with has sent three people to follow him and keep him awake by talking to him and sending vibrations into his body. [He] stated that he has not witnessed any of these individuals, but believes they are two black males and a black female.”

The Boyd and Baugh family, who were traveling back home to Birmingham after a family reunion in Virginia, believe they were the ""tormentors"" Alexis described. They recalled in vivid detail meeting the future killer while they were waiting in front of their gate in the Southwest terminal for a 1:30 p.m. flight. Rosalind Baugh was in her wheelchair and waiting in the escort line by the gate when boarding began.

“She laughed out loud and he thought she was laughing at him,” Rosalind’s sister in law Wallis, 74, explained to FoxNews.com.

“Rosalind was tickled at something somebody said and she was laughing and well, it was pretty loud. So then he came over and he started cursing us out,” Wallis said.

“We asked him to stop cursing in front of all those people. He was saying some bad words I wouldn’t want to say. Vile words. It was awful. It was very disrespectful and it was terrible. We really had a problem when he came over.”

Glynda, Rosalind’s niece, explained how her aunt was just sitting in her chair enjoying the company of family.

“We were just waiting at our gate and my Aunt Rosalind was sitting in her wheelchair for escort service and communicating with my uncle and my brother and were just talking and Aaron Alexis walked over to our gate and he came behind us and stopped right at us and said 'Who is that lady laughing at? Is she laughing at me? Who is she laughing at?'”

“I said, 'No, no, she doesn’t even know you. She’s just laughing,'” Glynda said.

Alexis stood by the family for another minute without saying anything and then walked away. Five minutes later, the family says, he came back.

Then he asked again, “Why is this lady laughing at me? What is she laughing at?”

Glynda Boyd said she replied to the killer, “She doesn’t even see you, she is 75 years old.”

That’s when Glynda’s brother Michael told Alexis, “hey there, this is inappropriate for you to approach us like this. You need to stop. You’re out of line. Don’t come over like this.”

Then, according to the family members, Alexis started spewing vile curse words, loudly, at them.

Airport security then came over and talked to Alexis. They said “if you say anything else and approach these people again you are not going to be getting on your flight,” Glynda explained.

After that Alexis stood by a sports bar watching television with security standing around in the area watching him and continually asking the family if they were ok.

When news broke of the shooting, along with a photo of Alexis, family members say they were stunned.

“When I first saw his face it blew me away completely. It just blew me away,” Glynda said.

“We could’ve been those killed people. We could’ve been killed.""

Really.","These people aren't right in the head.

These people aren't right in the head.

In the aftermath of horrible tragedies like Newtown, the government desperately wants to do something--even if that something is the wrong thing. There seems to be this notion, at least among liberals, that more laws will protect us--but as we all witnessed in Boston, that isn't necessarily the case. The government can't make us safer until it recognizes that the problem isn't the instruments of violence--but the environment of it. […] If Congress wants to stop these tragedies, then it has to address the government's own hostility to the institution of the family and organizations that can address the real problem: the human heart. As I've said before, America doesn't need gun control, it needs self-control. And a Congress that actively discourages it--through abortion, family breakdown, sexual liberalism, or religious hostility--is only compounding the problem.

The far-far-right Family Research Council is out with their own take on the Boston bombing and Newtown. As expected, it's so insane that you'd be hard pressed to even parody it. Now, I really would like everyone here to just pause for a moment and contemplate how very effed up in the head you would have to be to look at Newtown, and look at Boston, and think ""the problem here is sexual liberalism."" Or ""abortion."" And we're not even going to get into ""religious hostility,"" coming from a crowd that is very aggressively hostile to religion, if that religion is not one very specific one, and a narrow ideological sub-sect of that religion at that. ""Family breakdown"" is a lovely catch-all, yes, let's all be on the lookout for ""family breakdown."" But sexual liberalism, now that is a hum-effing-dinger. If you really think the manhunt for two or more terrorists is because people are using birth control or not hating gay people enough nowadays, you are, well, deranged.

So the Family Research Council is certain that it's not access to ""the instruments of violence"" that's the problem (a curious phrasing, but at least we've gotten an acknowledgement that yes, we are talking about ""instruments of violence"")—it's sex. It's sex, and the womenfolk, and the government telling you you can't demand your employees not take birth control.

That's Alex Jones levels of conspiracy theorizing, right there. That's being so unhinged from common sense that people want to cross to the other side of the street when they see you coming toward them. Is there any supposedly ""respectable"" conservative group left that is not just a haven for outright cultists at this point?

HOOD, TEXAS — A military judge decided Monday to grant a request by accused Ft. Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan to represent himself at his court-martial, finding him competent to waive his right to counsel after a doctor testified that he is physically capable of handling his defense during what’s likely to be a lengthy trial.

The military judge, Col. Tara Osborn, had ordered Hasan to undergo a physical exam last week and ruled Monday after summoning the doctor who performed the exam to testify about Hasan’s health.

Hasan, 42, an Army psychiatrist, is charged with killing 13 and wounding 32 during the 2009 mass shooting at this sprawling Texas military base. If convicted, he could face a death sentence. He has been represented by military attorneys since he fired his civilian attorney two years ago, but last month asked to represent himself.

On Monday, he appeared in court wearing his uniform and a full beard, his head shaved. He remained calm throughout, taking notes and only objecting to the doctor’s report being submitted as evidence, saying “that is information between me and my physician,” but the judge overruled him.

Osborn had questioned whether Hasan was physically capable of representing himself — during the attack, he was shot by police and paralyzed from the chest down; he now uses a wheelchair and his attorneys have said he is unable to participate in the courtroom for more than five hours a day. Hasan’s previous medical exam was a year ago this month, and since then, nursing staff where he is housed at Bell County Jail have addressed his medical needs.

But the doctor who testified Monday, Maj. Prasad Lakshminarasimhiah, a rehabilitation physician based at San Antonio Military Medical Center, said Hasan has the stamina to concentrate for hours at a time, that he can sit upright for up to 12 hours a day with stretch breaks every four hours, can write with his right hand (his left hand suffered nerve damage) and do limited typing.

Lakshminarasimhiah said the only medicine Hasan takes is occasional over-the-counter painkillers and that he has suffered no recurring pain or other major complications. He said Hasan would suffer no cumulative complications from sitting for extended periods in court defending himself.

Osborn barred the doctor from discussing comments Hasan made during the exam last Thursday, saying she did not want to know why Hasan requested to defend himself, other than whether it was “a strategic decision.”

“Yes,” Hasan said. “There’s multiple factors.”

TIMELINE: Trial of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan

Three years ago, a three-person board of military medical professionals determined Hasan was competent to stand trial. The findings of the report have never been released, but Osborn referred to it Monday, saying it showed Hasan is competent to understand legal proceedings.

But she spent most of the hearing urging Hasan to retain his military counsel and not defend himself, which she said was “unwise” given his lack of legal experience -- he said he had never defended himself, even against a traffic ticket. She noted that lead military lawyer prosecuting him, Col. Michael Mulligan, has been practicing since 1987.

She questioned Hasan for about an hour.

“How are you, with no formal legal training or education, going to know what to do when the other side has that level of education?” Osborn said.

“I’m going to do the best I can do,” Hasan replied, his voice calm.

Osborn also questioned how Hasan would be able to write and type enough to defend himself. He said he had a lot of experience typing and could compensate for his injured hand.

“You would be better off with a trained lawyer who would know the rules of court-martial, the rules of evidence, the rules of law,” she said, offering Hasan the option of seeking other lawyers. He declined.

At one point, the judge asked Hasan to list the charges against him, and he faltered, conferring with his lead military attorney before responding.

“If you are convicted, you could be sentenced to what, what is the maximum punishment in this case?” Osborn said.

“Death,” Hasan murmured.

In granting Hasan’s request, Osborn stipulated that his three military attorneys remain to advise him as standby counsel, with two sitting at the defense table; a third, whom Hasan had asked not to remain as standby counsel, will be seated in the gallery.

Osborn noted that if Hasan violates the rules of the court, making statements instead of cross-examining witnesses or himself, “I will consider revoking your pro se status” -- reinstating his military attorneys.

Monday’s ruling will allow Hasan to question soldiers and civilians he allegedly shot and who have told the Los Angeles Times they dread facing him in court.

Additionally, the judge also noted that Hasan will not have access to classified information previously reviewed by his attorneys and the military prosecutors as part of discovery.

Court was due to reconvene to discuss logistics Monday afternoon. It was not immediately clear how Osborn’s decision will affect the trial schedule.

Osborn has worked to expedite the trial, which under a previous judge had stretched on with repeated delays and appeals, the latest due to Hasan’s refusal to shave his beard due to his religious beliefs as an American-born Muslim. Jury selection was scheduled to start Wednesday with testimony expected to begin in July, and officials had already added two walls of security barriers around the courthouse in preparation for the trial.

Fort Hood shooting suspect apologizes for taking part in what he calls U.S. war against Muslims.

Army Maj. Nidal Hasan says he regrets serving in the U.S. military.

Hasan%27s trial on 45 counts of premeditated and attempted premeditated murder is set to begin Aug. 6.

FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) — The Army psychiatrist charged in the 2009 Fort Hood mass shooting said in a statement to Fox News that the U.S. government is at war with Islam.

""My complicity was on behalf of a government that openly acknowledges that it would hate for the law of Almighty Allah to be the supreme law of the land,"" Maj. Nidal Hasan said in a lengthy statement released to Fox News (http://fxn.ws/1cafkA2) on Saturday. He then says in reference to a war on Islam, ""I participated in it.""

Hasan, 42, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the November 2009 attack at the Texas Army post. His trial is scheduled to start Aug. 6. He faces the death penalty if convicted.

The American-born Muslim is serving as his own attorney and hasn't spoken much in pre-trial hearings or jury selection. Fox News reported that Hasan didn't directly address the shooting in his statement, which it said is more than six pages long.

Hasan also said in the statement that he regrets serving in the Army.

""I would like to begin by repenting to Almighty Allah and apologize to the Mujahideen, the believers, and the innocent. ... I ask for their forgiveness for participating in the illegal and immoral aggression against Muslims, their religion and their lands,"" he told Fox News in the statement.

Hasan also has objected to the judge's denial of his ""defense of others"" strategy, which must show that killing was necessary to prevent the immediate harm or death of others. Col. Tara Osborn has barred him from telling jurors that he shot U.S. troops because they were an imminent threat to Taliban leaders in Afghanistan.

At a hearing earlier this month, Hasan, who is paralyzed from the abdomen down after being shot by police the day of the Fort Hood shooting, said he wanted jurors to know that he was being forced to wear a camouflage uniform that he believes represents ""an enemy of Islam."""

A single deputy fired at Andy Lopez, killing him on the sidewalk at the edge of an empty lot in Santa Rosa, Lt. Paul Henry of the Santa Rosa Police Department said during a news conference, according to the Press-Democrat.

“The deputy’s mind-set was that he was fearful that he was going to be shot,” Henry said.

Lopez, a Santa Rosa eighth-grader, was walking through a southwest Santa Rosa neighborhood carrying a pellet gun that resembled an AK-47 assault rifle when he was spotted about 3 p.m. Tuesday by two deputies on routine patrol, Henry said.

The teen had his back to the two deputies, said Henry, whose department is investigating the shooting.

They stopped, took cover behind the doors of their patrol car and ordered him to drop the weapon, Henry said.

Lopez was 20 to 30 feet away, he said, adding the deputies did not realize he was a boy.

The deputy, a law enforcement veteran, believed the AK-47-styled pellet gun “was an authentic weapon,” Henry said.

“He has quite a bit of experience with this kind of weapon. He’s aware of the kind of damage these kinds of weapons can do,” Henry said.

He also was aware such a weapon can fire ammunition that “can penetrate his body armor, can penetrate the metal of his vehicle, and also the sides of houses and buildings in the area,” Henry said, according to the newspaper.

Earlier Wednesday, Sonoma County Sheriff Steve Freitas said in a statement that the shooting was a “tragedy” and that he would do everything he could to ensure the investigation was thorough and transparent.

“As a father of two boys about this age, I can’t begin to imagine the grief this family is going through,” he said.

Deputies also found a plastic handgun in the boy’s waistband, said sheriff’s Lt. Dennis O’Leary. The deputies, who have not been identified, have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard after a shooting, he said.

“On the 13th of February 2013 Reeva would have gone out with her friends and I with my friends. Reeva then called me and asked that we rather spend the evening at home. I agreed. … By about 22h00 on 13 February 2013 we were in our bedroom. She was doing her yoga exercises and I was in bed watching television. My prosthetic legs were off. We were deeply in love and I could not be happier. I know she felt the same way. She had given me a present for Valentine’s Day but asked me only to open it the next day.

“After Reeva finished her yoga exercises she got into bed and we both fell asleep. I am acutely aware of violent crime being committed by intruders entering homes … I have received death threats before. I have also been a victim of violence and of burglaries before. For that reason I kept my firearm, a 9 mm Parabellum, underneath my bed when I went to bed at night.

“During the early morning hours of 14 February 2013, I woke up, went onto the balcony to bring the fan in and closed the sliding doors, the blinds and the curtains. I heard a noise in the bathroom and realized that someone was in the bathroom .… I felt a sense of terror rushing over me. …

“I believed that someone had entered my house. I was too scared to switch a light on.

The Undetectable Firearms Act, which was first enacted in 1988 and reauthorized in 2003, makes it illegal to “manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive” any firearm that’s undetectable by metal detectors and X-ray machines.

Three Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer of New York, Bill Nelson of Florida and Patrick Leahy of Vermont are pushing legislation that would extend the ban to all guns manufactured using so-called three-dimensional printing technology.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who objected along with other senators, blocked Schumer's request for unanimous consent for a one-year extension to the law before the Senate adjourned last week, according to The Hill.

“We will be glad to give it serious attention,” Sessions said Thursday, according to the report. “I know it is the kind of thing we probably can clear at some point, but I object.”

The National Rifle Association has not publicly stated where it stands on the proposed extension. Gun Owners of America, a smaller gun rights group, told The New York Times that the extension is unnecessary because 3-D printing technology is not widely available.

“They’re not going to be in Kinkos,” Larry Pratt, the group's executive director, told the newspaper. “And at the moment, they can’t fire that many rounds. It’s just not something that we’re going to be dealing with anytime soon.”

Schumer, however, has said the technology of 3-D printing has advanced to the point anyone with $1,000 and an Internet connection can access the plastic parts that can be fitted into a gun. Those firearms can't be detected by metal detectors or X-ray machines.

The senator says that means anyone can download a gun cheaply, then take the weapons anywhere, including high-security areas.

More than 100,000 copies of plans for the world's first 3D-printed handgun, The Liberator, were downloaded in May before the State Department told the Texas-based nonprofit behind the firearm to stop sharing the file.

The Philadelphia City Council voted unanimously last week to prohibit the use of 3-D printers to create any firearm or ""any piece thereof"" unless that person possesses a license to manufacture firearms, making Philly the first city in the U.S. to pass such a ban.

In May, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requested a plan of action from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on the new threat posed by guns made with 3-D printing technology. The senator said earlier this month he has yet to receive a response.

“We must not allow a 3-D printer cartridge to become as deadly as a gun cartridge,” Markey said. “These homemade 3-D printed-guns are no longer a figment of the imagination but are a real threat to the public. We need to immediately pass the Undetectable Firearms Act to ensure these stealth weapons don’t go undetected.""

Texas lawmakers approve gun-friendly bills

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas House approved a batch of bills Saturday to further soften gun laws that were already among the country's most firearms-friendly, allowing college students to carry handguns in class, putting potentially armed marshals in public schools and exempting the state from any future federal bans on assault rifles, high-capacity magazines or universal background checks.

Dubbed ""gun day"" by supporters and opponents alike, the parade of votes came as tens of thousands of members of the National Rifle Association attended the group's annual convention in Houston. Gov. Rick Perry welcomed convention attendees Friday with a video of him taking target practice using a semi-automatic rifle.

The 12 approved gun bills must all clear final, procedural votes before heading to the state Senate. Still, they advanced with only minimal delay, cruising past Democrat-led efforts to block or stall them. Nearly all were approved by simple voice votes.

A Democratic parliamentary point of order managed to shoot down just one, a bill by Rep. Van Taylor, R-Plano, that would have allowed the use of a concealed handgun license as valid proof of personal identification — even though obtaining such licenses requires a background check that's not necessary to get driver licenses and many other forms of ID.

The fiercest debate in the Republican-controlled chamber came over the plan to allow students over 21 who already hold concealed weapons permits to take their handguns into college classrooms. The issue became exceedingly volatile during the last legislative session in 2011, and ultimately failed.

Pro-Second Amendment lawmakers have revived it, however. Sponsor Rep. Allen Fletcher, R-Tomball, reminded lawmakers: ""College campuses are not crime-free zones.""

The measure would allow colleges and universities to opt out of the new rules annually — which has softened opposition to it among some top higher education leaders. Current law already allows universities to opt in, and the Texas A&M University System is among those that have done so.

Meanwhile, the Texas Senate has already approved a separate measure allowing college students to keep guns in their cars on campus. But the prospects for the campus carry bill passed by the House on Saturday appear far bleaker. Top Republicans have even suggested the issue will be a non-starter in the upper chamber.

The House also overwhelmingly approved a bill that attracted national attention when it was introduced by first-term, tea party Republican Rep. Steve Toth of The Woodlands. It would nullify within state borders any federal laws banning assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, or expansion of background checks for firearms owners, even though doing so would almost certainly violate the U.S. Constitution.

""There are 27 amendments in the Constitution but only one says 'shall not be infringed,'"" Toth said. ""The Second Amendment is the amendment that keeps the people free.""

Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston, raised a string of parliamentary objections to many of the gun bills, but they all failed. He asked Toth, ""Is your bill political posturing?""

""We just passed by voice vote a slew of pro-gun legislation,"" Walle said. ""So what is this? Why do we need it?""

Rep. Gene Wu, a Houston Democrat, went further on Twitter, saying, ""In case your head is too thick to understand: State law will not trump federal law.""

Conroe Republican Rep. Brandon Creighton, and several co-authors, sponsored a bill to punish by up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine police officers or government officials who try to enforce federal firearms limits in Texas.

Also passing was the school marshal measure, sponsored by Dallas Republican Rep. Jason Villalba. The marshals would be employees who already hold concealed weapons permits and are chosen by their public school district or charter schools to receive firearms training. They would keep guns locked away on campus, but have access to them in an emergency — though their identities would not be divulged to the public.

Causing fewer fireworks when it passed was a measure reducing penalties for permit holders who accidentally show a concealed handgun.

Three other successful bills reduced the number of hours of training needed to obtain a concealed handgun license and tweaked the rules for renewing or being fingerprinted for one. A separate measure that passed 136-0 reduced the concealed handgun license fee for police officers, military veterans, national and state Guard members and even some Criminal Justice Department employees, despite costing the state up to $2 million in lost revenues.

Another measure that was approved was one by Democratic Rep. Ryan Guillen of Rio Grande City that's meant to prohibit agencies from posting ""no carry"" signs in cases where carrying a gun isn't illegal and imposing fines for violators. A bill by fellow Democrat Sergio Munoz of Palmview to expand school districts' ability to alert hunters of the location of campuses also passed."

John McCain (R-Sunday Shows) expressed bewilderment on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that GOP Sens. Cruz, Lee and Paul would filibuster gun control legislation. “I don’t understand it,” McCain said. “The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand.” With all due respect to Sen. McCain, that is almost completely backward.

The purpose of the US Senate is not to be some federal debating society. It is not tasked with taking the great issues of the day and giving its “august” members a platform for their musings on policy. The public does not look to the Senate for guidance in its deliberations on the issues.

The Senate’s first, and only, task is to uphold the Constitution. Originally, the Senate was designed to act as the states’ check on an encroaching federal government. Senators were appointed by state legislatures to be their voice in Washington. The House was designed to be the voice of the people. Sadly, those days are long gone.

Today, Senators are just House members juiced-up on steroids. Worse, they have a habit of putting decorum and the traditions and processes of the institution above foundational principles.

“I don’t understand why United States senators want to block debate when the leaders said we could have amendments,” McCain noted.

If one believes a legislative proposal is, on its face, unconstitutional, the ability to offer amendments is of little solace. Sens. Cruz, Lee and Paul, among other Senators, believe legislation to limit gun rights is, by its nature, unconstitutional. Amending the legislation to make it slightly less unconstitutional is a fool’s game, and a large reason our federal government has grown so large.

A filibuster against gun control legislation is upholding the greatest tradition of the Senate, i.e. acting as a bulwark against the federal government’s natural inclination to expand its power. Knowing how specific Senators voted on shredding the Constitution won’t put it back together again. Any proposal that tramples on constitutional rights should never grace the floor of the Senate.

Sen. McCain, once the GOP candidate for President, is becoming marginalized within the GOP Senate caucus. New, more conservative, Senators are stepping up to defend Constitutional principles and becoming a vocal, loyal opposition to the Administration and its curtailing of our liberties. They should be applauded.

Alexis had been hearing voices in his head and had been treated since August by the Veterans Administration for his mental problems, the officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the criminal investigation in the case was continuing.

Alexis, 34, was discharged from the Navy two years ago after serving hitches in Texas and Illinois.

He was reportedly armed with a shotgun and two handguns. Alexis sprayed bullets from the fourth floor down to the cafeteria area in the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters in southeast Washington.

The attack began just after 8 a.m. Alexis died later as he traded shots with responding police, although it was unclear if he killed himself or was brought down by cops.

More On This... Shooting spree at Washington Navy Yard leaves 12 dead

He most likely gained entry into the facility with a CAC card, or a common access card. The system does not require workers to pass through a metal detector and usually only requires employees to show the card. Senior military officials tell Fox News that he most likely shot his way into building 197, because that building requires a separate pass he did not have.

Washington Mayor Vincent Gray said there was still no motive for the shootings and no indication of terrorism ""although we haven't ruled that out.""

While some neighbors and acquaintances described him as ""nice,"" his father once told detectives in Seattle that his son had anger management problems related to post-traumatic stress brought on by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He also complained about the Navy and being a victim of discrimination.

The former Navy reservist had a string of misconduct problems during his nearly three years in the military, but he received an honorable discharge.

The officials say Alexis had bouts of insubordination, disorderly conduct and was sometimes absent from work without authorization. The offenses occurred mainly when he was serving in Fort Worth, Texas, from 2008-2011, and were enough to prompt Navy officials to grant him an early discharge through a special program for enlisted personnel.

Officials said the bad conduct was enough to make it clear Alexis would not be a good sailor, but not enough to warrant a general or less-than-honorable discharge.

Late Monday, police searched a Residence Inn hotel in Southwest Washington, where Alexis had been staying for at least two days prior to the shooting. WRC reported that he had been staying with a group of five other civilian contractors, four of whom had been interviewed by police. The station also reported that Alexis' rental car had been found near the scene of the shooting and authorities were working on obtaining a search warrant for the vehicle.

In New York, the FBI interviewed Alexis's mother at her home in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.

In Fort Worth, Texas, where Alexis lived for part of his Navy stint, those who knew, or claimed to know the gunman put forth their own theories. One told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that Alexis was upset with the government because of a dispute over benefits. Another acquaintance told The Associated Press that Alexis would complain about being a victim of discrimination.

That acquaintance, Oui Suthametewakul, said Alexis lived with him and his wife from August 2012 to May 2013 in Fort Worth, but that they had to part ways because he wasn't paying his bills.

Others expressed wonder that Alexis would be linked with such a crime at all.

""Oh boy, I can’t believe this,"" Somsak Srisan, Alexis' former landlord, told the newspaper. ""He was always very polite to me.""

After leaving the naval reserves, Alexis worked as a waiter and delivery driver at the Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White Settlement, a suburb of Fort Worth. A convert to Buddhism who had visited Thailand in the past, Alexis was able to converse with Thai customers in their native language and made several friends in the local Thai community.

Hewlett-Packard issued a statement Monday saying that at the time of the shootings, Alexis worked for The Experts, a subcontractor on an HP Enterprise Services contract to refresh equipment used on the Navy Marine Corps Intranet network. The FBI said he had legitimate access to the Navy Yard ""as a result of his work as a contractor.""

Gray said those killed ranged in age from 46 to 73. Eight others were injured — three by gunshots and the other five by non-shooting causes like stress and falls.

D.C. police identified all 12 victims: Arthur Daniels, 51; Mary Francis Knight, 51; Gerald L. Read, 54; Martin Bodrog, 54; Richard Michael Ridgell, 52; Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61.

Throughout the morning and early afternoon, helicopters circled above the sprawling complex. People still trapped inside the building, where some 3,000 work every day, were told to ""shelter in place,"" as helicopters dropped baskets to pick up the wounded.

Alexis, of New York, was a Navy aviation electrician's mate, third class, who spent time in Texas and Illinois before leaving the Navy in early 2011. It was unclear why he left or if he was voluntarily discharged. He had a ""history of misconduct,"" a senior defense official told Fox News.

While stationed in Fort Worth, he was arrested on Sept. 4, 2010, after an upstairs neighbor reported that he had fired shots up into her apartment.The neighbor said Alexis had often angrily confronted her about making too much noise, and she told police he scared her.

""[The neighbor] told me that she is terrified of Aaron and feels that this was done intentionally,"" the arresting officer wrote on the police report.

In 2004, Alexis was arrested in Seattle for shooting out the tires of a construction worker's car in an incident he later described as ""an anger-fueled blackout.""

He also told Seattle police he had witnessed the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and ""how these events had disturbed him,"" according to a police report.

Alexis' father told police in 2004 his son had participated in rescue efforts during 9/11 and had suffered post traumatic stress disorder, which could not be independently confirmed.

Republican support to proceed doesn’t guarantee final passage of the bill — just that the Senate can actually begin formal debate. Getting at least 51 senators to support a final bill will prove difficult, as the politics of the issue are especially tricky for several Senate Democrats seeking reelection in 2014 in rural and Midwestern states.

If the vote to proceed is successful, the Senate is expected to spend the remainder of April debating and voting on a bill that would expand the gun background-check system, make gun trafficking a federal crime for the first time and provide $40 million in federal funding to help revamp school security programs. Senators of both parties would be permitted to introduce related amendments, including plans to establish an online portal for background checks, and to provide more federal funding for mental health programs assisting military veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reid has also promised votes on proposals to ban military-style assault weapons and to limit the size of ammunition clips, but supporters expect those amendments to fail.

Meanwhile, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who is seeking a bipartisan compromise on provisions related to background checks, emerged from Reid's office Tuesday evening without word of a final agreement but still hopeful that a deal was in sight.

“We’re getting there, we really are getting there. Everyone’s working,” he said.

“We’re not there yet, we’re closer than we’ve ever been,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who’s been working with Manchin on changing parts of the bill regarding background checks.

Thus far, at least eight GOP senators — John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Mark Kirk (Ill.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and Susan Collins (Maine) — have said they will not join in a filibuster being planned by a handful of the party's more conservative senators.

Collins is most directly tied to the bill, as she is co-sponsoring the gun trafficking and school safety provisions.

“I am not going to join in a filibuster against bringing the bill to the floor as long as there is ample opportunity for amendments,” Collins told reporters. “It’s my understanding that amendments will be allowed to the bill, which is very important since there are portions of the bill that I do not support.”

Other moderate senators, however, said they are awaiting the results of ongoing bipartisan talks.

“I have to see first what amendments are going to be allowed, but filibuster just for the sake of trying to block it from a floor vote, I’m not there,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is also actively engaged in bipartisan talks over the nation’s immigration laws.

In a sign of how important Republican support would be for ensuring final passage of any legislation, at least two Democrats facing difficult reelection fights in 2014 — Max Baucus (Mont.) and Mark Pryor (Ark.) — said they might break with their party in opposition to the bill.

“My primary focus is the state of Montana, they’re my employers, I’m just the employee, I’m the hired hand here,” Baucus said Tuesday. “I care much more about Montana. I’m just going to wait and see what’s proposed.”

Pryor said he has advised Reid that he might join the GOP filibuster, “depending on how this plays out.”

The filibuster is being led by the new conservative wing of the GOP, including Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), whom McCain and Graham have clashed with in recent weeks. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and 10 other senators have signed on, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose involvement has lent the opposition more credibility.

In a statement Tuesday, Lee said that the filibuster threat ""is an attempt to facilitate greater debate about the specific piece of legislation that will come to the Senate floor. By objecting to the motion to proceed, we guarantee that the Senate and the American people have at least three additional days to assess and evaluate exactly how this particular bill will affect the rights of law-abiding citizens and whether it will have any significant impact on crime.""

Negotiations continue as the two sides try to come up with a compromise that would tip the scales enough to avoid a filibuster. Key players in that process include Manchin, Coburn and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Manchin will talk about that process at 5 p.m.

Democrats have 55 senators in their caucus, but Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) has been dealing with health issues and has been absent from the Senate. Sixty votes are needed to override a filibuster and bring the bill to a vote.

-- President Obama at a Connecticut campaign event calling for firearms restrictions.

President Obama said that it would be “a tough day” in his presidency if Congress failed to pass legislation in response to the December massacre at a Connecticut grade school.

It looks like the president has a tough day or two ahead.

The provision Obama is pushing hardest now is an expansion of background checks for gun purchases. That would not have affected the Newtown killer, since he did not purchase the weapons used in the killings, but rather took them from his mother, whom he also killed.

The only gun-control provision on offer that advocates say might have lessened the death toll – a ban on the sale of new high-capacity magazines – has been declared not viable in the Democratic Senate due to a lack of support within the president’s party. And even that measure would only have reduced the death toll in Newtown if it had been in place when the killer’s mother purchased the weapons long ago.

The left’s most sought and now most lamented measure – a ban on civilian firearms mocked up to look like military models – was also nixed by a lack of Democratic support. And even that would have been of little use in Newtown, again providing that it was in place when the killer’s mother purchased the weapons.

One measure in the remaining pool of viability that might prevent future school shootings – an increase in federal grants for school safety – could pass easily with bipartisan support. But tossing some money at the problem doesn’t exactly sound like a response to Obama’s call that “as a society… we must change.”

Having failed to develop a legislative package that addressed the causes of the slaughter in Connecticut, Obama and his allies fell back to old Democratic standbys on gun control from the 1990s. And those measures don’t have as much to do with mass shootings or school shootings as they do with street crime and gun registration.

So often the case in his presidency, he and those he tasked with producing legislation, in this case, Vice President Joe Biden, could neither innovate nor develop consensus, even within Obama’s party. Whether a stimulus spending package, a new health-insurance entitlement, bank regulations, global warming fees or, now, school-shooting curbs, Obama most often seems to be a captive of Congress.

Obama is now left with making the first hard sell of his second term by calling for background check legislation in response to a school shooting, despite the fact that the legislation would have done nothing to prevent the shooting in question. And all because he rushed and then bungled the development of the package. The Obama mantra of “we can’t wait” has again proved a poor approach to big legislation.

The disconnect between the shooting and the legislation has made it easier for Republicans to harass the president on the subject.

[pullquote]

As Obama’s firearms push clatters to an unhappy end, the remaining fight is over record keeping under the proposed expansion of background checks. The Obama-backed measure would create for the first time a federal registry of firearms sales. An alternative bipartisan measure, still struggling to get aloft, would expand background checks to all weapons sales involving a commercial intermediary (a Web site, the hosts of a gun show) but exempt transactions between individuals and, more importantly, not allow the feds to build a gun registry.

Democratic outrage over Republican threats to filibuster the provision including the registry might have more sting if anyone could argue that the measure would have prevented the Newtown killings.

While there is broad public support for expanding background checks, there is also considerable public concern that federal authorities might use such information to one day confiscate legally purchased weapons.

Expanded provisions for the inclusion of mental health concerns into background checks might have made a difference in Tucson, Aurora or Blacksburg. Those have been discussed, but have largely been dropped due to medical privacy laws and a cultural bias against involuntary psychiatric commitments.

But because Obama could not find a way to get his party to think anew and act anew on guns and because he focused on reviving old, largely unrelated, issues, the president went from the politically advantageous position of pushing for legislation in response to a specific tragedy to the politically disadvantaged, ancient bog of gun control.

And Now, A Word From Charles



“Well, I think every country at every time could use somebody as principled and smart and strong as [Margaret Thatcher]. I think what we don't quite remember in the gauzy recollections today is how despised she was, how widely despised at home and to some extent here among the left. I mean, she angered everybody in her country from the communist union leaders to the upper class twits in her own party, which isn't easy to do.”

The debate took place at Virginia Tech, and McAuliffe referenced the 2007 shooting on that campus as justification for more gun control.

Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli correctly stated more gun control would not have prohibited that shooting and that shooters like the killer in that instance, Seung-Hui Cho, are “almost impossible” to find before they decide to start shooting. McAuliffe replied, “Some people should not own guns.” He then defended his gun control proposals, saying: “I don’t care what grade I got from the NRA. I never want to see another Newtown or Aurora or Virginia Tech again.”

Cuccinelli’s argument is in line with experts on the subjects of firearms and the mentally ill. Mayo Clinic psychiatrist J. Michael Bostwick, M.D., recently wrote that more gun control aimed at the mentally will not end mass shootings. According to Bostwick, not even confiscating guns from the mentally ill will do that.

He says this is because the great percentage of the mentally ill are not dangerous, while individuals who commit mass shootings and are mentally ill are usually only discovered to suffer from mental illness after the fact.

On top of this, an internal investigation by a Virginia Tech Review Panel reported that more gun control would not have stopped the Virginia Tech shooting. Looking particularly at bans on “high capacity” magazines–bans which McAuliffe supports–the review panel said having 10 round magazines instead of 15 round magazines “would have not made that much difference in the incident.”

(AP) Colo. lawmakers lose recalls over gun laws support

By COLLEEN SLEVIN

Associated Press

DENVER

Two Colorado state lawmakers who backed gun-control measures in the aftermath of the mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut last year have been ousted in recall elections.



Pueblo voters in Democratic Sen. Angela Giron’s district approved her recall, with results coming in late Tuesday. Returns earlier showed Democratic Senate President John Morse also lost his seat in Colorado Springs.



In Giron’s race, voters chose Republican George Rivera, a former Pueblo police officer, to replace her.



The firearms legislation package Giron supported this year included size limits for ammunition magazines and expanded background checks for private and online gun purchases.



Her working-class district favors her party but includes Democrats who are big supporters of the Second Amendment.

UPDATE 12:26 AM EST — Senator Angela Giron is now down 60 to 40 with over half the votes counted and FOX31 Denver predicts she will follow Morse out the door. Giron says she is not conceding yet and will wait for more votes to be counted before speaking.



UPDATE 11:37 EST — Morse has conceded. Morse said, “It has been an honor to represent the 11th Senate District. It’s been hugely rewarding.” He is the first Colorado legislator ever successfully recalled. He vowed that Democrats will continue the fight for gun control.

UPDATE 11 pm EST — With 75% of the vote in, Morse is now down 52 to 47.

Kurt Bardella, a communications consultant for the Colorado recall effort, told Breitbart News: “If the early voting trends hold steady, history will be made in Colorado tonight that will reverberate throughout the country. After tonight, no one should underestimate the political potency of the gun-control debate. Democrats have targeted Colorado in recent cycles and have had some real success turning the state from red-to-purple. The fact that the sitting State Senate President is on the cusp of being the first-ever recalled state official in Colorado’s history should give anyone who is considering moving forward with additional gun control legislation real pause.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/california-governor-vetoes-several-tough-gun-control-bills-202721952.html,,[],California governor vetoes tough gun control bills,"By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO, California (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed several gun control bills on Friday, a move that essentially rebuffs an effort by fellow Democrats to enact a sweeping expansion of firearms regulation in the most populous U.S. state. Brown vetoed the strictest bill, which would have classified any rifle with a removable magazine as an assault weapon, calling it an ""infringement on gun owners' rights."" ""I don't believe that this bill's blanket ban on semi-automatic rifles would reduce criminal activity or enhance public safety enough to warrant this infringement on gun owners' rights,"" Brown said in his veto message. He also vetoed a measure that would have banned people from owning a gun for 10 years if they had been convicted of substance abuse violations or ordered to undergo outpatient mental health treatment. Brown did approve a measure to ban kits used to convert standard guns into semi-automatics with large capacity magazines, which he described as closing a loophole in existing state law. California's actions come amid national political lobbying around gun control, as lawmakers struggle to balance calls for more regulation following mass shootings against fear among gun rights supporters that their constitutional right to bear arms may be violated. State lawmakers sent 17 gun control measures to Brown's desk, in part because the U.S. Congress, mired in partisan bickering, failed to act after several high profile gun rampages last year, including a deadly Connecticut school shooting that killed 20 children and six adults in December. ""Large-capacity magazines have no place on our streets,"" said Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner, who represents Berkeley. ""We seized the opportunity to make California a model for common-sense gun violence prevention."" Chuck Michel, a Southern California attorney who advises the National Rifle Association on gun rights issues, said that with the exception of a bill phasing out the use of lead in ammunition used in hunting, Brown vetoed the measures that were of greatest concern to the NRA. ""I am pleased he's shown some respect for the rights of California gun owners and those who would choose to own a gun to defend their families,"" Michel said. Even so, the gun rights organization is concerned about several measures that Brown did sign, including the one banning conversion kits. ""He vetoed the worst of the worst,"" Michel said, ""But the rest are still bad."" In all, Brown signed 10 new gun control bills and vetoed seven. Those he signed included a measure to ban people from gun ownership for five years if they tell a licensed psychotherapist that they plan to shoot people. Another, by Republican Ted Gaines, would give mental health professionals 24 hours to report such threats. In addition to the semi-automatic weapons ban, bills vetoed included a measure that would have limited the ability of private parties to sell guns in the state, and one that would have allowed the city of Oakland to enact its own gun restrictions.

Vice president says he's considering several recommendations from stakeholders

Universal background checks and limiting high-capacity magazines considered

Biden says he wants to also meet with gun manufacturers

WASHINGTON — The National Rifle Association took aim Thursday at the White House task force on gun violence led by Vice President Biden, suggesting that the Obama administration is focused on imposing unnecessary restrictions on lawful gun owners in the aftermath of last month's shooting tragedy in Connecticut.

The powerful gun rights organization's sharp rebuke followed a meeting with Biden and gun-owners groups to discuss the White House's response to recent mass shootings. The vice president and other top administration officials have been meeting with various stakeholders in the gun debate in an effort to generate a broad proposal on steps to curb gun violence.

""We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment,"" the NRA said in a statement following the 95-minute meeting on White House grounds. ""While claiming that no policy proposals would be 'prejudged,' this task force spent most of its time on proposed restrictions on lawful firearms owners — honest, taxpaying, hardworking Americans.""

Biden, who was tapped to lead the task force after the Dec. 14 mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school, said he plans to deliver his recommendations to President Obama by Tuesday, and suggested Thursday that his proposal may include instituting universal background checks and limiting the size of high-capacity magazines.

Biden said that his proposal might also bolster the ability of the federal government to research gun violence, suggesting he may look for a way to relax rules that prohibit the release of information from the ATF firearms-trace database to anyone other than a law enforcement agency or prosecutor in connection with a criminal investigation

""There is a surprising, so far, recurrence of suggestions that we have universal background checks,"" Biden said. He added, ""Among ... my former colleagues in the Senate, who have been pretty universally opposed to any restrictions on gun ownership or what type of weapons can be purchased, etc., I have never quite heard as much talk about the need to do something about high-capacity magazines as I have heard spontaneously from every group I have met with so far.""

The vice president, notably, did not mention re-instituting the assault-weapons ban which expired in 2004, a move backed by several Democratic lawmakers and Obama. A USA TODAY/Gallup Poll published last month following the Connecticut shooting found 51% of respondents oppose an assault weapons ban, while 44% support reinstating the ban.

Biden, along with Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, were also meeting with entertainment industry executives Thursday, and a separately with some of the nation's top gun sellers, including the megaretailer Wal-Mart, to discuss the issue.

Biden has said that he may recommend Obama use presidential ""executive order"" power as part of the effort to stem gun violence. Gun-control advocates said that the president could take several steps without congressional action, including bolstering the national instant criminal-background-check system and stepping up prosecutions of felons and others prohibited from buying weapons when they try to purchase them.

Biden is also hoping to solicit the input of gun manufacturers before making his recommendations.

""There has got to be some common ground, to not solve every problem but diminish the probability"" of mass shootings, he said. ""That's what this is all about. There are no conclusions I have reached.""

The NRA had set low expectations for the meeting, but the sharpness of its rebuke was notable.

""We will now take our commitment and meaningful contributions to members of Congress of both parties who are interested in having an honest conversation about what works — and what does not,"" the group said.

The NRA instead is pushing for the federal government to implement a program to put armed guards in every school in the country.

The Advancement Project, a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights group, has long complained that cops in schools actually make safety worse for many kids, making it more likely that they'll end up in trouble with the law.

Upstate voters have biggest changes in attitude

In December%2C 57%25 of voters outside the NYC area had favorable opinion of him

In April%2C that number was down to 42%25 of Upstate voters

ALBANY, N.Y. — Support for the re-election of New York's governor has eroded in the past four months, a Siena College poll found.

The poll released Monday found that 52% of voters outside the New York City metro area ""prefer someone else"" to the Democratic governor in 2014 when he will seek re-election; 42% selected him. Cuomo has faced backlash over a gun-control law enacted in January, mainly from upstate voters.

The drop is precipitous. Cuomo's re-election support in December among upstate voters was 57% in favor vs. 34% unfavorable. It was 47% for ""someone else"" to 45% for Cuomo last month, said Steven Greenberg, a Siena College pollster.

Greenberg said the results are indicative of Cuomo's falling popularity although the numbers have been most striking upstate.

""Four small drops in a row suddenly becomes a significant drop. And that's what we've seen with the governor on his favorable-unfavorable, his job performance and his re-elect,"" Greenberg said. ""All three of those measures have come down month by month by month.""

Cuomo had a 62% to 33% favorability rating statewide, the poll found, down from 72% to 21% in December. The poll was conducted April 14 to 18 among 811 voters registered in New York state. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.

His numbers are strongest in New York City, dominated by Democratic voters. Voters in the city said they would support Cuomo's re-election 65% to 29%, compared with 53% to 40% in the downstate suburbs.

Gun-rights groups have had three protests at the Capitol in opposition to the law, and some police organizations have questioned it.

""I think there's no question that the gun issue eroded considerable support that the governor previously enjoyed among Republicans and among upstate voters,"" Greenberg said.

No Republican candidates have come forward to challenge Cuomo, who was elected in 2010.

Cuomo would be a formidable foe: He had more than $22 million in his campaign coffers as of January, and New York has twice as many enrolled Democrats as Republicans.

Cuomo has praised lawmakers for supporting the gun-control law enacted Jan. 15. He has criticized Congress for failing to reach a deal on federal gun-control legislation."

He Has Covered The White House', 'Congress']",Gun rights group endorses Manchin-Toomey background-check bill,"In anticipation of Senate votes this week on a proposed expansion of criminal background checks for firearms sales, one gun rights organization broke with the powerful National Rifle Association on Sunday to urge support for a compromise drafted by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.).

The endorsement by the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms — which calls itself the second-largest gun rights organization in the country, behind the NRA, claiming 650,000 members and supporters — is one of several moves over the past few days that have provided a boost to the hopes of proponents of background checks.

While leading gun-control advocates — including President Obama and New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) — back the bipartisan proposal, the announcement of support Sunday from the Citizens Committee reveals that substantial parts of the bill are viewed as “wins” for the gun lobby, including provisions that would prohibit a government registry of gun ownership and make it easier to transport and market weapons across state lines.

Though news of a split in the usually unified gun lobby cheered gun-control advocates, the gun lobby can count other probable wins in the current debate, such as the likely defeat of legislation to limit military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. Now, an expansion of background-check requirements for gun sales is considered the most likely major achievement.

Initially, gun-control advocates hoped for a requirement for background checks of individuals purchasing a gun under most any circumstance. Currently, background checks are conducted only for purchases made from licensed gun dealers. The compromise measure, drafted by Toomey and Manchin, would require background checks for currently exempt online and gun-show sales but not for most other private transactions.

There were other signs of momentum on gun-control legislation over the weekend, including a tentative expression of support for the Toomey-Manchin compromise on Sunday from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), an endorsement by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), and indications of backing from several House Republicans, including some who have had previous endorsements from the NRA.

Officially, only three Republican senators — Toomey, Collins and Mark Kirk (Ill.) — have said they plan to vote for the Manchin-Toomey agreement. Democratic aides say the bill will need the backing of at least six Republican senators to pass. The measure still has a long and tortuous path, with dozens of amendments expected. The Senate is scheduled to begin formal debate Tuesday by first considering the plan to expand the gun background-check program.

Sixteen GOP senators voted late last week to proceed to debate, but several of them and some moderate Democratic senators said they are unlikely to support the bill’s proposed compromise amendments. It is not known how many amendments will be considered by the Senate over the next two weeks.

A decade ago, the NRA backed expanded background-check legislation, but it now stands firmly opposed. An NRA spokesman re­iterated the group’s opposition Sunday evening and again promised to score the Senate vote on the compromise in making future election endorsement decisions.

The group that backed the bill, the Citizens Committee, has far fewer members than the 4 million claimed by the NRA. It was founded in 1972 and functions as a kind of sister organization to the Second Amendment Foundation, a legal think tank and law firm based in Bellevue, Wash., that, along with the NRA, has been a leader in filing major court challenges to halt restrictions on gun rights.

“We decided to back it because we believe it is the right thing to do,” said Julianne Versnel, director of operations for the group.

The chairman of the Citizens Committee, Alan Gottlieb, told supporters in an e-mail Sunday that the group would embrace the Manchin-Toomey compromise. He urged members to read the senators’ proposal to understand why the gun rights group would back it.

Gottlieb made clear in his e-mail that he enthusiastically backs the bill the NRA opposes.

“If you read the Manchin-Toomey substitute amendment, you can see all the advances for our cause that it contains,” Gottlieb wrote. He then listed the gun rights advantages in the bill: “interstate sales of handguns, veteran gun rights restoration, travel with firearms protection, civil and criminal immunity lawsuit protection, and most important of all, the guarantee that people, including federal officers, will go to federal prison for up to 15 years if they attempt to use any gun sales records to set up a gun registry.”

These “advances” cannot be achieved, Gottlieb wrote, “unless we win the Senate vote on Tuesday to substitute Senators Manchin and Toomey’s balanced approach” to background checks. Gottlieb, like other gun group leaders, opposes a more far-reaching background-check bill proposed by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).

The organization has already been in touch with individual Senate offices. Some have already rejected its argument.

Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who voted to proceed with debate, labeled the Manchin-Toomey agreement “unworkable and unfair to gun owners” in a message sent to constituents late last week. Because the plan would require gun purchasers to pay for a background check, “visitors to . . . gun shows across America will face a new tax of $30 to $50, and sometimes more, as they exercise their constitutional right to buy a gun,” Coburn said, adding that gun owners “will ignore and reject these changes.”

Other Republican senators who voted for debating the gun bill but plan to vote no on the amendment are Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), John Hoeven (N.D.) and Johnny Isakson (Ga.), their spokesmen said Sunday.

Among Democratic senators, moderates Mark Begich (Alaska) and Mark Pryor (Ark.), who face difficult reelection fights in 2014, voted against proceeding with debate and are expected to oppose the overall gun bill. Max Baucus (Mont.), Kay Hagan (N.C.) and Mary Landrieu (La.), who are also facing difficult reelection prospects, voted for debate but have signaled they may vote against the Manchin-Toomey deal.

A Baucus spokesman said Sunday that the senator is reviewing the Manchin-Toomey proposal “and listening to feedback from Montanans to make sure they have a chance to weigh in.” A Landrieu spokeswoman noted that the senator voted to proceed to debate on the gun bill but hasn’t made up her mind on other amendments. Aides to Hagan did not respond Sunday.

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) hopes to hold an up-or-down vote on the Manchin-Toomey plan by midweek and then proceed to vote on other amendments, according to senior Senate aides familiar with the plans.

Reid also is expected to call for a roll call on Democratic-backed amendments including the plan to ban military-style assault weapons, the aides said. A vote on the proposed ban, which is sponsored by 22 Senate Democrats, is expected to fall far short of the 60 votes needed to ensure final passage. Regardless, aides said Reid wants to hold a vote on the proposal early in the gun debate to fulfill his promise to Obama; the plan’s lead sponsor, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.); and gun-control groups that supported the ban.

Reid also hopes to hold a vote on a Democratic plan to limit the size of ammunition magazines, another proposal expected to fail, aides said. From there, he could proceed to a host of proposed amendments, including a bipartisan plan to provide more federal funding for mental health programs that assist military veterans, a Coburn proposal to establish an online portal for gun buyers to conduct their own background checks, a Republican plan to change the legal definition of mentally ill people when it comes to gun crimes, and an overarching GOP alternative to the underlying gun bill.

Gun-control advocates are worried about some of the expected amendments authored or backed by the NRA, including one that would provide a “national reciprocity” arrangement in which a gun owner who receives a permit to carry a concealed weapon in any one state would then be allowed to do that anywhere in the country.

Reps. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) plan to introduce on Monday a House version of the Manchin-Toomey agreement that mirrors the bipartisan Senate deal. King, who represents a suburban Long Island district, said he hoped the Senate deal would extend background checks to include most private firearms transactions but that “there’s no sense of making the perfect the enemy of the good these days.”

“Rather than reinventing the wheel, we adopted Manchin’s plan because we thought that any bill that passes the Senate could pass the House,” King said in an interview Sunday.

Expanding the background-check program “is absolutely essential” to curbing gun-related violence in New York, King said, noting that most gun crimes in his state are committed with firearms illegally obtained in other states.

Only King and Thompson are sponsoring the bill, but other House Republicans who represent suburban districts in the Northeast and Midwest are expected to sign on if it advances in the Senate, King said. Separately, Republican House members from Pennsylvania with past NRA endorsements indicated support for the Toomey-Manchin approach, including Reps. Michael G. Fitzpatrick, Patrick Meehan and Charlie Dent.

In a sign of the wait-and-see attitude in the House, King said he has had no formal discussions with House GOP leadership or the House Judiciary Committee about his bill or when gun legislation will begin to move in the chamber.

Late Sunday, a second gun rights group, the Independent Firearm Owners Association, joined the Citizens Committee in endorsing the Manchin-Toomey proposal. The group is led by a former NRA regional political director, Richard Feldman, but has far fewer members than either of the more established gun rights groups.

Toomey said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he expects a close vote this week on the measure. “I think it’s an open question as to whether or not we have the votes,” Toomey said. “I think it’s going to be close.”

Disappointed with New York State lawmakers and other jurisdictions around the country who have passed strict gun control legislation, the companies–composed of firearm manufacturers, gunsmiths, and sporting goods retailers–have announced these policies in the past week.

Their various statements emphasize that such laws create a class of government employees with rights and and a class of citizens without rights. Thus, they refuse to aid the enforcement of such inequality.

The announcements read:

Effective today, in an effort to see that no legal mistakes are made by LaRue Tactical and/or its employees, we will apply all current State and Local Laws (as applied to civilians) to state and local law enforcement / government agencies. In other words, LaRue Tactical will limit all sales to what law-abiding citizens residing in their districts can purchase or possess.

Due the passing of this legislation, Olympic Arms would like to announce that the State of New York, any Law Enforcement Departments, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee of such an entity – will no longer be served as customers. In short, Olympic Arms will no longer be doing business with the State of New York or any governmental entity or employee of such governmental entity within the State of New York – henceforth and until such legislation is repealed, and an apology made to the good people of the State of New York and the American people.

The Federal Government and several states have enacted gun control laws that restrict the public from owning and possessing certain types of firearms. Law-enforcement agencies are typically exempt from these restrictions. EFI, LLC does not recognize law-enforcement exemptions to local, state, and federal gun control laws. If a product that we manufacture is not legal for a private citizen to own in a jurisdiction, we will not sell that product to a law-enforcement agency in that jurisdiction.

We will not sell arms to agents of the state of New York that hold themselves to be “more equal” than their citizens. As long as the legislators of New York think they have the power to limit the rights of their citizens, in defiance of the Constitution, we at Templar will not sell them firearms to enforce their edicts. Templar Custom is announcing that the State of New York, any Law Enforcement Departments, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee will no longer be served as customers.

Based on the recent legislation in New York, we are prohibited from selling rifles and receivers to residents of New York. We have chosen to extend that prohibition to all governmental agencies associated with or located within New York. As a result we have halted sales of rifles, short barreled rifles, short barreled shotguns, machine guns, and silencers to New York governmental agencies.

Recently, companies such as LaRue Tactical and Olympic Arms have announced that they will no longer sell prohibited items to government agencies and personnel in states that deny the right to own those items to civilians. It has been and will continue to be Cheaper Than Dirt’s policy to not to sell prohibited items to government agencies and/or agents in states, counties, cities, and municipalities that have enacted restrictive gun control laws against their citizens. We support and encourage other companies that share in this policy.

Second Amendment activist groups Guns Save Life and Grass Roots North Carolina are currently urging big gun manufacturers Sig Sauer, Smith and Wesson, and Glock to halt their sales to government agencies within states that have clamped down on their residents’ right to bear arms."

The legislation was approved overwhelmingly on a voice vote, meaning House members on both sides of a politically fraught gun-safety issue avoided having their individual votes officially recorded.

The focus now shifts to the Senate, where Democrats will introduce a stricter measure of their own next week, along with the extension the House passed.

But they are expected to act on Monday, the day the law expires. That leaves little time for senators to debate the more controversial aspects of the legislation, which would impose new restrictions on 3-D printed weapons."

Both the Joyce Foundation and Google are established players in the anti-second amendment movement as well as other progressive political causes.

The Joyce Foundation has injected large chucks of money into the anti-gun movement, including Mayor’s Against Gun Control and the Violence Prevention Center. (Aside: Who was on the Board of the Joyce Foundation? None other than President Barack Obama who keeps assuring us that he doesn’t want to take our guns away. Obama sat on the board of the Joyce Foundation from 1994-2002.)

Likewise, Google’s support for anti-gun “advocacy” is no secret.

Specifically, they’ve banned results related to firearms and other products that they don’t deem to be “family safe.” Until recently, gun-related products appeared with other products in search results on the shopping section. Many of America’s 80 million gun owners have used Google as a powerful price-comparison tool. Not anymore.

And the connections go further, Ben Howe writes:

We know that Obama campaign manager Jim Messina received personal mentoring on both technology approaches and management style from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, his friend since the 2008 campaign. We know that Google employees overwhelmingly contributed to Democrats in the last cycle (and aggregate individual employee contributions outnumbered the company’s PAC contributions). We know that Google vice president and “chief Internet evangelist” Vint Cerf received a presidential appointment to the National Science Board following last year’s election.

The left wing Joyce Foundation just funded a digital advocacy study co-authored by Organizing for Action’s (formerly Obama for America) Michael Slaby, who used to work for Google’s Eric Schmidt.

As we continue hear wailing and lamenting about “big money” in politics and the need for campaign finance reform, let’s keep in mind the left is as big a benefactor if not bigger of “big money” as the right."

Many Congressional Republicans say they are bracing for Mr. Obama to blame them for any problems with the legislative process.

“I do get the sense that everything for this administration seems to be a day-to-day tactical decision, rather than a legislative strategy of how to get things passed,” said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. “That’s not the same as doing what it takes to get work done.”

Process could also prove an enemy. Senate leaders will need 60 votes to even start on a bill, but before then they will have to ponder numerous amendments from the left and right — all of which could injure the bill’s chances in both camps. In fact, when Mr. Obama was a senator, he fought for a “poison pill” amendment in 2007 to phase out a guest-worker program favored by Republicans, an amendment that, when attached to the bill, helped sink it.

Some House members have already started to go their own way with far more modest, incremental proposals. Republicans there will certainly produce a far different bill from the Senate’s. Should the Senate and House end up in a conference to reconcile two bills, the final measure may well end up closer to that produced in the Senate, as has been the case with other bills that have gone to conference.

If this happens, Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, might be presented with the excruciating choice of bringing a more liberal version of legislation to the House floor or failing to close the deal on immigration reform that many in his party believe is needed.

Perhaps the most important factor in the bill’s favor is its broad support among a wide variety of constituencies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the agricultural industry, labor unions and many church groups. Unlike the gun legislation, the immigration bill has no strong single opponent analogous to the National Rifle Association. Immigration legislation also has a compelling advocate in the Senate."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/27/Biden--Economy-kept-McCain-from-victory-over-Obama,2013-04-27 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Biden: Gun Control 'Will Pass Before the Year is Out',"(AP) – Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that Arizona Sen. John McCain probably would have beat his boss in the 2008 presidential election had the economy not collapsed.

Biden’s comment about McCain and President Barack Obama came during the opening dinner of an annual forum among the Red Rocks of Sedona in northern Arizona. He and McCain, a Republican, touched on the gun control debate following the Newtown shootings and the bombings in Boston, but made no mention of Syria. Just as the night came to a close, Biden turned to the grueling nature of presidential campaigns.

“The truth of the matter is, Barack knows it, I know, had the economy not collapsed around your ears, John, in the middle of literally — as things were moving — I think you probably would have won,” Biden said. “But it would have been incredibly, incredibly, incredibly close. You inherited a really difficult time.”

The forum is part of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a program formed by McCain as a way to debate foreign affairs. This year’s theme for the Sedona Forum is “How can we promote freedom and democracy effectively?”

Rather than a discussion between McCain and Biden, the two sat on stage together with McCain posing questions to his former Democratic adversary on gun control and whether background checks are necessary, human rights abuses at the hands of the United States and the recent bombings at the Boston marathon.

McCain and Biden both said that despite their disagreements, they’ve never lost respect for one another.

On gun control, Biden said it’s never been a simple issue, but that Congress has miscalculated how deeply the public feels about it and has failed to stand up to groups like the National Rifle Association, particularly after the shootings in Newtown. He said the public is looking to Congress to be mature enough to figure out a way to diminish the chance it will happen again.

“For the first time ever, you have people who are for gun safety, for increasing background checks,” Biden said. “Two out of three of them say it will be a major determining factor in how I vote. That’s the political dynamic that has changed. So I think we’re going to get this anyway. I think this will pass before the year is out, within this Congress.”

In responding to a question about the vulnerabilities of the United States when it comes to terrorist attacks, Biden said that the radical, lone wolves have been the most difficult to catch. But he said America shouldn’t change its values, how it treats people abroad or people coming into the United States. Nor should America adopt policies that keep people from freely walking down the street without being frisked by police or carrying identification cards, he said.

“The moment we change any of those things, that’s when they win,” Biden said. “Because they don’t see how you can have a society that is not ordered and regimented and wedded to an orthodoxy that is theirs. That’s the point that bothers them most about us.”

McCain followed up by saying that those who tortured U.S. prisoners, in violation of the Geneva convention, should be exposed and be held responsible to prevent repeated abuses.

Biden agreed with the man once held as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. He said the internal debate in Congress and at the White House is how things got to that point, but it’s not yet resolved.

“I think the only way you excise the demons is you acknowledge what happened, straightforward,” Biden said."

Vice President Biden meets Thursday with the National Rifle Association and other gun owners groups, but early signs do not suggest a meeting of the minds.

In a radio interview this week, NRA President David Keene criticized Biden and President Obama over their anti-gun violence efforts, calling it a political project.

""I think they're being disingenuous,"" Keene said, CBS News reported. ""I think that they see this as an opportunity to go after the Second Amendment, which they've wanted to do for years, if not decades, and I think they're going to do everything they can to strip Americans of their right to keep and bear arms.""

Biden and Obama have said they respect the Second Amendment right of gun ownership, but are looking for ways to keep weapons out of the wrong hands in the wake of last month's elementary school shooting in Connecticut.

The president assigned Biden to develop a legislative package by the end of the month. Obama is also considering a series of executive actions in the wake of the shooting that killed 20 children and six adult staff members.

The vice president has been meeting with a series of ""stakeholders"" on the issues, from gun control advocates to gun rights groups, faith leaders to elected officials, hunters to members of the entertainment industry.

""We've reached out beyond the issue of just gun safety,"" Biden said Wednesday. ""We've reached out to the mental health community. We've reached out to doctors and nurses. We've reached out to the religious community.""

The White House issued a statement on Biden's talk Wednesday meeting with elected officials:

""Following a meeting with representatives of victims' groups and gun safety organizations, the vice president held conference calls with governors of both parties and state and local elected leaders from across the United States.

""During the calls, the vice president listened to the unique perspectives of all the participants and solicited their ideas and input on how to curb gun violence in this country. The vice president reiterated the administration's commitment to this urgent issue, and stressed that the problem requires immediate action."""

Majority of Michiganders support ban on assault weapons and background checks

44%25 of respondents oppose Obama%27s plan

Results broke along party lines%2C with independents split 40%25 in favor%2C 42%25 opposed

WASHINGTON -- Many Michigan residents may be suspicious when asked in general about President Barack Obama's proposals for gun control , however, they appear to support the specific recommendations.

A poll by EPIC-MRA of Lansing, Mich. -- released exclusively to the Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV, Detroit -- shows majority support among state residents for prohibiting the sale or possession of so-called assault weapons, banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and requiring background checks for all firearm purchases.

Those are three of the top suggestions made by Obama last month in the wake of the December school shootings in Newtown, Conn. But when asked in general how they felt about ""President Obama's proposed changes in national gun laws,"" 44% of respondents said they were opposed, compared with 42% who were in favor. Fourteen percent were undecided.

Taken together, those results suggest that when it comes to people's opinions about gun control and the Second Amendment right to bear arms, very little can be taken for granted.

For instance, Beverly Ballew, 59, of Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich., said while she could support increasing background checks, limiting certain high-capacity ammunition magazines and prohibiting access to anything that could fire rounds repeatedly with a single pull of the trigger, she remains suspicious of any proposals Obama puts forward.

""I don't trust him No.1,"" she said. ""No. 2, I'm very supportive of the Second Amendment.""

For the poll, EPIC-MRA surveyed 600 Michigan voters between Feb. 5-10. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Despite splitting over Obama's proposals, respondents supported banning high-capacity ammunition magazines by a 58%-38% margin and prohibiting the manufacture, possession or sale of ""semi-automatic assault weapons, such as the AK-47 or the AR-15, 54%-43%.

The margin was even higher for requiring background checks for all gun sales — with 86% in favor compared with 12% opposed.

Rob Harris, the media director for Michigan Open Carry, a group which advocates the legality of unconcealed possession of firearms in public, said the results show how potentially misleading the issue — and the terms used in the debate — can be.

""Most people that you would come across in society today don't know what an assault weapon is,"" he said. ""If you ask a general person, they're going to say it's a machine gun, and that's not the case. ... It's a scary word that scares a lot of people who are not in the know.""

Steve Dulan, with the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners, said many of the definitions applied in the gun debate have ""been an attempt to mislead people on this issue.""

""I don't think that's even in question,"" he said.

Unlike a fully automatic weapon — such as those used by the military and some law enforcement — a semi-automatic assault weapon still requires a shooter to pull the trigger to fire each round. So-called assault weapons typically don't require a shooter to manually load another round, and gun control advocates argue their military design is antithetical to sporting uses.

Proposing a return of the assault weapon ban that expired in 2004, Obama said last month that weapons such as the rifle used in a shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater last summer ""when paired with high-capacity magazines"" have ""one purpose — to pump out as many bullets as possible, as quickly as possible.""

""These military style weapons, there's no reason why anyone outside the military needs them,"" said David L. Garrett Jr., 68, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.

With a doctorate in chemistry, Garrett — a retired chief materials engineer at General Motors and Delphi — said he has no problem with firearms for sport, but semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned. He doubts it will happen, though.

""With the Republicans in office (and holding the majority in the U.S. House), not a chance,"" he said.

The EPIC-MRA poll showed that while self-described Democrats broke by a better than two-to-one margin in favor of Obama's recommendations and Republicans by a more than two-to-one margin against, independent voters were split 40% in favor, 42% against. Slightly more than half of men — 52% — were opposed to Obama's proposals, compared with 38% in favor and 10% undecided; 45% of women were in favor, compared with 36% against and 19% undecided.

""I think it just shows that while Americans are united in their support for the Second Amendment it needs to go hand in hand with keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals,"" said Zach Pohl, executive director of Progress Michigan, a liberal activist group."

Our Capitol Hill neighborhood drowned in the scream of sirens as police cars, vans, trucks, and armored vehicles streaked through the narrow streets at deadly speeds. The skies filled with the constant wapping of countless helicopters.

Just back from dropping children off at school, neighbors began frantically calling, texting and emailing one another to see what was wrong. The crisp morning reminded many of Sept. 11, 2001.

Police dispatched text and email alerts to residents that there was an “active shooter” at the nearby Navy Yard, just blocks from where our children play little league baseball. Many were dead and more injured, we were told.

Then the terrifying news: As many as two more shooters were on the loose and being sought.

D.C. police concluded their advisory to residents with the same admonishment that punctuates every crime alert: “DO NOT TAKE ACTION.” Instead, we are given an “event” number and instructed to call 911.

As any decent American knows, there is no feeling more powerless than to realize that a couple of mass murderers are loose in your neighborhood and you are denied the right to keep a gun to defend yourself, your family, or your home. A sickening knot tightens in your gut.

“DO NOT TAKE ACTION.”

Then came the latest Orwellian phrase in the “homeland security” lexicon: “Shelter in place!”

So, not only are you not allowed to defend yourself against mass murderers, you are not supposed to run from them either.

This, my fellow countrymen, is pure insanity.

And all the terror and real bloody carnage took place inside the most impenetrable fortress of gun control utopia.

The very guns Aaron Alexis used to kill 12 people are banned in this city, unless you submit to an exhaustive, invasive, and expensive process and prove to the city bureaucracy that you are worthy of your Second Amendment rights. Clearly, that failed.

We now know that Alexis was run through to the normal background checks already in place to purchase a gun from a gun dealer. He submitted to even more exhaustive background checks to get his job and access to the Navy Yard. All of those background checks, and he still massacred 12 people.

We also now know that Alexis had multiple run-ins with police in various states and was accused of committing numerous gun crimes, including firing a gun into his neighbor’s occupied apartment and blasting the tires off of a car in a fit of rage. In those cases, existing laws were already in place to nab the lunatic and strip him of his gun rights. For whatever reason, these laws that should have flagged him as a dangerous criminal were not enforced.

So here we are with 12 good people dead, living in the land of gun control, where terror reigns because the criminals have guns and the rest of us are scolded “DO NOT TAKE ACTION” and “Shelter in place!”

The great cartoon philosopher Gary Larson once drew a panel of what he imagined a boneless chicken ranch might look like. Already flightless, the limp birds lay all about unable to even raise their heads with their legs splayed out in ridiculous fashion.

That is what we are here. Flightless and defenseless. As a cartoon about boneless chickens is hilarious; as a way of life, it is terrifying."

(CNN) – The chief of a powerful gun owners group said Wednesday he doesn't trust the methodology of polls showing an overwhelming number of Americans favoring universal background checks on gun sales.

""I'm not sure I believe any polls at this time. I don't think they know how to ask the right questions,"" Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer during a contentious interview on ""The Situation Room."" When Blitzer asked if that included Fox News' survey, Pratt said it did.



Nearly every national survey released over the past several months has shown a large percentage of Americans support increased background checks. The latest, a CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday, showed 86% of those questioned favoring some form of background checks that are not currently required by law for gun sales.

The CNN survey, along with the previous polls, found no real partisan divide, with very strong support for the checks from Democrats, Republicans, and independents.

Those figures, however, weren't enough to convince Pratt.

""Your polls are hokum,"" he said, explaining that polls of gun owners groups, like Gun Owners of America and the National Rifle Association, show only small support for increasing background checks. Gun Owners of America has 300,000 due-paying members, per its website, while the larger National Rifle Association has 5 million. Both reflect a small percentage when compared to the overall population.

""When you ask the people involved, maybe we have a reason to suspect how these polls are put together,"" Pratt said.

At the core of his opposition was the potential for the federal government to keep a registry of gun owners, which he declared unconstitutional.

""The background check is national gun registration,"" he said. ""And all that's on the table right now is to make that more comprehensive gun registration scheme than we've already had.""

Sen. Pat Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican who played a key role in negotiating a deal on expanding background checks, will receive backlash from gun groups, Pratt argued.

""He ought to be held politically accountable, and the way to do that is in the primaries,"" he said, adding his group was ""looking for a viable candidate.""

Toomey is up for re-election in 2016."

Pat Toomey, R-Pa., wasn’t planning to co-sponsor legislation seeking to expand background checks for gun purchases if reintroduced. While Toomey noted that it was “unlikely” another attempt to pass the measure would succeed in Congress, he said he would be a co-sponsor of such a bill if it were to be reintroduced.

As a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association with an “A+” rating for her voting record in the Tennessee House of Representatives, Debra Maggart never imagined that her political career would end this way.

Maggart, who chaired the Republican caucus, killed an NRA-backed bill that would have permitted Tennesseans to keep firearms in their parked vehicles wherever they went — work, school or the neighborhood bar.

Months later, Maggart was stunned to see NRA-sponsored ads on billboards in her district. Her face was next to a picture of President Obama. The ads proclaimed: “Sure, Rep. Debra Maggart Says She Supports Your Gun Rights. Of Course, He Says the Same Thing.”

The NRA threw its support behind a newcomer in the Republican primary. By summer’s end, the woman who had been one of Tennessee’s most powerful Republicans and ardent supporters of gun rights was done in by hardball tactics.

“As a pro-Second Amendment person and a life member of the NRA, I was just shocked they did this to me,” Maggart said in an interview. “They did this to send a message: ‘If you don’t do what we want, we will annihilate you.’ ”

The message has not been lost on lawmakers across the nation, including those in the U.S. Senate, where a proposal to expand background checks for gun purchases died April 17 in the face of the NRA’s staunch opposition.

For longtime NRA members, the Senate vote was not surprising. The group has turned the debate over gun control into a clarion call for constitutional rights. Any perceived assault on the Second Amendment is met with a withering counterattack. Even conservative lawmakers who cross the NRA are labeled as traitors. The NRA has been so effective over the years that gun-control groups are now trying to adopt some of the same tactics.

Well-organized NRA members and affiliated groups of gun owners hold rallies and pour resources into political campaigns. They flood local and national legislative offices with e-mails and phone calls. They make unannounced visits to the offices of lawmakers. The NRA’s lobbying arm posts myriad “Alerts,” calling on millions of members across the country to rise up at a moment’s notice.

It’s more about organizing muscle and less about political money.

A spokesman for the NRA did not return calls requesting comment.

“The NRA knows how to play very effective hardball,” said Richard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist who wrote the book “Ricochet,” an inside account of gun politics and tactics. “They have turned this into a symbolic issue. It’s no longer about guns. It’s about freedom and responsibility and liberty.”

After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn., in December, Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) said he could sense a “sea change” in gun politics. He issued a public pledge: He would not “shy away” from challenging the NRA, which has great influence in his state.

That was before Begich was overwhelmed by phone calls and e-mails from NRA members and other gun rights activists. They warned him against voting for expanded background checks, to stop violating “our gun rights,” and to break with the Democratic Party or face the consequences in the next election.

Begich was one of four Democrats from states with strong NRA membership to turn his back on his party and the legislation.

‘One strike and you’re out’

The NRA’s tough tactics have a long history. In 1994, after President Bill Clinton pushed criminal background checks and a 10-year ban on assault-style weapons through Congress, the NRA organized a grass-roots uprising.

The midterm elections that year were a bloodbath for Democrats who opposed the NRA, and Republicans took control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years.

Some of the most influential members of the Democratic Party lost their seats that night, including House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (Wash.) and House Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks (Tex.).

“The NRA had a great night,” Clinton would write in his autobiography. “They beat both Speaker Tom Foley and Jack Brooks, two of the ablest members of Congress, who had warned me this would happen. . . . The NRA was an unforgiving master: one strike and you’re out.”

George “Buddy” Darden was one of the 54 House Democrats to lose his job that night. For nearly 10 years, he had represented a district that included suburban Atlanta and swaths of rural Georgia, an increasingly conservative district with an well-organized contingent of NRA members.

Darden opposed the ban on assault-style weapons, but he wound up voting for the bill that contained the 10-year prohibition. The NRA leadership was infuriated. It recruited conservative religious groups, along with like-minded city council members and county commissioners, to attack Darden and support Republican challenger Robert L. Barr Jr., who used a local gun shop as a campaign base.

Barr won with more than 52 percent of the vote.

Looking back, Darden said numerous factors played into his loss. Although he refused to give the NRA full credit, he acknowledged that the group influenced the outcome of that race.

“The NRA is a take-no-prisoners organization. There is no margin of error with them,” Darden said in an interview. “I knew their position, and I can’t complain. I just felt that the Second Amendment, just like any other amendment, is not absolute.”

Feldman, the former NRA lobbyist, remembers the Darden-Barr race well. At the time, he was chief executive of the American Shooting Sports Council, a trade association for the firearms industry.

“He voted for the final package that included the assault weapons ban, and the day after he did that, there were lines around the corner of the gun store of people supporting Bob Barr,” Feldman recalled. “The NRA supported Barr. We supported Barr. You do what you do in a democracy.

“You support your friends, and you oppose your enemies.”

‘I couldn’t believe it’

Debra Maggart has been around firearms all her life. Her family owned Carter Hardware in Nashville, which sold rifles, shotguns and handguns. She got her hunter’s license, joined a local gun club and went to the Tennessee House in 2004 as a pro-gun lawmaker.

“You can’t get more pro-Second Amendment than me,” she said.

Last year, Maggart said, the NRA drafted a bill to permit concealed weapons to be kept in locked vehicles no matter where they were parked. She said business and property owners objected, arguing that they could be liable for gunfire on their properties. Maggart tabled the bill in April 2012.

In early July, she started to receive frantic phone calls from her friends.

“Have you seen the billboards?” they asked.

“I went out and looked, and I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “The billboards said I was just like Obama, and where I’m from, that’s deadly.”

The billboard ads were followed by radio spots, newspaper ads and fliers mailed to homes in her district: “Maggart and Obama: We Can’t Trust Either With Our Rights.”

On YouTube, Chris Cox, chief of lobbying for the NRA, went after Maggart.

“We’ve put up ads and billboards comparing Debra Maggart to Barack Obama,” Cox said. “That’s because, while both say they support our Second Amendment rights, they both worked against our freedoms behind closed doors.”

Maggart estimated that the NRA and other gun groups spent $155,000 on the race. She said all she could do was watch her polling numbers fall. She ended up losing the Republican primary by 16 percentage points to a candidate handpicked by the NRA, Courtney Rogers, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who had no political experience.

“They will lie about you. They will use intimidation tactics. They will use bullying tactics, and because of that, people are afraid,” Maggart said.

“Why wouldn’t you be afraid?’”

Ayotte in the middle

After watching the NRA’s successes on Capitol Hill and in statehouses across the nation, gun-control groups are starting to employ some of the same tactics.

Nowhere has that been more apparent than in New Hampshire, where Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte finds herself caught between two powerful forces: the NRA and Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

Ayotte was the only senator from a Northeastern state to side with the NRA.

Since the vote, the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry trade group, have been running radio spots in New Hampshire that praise Ayotte for her stance.

“Kelly Ayotte is not just a senator, she’s also a mom who cares about protecting our kids,” the announcer says. “Kelly had the courage to oppose misguided gun-control laws that would not have prevented Sandy Hook.”

Gun-control groups are hitting back. The mayors group, organized by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I), has tapped a deep reservoir of phone and ­e-mail lists to mobilize opposition to Ayotte. Protesters have trailed Ayotte to events in New Hampshire, demanding that she explain her vote.

On April 30, the daughter of the slain Sandy Hook principal confronted Ayotte at a crowded town hall meeting in Warren, N.H.

The scene was reminiscent of the way the NRA had taken over town hall meetings.

“A fair amount of what we’re doing in New Hampshire is right out of the NRA playbook,” said Arkadi Gerney, who was a special adviser to the mayors group before joining the Center for American Progress as a senior fellow. He and others are helping to coordinate the anti-Ayotte campaign in New Hampshire.

One of the lessons learned: Every vote in every city, county and state cannot be taken for granted.

“We’re on the ground, moving people on our side,” Gerney said. “You have to have people show up at the events, send letters and make the phone calls.

“It’s not enough to have 99 percent of the people agree with you.”

Toomey’s quandary

Until recently, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) was considered a friend of the NRA’s in the halls of Congress and in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, a state that boasts one of the highest concentrations of NRA members. The NRA had given Toomey an “A” rating for his dependable voting record and, in 2011, invited him to speak at its annual Celebration of American Values Leadership Forum.

That was before Toomey this spring joined Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to introduce legislation to expand federal background checks. Even though the measure failed, gun rights activists say Toomey crossed the “line in the sand” drawn by the NRA.

William A. Bachenberg, an NRA national board member who directs the organization’s efforts in eastern Pennsylvania, said Toomey undercut his credibility in the gun rights community. Bachenberg said many of Toomey’s supporters see the background-check proposal as a purely political move to help him win reelection in 2016 in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 1 million voters.

“I will not support him,” declared Bachenberg, who owns a skeet-shooting range in the Lehigh Valley and said he was not speaking on behalf of the NRA. “A lot of shooters have been coming to the range, and they feel betrayed. When you talk about constitutional rights and an issue that is this dear to us, this is very frustrating.”

John F. Brinson has been a friend of Toomey’s for more than 20 years. But as a co-chairman of the Eastern Pennsylvania Firearms Coalition, Brinson said he sees trouble on the horizon for the senator.

“I will support Pat, but a lot of people won’t. They are so angry,” Brinson said. “I have a right to keep and bear arms, period. And this is the kind of thing that sets off gun owners and makes us crazy. This is not gun control, this is people control, and they are treating us like children.”

Before the proposal was defeated, Toomey said he knew that the NRA would be angry.

“My approach is to do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may,” he said in an interview. ”I don’t know what the political implications will be. I don’t think anyone does. “

Manchin has said he plans to revive the background-check legislation. Toomey noted that it was “unlikely” another attempt to pass the measure would succeed in Congress, but he said he would be a co-sponsor of such a bill if it were to be reintroduced.

Like pray.

“Where we see tragedy,” said NRA chief lobbyist Chris Cox, “Barack Obama and Michael Bloomberg, they see opportunity. While we pray for God to comfort those suffering unimaginable pain, they rush to microphones and cameras, gather in war rooms on Capitol Hill and scheme about how to use that suffering to push their political agenda.”

Yeah, that makes sense.

I can definitely see where praying is much more effective than trying to pass universal background checks for gun purchases, limit the size of magazines or ban assault weapons.

RELATED: Sarah Palin’s vulgar tweets: Not funny

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who once sipped on a Big Gulp during a speech to tweak soda-averse New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, delighted the NRA crowd when she threatened to open a can of chewing tobacco to protest Bloomberg’s attempts to limit cigarette displays in stores.

“The politics of emotion,” Palin said, are governing current attempts to enact common-sense gun restrictions. “It’s not just self-serving, it’s destructive,” she said. “And it must stop.”

It’s apparent that all the NRA speakers this weekend got the same talking point about using the word “emotion” against those who would limit gun rights.

“We must do everything we can to stop violent crime,” said U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). “Everyone here has been horrified by acts of violence by deranged individuals that would take the lives of the innocent among us. And yet, in terms of how you actually stop violent crime, the president is fond of using emotion, and unfortunately disregarding the facts.”

Yes, emotion. Such a terrible thing. Particularly in the world of NRA leadership, which is known for its dispassionate, intellectual approach to the gun debate. It doesn’t get more lofty than Wayne LaPierre’s post-Sandy Hook analysis: “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”

On Planet NRA, only people who love guns are allowed to act on their emotions. Everybody else, not so much.

“Second Amendment rights are personal to me,” said Palin, who explained that her youngest son’s nickname is “Trigger,” her nephew’s middle name is “Remington,” her oldest son is a combat vet. “I could go on and on about the connections there.”

I bet she could.

However, if your first-grader died in a hail of bullets in the classroom, you, and the president who agrees with you about limits on gun ownership, are expected to shut up and grieve in silence.

You can’t be trusted to understand the gun debate.

You’re too emotional.

Reid said the Senate would “take a pause and freeze the background check bill where it is” and return to it at an undetermined date, likely with consideration of other proposed amendments.

“We’re going to come back to this bill,” Reid said.

Before making the announcement Thursday afternoon, Reid consulted with the White House about pulling the bill, and the White House supported the move, according to a White House official familiar with the talks.

The underlying bill hasn't been defeated and is still technically on the legislative calendar. As majority leader, Reid can bring up the bill again at a moment's notice.

When the Senate might reconsider the bill remains uncertain and may not occur for weeks or months. Reid said the Senate would move next to consideration of an Internet taxation bill, a proposal that is believed to enjoy bipartisan support.

Before Reid pulled the bill, senators voted Thursday to approve two amendments: One that would deter states from publishing lists of gun owners and a bipartisan plan to bolster federal funding for mental health efforts, including suicide prevention programs.

On Wednesday, senators blocked or defeated proposals that would ban certain military-style assault rifles, limit the size of ammunition magazines and expand background checks to most commercial gun sales. The action on background checks came despite polls showing that nine in 10 Americans support the idea, which was designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.

Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.), who helped write the bipartisan background check proposal, said Thursday that he supported Reid's decision and was confident the Senate would return to the issue.

""The bottom line is, that the facts were just so clean and clear,"" Manchin said in an interview. ""The bill had been worked on for three months, it took everyone. It sure as heck wasn’t the president’s bill.""

Manchin said he was especially distressed Thursday as he sat listening to colleagues repeat incorrect information about the contents of his proposal.

“They were just getting talking points from somebody, whether it be staff or someone. Trying to find any little wiggle room that they could find to change the interpretation,"" he said.

Manchin said he was especially angry with the National Rifle Association, which had incorrectly claimed that background checks on Internet gun sales would infringe upon people trying to privately sell or transfer weapons to family members or close friends.

Manchin said it was unlikely that most transfers between close family and friends would require posting an advertisement about a weapon online.

""If you’re selling your gun on the Internet to your son, to your cousin or to your close family and friends, you better check your relationships,"" Manchin said.

Other Democrats admitted they should have moved faster to marshal support for the bill.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said that the family members of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School were the most effective advocates for reform.

""The more my colleagues have a chance to talk to them, the more powerful the impact is,"" he said in an interview with The Fold, a Washington Post video program.

Story highlights NRA promises to release new ads, criticize 'so-called universal background checks' Group has actively opposed gun control measures backed by President Obama One past ad questions why Obama's children have armed security, other students do not Other groups have released their own ads, calling for stricter gun control measures

The National Rifle Association is heading back to the airwaves with yet another round of ads aimed at fighting gun-control initiatives circulating in Washington.

The advocacy group announced earlier this week that its CEO, Wayne LaPierre, would unveil the new ad campaign Saturday night from Salt Lake City during a speech at the Western Hunting and Conservation Expo.

In the same statement saying LaPierre would showcase new ads, the NRA said he would also “confront the real consequences of so-called ‘universal background checks.’”

As it turned out, LaPierre did not mention any new advertising in his remarks. But he did – as he has done passionately in the past – rail against President Barack Obama and other Democrats and the background checks that he said are “at the very heart of their anti-gun agenda.”

“This so-called universal background check that you’re hearing about all over the media … is aimed at one thing: It’s aimed at registering your guns,” LaPierre claimed. “And when another tragic opportunity presents itself, that registry will be used to confiscate your guns.”

The ads are the NRA’s latest salvo in the gun debate, attempting to influence the public – and, thus, lawmakers – to challenge a fresh gun-control push, one that the NRA CEO called “the single most devastating attack on the Second Amendment that this country has ever seen.”

The influential lobbying group has been vocal since Obama called for action in the days after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 students and six adults dead.

Afterward, NRA leaders said they would work with local officials to get more qualified armed guards in schools, while sharply resisting proposals to ban assault weapons, limit the size of gun magazines and to expand the system of background checks for firearms purchases.

The NRA efforts include advertisements such as the one, broadcast in mid-January, that described Obama as an “elitist hypocrite” because his two daughters are protected while at school by armed federal agents and yet he is “skeptical” about having armed personnel at all schools.

The White House blasted that ad, as did members of both political parties, for injecting the president’s children into the debate (and not acknowledging they may face different threats than other American schoolchildren).

But NRA President David Keene defended the spot on CNN, saying, “What we’re talking about is folks who have protections for their own children, … then pooh-pooh the idea that the average American’s children should have the same sort of protection.”

The gun rights organization also posted a web video that month asserting Obama’s attempts to enact gun control laws would result in the “confiscation” of people’s firearms.

More recently, the NRA ran ads in newspapers in five states – Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina and West Virginia – with the headline: “Will Obama’s gun control proposals work? His own experts say ‘No.’”

Democratic incumbent senators in three of those states are facing tough reelection fights, another is retiring and in the fifth, Maine, moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for reelection next year.

That ad buy, which also includes regional publications and online commercials, will cost the NRA about $350,000, a source familiar with it told CNN.

This follows the spending of about $100,000 to air a web video on various news sites in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Colorado, South Dakota and the District of Columbia.

The NRA has been successful in the past in thwarting gun-control legislation by building support on the grass-roots level, and that is where the group is focusing much of its efforts now.

Still, the organization has a challenge, given the horrific nature of the Newtown massacre – coming on the heels of several other mass shootings – and the high priority that Obama is placing on gun control. It also has competition in terms of ads, with groups such as MoveOn.org and Mayors Against Illegal Guns taking to newspapers and the airwaves themselves to push for stricter gun control measures."

Pat Quinn, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Senate President John Cullerton decried a bill to legalize concealed firearms that is backed by powerful House Speaker Michael Madigan, contending it would invalidate strict local gun laws like Chicago's ban on assault weapons.

That opposition, however, didn't stop Madigan from advancing the bill Thursday, demonstrating that after months of negotiations, the time for talking was over. Predicting it would pass the House, Madigan has indicated that a vote on the measure could come as early as Friday.

The odd tensions among the four top Chicago Democrats who run state and city government are exacerbated by twin deadlines: the legislature's own scheduled May 31 adjournment date and a June 9 date set by a federal appeals court for Illinois to come up with a concealed carry law after it struck down the nation's only state ban on possessing firearms in public.

The House bill is sponsored by Rep. Brandon Phelps, D-Harrisburg, the legislature's strongest voice for gun-owner rights. It would put in place a statewide standard for concealed carry that would not allow Chicago or other home-rule communities to enact stricter local laws on where guns could be carried.

Moreover, it would wipe out Chicago's existing gun laws by removing the right of home-rule communities to enact their own firearm regulations.

""This legislation as written is a massive overreach that goes far beyond the conceal carry issue,"" said Quinn spokeswoman Brooke Anderson. ""The measure would repeal Chicago's assault weapons ban and put public safety at risk. We oppose this.""

After lawmakers had gone home for the day, Emanuel's office issued a statement opposing Madigan's plan, saying the mayor is ""committed to working with the leaders"" on legislation to combat gun crimes and keep illegal guns off the street.

In a Capitol where political posturing is second nature, Cullerton's decision to attack what he sees as a pro-gun tilt in the House bill only escalated the drama between two chambers already at a standoff over how to fix a nearly $100 billion pension debt with only a week left in the spring session.

Even before a House committee advanced the bill on a 13-3 vote, Senate President Cullerton released a stinging statement that contended the National Rifle Association's ""fingerprints"" can be found ""all over"" the bill. Cullerton criticized the House bill as an ""NRA dream"" because it gives state government ""exclusive authority to regulate any matter related to firearms"" beyond just concealed carry.

NRA representatives were uncharacteristically quiet and took no position on the bill in the House committee. An affiliate of the NRA, the Illinois State Rifle Association, said it was ""neutral"" on the measure.

The NRA's silence prompted state Sen. Kwame Raoul, the sponsor of a Senate bill backed by Cullerton, to ask, ""When have you known the NRA to be quiet on a bill of this magnitude or quiet on a bill that they don't like? One's got to be suspicious of that.""

Both Cullerton and Raoul left room for further negotiations. Cullerton said that absent the language ending local communities' rights to regulate guns, the House legislation was ""clear evidence that the two chambers are close to an agreement.""

Raoul's bill stalled in the Senate last week when Madigan made it clear to lawmakers, including senators, that the House was working on what he indicated may be a better bill.

Both the House and Senate bills agree on some basics, such as banning guns in places like CTA buses and trains, stadiums, casinos and government buildings.

The House bill says state police shall give concealed carry permits to people who fit within the letter of the law. But local officials can still object, and applicants, if denied a permit, can appeal to a new review board loaded with appointees who have law enforcement backgrounds.

The Senate bill would require applicants to get separate endorsements — one for Chicago and one for the rest of the state — to carry a concealed weapon statewide. Those carve-outs are not in the House bill — a position the NRA has backed.

Rep. Andre Thapedi, D-Chicago, said it was a ""no-brainer"" to vote in favor of the House bill. He underscored the silence at the committee hearing from lobbyists for Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart and Emanuel.

A Dart spokesman said in an email that the ""situation in Springfield is just too fluid for the time being."" Alvarez's office had no comment.

The president, in a set of brief remarks from the White House Thursday surrounded by the mothers of shooting victims, raised concern that the shock from the Newtown elementary school shooting could soon fade.

""Less than 100 days ago that happened. ... Shame on us if we've forgotten,"" Obama said. ""I haven't forgotten those kids. Shame on us if we've forgotten.""

Amid signals from Washington that the Senate bill could be losing momentum and high-dollar ad campaigns on both sides, the president was there to deliver a message to wavering lawmakers. ""Don't get squishy,"" he said.

Obama, accusing opponents of drumming up ""fear,"" urged supporters to call members of Congress and pressure them into backing the package.

More On This...

Republican Sen. Mike Lee, of Utah, ripped the president for the remarks, suggesting he was exploiting the Newtown tragedy.

""The proposals the president is calling for Congress to pass would primarily serve to reduce the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding citizens while having little or no effect on violent crime,"" Lee said in a statement. ""It is deeply unfortunate that he continues to use the tragedy at Newtown as a backdrop for pushing legislation that would have done nothing to prevent that horrible crime.""

Lee said he and his conservative colleagues plan to ensure that any of the firearms proposals require a 60-vote threshold in order to proceed. This could be a high hurdle for the Senate to clear.

Already, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dropped from the main package a proposal to renew and expand the expired assault weapons ban.

The base bill will instead cover universal background checks, strengthened punishments for illegal trafficking and more money for school security.

Items like school security enjoy broad support. But the move to include private sales -- including gun show purchases -- in the background check system remains controversial in some circles. Plus the assault weapons ban, which Republicans most adamantly oppose, is still expected to get a vote as an amendment to the main bill.

The National Rifle Association, during and after Obama's remarks, tweeted a flurry of comments criticizing the latest Obama push. The group accused him of campaigning ""against guns to please the fringe.""

Both sides of the gun debate are stepping up their effort to sway Congress. While the NRA has been vocal since the start of the process, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg just launched a $12 million ad buy in support of the legislation.

""It's not done until it's done,"" Obama said Thursday. ""There are some powerful voices on the other side that are interested in running out the clock, or changing the subject. ... They're doing everything they can to make all our progress collapse under the weight of fear and frustration."""

(CNN) – Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords and an outspoken advocate for new gun control measures, purchased an AR-15 assault rifle in Tucson recently as a demonstration of what he says are unobtrusive background checks.

The retired space shuttle commander wrote on his Facebook page he would turn in the weapon – which he said he hadn't yet obtained - to the city's police department.



""Looks like the judiciary committee will vote on background checks next week,"" Kelly wrote, referring to the Senate panel where gun control legislation is up for a vote this week.

""I just had a background check a few days ago when I went to my local gun store to buy a 45. As I was leaving, I noticed a used AR-15. Bought that too. Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a matter of minutes,"" he continued.

Later, on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" Kelly said it was ""important for me to have firsthand knowledge about how easy it is or difficult it is to buy a weapon like that.""

The AR-15 is one of America's top-selling firearms, and has become a focus of the gun control debate after being used in a recent spate of mass shootings. One was used in the December massacre at a Connecticut elementary school. Advocates for tighter gun laws argue there's no need for Americans to own the powerful rifle, but the gun's proponents say the AR-15's accuracy makes it safe.

Aside from a measure bolstering background checks that's sponsored by New York Democrat Charles Schumer, the Senate Judiciary Committee this week will consider a ban on assault weapons that was introduced by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, which would outlaw the AR-15 among a host of other military-style weapons.

Last week the judiciary panel approved a bill toughening laws on gun trafficking and straw purchases, but on the issue of background checks – which previously appeared poised for bipartisan support in the legislature – Republicans and Democrats have reached some sticking points.

Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have expressed support for expanding the scope of mental health information submitted to the federal background check system used by gun sellers, but some have expressed concern that records would be kept on responsible gun owners.

Bipartisan talks have also failed to reach a compromise that would address the ""gun show loophole,"" which critics say provides an avenue for people who know they cannot pass a background check to obtain guns through private sales.

In his Facebook message about the AR-15 purchase, Kelly wrote it was ""scary to think of people buying guns like these without a background check at a gun show or the Internet.

""We really need to close the gun show and private seller loop hole,"" he concluded.

He added on CNN that he was ""looking forward at some point to buying a gun at a gun show, and also possibly selling a gun.""

Last week, Giffords support for background checks alongside her husband at a gun control rally in Tucson, Arizona, the same place where an assailant shot her in the head.

The former congresswoman urged lawmakers to ""Be bold. Be courageous. Please support background checks.""

At the event, Kelly said his newly formed gun-control organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions, was sending a letter to U.S. Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, both Arizona Republicans, urging them to support background-check legislation. McCain suggested last month that such legislation would have success in the Senate.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/18/colorado-sheriffs-sue-over-new-state-gun-restrictions/,2013-05-18 00:00:00,[],Colorado sheriffs sue over new state gun restrictions,"Colorado sheriffs upset with gun restrictions adopted in the aftermath of last year's mass shootings filed a federal lawsuit Friday, challenging the regulations as unconstitutional.

The lawsuit involves sheriffs from 54 of Colorado's 64 counties, most representing rural, gun-friendly areas of the state.

The sheriffs say the new state laws violate Second Amendment protections that guarantee the right to keep and bear arms. Opponents are criticizing the lawsuit as political maneuvering.

The filing targets Colorado laws that limit the size of ammunition magazines and expand background checks. The regulations passed the Legislature this spring and are set to take effect July 1.

It isn't yet clear whether the sheriffs' challenge will delay or jeopardize the laws. The filing, however, guarantees the renewal of a fierce debate over gun control.

Colorado lawmakers passed the restrictions in reaction to the shooting rampage at a suburban Denver movie theater last summer, where 12 people were killed and dozens more were wounded, and the massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

The gun control debate was one of the most emotionally charged of the legislative session, with lengthy debates and national attention. President Barack Obama added to the attention on the Colorado Statehouse, as his administration unsuccessfully pushed Congress to enact similar gun controls.

Sheriffs' attorneys are considering whether to ask the court for a preliminary injunction, which would block the Colorado laws while the lawsuit moves forward.

The law enforcement community is divided on the issue. In contrast to the sheriffs, the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police, which includes urban departments, supports the laws. The chiefs said the measures were ""common-sense approaches"" to protect the public ""while not taking guns from law-abiding citizens in any way.""

Unlike sheriffs, police chiefs are not elected.

Democrats maintain the public is on their side, and say legislators carefully crafted the proposals that were signed.

""These laws were not constructed haphazardly,"" said Democratic Sen. Mary Hodge, the sponsor of the magazine limit. ""They were constructed to protect us from massacres like the ones we suffered in Aurora and Newtown.""

Relatives of victims of the Colorado shooting criticized the sheriffs for filing the lawsuit and accused them of playing politics.

""As a parent who lost my son Alex at the Aurora theater shooting, I ask these people to put themselves in my place,"" Tom Sullivan said in a statement. ""I do not understand why these politicians are picking guns over people.""

Weld County Sheriff John Cooke said he and his colleagues were ""not the ones playing politics with this.""

""We believe that the Legislature were the ones who were playing politics,"" he said.

Gun control opponents say the language in the regulations is unclear and doesn't provide safeguards to prevent people from inadvertently breaking the laws.

Ammunition magazines, for example, are easily converted to larger sizes, which the bill bans. Gun rights advocates also say the law expanding background checks doesn't provide enough exemptions for temporary transfers and that people conducting private transactions will have a difficult time getting appropriate checks.

Lawmakers allowed several exemptions in the background check legislation, including transfers between immediate family members, shooting events and temporary transfers of up to 72 hours.

State officials, including Attorney General John Suthers, have worked to defend the intent of the laws. Suthers, a Republican responsible for defending the law against the legal challenge, issued a statement Friday giving guidance to law enforcement on how the magazine limit should be enforced.

He said magazine features ""must be judged objectively"" and that magazines that hold 15 rounds or fewer can't be defined as ""large capacity"" simply because it can be modified to include more.

The state has 30 days to respond to the lawsuit."

The Senate will vote Thursday on whether to bring gun bills to the floor

14 Republicans say they plan to block votes on gun bills

It is unclear whether there are 60 votes in the Senate to end the filibuster

WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that beginning Thursday, the Senate will hold votes on gun control — with or without a Republican filibuster.

As a bipartisan compromise proved elusive, Reid scheduled a vote to end debate on Thursday. Even if he falls short of the 60 votes needed to end debate, he said he'll make Republicans filibuster the bill until he gets a vote. ""It will take a little bit of time, but we're going to do it,"" he said.

""We need to move to this legislation … and let the cards fall where they may,"" he told reporters following a closed-door Democratic meeting.

Reid's action starts the clock on what will be the most intense debate on gun control since the 1994 crime bill. But even now, the exact shape of the legislation is very much undefined.

More than an hour after a 5 p.m. target for a compromise on criminal background checks for gun purchases, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., emerged from the majority leader's office without a Plan B.

""We're closer than we've ever been,"" Schumer said.

""These have all been great talks,"" Manchin said.

The compromise Manchin was trying to forge with Sen. Pat Toomey, the Republican from the neighboring Appalachian state of Pennsylvania, will have to come Wednesday — if it comes at all. They're working on a plan to expand background checks and close the ""gun show loophole.""

Other amendments in the works: A mental health provision by Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, language regulating the size of ammunition magazines by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's ban on certain types of assault weapons.

It's not clear whether there are 60 votes to end debate, and Reid conceded he didn't know, either. Several Republican senators have indicated they will vote with Democrats to end the filibuster and allow an up-or-down vote on the gun bill.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., said on MSNBC Tuesday ""I don't support a filibuster for this,"" and Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said on CBS that although it was still unclear what would be in the bill, ""I think it deserves a vote up or down.""

Other Republican senators who have expressed reservations about a filibuster include John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., wouldn't say outright whether he would support the Republican filibuster Tuesday, saying the final bill had not yet been released.

""I'll be anxious to see what the actual gun legislation looks like when Sen. Reid finally is ready to bring it to the floor and whether it has amendments on it or not,"" he said. ""But as a general principle, I believe it's always better to debate the bill.""

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, had a similar answer, telling reporters that he hadn't seen the final bill.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he welcomed a debate on the issue. ""I will vote to proceed with the bill if I get assurances that we can offer meaningful amendments,"" he said. ""I don't fear the debate; I welcome the debate. That's just me.""

Vice President Biden said Tuesday that the prospect of a Republican filibuster was ""mind-boggling"" and said the issue ""isn't going away.""

But Reid may not have all his Democratic votes, either. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., is ill and will not be in the Senate this week to vote, and at least two leading Democrats, Sens. Max Baucus of Montana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas, have not said whether they will support Reid's effort to move to the gun bill. Pryor confirmed to reporters Tuesday that he hadn't decided on whether to vote to proceed on the gun bill.

""I don't get all the Democrats all the time,"" Reid said. ""That's for sure.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, defended the filibuster. ""In my view, every senator has a responsibility to actively protect the Bill of Rights,"" he said. ""Any bill that would undermine the Bill of Rights, in my view, should be subject to a 60-vote threshold.""

But he deflected questions on whether he had enough senators to block a vote, or whether Tea Party-allied senators would take to the floor in a ""talking filibuster,"" such as the one Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., conducted last month on President Obama's nominee to head the CIA.

""I would be happy spending the next two or three weeks on the floor of the Senate debating this,"" Cruz said. ""There's an irony to the calls for 'Let's have a debate.' We're having the debate right now.""

Americans overwhelmingly support universal background checks for gun buyers

Two-thirds back tracking gun sales%2C but there%27s a big partisan divide on the issue.

Gun-rights supporters much more likely to place a priority on the issue.

WASHINGTON — An ""activism gap"" between gun rights supporters and those who back stricter limits helps explain why gun control legislation has proved so difficult to enact, even in the wake of public outrage over shooting rampages.

A nationwide poll by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press finds Americans by 51%-45% say it's more important to control gun ownership than to protect the right of Americans to own guns.

However, those concerned about gun rights are much more likely to place a priority on the issue and be politically active about it. Nearly one in four have contributed to a group that takes a position on gun policy, for instance, compared with 5% of those who say it's more important to control guns. Gun rights advocates are nearly twice as likely to have contacted a public official to express an opinion about gun policy, 15%-8%.

The phone survey of 1,502 adults, taken Jan. 9-13, shows broad and bipartisan consensus in support of two particular proposals:

Making background checks on gun buyers universal, including at gun shows and in private sales, is backed by 85% of Americans, including about equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans.

Preventing people with mental illness from buying guns is backed by 80%, including 86% of Republicans and 78% of Democrats.

Both ideas are supported by close to nine in 10 gun owners, who made up about a third of those surveyed.

On other proposals, there are sharp partisan splits. Two-thirds endorse creating a federal database to track gun sales, but Democrats are nearly twice as likely as Republicans to back the idea. A ban on assault-style weapons is supported by 84% of Democrats but 44% of Republicans.

""My starting point is not to worry about the politics,"" President Obama said at a news conference Monday when asked about gun control one month after 20 children and six educators were shot to death at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. ""My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works, what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we're reducing the incidence of gun violence.""

He said, ""If in fact — and I believe this is true — everybody across party lines was as deeply moved and saddened as I was by what happened in Newtown, then we're going to have to vote based on what we think is best. We're going to have to come up with answers that set politics aside. And that's what I expect Congress to do.""

What about the National Rifle Association's proposal to protect children by arming more adults in schools?

By 2-1, 64%-32%, those surveyed support the idea of using more armed security guards and police officers. A solid majority, 57%-40%, oppose arming more teachers. On that issue, the partisan divide is particularly stark: 56% of Republicans and 23% of Democrats say it's a good idea.

On some issues involving guns, men and women have different views. Two-thirds of women but fewer than half of men support an assault weapons ban. Nearly half of men but just a third of women endorse arming teachers with guns in schools.

The poll's margin of error is +/-2.9 percentage points."

With President Obama preparing to push a legislative agenda aimed at curbing the nation’s gun violence, pillars of his political network, along with independent groups, are raising millions of dollars and mapping out strategies in an attempt to shepherd new regulations through Congress.

But the efforts, designed in large part to counter opposition from the National Rifle Association, face serious political obstacles on Capitol Hill. The NRA spent more than $20 million on federal election campaigns last year, and its lobbying muscle extends from Washington to state capitals around the country.

Most Republicans in the GOP-controlled House also oppose additional gun regulations, as do some key Democrats in the Senate — meaning that the groups aligned with Obama will have to persuade dozens of skeptical lawmakers to vote for the president’s eventual proposals.

The groups, whose leaders are in regular contact with the White House, are working to enlist religious leaders, mayors, police chiefs and other influential constituents to lobby their local lawmakers in their home districts. The organizations also plan to stage rallies at congressional town hall meetings across the country in much the same way tea party activists mounted opposition in 2009 to Obama’s health-care overhaul.

View Graphic Majority sees Connecticut shooting as societal problem

A trial run for the burgeoning campaign came this week when the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence ran hard-hitting ads in North Dakota and Capitol Hill newspapers against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who said Sunday that some of the gun measures Obama is considering are “extreme.” After the ads — which told Heitkamp “Shame on you” — the freshman senator’s office issued a statement opening the door to supporting some gun-control measures.

“You have to get those members of Congress who think the easiest position is to be with the NRA to think that someone will walk up to them in the supermarket and say, ‘Why can’t we just have background checks?’ ” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank helping to coordinate the effort. “They have to think of these as mainstream issues.”

Other organizations active in the effort include liberal interest groups, labor unions and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which is led and financed by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I).

A political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, was launched this week by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and has picked up seven-figure donations from major Democratic benefactors.

Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, and Ron Conway, a leading Silicon Valley angel investor, are helping finance the Giffords group and will co-host a fundraiser in San Francisco this week, an organizer said. Two wealthy Texas lawyers, Steve and Amber Mostyn, told news outlets Wednesday that they had given $1 million to the organization. Giffords was shot in the head two years ago in a mass shooting outside a supermarket in Tucson.

“The real challenge that these organizations will have is how much money will they be able to raise in order to effectively communicate their side of the story,” said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former top congressional aide. “Those who are in favor of keeping the status quo have massive resources that can do the same thing.”

While groups such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence have long lobbied for stricter gun laws, last month’s massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., has spurred many progressive organizations, millionaire donors and other activists to begin focusing on the issue.

White House working group

An administration working group led by Vice President Biden is preparing a set of gun-control proposals that could be announced by the end of this month, perhaps as part of Obama’s State of the Union address. Lawmakers say Congress could begin considering gun bills in two weeks.

Biden, after a meeting Wednesday with victims of gun violence and leaders of gun-safety organizations, vowed that the administration will take swift action.

“This is a problem that requires immediate attention,” Biden said. “I want to make clear that we’re not going to get caught up in the notion that, unless we can do everything, we’re going to do nothing.”

The White House is considering a wide range of legislative proposals, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, as well as universal background checks on gun buyers. Biden also said Wednesday that Obama may take executive actions that sidestep Congress, although he did not provide details.

Biden’s comments sparked an immediate and sharp backlash from Republicans. “The Founding Fathers never envisioned Executive Orders being used to restrict our Constitutional rights,” Rep. Jeff Duncan (S.C.) said in a statement. “We live in a republic, not a dictatorship.”

Biden’s meetings with interest groups to build consensus will continue Thursday, when he will meet with representatives of the NRA and other gun-owner groups as well as a representative from Wal-Mart, one of the nation’s leading gun retailers. The NRA, which has signaled its opposition to any new gun regulations, has suggested placing armed guards at all of the nation’s schools in reaction to the Connecticut shootings.

‘Gun-violence prevention’

Earlier this week, senior White House aides organized a conference call with a roster of private foundations, some of which are funding polls, public ed­ucation campaigns and other anti-gun-violence­ initiatives.

One of the groups was the Chicago-based Joyce Foundation, a major funder of gun-control programs that counted Obama as a board member from 1994 to 2002. Nina Vinik, director of the foundation’s anti-gun-violence initiative, said research suggests that the public is poorly informed about current gun laws.

“Most people assume that our gun laws are in fact much more expansive and stronger than in fact they are,” Vinik said.

Some of the groups plan to use television and newspaper advertisements to paint laws restricting guns as a mainstream, common-sense idea. Some advocates have also stopped calling their efforts “gun control,” preferring “gun-violence prevention” instead.

One objective is to drive a wedge between the NRA’s policy agenda and the views of a majority of its members, activists said. Mayors Against Illegal Guns commissioned a study last year by Republican pollster Frank Luntz that found that 74 percent of NRA members support requiring criminal background checks for anyone purchasing a gun.

“This isn’t a battle about going dollar for dollar with the NRA,” said Winnie Stachelberg, executive vice president at the Center for American Progress. “It’s about drawing attention to the fact that the NRA officials and lobbyists and the NRA membership are in completely different places. Exposing that gap is a critical component of that effort.”

Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) criticized New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's federal gun control push on Tuesday, advising the mayor that he should be more worried about gun violence in his own city than in North Dakota, the Grand Forks Herald reported.

""North Dakota continues to have one [of] the highest rates of gun ownership and lowest incidences of gun crime in the country,"" Heitkamp said in a statement. ""Yet New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg insists on taking gun-driven crime statistics in his city and from other major cities and trying to force those numbers into a narrative that just does not fit North Dakota.""

Heitkamp, who previously served as North Dakota's attorney general, added, ""I do not need someone from New York City to tell me how to handle crime in our state.""

Her statement came in response to the recent $12 million ad buy from Mayors Against Illegal Guns, pushing senators in key states -- including Heitkamp -- to support such gun control legislation as comprehensive background checks. Bloomberg, who co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns in 2006 and is personally financing the ad campaign, is spending roughly $156,000 in North Dakota.

""Frankly, there are far better uses for Mayor Bloomberg's $156,000 than buying ads attacking a way of life he clearly does not understand,"" Heitkamp wrote.

Bloomberg earlier defended the ad buy, saying that the campaign reflects the sentiments of most Americans. ""These ads bring the voices of Americans -- who overwhelmingly support comprehensive and enforceable background checks -- into the discussion to move senators to immediately take action to prevent gun violence,"" he said in a statement issued last week by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

According to survey data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, roughly 50.7 percent of North Dakotans own a firearm -- one of the highest rates in the country. Yet the state's annual gun homicide rate is below the national average, with less than 1.1 per 100,000 people dying from gun violence in North Dakota, compared to the national rate of 2.75 per 100,000.

Heitkamp attributed these figures to North Dakota's ""proud ... outdoor heritage,"" explaining that firearms owners in her state understand the rights and responsibilities that come with gun ownership.

""Gun ownership in North Dakota comes down to growing up in a culture where those rights come with an ingrained responsibility taught at a young age,"" Heitkamp argued.

""I wouldn't expect Mayor Bloomberg to follow my advice on how to run a major east coast city of over 8 million people, and I don't plan to follow his advice on what is best for North Dakotans,"" added Heitkamp, whose state has about 700,000 inhabitants.

This isn't the first ad campaign targeting Heitkamp's position on gun control. In January, less than a week after she was sworn in as senator, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence launched a series of ads attacking her pro-gun stance.

""No parent should have to send their children to school wondering if they will come home,"" that ad read. ""Shame on you, Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), for telling the country on Sunday that the Obama Administration's response to Newtown -- which may include universal background checks and a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines -- is 'extreme.'""

The coalition was responding to statements made by Heitkamp that the White House's gun control plans were ""way in extreme."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/19/gun-rights-rally-to-break-century-long-alamo-tradition/,2013-10-19 00:00:00,[],Gun rights rally to break century-long Alamo tradition,"This is how to make another gun rally in gun-friendly Texas stand out: Tell everybody to bring their rifles and shotguns to the Alamo, the state’s most popular attraction, which sits downtown in the country’s seventh-largest city. And be sure to invite the state’s gun-friendliest politician, who also happens to hold the keys to the historic site.

When the organizers of “Come and Take It San Antonio!” made plans for a display of long guns today, this setting seemed ideal but the event is now drawing attention for breaking a century-long tradition against public demonstrations at the shrine of Texas liberty, where Col. William Travis and 200 Texas defenders famously died in a siege with the Mexican army in 1836. Such public displays have usually been relegated to an adjacent plaza.

Some are asking whether a pro-gun group has gone too far in extolling firearms rights, a feat considered near impossible in Texas. And whether a politician may have been too willing to accommodate them.

“We certainly consider the Alamo our family cemetery,” said Lee Spencer White, president of the Alamo Defenders’ Descendants Association. “Our guys died there and we take it very seriously.”

Inside the weathered stone mission church where the Texans made their last stand, “You instantly become reverent,” she said. “You feel the sacrifice and the emotions of those who died there. You can’t help but leave feeling moved and changed forever.”

But rally organizers say the site fits their cause, protesting a San Antonio local ordinance they say impinges on firearms rights.

“We’re doing this to show that we’re not going to back down,” said Victoria Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Open Carry Texas, one of the groups behind the event.

The gun groups organized the rally after a confrontation with San Antonio police two months ago. Police threatened to arrest several activists who were carrying their rifles outside a Starbucks.

Texas law prohibits open carrying of handguns but has no similar restriction for long guns. The Texas penal code, however, does bar display of a “deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm.” A San Antonio ordinance restricts firearms in public parks or at political rallies.

“We are going to fight for our rights, and it’s not OK for police to just say whatever they want and make up the rules as they go along,” said Montgomery.

In late September, the gun rights groups got permission to use the Alamo from the Texas Land Commission.

The four-acre historical site downtown includes the small mission church, whose foundation was laid by the Spanish in 1744, other surviving buildings and artifacts including Davy Crockett’s desk. About 2.5 million people visit every year.

From 1905 to 2011, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas organization kept the church sacrosanct from events deemed inappropriate. But the state took control after allegations of mismanagement by the Daughters. The decision on the long gun protest rested with Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who as a legislator was known for carrying a pistol in his boot. The Marine veteran is running for lieutenant governor largely on a single-barrel platform of gun rights.

Patterson acknowledged his office had not developed rules on use of the mission. But he said he doesn’t think the restrictions should be extensive.

“Citizens who want to gather and exercise their First Amendment rights, who behave in a lawful manner, I’m not sure we have the lawful authority to say no, even if we wanted to,” he said Wednesday.

As for the long gun rally, Patterson, who as a senator wrote the state’s concealed handgun law, says he plans to explain to San Antonio city attorney afterward that the city’s ordinance is unconstitutional.

San Antonio officials disagree but say they anticipate no problems Saturday. “We are expecting it to be a peaceful gathering and within the limits of the law,” Police Chief William McManus said in an emailed statement.

Not all Alamo devotees object to the gun extravaganza. Stephen Hardin, a professor of history at McMurry University in Abilene, who has written extensively on the Alamo and spoke recently at a symposium sponsored by Patterson’s office, said the site is a natural rallying place.

“Free speech was one of the rights the defenders fought and died for,” Hardin wrote in an email. “Can you think of a better place for Texans to exercise their rights?”

But White, a descendant of George C. Jennings, who manned a cannon in the siege against Mexican General Santa Anna’s forces, sees this as an ominous step.

“You’re setting a precedent here,” she said. “Today it’s a gun rally. What is it going to be next month, next year?”"

And there are a lot. But as interesting as the stories are, they don't do us any good if we don't collect them in some more permanent way. So here's my first attempt at doing so. But to avoid going completely crazy, I'm limiting myself (with a few notable exceptions), to incidents from January 2013 only. Where possible, I've tagged each incident with the date on which the actual shooting took place, according to the linked stories.

Before we even get started, what is this all about? Does it mean you can't or shouldn't have guns? No, not by itself. But what it does mean is that people who start out with the best of intentions sometimes get themselves mixed up in some serious trouble, and often people die because of it. These are the stories you should think about every time you handle a weapon, or are near someone else who's handling one.

And yes, these stories have special relevance now that more and more people are carrying concealed weapons, often with the idea in mind that they're protecting both themselves and the community. It's also relevant to the question of whether or not we should be putting guns in our schools. Whether you're trained or not, experienced or not, or were raised around guns or not, where guns go, accidents follow. That's just statistics. You can do your best to prevent accidents, but everyone thinks they're a responsible gun owner, until something happens. Sometimes because you were kidding yourself. And sometimes although you think you did everything right.

But the mistakes are very often of the kind that cannot be taken back.

Before we begin with January's stories, here's some follow-up news on some prominent cases that actually happened in December:

12/08/12: No charges filed in accidental shooting of 7-year-old boy. On a trip with dad to the gun shop. Shot and killed in his safety seat in dad's truck, when the pistol everyone thought was unloaded inexplicably fired all by itself while sitting on the center console.

12/10/12: This one could've been prevented with a simple, ""Who's there? I have a gun!"" Which would have been answered with, ""Don't shoot, Grandpa! It's me!"" But instead, he shot first. Because he's a fucking ninja. Well, actually, he's the pastor of the local Seventh Day Adventist church. But whatevs.

12/28/12: Involuntary manslaughter charges, though, for the uncle who killed his 12-year-old nephew in a hunting accident. Seems the uncle didn't bother obtaining a hunting license, and skipped the mandatory hunting safety course. Wonder why they have those? Probably tyranny.

Now, new incidents from this month, beginning with the traditional woundings and deaths caused by New Year's celebratory gunfire:

1/01/13: Houston Co. man injured by celebratory New Year's gunshot

1/01/13: 67-year-old Laurie Eileen Eberhardt was sitting on a patio at the St. Pete Yacht Club watching the fireworks when a bullet struck her hand at about 12:08 AM

1/01/13: Police say celebratory gunfire a growing problem in Jacksonville after 8-year-old boy is shot in foot on New Year's Eve

1/01/13: 10-yo girl killed by celebratory gunfire to mark the New Year.

January's hunting accidents. I don't always tweet about these, because as tragic as they are, hunters know they can be shot. So many others of these accidents happen to people who really think things won't happen to them, and that puts them in a different category:

The Firearm Risk Protection Act, pushed by Rep. Carolyn Maloney and seven co-sponsors, follows efforts at the state level to create the controversial new kind of insurance for gun owners.

""For too long, gun victims and society at large have borne the brunt of the costs of gun violence,"" Maloney said in a written statement. ""My bill would change that by shifting some of that cost back onto those who own the weapons.""

The likelihood, though, of Maloney's bill gaining any traction is slim. Republicans control the House, and even states where Democrats have sizeable majorities have not approved the insurance idea.

Six states -- California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania -- have all introduced gun liability insurance legislation over the past few months. None has produced any results.

More On This...

In Illinois, the House rejected a measure 34-74 that would require people carrying concealed weapons to also carry $1 million in liability insurance. Chicago Democrat Kenneth Dunkin was behind the defeated bill. He said an insurance policy would cost between $500 to $2,000, but Illinois Republicans successfully argued the costs were too high for citizens exercising their constitutional right to carry a gun, and the bill was defeated.

Last week, a similar measure in Connecticut was withdrawn following a two-hour hearing on the issue. Connecticut's proposal would require firearm owners to maintain excess personal liability insurance and self-defense insurance.

In Maryland, a bill that sought mandatory firearm liability insurance for gun owners was also recently withdrawn.

Because there have been so many setbacks on state levels, many have argued that trying to pass a liability insurance mandate on a national level would be near impossible.

Still, Maloney maintains she won't back down from the fight.

""We have a long history of requiring insurance for high-risk products -- and no one disputes that guns are dangerous,"" she said in her written statement. ""While many individual states are debating this issue right now, it makes more sense for Congress to establish a national requirement to allow the insurance markets to begin to price the risks involved consistently nationwide.""

Maloney also supports proposed bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The push in Congress for a renewed assault weapons ban has faltered. Though it is expected to get a vote as an amendment to a broader gun control package, few expect it to pass. The debate in Congress lately has centered on whether lawmakers can agree to a system of near-universal background checks."

http://news.yahoo.com/texas-sd-governors-court-conn-gun-makers-201532123.html,,[],"Texas, SD governors court Conn. gun makers","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — The governors of Texas and South Dakota visited Connecticut on Monday to court gun manufacturers that have threatened to leave since the state passed tough new gun-control laws this year in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

While gun makers may be unlikely to leave behind their factories and skilled workforces, executives say Texas is an appealing location — and some said the out-of-state attention marked a stark contrast with a Connecticut governor they say has shown little regard for a local industry that dates to the Revolutionary War.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry shot at a firing range at Connecticut's venerable Colt Manufacturing Co., one of the plants he toured, and met privately with company owners and other businesses at a downtown Hartford restaurant. At a brief news conference afterward, the Republican offered a conservative policy blueprint in a state run by Democrats.

""Are your tax policies really in the best interest of your job creators?"" he asked. ""Is your regulatory climate one of which (that) really allows your citizens to be able to enjoy the freedoms that they can have or they should have or that they think they should have or are they going to relocate somewhere?""

Connecticut's Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, signed new gun restrictions into law in April, four months after 20 children and six educators were murdered by a lone gunman at a Newtown school.

Joe Bartozzi, senior vice president and general counsel at O.F. Mossberg & Sons, welcomed Perry's visit to the North Haven gun maker, which employs 270 workers in Connecticut and 400 in Texas. He contrasted Perry's interest in the business and the jobs it provides with what he called ""less than flattering remarks"" in recent months by U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy and Malloy about the gun industry.

Asked about the possibility of expanding in Texas, Bartozzi said, ""That would make more sense. That would be more logical for us.""

Story continues

The political climate in Connecticut is one of the factors, he said. He also said taxes and costs are higher in Connecticut.

Colt President and CEO Dennis Veilleux issued a statement saying Perry assured the company it would ""always be welcome in Texas.""

Mark T. Malkowski, president of Stag Arms in New Britain, said he's been in touch with Perry's office and met with the governor in Houston last month. He said he and Perry spoke about taxes, what Texas is doing ""to keep it a very friendly place for businesses"" and the cultural differences between Connecticut and Texas, which is perceived as less hostile to guns.

""There was nothing as much as a phone from our governor asking us to stay,"" he said.

Kelsey Pritchard, a spokeswoman for South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard, said the governor and state economic development officials are visiting Connecticut on Monday and Tuesday to meet with gun manufacturers.

Malkowski said the biggest obstacle to quitting Connecticut is that the company's 200 employees would have to uproot themselves and their families.

""That's the hardest part. The employees make up the business,"" he said.

Malloy, who welcomed Perry to Connecticut in an unannounced visit to the Texas governor's meeting in Hartford, said the gun issue is particularly sharp in Connecticut because of the killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School.

""I don't think he understands that kind of loss and how it's affected people in our state,"" Malloy said.

Legislation enacted in April adds more than 100 firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and bans the sale of magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

Perry said taxes and regulations are factors in decisions not only by gun manufacturers, but by pharmaceutical companies, financial firms and other businesses about where to locate.

Malloy sought to blunt Perry's thrust on jobs and industry. Connecticut's governor has made economic development a signature issue since taking office in January 2011, establishing a program consolidating tax credits to draw large employers and pushing for legislation promoting small business and bioscience jobs.

""Listen, we compete for every job and we're doing a pretty good job at it,"" he said.

Perry has poached in other states. He sought to talk up Texas for jobs in California's high tech, biotechnology, financial, insurance and film industries and urged Illinois employers to leave the state ""while there's still time.""

The Texas governor, who is set to visit New York during his trip to the Northeast, also has run ads mocking New York's ""new New York ads,"" saying the Empire State is a high-tax state that hasn't much changed.

In Connecticut, he tried to take the edge off his tough message.

""Sometimes it's a rough business. I get that,"" Perry said. ""But so is competition on an athletic field. I hope we can shake hands, realize that we're just competitors. We're all Americans first. ""

Illinois is the last state in the nation not to have some form of concealed carry on the books, but a federal appeals court overturned the state’s long standing ban in December and gave lawmakers until June 9 to come up with regulations to allow it.

""Don't let your constituents go off the cliff, this is a historic day for law abiding gun owners in this state,"" said sponsoring Rep. Brandon Phelps, D-Harrisburg.

Under the proposal, concealed weapons would be banned from numerous sites, such as CTA and Metra buses and trains, casinos, government buildings and stadiums. But lawmakers said the bill would allow people to carry concealed weapons in restaurants where alcohol is served but more than half of the sales are for food.

A five-year concealed weapons permit would be issued to applicants. Law enforcement could object, and an applicant could appeal to a seven-member board designed to have people with such credentials as former judges or FBI agents. A person would have to complete 16 hours of training before getting a gun.

A series of provisions were designed to prevent people with mental health problems from getting guns. ""We don't want to mentally ill people to have firearms, period,"" said Phelps, the House's main gun rights supporter and a major negotiator.

Attempts were made to allow gun owners to carry through different communities without getting hung up on a patchwork of local laws.

Chicago's ban on assault weapons would be kept intact, but towns that don’t already have a ban would be prevented from adopting them.

The Senate quickly passed the bill 45-12-1. The House vote was 89-28.

The bill needed three-fifths votes in both chambers because it would affect home-rule cities like Chicago.

""We worked really hard on this bill to come up with something that we think everybody can live with, but probably everybody won't be happy with,"" said sponsoring Sen. Gary Forby, D-Benton. ""But it's something we need to do.""

“We’re not there yet on this bill, not even close,” said Sen. Dan Kotowski, D-Park Ridge, who said the 16-hours of training required in the bill was not enough.

Gov. Pat Quinn's spokeswoman offered the administration's standard response when asked about the bill, saying Quinn would review it when it reaches his desk.

Democrats and Republicans got up to speak in favor in the Senate.

“This bill is for the common good of all citizens, those who live in our dense cities, those who live in our rural areas, it’s time to put this issue to rest,” said Sen. William Haine, D-Alton.

“We all know but for the Constitution and the federal court, we might not be here today,” said Sen. Bill Brady, R-Bloomington. “I think what’s most important is like 49 other states in the nation, the citizens of Illinois will enjoy a right and will become comfortable with because we crafted a good law, at least as a start.”

State lawmakers have wrestled over how to bridge the state's regional and philosophical divide between gun rights advocates and gun control proponents. In the latest version, both sides budget, and lawmakers indicated the city of Chicago and the National Rifle Association both registeried as neutral. But Chicago's anti-gun lawmakers still contended the bill was not strong enough even as other lawmakers wanted fewer restrictions.

""We got a bill everybody can live with,"" said Forby, the sponsor from Downstate Benton who has long fought for gun rights.

""Everybody agreed nobody liked"" the bill, Forby said, ""But it was something we had to do by July 9. ... Nobody wanted to go over the cliff.""

Attempts were made to allow gun owners to carry through different communities without getting hung up on a patchwork of local laws.

But Forby got peppered by lawmakers who worried that the legislation opened up the potential to allowing a person with a firearm owners identification card to have as many as 100 guns in his car trunk without violating laws.

Forby said he saw nothing illegal, prompting some lawmakers to shake their heads in disappointment.

Democratic Sen. Tony Munoz, a Chicago policeman, also questioned why the legislation would allow people to carry concealed weapons in places where more than half of the sales are for food.

Forby said a restaurant or bar owner also can put up a sign that says no guns are allowed, but Sen. Ira Silverstein, D-Chicago, said the option is ""ludicrous"" because it would be hard to know who was complying with the sign unless there were a metal detector at the door.

Forby parried that somebody always will break the law ""no matter what you do.""

Democratic Sen. Kim Lightford of Maywood contended the bill fails to give ""enough protections in violent situations.""

The elements of the bill came together in a meeting Thursday with Speaker Michael Madigan, who had pushed through a separate proposal.

The photograph depicted a familiar scene of a dusty street and squared wooden facades. But there was also the unexpected: A sign warning that carrying a firearm in town was “strictly prohibited.”

“The Wild West towns like Tombstone (and Dodge City) had the most restrictive gun laws in the nation,” Winkler said. “That is an example of how our understanding and our mythologizing about guns really has created a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings both of the nature of the right to bear arms and the history of gun control, and about American’s relationship with guns.”

Context, as we know, is crucial for any sort of political discussion, and Winkler and two other authors of books about guns and gun control provided plenty of it to more than 300 people in the basement of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at USC, the same room, coincidentally in which the late Rodney King spoke last year about his accidental role in the waves of violence that convulsed Los Angeles in 1992.

The consensus was that the fate of gun control is controlled by a small but dedicated minority of people, including the National Rifle Assn., which through its near single-minded focus on fighting gun restrictions has been able to produce far more influence on the political process than those who support gun control.

It could have been a depressingly timely subject, given the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., and the running gun battle last week between police and the presumed Boston Marathon bombers. But the panelists moved beyond the momentary arguments, with Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional scholar and founding dean of the UC Irvine law school, pointing out that of all the divisive political issues of the era, gun control is the only one rooted in the “enigmatic” phrasing of a constitutional right.

VIDEO: AUTHOR INTERVIEWS FROM FESTIVAL OF BOOKS

Despite polls that show wide support for many gun control measures, including the expansion of background checks that failed in the US. Senate last week, Chemerinsky said the NRA and its supporters have been able to exert their minority will.

“The question then to me becomes, how does the NRA come to have as much political power that it is in an absolute position to stop the Senate from adopting such an unobjectionable form of background checks,” said the author of “The Conservative Assault on the Constitution.”

Paul M. Barrett, assistant managing editor of Bloomberg Businessweek and author of “Glock: The Rise of America’s Gun,” argued that the current battles are rooted in political conservatism that began growing in the 1970s.

Winkler had earlier traced the rise of political conservatism and a near-libertarian view of gun laws within the NRA to a political coup that occurred during a 1977 national conference. As the leadership of the group was contemplating stepping back from politics and refocusing on the sporting nature of guns (from target shooting to hunting), he said, political conservatives descended on the meeting and wrested control of the group, redirecting it to the political theater.

To understand the NRA of today, Barrett argued, you have to understand the politics of the 1970s and 1980s, as urban violence exploded with the rise of crack cocaine and gangs, and the liberal response was to press for gun control. No matter how relatively modest proposals such as the expansion of background checks might seem, they are viewed by the gun-rights advocates “as the first step down the slippery slope” to seizing private guns, he said.

“That can be lampooned and ... has a paranoid overtone, but it’s not a lightly held view by millions of Americans,” Barrett said. “One of the reasons the gun debate seems to have tilted so far to the [right] ... is the inability of people on the other side of the argument to appreciate how deeply felt these fears are.”

As if to make the point, the last question from the audience was about whether the seizure of privately owned guns could make it easier to establish martial law, a question that was greeted with laugh in parts of the audience.

“While I don’t share those sentiments or anxieties, those sentiments and anxieties are held by a significant minority of the population,” Barrett said. “They are an element of the pro-gun movement that is very important to pay attention to.”

President Obama will promote his plan to battle gun violence on Monday in Minneapolis because that community is doing some of the things he wants to see nationally.

Minneapolis has launched a youth violence initiative that has seen some success; and sheriffs in Minnesota have worked to improve the state's background check system for gun buyers.

During his visit Monday, Obama will ""discuss with local leaders and law enforcement officials his comprehensive set of common sense ideas to reduce gun violence,"" the White House says.

The president has called for universal background checks, renewal of an assault weapons ban, and restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines, as well as new school safety and mental health programs.

The gun-control push comes in the wake of a series of mass shootings, including the Dec. 14 attack on an elementary school in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults.

Obama has vowed to promote his plan in appearances across the country.

Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau and Hennepin County Sheriff Richard Stanek were among the local law enforcement officials who met at the White House this week with Obama and Vice President Biden, who helped develop the White House plan.

""Minneapolis is a city that has taken important steps to reduce gun violence and foster a conversation in the community about what further action is needed,"" said a White House statement. ""President Obama will visit with members of the community about their experiences and discuss additional steps that can be taken at the federal level to reduce gun violence."""

The raw emotion of the background check amendment defeat played out in the Senate gallery just after Vice President Biden read the vote count in his capacity as Senate president.

“Shame on you!” at least two women were heard shouting.

As they were escorted from the Capitol, Patricia Maisch and Lori Haas said they shouted in anger. Maisch successfully knocked a large ammunition magazine out of the hands of Jared Loughner in Jan. 2011 after he shot former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and other bystanders.

“They are an embarrassment to this country, that they don’t have any compassion or care for people who have been taken brutally from their families,” Maisch said as officers attempted to remove her from the building. “I hate them,” she said of the senators.

“We’re sick and tired of the death in this country and these legislators stand up there and think it’s a bunch of numbers,” said Haas, whose daughter, Emily, was wounded in the April 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech.

“It’s a shame, it’s appalling, it’s disgusting,” she added.

The chief architects of the plan to expand the national gun background check system, Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) and Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.), acknowledged in interviews early Wednesday that their proposal lacked sufficient support.

After the vote, Toomey expressed regret, but said that it was time to move on.

“I did what I thought was the right thing for our country. I sought out a compromise position that I thought could move the ball forward on an important matter of public safety,” he said in a statement, adding later, “We have a lot of other very important issues to deal with such as getting the economy back on track, dealing with the debt ceiling and creating more jobs for Pennsylvanians.”

Before the voting began, Biden, who is leading the Obama administration's gun control effort, sounded quite frustrated with misinformation being spread by opponents to the bipartisan compromise Wednesday. Speaking during a “Google Hangout,” Biden reiterated that the proposal would not create or lead to the creation of a federal gun registry. “Nothing can be further from the truth,” he said.

Biden also dismissed suggestions that the measures would infringe upon people’s constitutional right to bear arms.

“There is no – zero – no infringement on the Second Amendment, not one single thing being proposed,” he said.

In the hours before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) also attempted to rally last-minute support for the bill by issuing an ominous warning to his colleagues.

“If tragedy strikes again…if innocents are gunned down in a classroom, theater or restaurant, I would have trouble living with myself as a senator, as a husband, a father, or grandfather and friend, knowing that I didn’t do everything in my power to prevent that incident,” Reid said.

Shortly before the vote, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he would support the background check plan, saying that while he was a staunch defender of Second Amendment rights, the bipartisan proposal is “not overly burdensome or unconstitutional.”

“Is this a perfect solution? No. will it prevent all future acts of gun violence? Of course not,” McCain said. “Would it have prevented the most recent acts of gun violence? In all likelihood, no. But it is reasonable, and it is my firm conviction that it is constitutional.”

In addition to McCain and Toomey, the amendment was supported by Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mark Kirk (Ill.) The Democrats who opposed the measure were Sens. Max Baucus (Mont.), Mark Begich (Alaska), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Mark Pryor (Ark.) The four Democrats face difficult reelections in rural states with strong gun cultures.

Democrats, fearful of lacking even just 50 votes in support of the background check proposal, called upon Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) to return to Washington for the votes.

Lautenberg has been absent in recent months as he’s battled the after-effects of cancer, but came to Washington Wednesday for the votes. Democratic aides had said that they would only need Lautenberg if gun legislation appeared in doubt.

In a dramatic moment, Lautenberg was brought to the floor by wheelchair. When a clerk called his name, Lautenberg shouted “Aye!” Democratic senators applauded, as did some people watching in the balcony above.

Reid said he would vote for the assault weapon ban proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) “because maintaining a law and order is more important than satisfying conspiracy theories, who believe in black helicopters and false flags. I’ll vote for the ban because saving the lives of police officers – young and old – and innocent civilians – young and old, is more important than preventing imagined tyranny.”

Reid’s decision to support the ban is a notable reversal because he has maintained a close relationship with the National Rifle Association, which strongly opposes it, and because Reid had previously voiced doubts about the Feinstein plan.

In addition to the background check and assault weapons amendments, senators were also voting on a Democratic proposal to limit the size of ammunition magazines. Democrats expected the proposal would fail.

Also under consideration were a bipartisan amendment that would make minor changes to the bill’s provisions regarding gun trafficking and a bipartisan plan to provide more funding for mental health programs.

Four GOP proposals were also being considered. The first, by Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and Ted Cruz (Tex.), was a package of Republican proposals that would improve the mental health classifications used in the background check reporting system. It was expected to include a proposal Grassley demanded that would prevent abuses like those reported in Operation Fast and Furious, a botched effort to track illegal weapons activity along the U.S.-Mexican border.

Another GOP amendment from Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) would have allowed gun owners who receive a state-issued permit to carry a concealed weapon to take that weapon into other states that issue such permits. Only Illinois and the District of Columbia do not issue concealed-carry permits.

An amendment by Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) addressed special concerns of veterans. For several years, Burr has sponsored a ""Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act."" The legislation, backed enthusiastically by Grassley, was written as a response to Department of Veterans Affairs policy of submitting the names of veterans to the FBI who have a fiduciary appointed to manage their financial affairs because of mental problems.

The referral meant that the veterans were placed on the background check list of those who could be denied weapons permits. Burr's legislation specified that only veterans designated as a danger to themselves or others would be placed on such a list.

Finally, an amendment co-authored by Sens. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) would authorize suicide prevention and related mental health programs for young people.

Obama: 'A pretty shameful day for Washington'

Read transcript of Obama's remarks on gun votes

The Fix: What failure of the Manchin-Toomey plan means"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/15/nra-video-obama_n_2483118.html,2013-01-15 00:00:00,"['Deputy Managing Editor', 'Breaking News']",NRA Video Criticizes Obama For Stance On Armed Guards In Schools,"A video released by the National Rifle Association on Tuesday sharply criticizes President Obama for his skepticism about placing armed guards in schools, calling the president an ""elitist hypocrite"" for allowing the Secret Service to protect his daughters.

""Are the president's kids more important than yours?"" the ad asks. ""Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school?""

The ad continues: ""Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he is just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security.""

The video, part of the NRA's new ""Stand and Fight"" campaign, comes in response to comments Obama made on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" last month.

""I am skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools, and I think the vast majority of the American people are skeptical that that somehow is going to solve our problem,"" Obama said. ""And, look, here's the bottom line. We're not going to get this done unless the American people decide it's important.""

President Obama is set to announce his proposals for curbing gun violence on Wednesday. According to a Washington Post report, White House officials have considered funding for more police officers in public schools as part of those recommendations.

While placing armed guards in school remains controversial, some polling has showed support for the idea in the weeks since the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School last month. A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found two-thirds of Virginia voters in favor of increased police presence at schools, while 41 percent of respondents in a Washington Post-ABC poll released Tuesday said that having armed guards in schools would do more to curb violence on campuses than stricter gun measures would.

Watch the NRA video above.

UPDATE: The NRA responded to criticism of the ad Wednesday morning. """"Whoever thinks the ad is about President Obama's daughters are missing the point completely or they're trying to change the subject,"" said a spokesman."

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",McManus: Sadder but wiser pols,"President Obama took a posse of Republican senators to dinner last week, and this week he’s giving Congress the unusual courtesy of no fewer than four presidential visits to Capitol Hill.

Can a flurry of presidential schmoozing change Washington from a bitterly polarized battlefield into a haven of bipartisan cooperation? Don’t hold your breath.

“We’re very far apart,” an Obama aide told me Tuesday, stating the obvious in the wake of the budget proposal from fiscal hawk Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). The GOP wish list includes deep cuts in healthcare, education and defense spending, but no tax increases. The Democratic budget, expected this week, includes more modest spending cuts and almost $1 trillion in tax increases.

So why the charm offensive? The president’s yen for the pleasure of Congress’ company is the byproduct of an important change: Both sides in the fight are older, sadder and wiser.

Advertisement

That alone could mean that a “grand bargain” over spending and taxes is more possible this year than any time since 2010.

Republicans have finally noticed that they lost the presidential election (including Ryan, who was their choice for vice president) and that most voters didn’t choose their severely conservative policies. At best, Ryan noted in his budget announcement, the voters opted for “divided government. So this year, we have to make it work.”

Democrats have suffered a comeuppance too: Voters didn’t rise up in anger against the automatic “sequester” of government spending that kicked in March 1, as liberals hoped they would. That may be because most of the sequester’s effects haven’t been felt, but the short-term result was to make Obama and his party look silly — and, more important, to knock some points off the president’s popularity.

There’s been gradual movement toward the center on the substance of the budget as well as the politics. Republicans still oppose tax increases, but some senators have acknowledged that they’ll have to accept revenue increases to make a deal. And Obama has been more explicit than before about his willingness to cut future spending on Medicare and Social Security, bitter pills for liberals. The more often the president repeats that message to Democrats, the more skeptical Republicans believe he might mean it.

Finally, leaders on both sides know how to get to an agreement — or, more precisely, how not to get there — because they’ve tried so many routes before.

The short answer: Negotiations between Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) won’t work; that method failed miserably in 2011. Negotiations with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) produced a short-term deal in 2012 but probably won’t work now because McConnell, who faces a potential GOP primary challenge next year, has been adamant in his opposition to new taxes.

That leaves only this way forward: a bipartisan negotiation among senators who want to negotiate, like the “Gang of Six” who produced a budget compromise in 2011 (a deal, it must be noted, that led nowhere at the time).

“The only way we’ve been able to get anything done over the last two years is when the Senate passes something on a bipartisan basis and sends it to the House,” the Obama aide noted. Only then has Boehner allowed his House GOP majority to divide and contribute to passing legislation. Once some senators compromise, the cost of obstruction in the House increases.

That’s why Obama kicked off his charm offensive with senators — and not just any senators but Republicans who were already interested in seeing whether a deal is possible, including some fiscal moderates (Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire) and influential fiscal hawks (Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma). If it didn’t change the landscape, it may have detoxified the air.

“I think the president’s tremendously sincere. I don’t think this is just a political change in tactic,” Coburn said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “I think he actually would like to solve the problems of the country…. He’s moving in the right direction. I’m proud of him for doing it.” When was the last time you heard a Republican say something like that about Obama?

Obama needs the vote of confidence. After the failure of his negotiations to avert the sequester, three recent polls showed him in negative territory, with more voters disapproving than approving. Obama blames Republicans for the impasse, but no president ever wins by appearing powerless.

On top of that, Obama is hoping to pass new legislation on immigration and gun control. ""[If] we can build these bonds of trust, that will be useful on these other issues,” the Obama aide told me, even if a budget deal remains out of reach.

Advertisement

And despite Coburn’s disclaimer, there’s the ultimate political calculation: Who will voters blame?

“There’s a tendency to say, whenever agreement isn’t reached, that it’s both sides’ fault,” the aide said. “If we reach out and we put entitlements on the table and are serious about it, and the Republicans still can’t get to ‘yes,’ there is no other answer left other than Republicans just can’t get to ‘yes.’”

So don’t get too romantic about all the wining and dining in Washington. It won’t mean an end to the battles; it’s more a cease-fire while both sides warily regroup. But it’s better than nothing, and a lot better than everyone going home hungry.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court weighs whether to hear case on guns in public,"WASHINGTON — While Congress debates proposals for tighter gun regulation, the Supreme Court is weighing whether to consider striking down state laws that strictly limit who can carry a gun in public.

When the justices ruled in 2008 and 2010 that the 2nd Amendment gave people a right to keep firearms in their homes, it did not address whether they had a right to carry weapons outside the home.

Gun rights advocates have asked the court to strike down New York’s law allowing officials to deny “concealed carry” permits to gun owners unless they can show a “special need for self-protection.” They want the justices to rule that the 2nd Amendment gives law-abiding gun owners a right to be armed on the streets. An announcement from the court on whether it will hear the case could come Monday.

Justice Antonin Scalia, in his 5-4 majority opinion in the 2008 Heller case striking down a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia, described the 2nd Amendment as creating a “right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.”

Citing Scalia’s words, gun rights advocates have mounted challenges to laws in seven states that routinely deny permits to gun owners who wish to carry loaded or unloaded guns with them. Typically, these laws say the gun owner must show a “proper cause” or “good cause” to obtain a permit. California, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York have such laws.

“This case could be more important than Heller,” said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler. “The biggest unanswered question about the 2nd Amendment is whether people have a right to carry guns in public.”

In December, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago struck down the Illinois law, the nation’s strictest. That law was understood to bar all but police and security guards from carrying guns in public.

Judge Richard Posner said the Supreme Court had described the 2nd Amendment as conferring “a right to bear arms for self-defense,” and if so, being armed is “as important outside the home as inside.” The decision gave state lawmakers six months to craft a new law that would allow the carrying of guns in public in a way that is “consistent with public safety.”

In November, however, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld that state’s law, which is often described as the nation’s second strictest. It authorizes gun owners to obtain permits to carry weapons in public, but only if they can convince a county official that they have “a special need” to be armed. Evidence of “good moral character” is not enough, nor is living or working in a “high-crime area,” the judges said.

The appeals court rejected a constitutional claim brought by Alan Kachalsky and several other residents of Westchester County who were turned down for permits. The 2nd Amendment does not “call into question the state’s traditional authority to extensively regulate handgun possession in public,” the appeals court said.

Advertisement

Attorney Alan Gura, who won the 2nd Amendment rulings in the case from District of Columbia and the 2010 case from Chicago, appealed the New York case to the high court. He says the New York decision made the right to bear arms “practically worthless.”

“If it is a constitutional right, you don’t have to prove to the government that you are entitled to exercise your rights,” he said.

Advertisement

If the justices vote to take up the appeal, the Kachalsky case will be heard in the fall.

But Winkler, the UCLA law professor, and others think the court may choose to put off a decision on the reach of gun rights. “Some of the justices may be hesitant to take a 2nd Amendment case while nerves are still raw from Newtown,” Winkler said.

The December school shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and six adults has forced Congress to take another look at the nation’s gun laws, and last week the Senate voted to begin debate on expanding the background checks required for purchasing a handgun.

If the justices deny the appeal in the New York case, it will not set a legal precedent, but it will be seen by some as allowing state and local officials leeway in deciding who can carry a gun in public.

But the continuing litigation will almost surely force the court to decide the issue in the next few years. In December, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard challenges to the concealed-carry laws from two California counties and from Hawaii. Illinois Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan has until May to decide whether to ask the Supreme Court to review the 7th Circuit decision striking down the state’s ban on carrying guns in public.

david.savage@latimes.com"
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-02-22/news/chi-concealed-carry-illinois-20130222_1_appeals-court-concealed-carry-lisa-madigan,2013-02-22 00:00:00,['Ray Long'],Court to Lisa Madigan: No rehearing on concealed-carry guns ruling,"SPRINGFIELD — A divided federal appeals court today rejected Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s request for a rehearing on the case where the state has been ordered to allow citizens to carry guns in public.

Madigan made the request following the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision in December that gave Illinois 180 days to put together a law that would allow concealed weapons in Illinois.

Madigan has not made a decision on whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, said Maura Possley, Madigan spokeswoman.

In a statement, the attorney general encouraged state lawmakers to write a new law that fits within the parameters of the initial decision calling for concealed carry in Illinois. And she sought to explain why she went forward with the request to have a hearing by all judges in the 7th Circuit, a move known as “en banc.”

“Although the 7th Circuit rarely grants rehearing en banc, it was important to ask the full court to reconsider its opinion,” the Madigan statement said. “Significantly, in today’s decision, four of the 7th Circuit judges have provided a clear framework to guide the legislature in drafting a new law. With the 180-day deadline still in place, it is critical that the legislature continue to work to enact a law that will protect public safety.”

She has 90 days to appeal the original decision.

The appeals court action officially rejected Madigan’s request for a rehearing by the full court, but the denial came with a stinging dissent from four of the nine members of the appeals court who reviewed the matter. The original order came down from a three-member panel that also had a split vote.

The arguments made in the dissent, written by Judge David Hamilton, could bolster Madigan’s cause if she appeals to the nation’s high court.

“The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether .. the individual right to keep and bear arms at home under the Second Amendment extends beyond the home,” Hamilton wrote.

Illinois is the only state in the nation that does not allow citizens to carry weapons in public in some form.

Hamilton’s dissent also noted the ruling that called for Illinois to allow concealed carry is the “first decision by a federal court of appeals striking down legislation restricting the carrying of arms in public.”

He wrote that three major points are worthy of consideration by the full appellate court rather than simply the three-member panel:

*Whether to extend the right to bear arms outside the home and into the public sphere, a matter that “presents issues very different from those involved in the home itself, which is all the Supreme Court decided” in a case currently viewed as the law of the land.

*How to handle what the panel did not decide. The three-member panel left Illinois a “good deal of constitutional room for reasonable public safety measures concerning public carrying of firearms.”

*How to proceed in future decisions about laws that are more narrowly tailored and any state interests that justify some restrictions on rights.

“Where the law is genuinely in doubt, as it is likely to remain for some time under the Second Amendment, a trial court can do a great service by ensuring the development of a thorough and complete record that provides a reliable, accurate factual foundation for constitutional adjudication,” Hamilton wrote. “The federal courts are likely to do a better job of constitutional adjudication if our considerations are based on reliable facts rather than hypothesized and assumed facts.”

Destini's sister, Janay McFarlane, 18, was the victim of the very thing that the President was condemning at Hyde Park Academy in Chicago.



McFarlane, of the 8900 block of South Lowe Avenue, was visiting friends and family in North Chicago when she was shot on her way to a store in the northern suburb, her family said.



She was pronounced dead at 11:30 p.m., shortly after suffering a single gunshot wound to her head, according to the Lake County Coroner's office.



North Chicago Police officials did not return calls for comment Saturday.



Angela Blakely, the mother of both girls, said that the family had been anticipating the President's visit to the school where Destini is a freshman.



Leading up to the visit, McFarlane frequently mentioned the recent death of Hadiya Pendleton, 15, whose own shooting death a mile from the Obama's home spurred the President's visit.



""It's terrible, it's terrible the only thing I can remember is my daughter telling me, 'Mommy, it's so sad about Hadiya. That makes no sense,'"" Blakely said. ""She always asked me a lot of questions about death.""



Blakely said that McFarlane was still trying to make sense of the violence that claimed Pendleton's life. She kept questioning why someone so innocent could die from violence.



McFarlane, who attended Hyde Park Academy before she became pregnant with her son Jayden — 3-months-old — later transferred to an alternative school and was set to graduate in June. She was excited that her younger sister was able to attend Obama's speech.



Destini said that during the days before the President arrived to Chicago, her sister would come by and talk to her about the visit. Destini said she last spoke to her sister on Thursday night before the younger girl went to sleep.



""She was like 'Just tell me how it's going to be.' She was excited for me,"" said Destini. "" (The violence) was really wracking her because she was talking to my momma about Hadiya.""



Destini said she was sitting on a bench about two rows behind the President on stage listening as he spoke about gun violence.



""I could relate to it because that's been happening to a lot of people,"" said Destini.



The speech resonated even more when her family got the call from McFarlane's father in North Chicago, who told Destini that her sister was dead, she said.



""It was like real painful,"" said Destini, her voice choking back tears.



Since President Obama's speech on Friday, two people have been killed and six injured by guns in Chicago.

This heartfelt conviction has surfaced lately in state legislation that attempts to nullify federal gun regulations. For the nullifiers, and many others, the broadest possible right to bear arms is purportedly enshrined in the 2nd Amendment and recognized in the Supreme Court case Heller vs. District of Columbia.

Advertisement

And yet, no matter how prevalent or fervently held, the opinion that the Bill of Rights supports and the high court acknowledges an absolute right to gun ownership is just plain wrong.

The language of the 2nd Amendment is quite clear: “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” As the minority in the Heller decision argued, and more than a century of judicial precedent at the federal level established, the right to bear arms was not an inherent right of citizenship but rather a right that derived from service in the militia.

The historical context in which these words were crafted clarifies what was in James Madison’s mind when he wrote them. In 1787-88, seven of the states that ratified the proposed Constitution did so on the condition that Congress give consideration to adding several amendments if and when it went into effect. These states proposed 124 amendments, none of which mentioned the right to bear arms but several of which mentioned the fear of a standing army.

When Madison sat down to write what became the Bill of Rights in the summer of 1789, those 124 proposed amendments served as the basis for his deliberations. He distilled from them an essence of 12 amendments, subsequently reduced by the states to 10. The 2nd Amendment represented Madison’s attempt to respond to the fears of a standing army by assuring that national defense would reside in the states and in militias, not at the federal level in a professional army. The right to bear arms derived from the need to assure that state militia could perform its essential mission.

Advertisement

All this was what constitutional scholars call “settled law” until Heller, in which the high court ruled that the right to bear arms, despite the language of the 2nd Amendment and the historical context of its creation, existed independent of service in the militia. Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion is a tour de force of legalistic legerdemain, a lengthy journey through English common law, colonial charters, state constitutions and obscure 19th century court cases. Given Scalia’s judicial philosophy as an “originalist” — meaning he believes his opinions should be guided by the original intent of the framers — his failure to assess Madison’s motives in drafting the 2nd Amendment is strange, much like a devout Christian explaining his faith without mentioning Jesus.

But even Scalia, fully aware of the legal precedents he was overturning, saw fit to insert the following caveats near the end of his opinion:

Advertisement

“Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited…. Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.”

These caveats create a crack through which significant gun control legislation might flow. Indeed, expanded background checks and limits on automatic weapons, the key provisions in the post-Sandy Hook gun legislation debated (and defeated) by Congress earlier this year, fit comfortably within this space.

But gun control advocates need to be realistic. The Heller decision, no matter how misguided, is itself “settled law,” and the current composition of the Supreme Court will defeat any challenge to its sweeping, if limited, mandate. In addition, Congress is demonstrably hogtied by the National Rifle Assn., and even though many states (Colorado, Connecticut and New York among them) have tightened gun ownership laws since the massacres in Newtown, Aurora and Tucson, another half a dozen are trying the nullification gambit.

Given all this, the only alternative is to go back to “the people” themselves, where there remains good reason to believe a clear majority wants sensible reform at odds with the agenda of the NRA and the nullifiers. Remember: As 2013 began, an astonishing 89% of voters, including 75% of NRA members, were in favor of expanded background checks, and sizable majorities favored a ban on sales of semiautomatic weapons. Months later, polls still find most Americans are in favor of checks, “assault rifle” bans and restrictions on who is allowed to purchase guns.

The terms of a national discussion would no doubt include the gun violence tragedies we’ve faced, but it should also focus on the legal core of the gun rights issue: the 2nd Amendment and the Heller decision. These two tools, so often used to fight gun control, can and should be used to affect reasonable reform.

The intent of the founders needs to be heard and understood. The men who hammered out the Constitution, argued for its ratification and underlined our liberties with the Bill of Rights, would urge us to think about the issue this way: How do we balance the right to bear arms against the collective security of the American people?

Framed in this fashion, we can all come together as fellow citizens to discuss in a sensible rather than strident tone where the line needs to be drawn between our rights and our responsibilities.

All that’s required is that we channel our inner James Madisons, and even our inner Scalias. There is no unlimited right to bear arms — on that these two men agree, and so should we.

The lukewarm response in the Senate to Obama's highly anticipated anti-gun violence plan portends an uphill climb for the legislation. And it underscores how, as the president's backers prepare to launch a veritable campaign to promote the plan, they will be pressuring members of their own party as much as reluctant Republicans.

No Democrat in the Senate came out against Obama's gun plan. But several appeared to be on the fence or noncommittal, even as the president's allies in the House cheered the package as a long-sought solution to America's gun violence problem.

""We must find a way to balance our Second Amendment rights with the challenges of mental illness, criminal behavior and the safety of our schools and communities,"" Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said in a statement, noting Louisiana's tradition of hunting, target shooting and gun collecting. She said she would give the proposals ""serious consideration.""

The president on Wednesday called for a new and stronger assault-weapons ban as well as a 10-round cap on magazines and universal background checks. The last assault-weapons ban expired in 2004 amid questions about its effectiveness and political considerations. The shocking mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., has renewed interest in seeking a stricter crackdown on weapons that do the most damage -- yet more than a decade later, lawmakers remain leery about the perception of infringing on Second Amendment rights.

Many of the Democrats voicing concern are up for re-election in 2014. A total of 20 Democratic seats are up in the next cycle -- 22 when special elections are included.

Among those senators is Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, who has parted with the president before on energy and other issues.

He said he was ""pleased"" with Obama's call for an increase in mental health services, but said ""there is no quick fix when it comes to keeping our families and communities safe.""

""We must make smart investments to increase our safety while ensuring American's Second Amendment rights are protected,"" he said.

Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Sen. Max Baucus in Montana have also declined to take a position on the president's proposals.

Even Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who is considered to have a pro-gun rights record, said only that the chamber would ""consider"" the legislation.

""The tragedy at Sandy Hook was just the latest sad reminder that we are not doing enough to protect our citizens -- especially our children -- from gun violence and a culture of violence, and all options should be on the table moving forward,"" he said.

House Speaker John Boehner similarly did not take a position on the plan after Obama announced it Wednesday.

One lawmaker to watch is Sen. Al Franken in Minnesota. Considered among the most liberal members of the Senate, Franken nevertheless represents a state with a strong gun-rights culture and one where both parties are well-represented - he is up for re-election in 2014.

His office scrambled on Thursday to clarify an article which suggested he was holding back on endorsing an assault-weapons ban.

In a carefully worded statement, Franken said he's ""always supported the Second Amendment rights of Minnesotans to own firearms for collection, protection, and sport. But I also think we need to find a balance between those rights and the safety of our children and our communities.""

He noted he co-sponsored legislation to ban large magazines and supports ""the principle that we should reinstate a ban on assault weapons.""

Franken, though, did not endorse any specific assault weapons ban -- like one being introduced by Senate colleague Dianne Feinstein of California -- and stressed that he would ""carefully review any proposal to do that."""
http://news.yahoo.com/newtown-residents-upset-nra-robocalls-110326644.html,,[],Newtown residents upset about NRA robocalls,"NEWTOWN, Conn. (AP) — Some residents of the Connecticut community devastated by December's school shooting said they're outraged over robocalls they've received from the National Rifle Association only three months after a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Newtown residents said the automated calls from the NRA began last week and urge people to tell their state legislators to oppose gun control proposals. Some also said they received postcards from the NRA supporting gun owners' rights.

""It's ridiculous and insensitive,"" Newtown resident Dan O'Donnell told Hartford-area NBC affiliate WVIT-TV, one of several media organizations to report about the robocalls. ""I can't believe an organization would be so focused on the rights of gun owners with no consideration for the losses this town suffered.""

A message seeking comment was left Monday at the NRA's headquarters in Fairfax, Va.

Like Congress and other state legislatures, Connecticut's General Assembly has been considering gun control measures in the wake of the school shootings, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The NRA strongly opposes many gun control proposals including an assault weapons ban, saying government officials should better enforce existing gun laws and not impede on people's Second Amendment rights.

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, has said his organization supports getting the records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent and dangerous into the background check system for gun dealers and beefed up penalties for illegal third-party purchases and gun trafficking.

Shortly after the Newtown shooting, LaPierre also called for armed security guards in schools.

A 20-year-old gunman killed 26 students and educators and himself at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, after having shot his mother to death at their Newtown home.

Another Newtown resident, Christopher Wenis, told The Huffington Post that he received three of the NRA's robocalls last week.

""I've got a 5-year-old son who went to preschool on the Sandy Hook Elementary School campus,"" Wenis said. ""And this was a really hard week for me on a lot of levels. These calls were the very last thing I needed."""

USA TODAY

Incident happened at the Blue Mesa Grill in Arlington%2C Texas

Founder of mothers group says the women were holding a private meeting%2C not a rally

Open Carry Texas contingent%2C which included men%2C women and children%2C was armed with about two dozen semi-automatic rifles

The sudden appearance of about 40 armed men outside a Dallas-area restaurant this weekend was the latest confrontation between an open-carry gun-rights group and a mothers group advocating gun control that was meeting inside.

Police monitored the incident at the Blue Mesa Grill in Arlington, Texas, but took no action because it is legal to carry long guns openly in Texas.

""We are aware that a group did gather in a shopping area in Arlington Saturday,"" Tiara Ellis Richard of the Arlington Police office of communication said in an e-mail to USA TODAY. ""Officers were notified and arrived at the location. There were no issues that we are aware of, and no arrests occurred.""

One of four women who were meeting Saturday tried to file a police complaint on Monday but failed because she was told that no law had been violated, a spokeswoman for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense said Monday.

Shannon Watts, founder of the national gun control organization, said the mothers were holding a private meeting — not a rally — at the restaurant. She founded her group in the wake of the killings in Newtown, Conn.

Watts, whose organization is based in Indianapolis, said she was not at the restaurant at the time but was speaking on behalf of the four mothers, including a school teacher, who wanted to remain anonymous.

The Open Carry Texas (OCT) contingent, which included men, women and children, were armed with about two dozen semi-automatic rifles, which are classified as long guns in Texas and can be legally carried openly.

The two groups have been at odds since the mothers group successfully lobbied Starbucks to ban the open carrying of weapons in its coffee shops.

In April, a group of armed men also showed up at an MDA gun-control rally in Indianapolis, Watts said.

""We were surrounded by armed men, including some openly carrying loaded semi-automatic rifles,"" Watts said. ""Many of our moms had children with them. Unfortunately this is not a unique situation — it's happened in many states, including Indiana, Ohio, Oregon, Michigan and now Texas. If open carry is allowed, our rallies are often attended by armed protesters.""

In the Arlington incident, Watts said, the OCT apparently learned of the meeting through Facebook.

""They (the mothers) were sitting in the restaurant and all of a sudden saw cars pull up and these people were getting out of cars and pulling semi-automatic rifles out of their trunks,"" Watts said.

Kory Watkins, who organized the protests, told National Review's Charles C. W. Cooke that ""we were just out there peacefully assembling.""

""We walked down the street, away from where they were, and took a couple of pictures,"" he said. ""People were pulling over and honking and all that good stuff. When we were in the parking lot, one of them called us an (expletive) but that was it.""

Watts said the patrons of the Blue Mesa Grill were ""terrified.""

""They felt like in an armed ambush and had no idea why it was taking place,"" Watts said. She said one mom went from table to table ""to explain what was going on.""

Chris Barton, the CFO of Blue Mesa Grill, said that the manager called 911 at 11:35 a.m., shortly after the armed group arrived.

""When the manager called, he told them (the police dispatcher) what was going on,"" Barton said. ""They said that if they are having a peaceful demonstration, they are within their legal rights.""

He said the police did arrive as the group was leaving the restaurant area to walk to a nearby Hooters.

Watts said, however, that police told them on Monday that officers were already on the scene, keeping an eye on the incident.

The mothers group posted a photo online of the armed men outside the restaurant.

Open Carry Texas, however, reposted the same photo, added their own photo that was taken around the same time and included a message:

Many anti-gun groups have been posting this picture on their pages accusing these peaceful protesters of bullying and harassing members at their anti-gun rally. From this point of view, it looks like the gun owners are ready to confront someone. In reality, the peaceful gun owners were posing for a photo. Both pictures were taken at the same time, but one is good for anti-gun PR. Don't trust anything you see from the anti-gun pages.

Open Carry Texas says on its Facebook page that its purpose is to educate Texans about their right to openly carry rifles and shotguns in a safe manner and to ""condition Texans to feel safe around law-abiding citizens that choose to carry them.""

It also seeks to pass less-restrictive open-carry laws, especially pistols, which cannot be openly carried legally in Texas, and to foster a cooperative relationship with police ""with an eye towards preventing negative encounters.""

Kellye Bowman, a Houston activist with Moms Demand for Action, said her group is ""enemy No. 1"" to the open-carry groups.

She said the incident in Arlington was ""to confront"" and that ""there was no mistake what their intent was.""

Bowman said the Open Carry Texas group has been very high profile in recent months, including holding an unprecedented rally in front of the Alamo.

On Sunday, an open-carry group walked through a residential area of Kennedale, Texas, near Arlington, videotaping their interaction with a police officer. The group then posted the incident on YouTube, including their contention that they are not obliged to give their ID to police."

“As the father of four young children, I was deeply saddened by the murder of innocent kids at Sandy Hook. In the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, I expressed my hope that President Obama and our elected leaders would take a sober look at how we can prevent such heinous murders in the future. Doing so would require addressing the underlying causes of these evil acts, and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill without curtailing the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. “Nothing the President is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook. President Obama is targeting the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence. Rolling back responsible citizens’ rights is not the proper response to tragedies committed by criminals and the mentally ill. Making matters worse is that President Obama is again abusing his power by imposing his policies via executive fiat instead of allowing them to be debated in Congress. President Obama’s frustration with our republic and the way it works doesn’t give him license to ignore the Constitution. “Guns are not the problem; criminals with evil in their hearts and mentally ill people prone to violence are. Rather than sweeping measures that make it harder for responsible, law-abiding citizens to purchase firearms, we should focus on the root causes of gun violence and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. “As a strong defender of the 2nd Amendment, I will oppose the President’s attempts to undermine Americans’ constitutional right to bear arms.”

Weld County, Colo., Sheriff John Cooke, left, with El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa, center right, and other sheriffs standing behind him, speaks during a news conference at which he announced that 54 Colorado sheriffs are filing a federal civil lawsuit against two gun control bills passed by the Colorado Legislature, in Denver, Friday, May 17 2013. (Photo: AP)

In the wake of the tragedy in Aurora, Colorado passed some of the strictest gun control measures in the country.

But in recent months, an overwhelming 55 of the state's 62 county sheriffs have joined a lawsuit aiming to block the measures.

""These bills do absolutely nothing to make Colorado a safer place to live, to work, to play or to raise a family,"" Weld County Sheriff John Cooke explained at a recent press conference. ""Instead these misguided, unconstitutional bills will have the opposite effect because they greatly restrict the right of decent, law-abiding citizens to defend themselves, their families and their homes.""

Sheriff Terry Maketa of El Paso County is one of the opposing sheriffs, and he explained on TheBlaze TV Wednesday how the public was ""duped"" into supporting overly vague legislation banning high-capacity magazines and requiring background checks.

Maketa says they believe the laws are unenforceable, but also violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments.

After explaining the tactics used to pass the bills that essentially ""eliminated all public input,"" Maketa reiterated that it's clearly an ""overreaching step"" for politicians to claim law enforcement supports stricter gun control.

When asked by Pat Gray whether he and other sheriffs are ""getting flak"" for standing against the stricter measures, Maketa replied that it's the ""exact opposite.""

""I would say the communications I've received are 99% in favor,"" he added.

""I think Colorado is the epicenter of this battle, and 55 Colorado sheriffs have drawn a line in the sand and said 'We're not going to tolerate it,' he concluded. ""[The laws] are unenforceable...and we certainly are not going to compromise citizens' rights [to claim] that we are.""

According to the statistics from the FBI, 6,009 people were murdered with handguns in America in 2010, which was 67.5% of all murders in the country that year. There were 8,775 total firearm crimes reported in the U.S. in 2010. The highest rates of gun crimes in the Unites States come primarily from states where gun laws are most lenient. South Carolina and Tennessee dominate the board in their rate of gun crimes per capita.

Our constitutional rights are very much valid and important, but no right is absolute, without exception or consideration for particular circumstances. Even the sacred right to freedom of speech is limited in that you cannot knowingly spread false information (although no one is telling that to Fox News), you cannot call in a fake bomb threat and incite terror, and you cannot threaten someone’s life or purposefully insight violent actions. The second amendment right to gun ownership is equally as relative.

When the Second Amendment was ratified, the founding fathers had very little or no understanding of mental health and stability. Medicine and medical knowledge was still very primitive at the time and psychology was not a known practice or science until late into the 19th century. So the founding fathers never gave a thought to those who were mentally unstable and should not own guns, nor to young boys with guns who were treated like men from a very early age. Guns at the time were also far less dangerous than they are today, their guns shot one weak bullet at a time and it took a long time to reload. There were no weapons of mass destruction, no bombs, no silencers, and no automatic rifles, and there was no way for the first congress to anticipate the future of weapons technology.

Children who are not even old enough to vote or drive have access to deadly weapons. If a nine year old were allowed behind the wheel of a car, even with an adult, it would be a crime and the parent would be charged for negligence and child endangerment, at least. Yet I have seen and heard of children as young as four and five who are taken to shooting ranges and taught to shoot. This practice, even with older children, desensitizes them of the dangers of guns. Children’s brains are NOT developed enough to handle the dangers and responsibilities of handling a gun. They are not mature enough to comprehend the severity of the potential consequences. The human frontal lobe, which is the home of consequential thinking, rationalizing, and decision making, is not fully developed until the age of about twenty-five. Children are also not physically coordinated enough to safely handle a gun, which is why we also don’t let young children play with sharp things, boiling water, and fire!

I am an advocate for the restriction of guns from everyone under the age of twenty-one. I believe that if you pass a written safety test you should be able to acquire a firearm learner’s license when you’re eighteen. With the learner’s license you may go to approved shooting ranges, be issued a gun, and practice shooting targets under strict supervision. Once you turn twenty-one you should then be able to have a psychiatric evaluation, a written safety test, and a shooting range test. If you pass the tests, you can get a license to buy and own certain hand guns and rifles for self-defense. We are required to be tested in multiple ways to get a license to drive; it is only logical that it should be at least as difficult to attain a license to own a deadly weapon. Cars are also registered, and no one questions it, and it is far more important that guns be registered so that crimes are easily traced back to the offender. It should also be a law that all firearms must be locked away securely and unloaded when not in use.

Assault weapons and automatics should be strictly prohibited. I am viciously against hunting, but even if you are pro-hunting there is no reason for anyone to have automatic assault weapons. Automatic weapons are meant to kill people in an attack. They are not used in hunting, are impractical for self-defense, and no civilian has any business with such dangerous weapons. In an ideal world such weapons would not even exist, but as long as they do they must be kept from those unqualified to use them.

For those that would argue that they fear of a massive military uprising against the American people, you are exactly the type of paranoid nut that I do not want handling guns. The fact is that most of the people in our military would not turn on the American people (their own people) even if they were ordered to. Also, if the far-fetched, unlikely scenario occurred wherein the government and military utterly, blatantly, and violently turned on us and made this country a military state at gunpoint, we are not going to be saved by a crowd of civilians with a few assault weapons. The fact is that the American people have already been taken over, but it has been done in subtler ways, through economic disparities and corporate control of our government.

The reason that our weak gun control laws go utterly unchallenged is that the NRA, weapons manufacturers, and rich Christian institutions have strict monetary ties with the political “right”. The NRA supplies the right-wing with a mountain of campaign contributions and, in return, the politicians vote for and pass legislation that “protects the second amendment”, and keeps gun restrictions weak. The NRA and the GOP also fool the general public by asserting that the Democrats and liberals want to “take away your guns”, and ban guns entirely. They also feed into baseless conspiracy theories about “socialist” military take overs. The second amendment is a Republican talking point used to distract the masses and gain followers who don’t understand that the right-wing’s true agenda is to take over the people by sucking our way of life dry and turning us into ignorant, desperate subjects and sheep.

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",EJ Dionne: The way forward on guns,"Victories often contain the seeds of future defeats. So it is — or at least should be — with the Senate’s morally reprehensible rejection of expanded background checks for gun buyers.

The outcome is a test of both an invigorated gun safety movement and a gun lobby that decided to go for broke.

The National Rifle Association assumed that blocking new gun legislation in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre would firmly establish its dominance. Advocates of sane gun regulations would scatter in despair and be torn apart by recriminations.

But there is a flaw in the gun lobbyists’ calculation: Their strategy leaves the initiative entirely in the hands of their opponents. The early evidence is that rage over the cowardly capitulation of so many senators to raw political power is pushing activists against gun violence to redouble their efforts.

What was striking about Wednesday’s vote is that many of the senators who had expressed support for universal background checks after the slaughter at Newtown meekly abandoned their position when the roll was called.

Proponents of the measure, including Mark Kelly, the husband of former representative Gabrielle Giffords, spoke of private meetings in which senators offered no substantive objections to the compromise negotiated by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa). The wobbling legislators simply hinted that politics would not permit them to vote “yes.”

Giffords, the victim of the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona, founded Americans for Responsible Solutions to battle on behalf of gun reforms. She responded to the Senate vote with an op-ed in the New York Times that declared plainly: “I’m furious.” Senators, she said, “looked over their shoulder at the powerful, shadowy gun lobby — and brought shame on themselves and our government itself by choosing to do nothing.”

Giffords’s frustration echoed sentiment all across her side of the debate. In the past, Democrats who support gun safety had reacted benignly to members of their party from rural states who opposed sensible gun measures for expediency’s sake. Not this time. The response to Democrats who opposed background checks — Sens. Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Heidi Heitkamp and Mark Pryor — was indignation.

Begich invited scorn by insulting those who insisted that the Newtown massacre ought to be the last straw.

“It’s dangerous to do any type of policy in an emotional moment,” he said. “Because human emotions then drive the decision. Everyone’s all worked up. That’s not enough.” Describing the reaction to the death of so many children as “emotional” rather than rational should be electorally disqualifying.

But the vote also demonstrated for all to see a Republican Party walking in lock step behind its commanders in the gun lobby. Only four Republicans bravely defied the NRA’s fanatical opposition to a very mild measure: Toomey and Sens. Mark Kirk, John McCain and Susan Collins.

This should send a message to all who keep looking for new signs of Republican moderation.

Republicans who cultivate a reputation for reasonableness — their ranks include, among others, Sens. Johnny Isakson, Lamar Alexander, Bob Corker, Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lisa Murkowski and Rob Portman — could not even vote for a watered-down proposal. This tells us that the GOP has become a coalition of the fearful. In a pinch, the party’s extreme lobbies rule.

This vote also made clear that the right wing is manipulating our system, notably by abusing the filibuster, to impose a political minority’s will on the American majority. Since when is 90 percent of the nation not “the Real America”?

Not only do Americans overwhelmingly endorse background checks; senators representing the vast majority of our people do, too. The “yes” votes Wednesday came from lawmakers representing 63 percent of the population. How can our democracy thrive when a willful minority can keep dictating to the rest of the country?

But the next steps are up to the supporters of gun sanity. They can keep organizing to build on the unprecedented effort that went into this fight — or they can give up. They can challenge the senators who voted “no,” or they can leave them believing that the “safe” vote is always with the NRA. They can bolster senators who cast particularly courageous “yes” votes — among them, Mary Landrieu and Kay Hagan — or they can leave them hanging.

The story of reform in America is that it often takes defeats to inspire a movement to build up the strength required for victory. Which way this story goes is up to us.

John Hickenlooper signed expanded background checks and a “high capacity” magazine ban into law on March 20, the lesson for other states was that this is what you get if you give Democrats the reins of power.

Colorado is a gun state, always has been. But Under Hickenlooper and the Democrat-controlled state legislature, Colorado’s immediate future is one of ever expanding gun control.

How pro-gun was Colorado before Democrats rolled into town? Think about it this way–in Colorado there are no special permits required to buy a handgun, a shotgun, or a rifle. They have concealed carry laws within their state which even recognize the right to carry firearms on college and university campuses for self-defense.

Moreover, Colorado used to have open carry within the state–which means anyone over 21, with no felonies, used to be able to strap their revolver or pistol on their hip and go about their day with their firearm in plain view. I lived in Colorado in the 1990’s, and not only remember carrying a gun in this manner but also seeing many others carry one as well.

However, by the late 1990’s, the Democrats’ influence was beginning to take hold, and people were being discouraged from carrying guns thus. Now, the laws regarding open carry are best described as “vague,” and I would not risk carrying in the open if I were in the state.

Add to this Gov. Hickenlooper’s ban on “high capacity” magazines and the ban on private gun sales, which is part and parcel to the expanded background checks, and it’s easy to see how far Colorado gun laws have fallen.

Here’s the lesson for other states: Democrats cannot be trusted with your guns–period. And given time and power, they will turn any gun state into a gun control state."

That claim, trumpeted by cable television, National Review, talk shows and comment threads, is, however, based on two polls, most particularly a CBS News poll showing only 47 percent now in favor of stricter gun-control measures compared with 57 percent in December.

There are three problems with this assessment.

First: it's one poll. A Marist poll (commissioned by MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" program) was released early Wednesday showing 60 percent of Americans replying ""more strict"" to the question: Do you think the laws covering the sale of firearms should be more strict, less strict, or kept as they are now?

That's not all. The fact is, the generic strict versus less-strict versus stay-as-they-are questions always elicit weaker support than more specific questions.

As the Center for American Progress has noted in a comprehensive look at this matter:



One of the most consistent findings in gun polling is that support for “gun control” broadly is lower than support for specific tighter gun laws. One reason is the lack of specificity in broad “gun climate” questions. What do respondents think of when asked whether they support “gun control” or “stricter laws covering the sale of firearms”? Are they thinking about a ban on all guns, including hunting rifles? Are they thinking about preventing people accused of domestic violence from getting a gun at a gun show without a background check and then bringing that gun across state lines? We simply don’t know. This is not to say that a broad question on attitudes toward gun laws can’t be useful, but we should simply understand its limitations.

Here's what else was asked in that CBS News poll in the third week of March which found the drop in support for stricter gun control:

Do you favor or oppose a nationwide ban on semi-automatic weapons—including some rifles, pistols, and shotguns—that have detachable magazines, allowing them to rapidly fire a high number of rounds?""

A total of 49 percent in favor, 49 percent opposed. That's a downward shift of three points from February, which is the same as the margin of error. Also asked:

""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?""

A total of 90 percent in favor, 8 percent opposed. In February, the figure was 91 percent.

What's clear when you look at all the polls is that while there has been some slippage when questions about specific measures are asked, it is marginal. The majority of Americans still want universal background checks, an assault weapons ban and a limit on the capacity of gun magazines."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/19/recall-effort-against-morse-deemed-sufficient/,2013-06-19 00:00:00,[],Colorado lawmaker who supported gun control to face recall election,"The Colorado secretary of state's office on Tuesday declared that organizers behind a recall petition against a Colorado lawmaker who supported gun control had enough valid signatures to set up the first potential recall of a state lawmaker in Colorado history.

The secretary of state said opponents of Senate President John Morse, D-Colorado Springs, gathered more than 10,000 valid signatures. They only needed 7,178 valid signatures, equaling 25 percent of all the votes cast in the previous state Senate election.

The recall election would likely in occur in September, though legal challenges could drag the process into October.

Lawyers for Morse are challenging the recall effort. They argued that the petition fails to use language defined in the Colorado constitution that ""expressly include a demand for the election of a successor to the recalled official,"" The Denver Post reported.

""The constitution is clear, just as the courts are clear: no recall petition is valid without this specific language,"" Mark Grueskin, an election lawyer representing a Morse constituent who filed the legal challenge Tuesday told The Post.

The campaign to unseat Morse has become a national flashpoint in the gun control debate. Gun-rights activists from across the country have vowed to defeat Democrats who steered through laws that made Colorado the first state outside the East Coast to curb gun rights in the wake of mass shootings at an elementary school in Connecticut and a movie theater in suburban Denver.

The gun rights supporters were especially unhappy with new laws to expand required background checks for gun purchases and to limit the size of ammunition magazines. The laws take effect next month.

Jessica Kerns, spokeswoman for the group behind the recall, told the Colorado Springs Gazette her group plans to defend the petition against legal challenges from Morse supporters.

""We were expecting the most frivolous legal challenges to this and we're prepared to fight this,"" Kerns told the newspaper. ""We're prepared to defend every single petition so that the peoples' voices can be heard.""

Morse, a second-term incumbent who would be leaving office because of term limits after next session, has vowed to fight the recall. He didn't immediately return a call Tuesday after the recall petition was deemed sufficient.

Earlier this summer, Morse told reporters that the gun control measures were imperative after a bloody 2012.

""Keeping Coloradans safe from gun violence is very worth your political career,"" Morse said.

Morse's attorneys are asking that the validation of the signatures be reversed. A hearing will be scheduled for arguments at the Secretary of State's Office within two weeks. If there's an appeal there, it goes to Denver District Court.

A spokeswoman for the recall effort, Jennifer Kerns, called the Morse challenge part of the ""normal crop of frivolous legal challenges.""

""We are not surprised by their attempts to thwart this recall effort, and we will do everything we can to ensure that the voices of the people are heard,"" she wrote in an email.

If Morse resigns, the seat remains in Democratic hands because the party would appoint a senator to the vacancy. Democrats hold a five-seat advantage in the state Senate.

Democratic Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo is awaiting word from the secretary of state about a similar petition filed against her. A decision in that recall effort was expected by the end of next week.

Recall efforts against two other Democratic lawmakers who supported the gun control measures fizzled. Democrats control both chambers of the state Legislature, as well as the governor's office.

Obama appointed Biden–who throughout his career has opposed gun rights–to lead his gun-control task force after the horribly tragic Newtown shooting. Biden and Holder met Thursday with Jim Baker, director of the Federal Affairs Division of the NRA’s political arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. The meeting took place in the Old Executive Office Building, part of the White House complex adjacent to the West Wing.

It’s revealing that Obama and Biden brought Holder into the meeting. In 2008, when the Supreme Court decided the historic Second Amendment case D.C. v. Heller, Holder joined a brief arguing that the Court should uphold D.C.’s complete ban on gun ownership because the Second Amendment does not apply to private citizens. Holder’s position is that no American citizen has the right to own a gun, and the federal government can ban guns nationwide.

This casts doubt on Obama’s claim of being willing to find “common-sense solutions” and “middle ground” regarding firearms. Polls show 74% of Americans support their constitutional right to keep and bear arms, yet Obama taps two people from the other 26% to remake national policy on this issue.

According to sources familiar with the meeting, it seems NRA was asked to meet with Biden and Holder so that the White House could tell the country that the administration sought input from all sides of the gun-control debate before launching new gun-control measures. “It’s clear they brought NRA in to lecture us, not to have a serious discussion in good faith,” remarked one member of the NRA’s board of directors.

The NRA’s leaders are developing a multi-tiered strategy to combat threats on four fronts. First, anti-gun legislators in both the House and Senate are introducing gun-control bills. These are targeting so-called “assault weapons,” banning high-capacity magazines, shutting down gun shows, and seeking to create a national database of gun owners, complete with fingerprints.

Second is executive action without legislation, through executive orders and new agency regulations. NRA leaders are getting word of various possible routes where Obama will seek to act without any new laws, claiming that existing laws give him all the authority he wants. Given that Obama claims the power to make “recess appointments” when the U.S. Senate is not in recess (which the courts are likely to strike down) and the power to order churches who their leaders will be (a claim the Supreme Court unanimously rejected), many are concerned that he will likewise make a move against gun owners.

Third is foreign policy. Obama said he wants the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, which is officially intended to stop the illicit trade of small arms but would do so by giving the world body–most of whose members do not allow their citizens to own guns–authority to regulate gun ownership over the entire planet and obligate the United States to follow its dictates.

And fourth is at the state level. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo–an Obama ally planning a 2016 presidential bid–went on an anti-gun rant during his State of the State Address, saying that confiscating guns is possible. Meanwhile, Obama’s home state of Illinois is planning new anti-gun measures, as is California’s plan to restrict bullets, rendering guns useless.

Americans are taking sides. NRA membership has skyrocketed by over 100,000 new members in less than a month, as the White House organizes all its allies to push gun control. The Second Amendment survived by only a single vote in the 2008 Heller case, then again survived in another 5-4 vote in the 2010 case McDonald v. Chicago. If Obama gets more Supreme Court picks, they could overrule these cases to effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Supreme Law of the Land.

So the Second Amendment is becoming a major political fight in Obama’s second term, the latest battle over government power versus individual liberty in what some are calling a power grab by an imperial president.

http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-09/news/chi-illinois-concealed-carry_1_harrisburg-democrat-gun-bill-quinn,2013-07-09 00:00:00,"['Ray Long', 'Monique Garcia', 'Rick Pearson']",General Assembly overrides governor's veto of concealed carry bill,"SPRINGFIELD -- Lawmakers made Illinois the last state to allow concealed carry of firearms in two quick votes Tuesday that formalized the deepening rift between Gov. Pat Quinn and the legislature.

The House and Senate voted to override Quinn's amendatory veto of a legislative compromise aimed at satisfying a federal court deadline for legalizing some form of public possession of firearms. Illinois was the last state without some form of legal concealed carry, but the appeals court ruled late last year that the ban was unconstitutional.

While Tuesday's court deadline for passing a law was a major motivating factor, the 77-31 House vote and 41-17 Senate roll call were more than a rejection of Quinn's efforts to toughen the regulations — they were a repudiation of the Democratic governor's leadership style by a Democratic-led legislature.

Quinn, who has said he will seek a second elected term as governor next year, found Democrats assailing his lack of direct involvement in the legislative negotiations that led to the compromise bill that originally passed the General Assembly on May 31— the final day of the spring session.

""It was all grandstanding and he should be ashamed of himself,"" said Rep. Brandon Phelps, the Harrisburg Democrat who sponsored the override.

""He thumbed his nose at our compromise,"" said Phelps, who had accused Quinn of political pandering to voters supportive of tight gun control in Democratic-dominated Cook County. Phelps said the House and Senate votes send a ""pretty strong message to the governor that he was wrong the whole time.""

The complaints about Quinn's handling of the gun debate mirrored those from lawmakers on Illinois' most vexing issue — the state's massive unfunded liability for public employee pensions. Lawmakers also blew through Quinn's Tuesday deadline for a special bipartisan panel to come up with a pension fix — something that has been elusive for the past two years.

""Anyone who doesn't understand that we're going to run this bill over his objections doesn't understand government,"" Sen. Mike Jacobs, D-East Moline, said about the gun bill. He urged the governor not to make the same mistake on pensions: ""I want Gov. Quinn to get in the game.""

Quinn had issued a blanket criticism of lawmakers — including gun control allies who supported the bill — as ""genuflecting"" to the National Rifle Association. Following the vote, he defended his efforts to work with lawmakers but said the General Assembly had ""surrendered"" to the NRA.

""With respect to working and getting the job done, I think the people of Illinois know that I work every day for their common good. I believe in gun safety, and I'm going to always speak out about that. I don't think people should have their lives and property harmed by people with loaded concealed weapons who don't, under the law, deserve to have them,"" he said.

Quinn promised to continue seeking the changes he had proposed, including banning firearms from establishments that sell any alcohol, limiting a person to carrying one concealed firearm at a time, and restricting magazines for concealed weapons to no more than 10 rounds.

The governor was successful in peeling off some votes from gun control advocates. The measure originally got 89 House votes and 45 Senate votes. But faced with the prospect that the legislature's failure to enact a law could lead to unregulated concealed carry, even gun control supporters in the legislature urged an override of the governor.

Sen. Kwame Raoul, D-Chicago, who negotiated the measure on behalf of gun control advocates, said he felt conflicted by rejecting Quinn's changes because he originally sought to include many of them. He warned that voting with Quinn was a ""political vote"" but one that endangered public safety if no law was enacted.

""There's no more time,"" Raoul said. ""We are here on July 9th and if the members of this chamber have the interests of public safety at their heart, they would vote 'yes' to override.""

It will be several months before qualified gun owners can carry a concealed firearm outside their homes while the Illinois State Police puts together licensing procedures and applicant reviews.

But the legislature's decision to override Quinn and stick to its agreed-upon compromise may represent only a short-lived truce between gun rights advocates and gun control supporters in a state where there is a vast divergence over how firearms are viewed, dependent largely upon cultural and regional differences.

Even a late effort by lawmakers to amend another bill to reflect three mostly minor changes that the governor had proposed ended up falling short of the votes needed in the House after first passing the Senate.

Phelps acknowledged now that the law is in effect, ""you're going to see political posturing on both sides of this issue.""

Sen. Christine Radogno of Lemont, the Senate Republican leader, told colleagues that ""I don't think this is the last time we're going to be discussing this issue."" And Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago, a gun control supporter, said ""it is a very safe bet that we will be back"" fighting over changes in the new law.

Cassidy noted the new law removes the ability of larger communities to set some of their own gun laws and said she feared gun rights supporters are ""going to be back here time after time after time chipping away at all the things that everyone has lauded as the great protections.""

Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said lawmakers ""can and should add more protections to when and how people can carry guns in public places. I believe in give-and-take and compromise, but we can't bargain away the safety of our families."""
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/gun-background-checks-poll_n_3177865.html,2013-04-29 00:00:00,"['Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']","Senators Lose Support After Opposing Gun Background Checks, Poll Shows","Senators in several states who voted earlier this month against increasing background checks for gun buyers have since seen their approval ratings noticeably drop, according to new polls released Monday by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski's (R-Alaska) net approval rating dropped 16 points, as she shed much of her previous cross-party appeal. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) saw his numbers dive 18 points, from a positive to a negative rating.

Not all of the change can be attributed to the vote. Portman, for instance, saw his approval drop among Republicans when he announced his support for gay marriage in March. But in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada and Ohio, at least 60 percent of voters supported background checks, and many expressed disappointment with politicians who voted otherwise.

Fifty-two percent of Arizona voters said they were less likely to support Sen. Jeff Flake (R) for reelection due to his ""no"" vote, while 46 percent of Nevadans said the same of Sen. Dean Heller (R). More than a third of voters were less likely to back Portman as well as Alaska Sens. Mark Begich (D) and Murkowski. A previous PPP poll found that Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) also saw her ratings tumble 15 points, likely due in part to her vote against background checks.

Much of the lost support comes from independent or moderate voters.

PPP hasn't yet conducted polling on how senators who supported the bill have fared. But Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who cosponsored background check legislation, saw his approval rating increase by a net 7 points, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Friday.

Nationally, most polls taken since the shooting in Newtown, Conn., have found that upwards of 80 percent of people support gun background checks, and that there is relatively little partisan division on the issue.

Opinions were less unified on the actual legislation considered in the Senate, but most still say they wish it had gone through. A 65 percent majority of Americans said the measure should have passed, including 45 percent of Republicans and a majority of Democrats and independents, according to a Gallup poll released Monday."

In letters to the state's congressional delegation and governor, Lawrence G. Keane, the senior vice president and general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the industry is ""offended by the hypocrisy of our elected officials in Congress and the state government"" to advocate for legislation paying homage to the firearms industry and the iconic Colt firearms factory while pursuing gun control legislation.

""As major contributors to the state's economy, we find it unacceptable for lawmakers to propose banning our products and hindering our ability of Connecticut companies to grow their businesses, create more good-paying manufacturing jobs, and contribute hundreds of millions in taxes,"" Keane wrote in the letters released Tuesday.

He called the state's legislation ""job-killing"" because it bans many of the most popular and commonly owned firearms that the foundation's members manufacture.

Current and past delegation members have pushed for years for the National Historical Park designation at Coltsville, an area named after Samuel Colt, who designed a revolver that revolutionized personal firearms. The area includes manufacturing facilities and employee housing that his Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Co. began building in 1855.

Coltsville was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2008, a step toward the national park designation.

U.S. Rep. John Larson, a Democrat who represents Hartford and a chief proponent of the national historical park designation, said the site is of national historic significance and ""anyone who understands the significance and importance of Coltsville gets it."" He said the location was and will remain the cradle of the Industrial Revolution, the site of precision manufacturing, assembly line production and interchangeable parts.

""Historic designation has nothing to do with universal background checks, which 91 percent of the American people support,"" Larson said.

The foundation is based in Newtown, the site of the Dec. 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2013/02/gun-laws-are-useless-thats-all-wet.html,,[],Change of Subject: Gun laws are useless? That's all wet,"From Sunday's print column, which features another collection of dispatches from Somebody Nobody Asked™, America's pre-eminent unsolicited advice columnist

Dear gun rights advocates:

I'm with you on the futility of municipal gun bans and other localized restrictions on the private ownership of firearms. They present obstacles mainly for responsible, law-abiding people and do little to prevent evildoers from obtaining and carrying lethal weapons

But please. In the wake of the recent uptick in firearms fatalities in Chicago I've heard a corresponding uptick in your triumphant claim that the carnage here — a city with some of the toughest gun-control laws in the nation — illustrates not just that gun control doesn't work, but also that it has the perverse effect of making our streets more dangerous.

Truth is, attempts to declare ""no gun"" zones in urban areas that are surrounded by suburban and exurban dealers are doomed to be as ineffective as declaring ""no peeing"" zones in public swimming pools. In both cases, the flow is so easy and inevitable that it renders boundaries basically imaginary.

As long as we permit the straw purchase of virtually unlimited numbers of firearms, as long as we don't carefully track the custody of these weapons from hand to hand and as long as we don't require background checks prior to every gun sale, local ordinances will be chain-link levees. Their ""failure"" proves nothing, suggests nothing.

Police don't yet have a suspect in custody in the shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton in a South Side park Tuesday afternoon. But what do you want to bet that the murder weapon, if it's ever recovered, will have been bought by someone else, then sold, passed around or stolen until it ended up in the hands of the thug who fired the bullet that struck Hadiya in the back?

Strict, Chicago-style gun restrictions might reduce violence if implemented nationwide — it works in other countries — but we all know that's a political nonstarter, and no one is seriously suggesting it. In fact, the legal trend is going the other way, with Illinois poised to become the final state to allow licensed residents to carry concealed weapons. This development will at least start to level the battlefield in the war between those who follow the law and those who don't.

So meet us halfway here. Universal background checks. Heavy penalties and other safeguards against straw purchases. And no gloating about Chicago's homicide rate."

The first page offers an executive summary of what follows along with references to Sandy Hook, Newtown, Aurora, Oak Creek and Tucson. It closes by once again focusing on children, “If even one child’s life can be saved, then we need to act.”

The rest of the document is broken into four major points with many sub-sections. Point one is closing background check loopholes and it opens with another reference to Sandy Hook:

We must strengthen our efforts to keep guns from falling into the wrong hands…The single most important thing we can do to prevent gun violence and mass shootings, like the one in Newtown, is to make sure those who would commit acts of violence cannot get access to guns.

The guns used in the Newtown shooting were bought legally by the shooter’s mother. He stole her guns, shot her while she slept and made his way to the school. There is literally nothing in this section that, if enacted, would have changed the outcome. Sub-points include expanding background checks and insuring all states are contributing to the national database of people with mental illness. These might be worthy changes but again suggesting it would have stopped what happened in Newtown is pure emotional manipulation.

Step two is to ban “military-style assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines. This is essentially an effort to reinstate the ban which existed from 1994-2004. But this section also includes four other sub-sections covering everything from additional law enforcement “tools” to spending federal money on gun violence research.

One of the priorities in this section is a “national responsible gun ownership campaign.” The document isn’t specific but this would likely be modeled on other government campaigns such as the one against smoking or drug use (“This is your brain on guns”). In practice this could be safety tips about gun storage or it could becomes a media slush-fund to stigmatize gun owners as heartless monster, like the people who let their second hand smoke waft toward babies.

The big budget item in this section is a plan to spend $4 billion keeping 15,000 cops “on the streets.” But again it’s not clear how this priority connects to any of the mass shooting incidents the document is ostensibly aimed at preventing. How will 15,000 more cops prevent the next school shooting if they are not on campus when the shooting begins?

In section three we finally get to “Making Schools Safer” which really ought to be the focus. Obama is proposing funding for 1,000 school resource officers at a cost of $150 million. This is a fraction of what he proposes to spend on cops in general ($4B) and seems insignificant in a country with more than 70,000 public schools. Chances that your elementary school will get an armed officer as a result of this program are exceedingly slim.

The other parts of this section include insuring schools have an emergency management plan and creating a “safer climate” at schools. The former seems like a good idea but the latter is rather vague. It involves spending $50 million to have the Department of Education train 8,000 schools to “improve climate.” There is a mention of “more intensive steps for groups of students exhibiting at-risk behavior” but it’s not clear from the document what this means or which groups are at risk.

Section four is titled “Improving Mental Health Services.” Here the documents suggests but never quite says outright that mental issues were involved in the shootings at “Newtown, Tucson, Aurora, and Virginia Tech.” The proposal involves training teachers to identify troubled kids and then insure they get treatment. It also lays out a proposal to train 5,000 mental health professionals to work with kids and young adults.

The mental health approach does seem like common sense though it’s not clear the items proposed would have prevented the shootings mentioned prominently in the document. Adam Lanza, Jared Loughner and Seung-Hui Cho were all known to have social/mental problems by their parents and teachers. They had been identified (James Holmes’ problems seem to have cropped up later) but obviously didn’t get sufficient help. Is that because help wasn’t available or because their parents wanted to avoid the stigma?

The President’s gun proposal throws a lot of progressive spaghetti at the wall (to mix metaphors) in the hope that some of it will stick. Some of it will and perhaps some of it really should, but the items which seem most likely to prevent another Sandy Hook–cops in schools, mental health intervention–receive less money and attention than the ones designed primarily to please Obama’s progressive constituency. It’s an odd mix until you realize this is as much a political document as it is a practical one."

Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy using the skeet range at Camp David.

This column has been updated with a new ruling

The New Republic: “Have you ever fired a gun?”

President Obama: “Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.”

New Republic: ”The whole family?”

Obama: “Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.”

— from an interview published Jan. 27, 2013

A number of readers have raised questions about the president’s statement that he goes skeet shooting “all the time” while at Camp David. In these suspicious times, they would like to see some evidence.

But the White House has been oddly silent about the matter.

On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said he did know how often the president has gone skeet shooting and that he has not seen a photograph. “When he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs,” Carney told reporters.

Of course, this did not stop the White House from releasing these photographs in 2011. (Obama is shown at Sasha Obama’s birthday party at Camp David; the second was taken the same weekend of Vice President Biden, but that is not at Camp David):

Then, on Wednesday, Carney tersely said he had no response to a challenge from Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) for a skeet shooting contest with the president.

We e-mailed a White House official on Tuesday and then Carney twice on Wednesday asking for the name of an Obama guest at Camp David who could confirm the president’s account. (The White House does not publicly release the names of guests.) We received no response all three times.

So let’s review what we do know.

The Facts

In skeet shooting, participants use shotguns to hit clay disks that are automatically flung into air, in an effort to simulate bird hunting. An interesting blog about Camp David, in a post from 2010, reports that many presidents have enjoyed skeet shooting at the rustic retreat. (Check out the photo of John F. Kennedy skeet shooting with future Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.) The blog also displays overhead images over the years showing that the skeet range is located near the helicopter pad.

We searched high and low through hundreds of news reports to see if there was ever any other mention of Obama engaged in skeet shooting. We found that Obama, in a weekly radio address in 2012, congratulated Kim Rhode on becoming “the first American to win individual medals in five straight Olympics with her gold in skeet shooting” and Army Sgt. Vincent Hancock for a second skeet gold.

But when the Olympic athletes later visited the White House, Obama did not make a reference to having attempted skeet shooting. Instead, he spoke of other sports that moved him to do better:

“But I was inspired to watch you guys even though I couldn’t do what you do. I was inspired to run a little bit faster watching Tyson Gay, and lift a little more after watching Holley Mangold, or do a few more crunches after watching Michael Phelps and the other swimmers. Somehow, it didn’t work quite on me.”

In 2011, Politico reported that Obama was “an infrequent visitor” to Camp David, compared to other presidents:

Those close to Obama say the president — who owns a home in Chicago — is more of an “urban guy,” who prefers hitting the basketball court and the golf course on weekends to blow off steam. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, upon returning from Camp David on his most recent trip, Obama headed straight for the links. And while Camp David includes a movie theater, bowling alley, swimming pool and endless biking and hiking trails, Obama prefers to stick close to the White House when he’s not on vacation.

Again, no mention of skeet shooting.

(UPDATE: A reader pointed us to an Associated Press article in 2010 which reported that after Obama met with the Texas Christian University national championship rifle team, one team member quoted Obama as saying he had practiced shooting a rifle with the Secret Service.)

We also could not find evidence that Obama ever tried skeet shooting before he became president.

During the 2008 campaign, a group that called itself the American Hunters and Shooters Association — which some pro-gun groups attacked as a front for anti-gun forces — endorsed Obama and announced he would attend a skeet shooting event in September in Colorado. “The Obama campaign says the skeet shooting event will highlight the Democrat’s support of the Second Amendment and hunting rights,” the Associated Press reported. But Ray Schoenke, a former Washington Redskins football player who headed the organization, said in an interview Wednesday that in the end Obama did not attend the Colorado event.

Schoenke said that after Obama’s election, the organization — which he said was intended to bridge the gap between urban liberals and rural gun owners — closed down because of lack of support from the Obama administration. He said he did many events in support of the Obama campaign in 2008 but Obama never mentioned having ever handled a firearm.

During a September 2008 campaign event in Duryea, Pa.., Obama was point blank asked if he was “going to take away the guns.” He gave a rather long answer, but he made no reference to having used a weapon himself — and this certainly would have been the perfect moment. Instead, he speaks of “your guns:”

“The bottom line is this: If you’ve got a rifle, you've got a shotgun, you've got a gun in your house, I'm not taking it away. All right? So they can keep on talking about it, but this is just not true.

“And, by the way, even if — here's another thing you've got to understand. Even if I wanted to take it away, I couldn’t get it done. I don't have the votes in Congress….

“It's your guns. We're not going to mess with them, all right? I hope I made that clear. Is everybody clear back there in the back? Because I see a couple sportsmen back there. All right? Spread the word with your friends. I'm not going to take away your guns.”

Generally, a politician who has handled firearms will advertise that fact to gun owners. Indeed, here’s how Obama’s 2008 rival for the Democratic nomination, then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke about guns after another mass killing that year, according to the AP:

Clinton told an audience she supported gun rights, two days after a student opened fire on the campus of Northern Illinois University, killing five before turning the gun on himself. Clinton said she believed in getting guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill even as she favored protecting the rights of law abiding gun owners.

“I've gone hunting,” she said. “I know you may not believe it, but it's true. My father taught us to shoot.”

Clinton told reporters later she had once shot a duck in Arkansas, along with “a lot of tin cans, targets and some skeet.”

The Pinocchio Test

The evidence suggests that until Obama had access to a shooting range as president, he never went skeet shooting. He certainly did not speak like a politician who had once used a firearm.

But it is also curious that the White House refuses to provide any documentary evidence that he actually used the shooting range at Camp David, since he claims he uses it “all the time,” or that a presidential friend has not come forward to confirm the president’s comments.

We live in suspicious times and the president lives in a media fishbowl. That’s the way it is. In the meantime, we do not have enough information to make a ruling one way or the other. We are eager to see a photograph, or hear from someone who saw him at the skeet range, to put this matter to rest.

UPDATE: A reader notes that because Obama said he does skeet shooting “all the time,” perhaps our standard of proof should be higher--such as several photographs. That’s a reasonable point. We have also been asked why we did not immediately award Pinocchios, such as when Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) made unproven claims about Mitt Romney’s taxes. We try to avoid using “verdict pending,” but in cases of self-aggrandizement, we are willing to be a bit more patient. Obviously, if the White House is not forthcoming with additional evidence, then the claim becomes increasingly doubtful.

UPDATE, Feb. 2: The White House released this photograph of the president at the Camp David skeet range on Aug. 4, 2012. We are pleased the White House has become more forthcoming about this matter, though it does not quite answer the questions concerning the president’s “all the time” language. What do readers think? (Also, given some of the controversy this column generated, we refer you to a negative critique that appeared on Mediaite, which certainly reflects the views of a number of readers who are upset that we thought this was even an issue.)

UPDATE: As one might expect, there is a vast divide on this, with some readers upset that we did not immediately change our ruling because the president released a photo, as we had requested in our original column. We try not to make snap judgements, but readers argued we had moved the goal posts. Well, a case could be made that we had. (See first update.)

We certainly appreciate all of the commentary we received on this column. Many readers initially were upset that we did not immediately award Pinocchios, but now a new wave of readers has condemned us for even thinking this was worthy of serious inquiry. On the last point, we respectively disagree. All statements by public figures are subject to scrutiny. The president made an unexpected claim, and for nearly a week the White House refused to back it up.

So we now have a photo, a news report quoting an anonymous source that the president participated in a Marine guard competition and a news report quoting Obama that he has practiced with the Secret Service. The issue is settled, and we award the president a Geppetto Checkmark.

Often, reports of shooting incidents that qualify for GunFAIL don't come out right away, but turn up a week or so later. Earlier in this series, I was keeping things strictly in chronological order, and adding updates to earlier posts when I found late-breaking reports. But slipping those reports into lists that have already been read by 90+% of the people who read them tends to understate their impact. If you're interested in these incidents and the number of them that are found, you should see every one of them as I find them. So although I'll still present each installment in the series in chronological order, I won't be updating old posts with new finds.

Second, I'm going to separate out the suicides and murder-suicides from the rest of these incidents. Although they do in many cases represent that sub-category of GunFAIL I sometimes tag on Twitter as #protectingthefamily—that is, the idea that guns bought to protect the family often end up killing the family—these incidents are hard to classify based on little more than the news reports, which are often sketchy.

Third, I'm not entirely sure what to do with domestic situations that involve guns, but don't involve suicides. What about straight-up assaults or murders? What should I do with incidents where a domestic partner might have purchased a gun for protecting the home, only to end up using it to kill his or her partner? Isn't that a mission failure of some kind? If so, where does it belong?

All of which brings me to another point. The more of these stories I collect, the more I realize how difficult it sometimes can be to categorize them. What do I do with a suicide committed with a gun not owned by the victim? That doesn't fit in the category of family deaths caused by a gun purchased to protect them. And what if a murder-suicide is committed between terminally ill, elderly spouses? Does it fit the category? It hardly seems sensitive to include them, of course. But it also might not really be very telling about the way guns get used. Or maybe it is. But one thing is for sure, it has made me more acutely aware of the difficulties gun rights advocates point out with things like defining ""assault weapons,"" or listing ""legitimate"" reasons to have certain types of guns, or certain modes of employing them. If there are ways of killing yourself or your family with guns that confound the notion of #GunFAIL, then surely there are things I haven't thought of in terms of justifiable uses, reasons for ownership, etc.

With that thought out of the way, let's begin with the GunFAIL report, below the fold."

USA TODAY

Just 10%25 of Republicans who responded said they do not own a gun

66%25 of Democrats said they are not gun owners

President Obama is pushing Congress to draft gun legislation

Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified the press secretary for Sen. Mark Pryor. Her name is Lucy Speed, not Sara Lasure. Also, six people died in the Minneapolis sign store shooting last fall -- the original story had a preliminary death toll.

WASHINGTON -- Republicans in Congress are much better armed than their Democratic counterparts — a fact that helps explain the deep partisan divide as Congress gears up for its first major votes on gun control in a decade.

One hundred nineteen Republicans and 46 Democrats declared themselves as gun owners in a USA TODAY survey of lawmakers.

There is no uniform public record of gun ownership by members of Congress, and it is not part of the information lawmakers are required to reveal in their annual financial disclosure forms. So USA TODAY and the Gannett Washington Bureau contacted every congressional office to ask: Does the lawmaker own a gun?

The results show a partisan — and regional — divide. Only 10% of Republicans who responded said they do not own a gun, while 66% of Democrats said they are not gun owners.

Michael Hammond, legislative counsel of Gun Owners of America, said he's not surprised. In Republican districts, a gun ""is a campaign accoutrement,"" he said.

Plotted on a map, the survey results speak to the cultural chasm between those districts where guns are a talisman of individualism and those where guns are viewed more as a criminal tool. Only 12 lawmakers from the Northeast, including Pennsylvania, said they own firearms, while 77 Southerners said they do.

Congress' gun gap suggests that cultural factors are at least as important as the influence of the gun lobby in determining where members stand on President Obama's package of gun control proposals.

The gun gap

Some members were more than willing to give an inventory of their gun lockers. Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., owns three shotguns, three rifles and two pistols, press secretary Lucy Speed said. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, owns a dozen, but her favorite is a 20-gauge Ruger, communications director Matthew Felling said.

Others — overwhelmingly Southern Republicans — declined to answer, even suggesting it was ""irresponsible"" for reporters to ask the question.

Again there is a partisan split: 36 Republicans in the House refused to say whether they own guns; 11 Democrats refused to say. Across both the House and Senate, an additional 161 lawmakers did not return repeated phone calls, e-mails and requests for comment — 97 of those were Republicans.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he owns guns, though he wouldn't say what kind. His Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, declined to say whether he does. In the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she does not own a gun, and Speaker John Boehner's office did not respond to multiple requests.

The White House has released photos of Obama shooting skeet but asked by reporters Monday whether Obama owns a gun, spokesman Jay Carney said ""not that I am aware of.""

Obama is pushing Congress to reinstate a ban on assault weapons, expand background checks for gun purchases and adopt other measures to curb gun violence. Any new gun legislation in Congress would have to pass through the Judiciary Committee in each chamber. Eight of 23 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee confirmed they are gun owners, but only one of the panel's 17 Democrats admitted having a gun — Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee.

On the Senate committee -- which is drafting gun legislation -- Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island were the only two Democrats who said they own firearms, while six of the eight Republicans on the committee said they do.

Gun ownership is clearly correlated with members' political positions. Over the last two years, the National Rifle Association's political action committee gave 10 times more contributions to House members who own guns than to those who don't, according to an analysis of campaign finance reports filed last week. And members who owned guns were eight times more likely to get an ""A"" rating from the NRA than those who did not.

You don't say

For some members, their gun ownership is a point of pride. Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., provided a list of weapons he owns, and his spokeswoman followed up a few days later to note the congressman had also just bought ""a third-generation Glock G27"" handgun.

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who famously used a rifle to shoot a copy of an environmental bill in a 2010 campaign ad, seemed surprised by the question about his gun ownership, pointing out that he is from West Virginia. ""Why would anybody not own a gun?"" he asked.

At least a dozen members spoke of heirloom weapons, inherited from fathers, grandfathers and mothers, that are as much a part of the family as their name. Rep. John Barrow, D-Ga., in a television ad, proudly brandishes the Smith & Wesson his grandfather used to stop a lynching – but his office did not return phone calls to confirm his gun ownership. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., keeps a pistol and two rifles as mementos of his late father.

Asked about his gun ownership, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, tells of his great-grandfather, a Swiss immigrant who, at age 80, ""went out into a duck blind on a frozen lake and he never came back.

""And they went out to find him at the end of the day, and he had died of a heart attack in the duck blind with his gun over his lap and with a smile on his face, which is part of the Portman family lore because he loved to hunt,"" Portman said. ""I have that gun. And my kids have shot that gun, so it's a tradition in our family.""

Portman said he's mostly concerned about the views of his constituents on gun rights — but said he couldn't deny that his own experience influences his votes.

For others, the question itself was an intrusion.

Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican, said, ""Given the security concerns for members of Congress and their families after the shooting of (former Arizona congresswoman) Gabrielle Giffords, it is irresponsible for members of the media to publish how members and their families protect themselves in public and at home.""

Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., through spokeswoman Sarah Wolf, provided a more succinct response: ""None of your damn business.""

Some lawmakers declined to respond to the survey even though they have already made public statements declaring themselves to be gun owners. Rep Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., would not respond to the survey, but his website says, ""I am a gun owner and avid hunter, and have consistently fought to protect the right to keep and bear arms.""

Rep. Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican who appears to be the only licensed gun dealer in the House, also declined to respond. Graves holds an active license for the Rockin H Gun Shop, which apparently has been in his family for some time, though there is no longer a shop affiliated with the name.

Hammond, the gun owner's group lobbyist, said he was surprised by the number of lawmakers who declined to talk about their guns. It suggests ""they feel that gun ownership is more sensitive than some of the other things they have to reveal,"" he said.

Members are allowed a few secrets.

Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer, who previously served as chief of the Capitol Police, said lawmakers are ""permitted to have guns in their offices"" and would not have to tell anybody they had a gun.

""We discourage them,"" he said. ""I personally don't know of any member who is packing,"" he said.

In the public hallways of the Capitol, a lawmaker can carry a weapon only if it is ""unloaded and securely wrapped,"" Gainer said.

Outside the Capitol, members are governed by the gun laws of their states. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., ""travels with firearms while on official business in (his) district,"" chief of staff Doug Coutts said.

Reflecting the constituents

The responses suggest that gun ownership among lawmakers is on par with gun ownership nationwide. In a December 2012 USA TODAY/Gallup Poll, 43% of respondents said they have a gun in their home. In USA TODAY's lawmakers survey, 43% who responded said they were gun owners.

Hammond argued that gun ownership does not determine a lawmakers' vote on gun control. More likely, he said, the culture of the district they represent shapes their view of gun control and their decision to own a gun.

""Lots of Democrats live in urban areas like Chicago and New York where guns are all but banned,"" said Hammond, whose Gun Owners of America bills itself as ""the only no-compromise gun lobby in Washington.""

Those lawmakers ""don't have a lot of constituents who place a high value on the Second Amendment,"" and also ""don't have the personal experiences with guns that would lead them to see them as anything other than a dangerous nasty object,"" Hammond said.

Some gun owners in Congress support gun control. Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat from a Minnesota district where six people were killed in a sign-shop shooting last fall, said, ""I am a gun owner, and I believe in common-sense gun safety rules.""

But gun-control advocates say the USA TODAY survey shows how difficult it is for Republicans to endorse gun measures or to even publicly declare that they don't own guns. ""This has become a political totem — a badge of honor for many politicians,"" said Ladd Everitt, spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

Gun ownership and the Second Amendment have become ""a symbol of a political identity: a rugged individualist who is willing to lay down the law when the government oversteps its bounds,"" with an emphasis on small government and personal freedom, Everitt said.

For Republicans in conservative, rural districts, he said, ""the reality of whether they own a gun may be butting up against the image they want to project.""

The email alert to Obama’s list of more than 20 million supporters was intended to flood Congress with calls in support of the President’s gun control proposals. After a week, it is clear the effort fizzled.

The Obama campaign’s action alert last week tickled lefty journalists like BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith. The White House stenographer took to twitter to boast about the mobilization.

So Messina unleashed the kraken on the congressional switchboard today — Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 25, 2013

Yeah, not so much.

Breitbart News talked with a dozen Congressional offices, in both the Senate and the House. None reported any increase in calls as a result of Obama’s action alert. One Senate office said that, in the week since the alert went out, they had received around 20 calls in support of gun control and around 150 in support of gun rights.

Without a doubt, Obama has built an impressive turnout machine for elections. His campaign has vowed to use this to mobilize on issues important to the White House. This initial failure, however, suggests it will be difficult to translate voter’s personal support of the President to specific issues.

In the weeks since the tragic shooting in Newtown, Obama has used the full wattage of his bully pulpit to press for actions on guns. The media has provided a powerful assist by devoting enormous attention to guns and the issue of gun violence. Yet, Obama’s well-oiled machine can’t generate enthusiasm from his supporters on the issue.

This is further evidence of the fundamental challenge faced by supporters of gun control. While large numbers of voters say they support more restrictions on gun rights, they aren’t particularly motivated by the issue. It is merely one of many issues they support. Those who believe in gun rights, however, are singularly motivated on the issue. Not only is their vote determined by that issue, their level of political engagement is determined by it as well.

Not even Obama can fix that math.

Vice President Biden talks gun control in a Facebook forum

Biden says assault weapons are hard to aim

%22You don%27t need 30 rounds to defend yourself%2C%22 he says

WASHINGTON — Vice President Biden has a little advice for those critics of the administration's push to ban assault weapons and limit the size of ammunition clips who say such measures will make it more difficult to defend themselves: Buy a shotgun.

Speaking with Parents Magazine in a Facebook town hall on Tuesday, Biden said that he has advised his wife, Jill — if she ever has the need to protect herself at their home in Wilmington, Del. — that a double-barreled shotgun should be her weapon of choice.

""I said, 'Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here ... walk out and put that double-barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house,"" Biden said.

The vice president went on to explain that popular assault weapons, such as the AR-15, are less useful for self-defense.

""You don't need an AR-15 — it's harder to aim, it's harder to use, and in fact you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself,"" he said.

In the interview, Biden, who has been President Obama's point man on shepherding the White House's gun-control agenda, reiterated that he and the president are supporters of Second Amendment rights. But he also argued that the Constitution allows for the government to set limits on weaponry for the public good.

""How can I say this politely?"" said Biden, who noted his surprise at some of the questions that were culled from Parents Magazine readers. ""The Constitution does allow the government to conclude that there are certain types of weapons that no one can own. Now if that were not the case, then you should be able to go buy a flamethrower like the military ... if you're a billionaire you should be able to buy an F-15 … you should be able to buy an M-1 tank, you should be able to buy a machine gun, you should be able to buy a grenade launcher, and you can't do those things.""

Biden said that even if all of the president's agenda is implemented, it won't be an immediate cure-all for gun violence. But he argued the limitations are analogous to the ban on leaded gasoline implemented over nearly a quarter-century, suggesting that the tighter gun laws could have greater impact over time.

""It will not solve the whole problem, but we shouldn't continue to make (the same) mistakes,"" Biden said."

Gun maker Sturm Ruger%27s 1Q earnings surged 39%25%2C besting estimates

1Q background checks%2C proxy for gun sales%2C jumped 46%25 year over year

Many people say they are buying guns%2C ammo ahead of stronger laws

The White House unintentionally is proving to be the best thing to happen to gun sales in decades.

In late April, Sturm Ruger (RGR) reported first-quarter results that exceeded targets. Net sales for the largest publicly traded gun manufacturer surged 39% to $155.9 million, compared to $112.3 million a year earlier.

The gun maker's earnings came in at $1.20 per share, up from 79 cents per share in the same period last year. Analysts on Wall Street were expecting earnings of $1.01 per share with revenue of $112.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters.

New products, such as LC380 and SR45 pistols, boosted sales, but the company said the recent gun control debate is the main driver of rising sales.

During the first quarter of 2013, background checks through the National Instant Criminal System, considered a proxy for retail gun demand, jumped 46%, according to Sturm Ruger.

Gun maker Smith & Wesson (SWHC) says background checks in February, while down from a month earlier, were 29.1% higher than the same month in 2011.

Gun sales typically receive a boost when a Democrat inhabits the White House, but firearms and ammo sales have surged to record highs after the December tragedy in Newtown reinvigorated debate about gun control.

Sturm Ruger can not make guns fast enough to satisfy growing demand. Itsbacklog climbed to 2.1 million orders in the first quarter vs. 337,000 order in the same period a year earlier.

Ruger had to limit incoming orders from independent distributors to reduce the growth in its backlog, which hit 1.5 million orders at the end of 2012, or roughly nine months of production.

In a regulatory filing, Ruger said: ""Demand for the company's products in the first quarter of 2013 was very strong. We believe this strong demand for our products was primarily due to the current political environment that favorably impacted the entire firearms industry.""

In January, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden rolled out a wide-ranging list of executive actions aimed at strengthening gun control. As a result, many people say they are making purchases ahead of any major legal reforms. In fact, many people say Obama may end up being the best gun salesman in history.

Obama continues to press Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and ammo capacities of more than 10 rounds, to require background checks on all gun sales, and to create tougher penalties for anyone selling guns to people who are not legally allowed to own them.

After months of heated and emotional rhetoric, a bipartisan bill aimed at expanding the system of background checks failed in the Senate. It received 54 votes, six votes short of the 60 needed to advance.

Breaks from party lines impacted the bill's prospects. Five Democrats voted against it, and broke from party lines and voted against the bill. And only four GOP senators voted in favor of the bill. The Senate also blocked a proposal to ban semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

A visibly angry Obama gave a speech shortly after the Senate's decision. He said: ""This was a pretty shameful day for Washington. But ... I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don't give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities … but we can do more if Congress gets its act together.""

Some companies responded to public opinion polls showing support for stronger gun control laws. In January, Wal-Mart (WMT), one of the largest gun sellers in the U.S. placed a limit on ammunition sales of three boxes per customer, per day.

Gun sales had been on the rise before the Newtown shooting, in which a lone shooter killed his other, then mowed down 20 children and six adults at an elementary school before turning the gun on himself.

According to a gun industry analysis by The Associated Press, in Obama's first four years in office, the federal government conducted roughly the same number of background checks for gun owners and prospective buyers as it did under George W. Bush's first six years in office.

And for the first time since 1993, the number of federally licensed retail gun dealers in the U.S. increased in 2010 and 2011, adding 1,167 more licensed dealers.

Little wonder shares of gun makers continue to outperform the broader market. The past three years, Ruger shares have tripled in price, while Smith & Wesson shares have more than doubled. Shares of Cabela's (CAB), one of the most well-known outdoor recreation brands in the world, have more than tripled since 2010.

Police say officers acted %22heroically%22 responding to high-speed pursuit through nation%27s capital

Security experts question the decision by police to fire at a moving vehicle through crowded streets

They suggest installing more vehicle barriers through the region to stop future car chases

WASHINGTON — After a car chase through the heart of the nation's capital ended with police shooting to death a 34-year-old Connecticut woman, security experts are wondering whether that was their only option.

D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier said the first shots were fired Thursday after the woman rammed a Secret Service vehicle near the Capitol building. The second, fatal round of shots was fired several blocks away when the woman crashed near a barrier to the Capitol complex.

Michael Lyman, a former criminal investigator who has studied use-of-force guidelines for police, said the woman's inability to penetrate barriers around the White House downgraded the situation from a national security concern to an ""old-fashioned pursuit."" From that point on, he said, officers should have tried to use other means to stop the car.

""Shooting at a moving vehicle is against all nationally recognized protocols,"" said Lyman, a criminal justice professor at Columbia College of Missouri.

Lyman said the possibility of accidentally striking innocent bystanders is just too high when trying to shoot at a moving car.

""Cops get rattled,"" he said. ""And when they get rattled, police don't always shoot straight.""

Geoffrey Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, said that Washington's unfortunate history as a target of terrorist attacks cannot lower the threshold for officers deciding to open fire in a crowded area.

""Does it increase the level of risk? Yes. But it's still the same standard as any other use of force,"" Alpert said. ""The officers need to explain why each one pulled the trigger and each bullet expended.""

Even if police were trying to shoot out the tires of the car in an effort to disable it — something people see in movies and TV shows all the time — experts say that's an incredibly difficult feat to actually pull off. Dan Kennedy, a forensic criminologist, said police are instructed not to attempt that, because bullets end up ricocheting off the pavement or the vehicle and potentially striking bystanders.

""There's been a real disconnect between reality and expectations on the part of civilians based largely on what they've seen on TV and in the movies,"" Kennedy said. ""It's generally a bad idea to fire at a moving vehicle and most police departments don't allow it.""

But this wasn't just a car chase down a desolated highway. The woman struck and injured an officer with her car when the chase began near the White House, she rammed a police car while evading police by the Capitol building, and the car was careening through an area filled with embassies, federal buildings and throngs of tourists.

""The officers felt their lives were in ... jeopardy, or other citizens' lives could've been in fear as well,"" Ed Clarke, a security expert, told WUSA-9. ""It's very quick how they have to make a critical decision. In a matter of milliseconds.""

Lanier said Thursday that the officers who reacted to the pursuit acted ""heroically"" under intense pressure. Given the route of the pursuit — from the White House to streets all around the Capitol building — officers did not know the intentions of the driver and had to respond assuming the worst.

""There were multiple vehicles that were rammed,"" Lanier said. ""There were officers that were struck. And two security perimeters that were attempted to be breached, so it does not appear in any way this was an accident.""

Lyman said officers could have tried to place tire-deflation devices on the road ahead of the driver. They could have used more cars to try and box her in.

Most important, Lyman said, Thursday's shooting should prompt D.C. law enforcement agencies to consider installing more pop-up vehicle barriers throughout the area. There are several such barriers — metal gates that can be raised up from the road — next to many federal buildings. But Lyman said Thursday's chase shows how they could be used along other streets in the capital region.

""These would not only stop a vehicle, they would give law enforcement officers the opportunity to apprehend without resorting to deadly force,"" he said. ""That should be a conversation that law enforcement should have in D.C.""

Alpert said the shooting should also prompt D.C. law enforcement to consider bolstering approaches to the White House, Capitol and other critical buildings.

After the driver rammed into the White House barriers, she was able to evade police and escape, starting the high-speed chase. Alpert said law enforcement should at least consider military-style entrances that include a wall that can be erected behind an approaching car to prevent it from getting a away.

""You drive up into a guard post. Once you get into that area, you're talking to the guard and if you're suspicious at all, they put up a huge barricade behind you,"" Alpert said. ""You're absolutely blocked in and have nowhere to go.""

Retired New York City police officer Valarie Carey, who is also the sister of shooting victim Miriam Carey, said late Friday that there was ""no need for a gun"" or deadly force to be used.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court turns down challenge to N.Y. concealed-carry law,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court left in doubt Monday whether gun owners have a 2nd Amendment right to carry a firearm in public.

Without a comment or dissent, the justices turned down a gun-rights challenge to a New York law that strictly limits who can legally carry a weapon when they are on the streets. To obtain a “concealed carry” permit, New Yorkers must convince a county official that they have a “special need for protection” that goes beyond living or working in a high-crime area.

Only about one-tenth of 1% of New Yorkers have concealed-carry permits, compared to more than 6% in the neighboring states of Connecticut and Pennsylvania, the court was told.

Several gun owners who were denied a “concealed carry” permit sued, arguing they had a 2nd Amendment right to carry a gun for self-defense.

Rather than hear their appeal, the high court let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court that held states have broad authority to regulate guns in public.

New York Atty. Gen. Eric Schneiderman said the decision keeps in place the state’s “sensible and effective regulations of concealed handguns. This is a victory for families across New York who are rightly concerned about the scourge of gun violence.”

The court’s refusal to hear an appeal does not set a legal precedent, and the justices do not explain their reasons for turning away a case.

For now, however, the reach of the 2nd Amendment right “to keep and bear arms” remains uncertain.

Advertisement

In a pair of decisions in 2008 and 2010, the Supreme Court struck down ordinances in Washington and Chicago because they prohibited all private possession of handguns, including keeping a gun at home for self-defense. The justices did not address whether this right to self-defense includes a right to be armed in public.

Most states allow law-abiding gun owners to obtain a concealed-carry permit.

However, at least six states besides New York, including California and Illinois, have laws that make it difficult or nearly impossible for gun owners to obtain a permit that allows them to be armed in public.

Those laws are under challenge in the lower courts.

The Illinois law, the nation’s strictest, was struck down in December by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. State lawmakers are considering a new law that would permit at least some gun owners to obtain a license for carrying a weapon.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco has also heard several 2nd Amendment challenges to counties in California that routinely deny concealed-carry permits.

The justices may well revisit the issue after rulings by several other lower courts.

In Pennsylvania, state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe declares that gun control advocates have “gone far enough.” And in North Dakota, state Rep. Roscoe Streyle says, “We know what’s right for our citizens.”

They are among a wave of lawmakers in at least 20 states who are pushing back against the Obama administration’s drive to pass tougher gun laws after the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. They seek to exempt their states from any new federal regulations.

Even before Congress votes on new gun laws, some state legislators are intent on promoting bills like the Firearms Freedom Act — introduced in Alabama, Michigan and Oklahoma, among other states — based on a theory that guns and ammunition made and kept within state borders do not involve interstate commerce and are out of Washington’s reach.

Other bills — such as Pennsylvania’s proposed Right to Bear Arms Protection Act — would make it a felony, punishable by up to seven years in prison for government officials to attempt to enforce new federal gun restrictions in their states. A Tennessee bill declares that any federal action seeking to restrict gun ownership in the state “shall be deemed an intentional violation of state sovereignty and shall be unenforceable within the borders of Tennessee.”

Wyoming’s Republican-controlled House has sent to the state Senate, on a 46-13 vote, a measure declaring unenforceable any future federal ban on semiautomatic weapons or limits on the size of ammunition magazines that remain exclusively in the state.

President Obama has called for background checks for all gun sales and reinstatement of bans that expired in 2004 on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Obama alluded to those proposals in his State of the Union address Tuesday, calling on Congress to bring them up for a vote.

A White House spokesman declined to comment on the wave of state legislation.

The spate of proposed state laws reflects the national schism of opinion on gun control.

While lawmakers in a number of states fight the Obama administration’s efforts, New York recently passed a tougher gun law. California is also considering strengthening its laws, including requiring background checks for anyone who buys bullets. Maryland is weighing new limits, including licensing for handgun buyers.

A group of Colorado Democrats is quickly moving forward with legislation to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines, expand background checks and hold gun makers and sellers liable for damage caused by their weapons, though that could conflict with a 2005 federal law shielding the industry from certain lawsuits.

Some legal experts said the states’ proposals to limit gun control would be unlikely to withstand a constitutional challenge. And it’s uncertain whether any will be signed into law.

A spokesman for Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, said the governor believed there were “plenty of ways for Wyoming to send a message voicing concern about infringements on the 2nd Amendment, but he is concerned about creating an unenforceable law.”

In Virginia, a GOP-sponsored measure to prohibit local and state officials from assisting federal authorities in enforcing any new gun restrictions ran into trouble after lawmakers raised concerns that it could cost the state federal aid.

Advertisement

A number of the gun rights measures are patterned after a 2009 Montana law. Its constitutionality is before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, with oral arguments set to begin in March.

Legal experts cite a 2005 Supreme Court ruling upholding federal restrictions on homegrown marijuana in California as the precedent that stands to doom the spate of gun exemption laws. The court ruled that because marijuana moved in a national market, the federal government could regulate its use, even if it were grown and used only in California.

“There’s apparently some people out there who have yet to read the Constitution,” said Ladd Everitt of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

But the bills are also designed to sway federal lawmakers. “It is time to send a message to those in Washington, D.C., that we will not stand for the continual erosion of our rights and freedoms,” Nebraska state Sen. Charlie Janssen said in an Internet message seeking support for his bill.

Advertisement

Metcalfe, a Republican who is the chief sponsor of the Pennsylvania Right to Bear Arms Protection Act, said the measure had generated more public reaction than any bill he had sponsored in 15 years in office.

The disparate state responses underscore the difficulty of reaching a political consensus on an issue that often divides lawmakers not just by party affiliation but also geography.

Indeed, after New York acted to tighten gun laws, Texas Atty. Gen. Greg Abbott ran an Internet ad inviting New Yorkers to keep their guns and come to the Lone Star State.

Williamson responded to Gabby Gifford's New York Times op-ed by churlishly calling her out as an embarrassment.



While Ms. Giffords certainly has my sympathy for the violence she suffered, it should be noted that being shot in the head by a lunatic does not give one any special grace to pronounce upon public-policy questions, nor does it give one moral license to call people “cowards” for holding public-policy views at variance with one’s own. Her childish display in the New York Times is an embarrassment.

I'll tell you what is an embarrassment, Mr. Williamson. It is a Senate who voted against the will of 90 percent of this nation and instead caved to the craven demands of the National Rifle Association. What is embarrassing is having people like you defend this action and take it upon yourself to decide that a shooting victim who was a member of the United States Congress has no moral license to speak out on behalf of the overwhelming majority of this country who stand in agreement with her. What is cringe-inducing is to have people who carry your same sentiments tell the parents of the children killed in the Newtown massacre that they should have no voice in the debate and declare they are merely being used as props.

Given the nation's focus right now on the drama unfolding in Boston, I expect your vile slam against Gabby Giffords will go largely unnoticed, Mr Williamson. However, I noticed and am compelled to share your shameful attack on her.

In the meantime, I stand with Ms. Giffords and will join her in her efforts to fire the members of Congress who chose to pander to the will of the NRA rather than the people they were sent to represent.

(CNN) – Dozens of retired senior military veterans are signing onto Americans for Responsible Solutions, the pro-gun control group of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly.

The new initiative, Veterans for Responsible Solutions, will support Giffords and Kelly's wider efforts by bringing to bear the experience of military veterans who've sworn to defend the Second Amendment and have themselves been well versed in the use of firearms.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Kelly is taking point on the initiative as a veteran himself. The former astronaut is a retired Navy captain, becoming a combat veteran as a military aviator.

""I've been shot at"" while flying, Kelly told reporters on a conference call organized to promote the initiative.

Moreover, there are guns in the Arizona home Kelly shares with Giffords he said, guns used for self-defense and target shooting.

The point Kelly was trying to prove is that neither he nor any member of his organization is looking to repeal or limit Second Amendment rights, likely because the perception of any move against gun ownership in the United States is bound to incite fierce opposition from the powerful pro-gun lobby.

""We're for gun rights,"" said James Barnett, a retired rear admiral.

Instead, Veterans for Responsible Solutions wants commonsense actions like universal background checks, Kelly said.

These are background checks an overwhelming majority of Americans have said they support, polls show.

Vance Coleman, a retired Army major general, said on the call that he also owns guns. But not everyone should, Coleman continued, namely criminals and the mentally ill.

""They should not own guns and the Congress needs to do something about that,"" Coleman said.

The exact functions of the veterans initiative remains fluid.

According to Kelly, some members will be doing little more than lending their names while others will be pursuing a greater measure of activism, perhaps by writing newspaper editorials.

Efforts at introducing universal background checks stalled when a Senate bill got 54 votes in April, six shy of the supermajority it would have needed.

The Obama administration's vow to fight on gained little traction, although there have been limited executive actions taken since then aimed at curbing gun violence.

On Friday Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius pushed new rules that would require mental illness to be treated the same as physical ailments.

Gun control activists and other have argued that not enough attention has been paid to treating the mentally ill when it comes to trying to prevent gun violence.

Politically, gun control has proven largely unpalatable, particularly with the successful recall elections in September of a pair of Democratic legislators in Colorado who helped push gun control measures.

Groups like the National Rifle Association argue that background checks and other restrictions harm only law-abiding gun owners while criminals will continue to obtain firearms illegally."

Kutztown%2C Shippensburg%2C Edinboro%2C Slippery Rock%2C Millersville universities changed policies

Students with concealed-carry permits had questioned the constitutionality of blanket weapons bans

22 states ban concealed weapons and 5 allow firearms on public university campuses

KUTZTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Students on some of Pennsylvania's college campuses might be carrying more than books.

At least five Pennsylvania state-owned universities are now allowing guns on campus after the state's lawyers concluded that an outright ban on weapons was likely unconstitutional.

Kutztown, Shippensburg, Edinboro, Slippery Rock and Millersville universities have all quietly changed their policies over the past year to reflect the advice of lawyers in the governor's office and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. Students in those schools are now allowed to have weapons on campus, though they are still generally banned from school buildings and athletic events.

Students with concealed-carry permits had questioned the constitutionality of blanket weapons bans at state-owned universities, prompting a legal review that found such bans were vulnerable to court challenge.

Pennsylvania is among 23 states that allow individual colleges or universities to decide if they'll ban concealed weapons on campus, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Twenty-two states ban concealed weapons and five — Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin — allow firearms on public university campuses.

Kutztown changed its policy April 19, though it had largely escaped notice until Kutztown President F. Javier Cevallos emailed students, faculty and staff about it Thursday night.

Under the new policy, licensed gun owners are permitted to bring their weapons onto campus, but not into buildings or athletic events without permission from the university police chief. The chief will consider making an exception if there is a ""compelling reason"" related to personal safety, the policy says.

Kutztown is not endorsing weapons on campus, spokesman Matt Santos said Friday.

""Our president does not believe that guns have a place on campus,"" he said. ""We will do what we can to keep our campus free of weapons and have written the policy to keep it as strong as possible to keep weapons away from buildings and campus events. We believe we provide a very safe environment for students to learn and live.""

Although there has been no legal challenge mounted in Pennsylvania, the state's lawyers cautioned that ""blanket firearms bans were vulnerable to constitutional challenge and exposed the universities"" to legal claims, said Nils Hagen-Frederiksen, a spokesman for the governor's Office of General Counsel.

About a year ago, the state system provided a model weapons policy for consideration by all 14 schools ""that more narrowly tailored the firearms restriction, addressing both public safety and constitutional concerns,"" Hagen-Frederiksen said.

Pennsylvania's concealed-carry law is silent on the issue of guns on college campuses. Other state laws do prohibit firearms in K-12 schools and court facilities, but there is no statute banning firearms possession at state-owned universities.

Thus ""an outright weapons ban on public college campuses may be a problem under Pennsylvania law,"" Michael Moreland, a vice dean and professor at Villanova University's law school, said via email.

Last year, he noted, the Colorado Supreme Court struck down the University of Colorado's ban, ruling it violated the state's concealed-carry law.

The new university weapons policies seemed unlikely to turn Pennsylvania's campuses into armed camps. At Kutztown, gun owners are generally limited to wandering the campus with their firearms, locking them in their cars, or checking them in at the police department.

Still, as word of the new policy spread across campus Friday, students debated whether it's a good idea to allow weapons.

""It promotes violence. You have lethal weapons on campus in a place where we're supposed to get a higher education, not carry bullets and guns and be prepared to kill someone. It's bizarre to me,"" said James Alexander, 21, a political science major from Pottstown.

But another student raised the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a gunman killed 32 students before committing suicide, to argue in favor of a well-armed student body.

""It could potentially have been stopped,"" said Tony Pavoncello, 20, a freshman from York. ""If one or more students had been armed and had been there when he came in the door, you never know what might have happened. It might have changed something.""

Pennsylvania's largest university, Penn State, bans all weapons from campus, though students who hunt or shoot recreationally are permitted to store them with police. Penn State receives a state appropriation each year but is not owned by the state. The University of Pittsburgh — likewise state-supported but not state-run — also prohibits weapons anywhere on campus.

""Our feeling is that police, who are trained in handling firearms, shooting accuracy during stressful situations and in making quick decisions and judgments, should be the ones with weapons,"" Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers said via email Friday. ""They are the experts.""

Gun-rights advocates including Students for Concealed Carry — a group launched in the wake of Virginia Tech —maintain that an armed campus is a safer campus because police typically can't respond quickly enough to stop a mass shooter in the act.

A campus police chiefs' association, the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, takes an opposing view. Its board has declared that allowing guns on campus could ""dramatically increase violence.""

Although Kutztown changed its rules just a few weeks ago, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education appeared to be having second thoughts Friday, telling all 14 member schools to hold off on weapons policy changes until a task force on campus safety can weigh in.

""Given the importance of this issue, the significance of this issue, we think it's a good idea to take a second look,"" state system spokesman Kenn Marshall said."

Steve and Amber Mostyn, wealthy Texas trial attorneys, said today that they are giving $1 million to help start the gun-control advocacy group formed by former Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly. Steve Mostyn, one of the top contributors to a super political action committee that assisted in President Barack Obama’s re-election effort, is listed as treasurer of Giffords’s new super-PAC, Americans for Responsible Solutions. Mostyn said the group will have a nonprofit wing, which will be used to conduct a public education campaign.

Mostyn said the super-PAC will counter the political contributions of the National Rifle Association, which is how he’s pitching it to other big Democratic donors.

If there is any real hope of effectively standing up to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby, it is certainly going to take a similarly well funded and organized effort. It is also probably going to take the charismatic image of a person like Giffords. Jim Brady and his supporters attempted to use his tragic experience to establish an effective gun control lobby. They had some successes, but I don't think that they ever became a political force that could counter balance the NRA.

The culture of guns and violence is deeply rooted in our society and history. There are many cultural divides in America. It is possible for some of them to coexist on the basis of live and let live. The issue of guns has become one where this isn't really a workable approach. The ready accessibility of high powered military style weapons poses a threat to the ability of other people to simply live. The political difficulty arises when attempts to find a workable approach to balancing concerns about public safety with the legal rights of gun owners are unable to move forward. The NRA and its allies are determined to block any and all attempts at better control and regulation. That is a force that must be vigorously opposed.

I think that I will take the news of this vote of confidence as reason to send my little mite to Ms. Giffords in support of her efforts. I hope that others here will consider doing likewise."

Colorado Senate President John Morse, who shepherded the legislation to passage, was defeated on a 51%-49% vote. Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo, a fellow Democrat who voted in favor of the measures, lost 56% to 44%. They were replaced by Republicans who opposed the new restrictions.

The recall was the first in the 100 years since Colorado adopted the constitutional provision and grew out of sweeping measures passed last winter after mass shootings at a school in Newtown, Conn., and at a movie theater in Aurora, outside Denver.

The laws limit gun magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks, to be paid for by the gun purchaser, among other restrictions. They passed without a single Republican vote. The laws, which took effect July 1, remain in force despite Tuesday’s vote.

Morse thanked his constituents for the chance to serve them and said “the Democratic Party will continue to fight.”

“The highest rank in a democracy is citizen, not Senate president, so soon, along with many of you, I will hold that rank and there’s nothing citizens can’t accomplish when they put their minds to accomplishing it,” Morse told disconsolate supporters at a party that turned into a political wake.

Although eclipsed nationally by the debate over Syria, the results could still resonate well beyond the Rockies. The national gun debate has always been less about numbers than the passions of a relatively small but fervent group of activists, and both sides invested heavily in the campaign, knowing the message the outcome would send.

Morse, a Colorado Springs lawmaker whose support was vital to enactment of the legislation, called the restrictions a measured, common-sense response to gun violence in a state with a long, venerated tradition of gun ownership.

Critics called the legislation an infringement of personal freedom and accused Morse of ramming it through the Democratic-run Legislature without enough public input or a single Republican vote. Grass-roots activists launched the recall effort even before Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper applied his signature.

What began as a local effort, however, quickly gained national attention once the recall question was cleared in mid-July for the ballot, drawing advocates on both sides hoping to either frighten or fortify lawmakers nationwide who might be considering similar legislation.

The National Rifle Assn. and its allies faced gun control supporters led by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, each side pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into the campaign.

Groups with other interests invested heavily as well, including organized labor, Planned Parenthood and the conservative Koch brothers, turning the contest into a wide-ranging free-for-all that surpassed, in Colorado, even the intensity of the 2012 presidential contest.

With the replacement of Morse and Giron by Republicans — former Colorado Springs Councilman Bernie Herpin and former Pueblo police officer George Rivera, respectively — the Democratic hold on the state Senate shrinks to just one seat. The party has a much larger majority in the state House, enough to thwart any legislative effort to overturn the gun laws.

Opponents are hoping to qualify a ballot initiative in 2014 that would repeal some of the provisions. A group of sheriffs has also filed suit to overturn the legislation.

The results in effect pushed up the retirement date for Morse, who was first elected in 2006 and termed out after 2014. He repeatedly said that even if he lost his job, passing the gun measures was worth the sacrifice. Giron, a freshman lawmaker, would have faced reelection in 2014.

Headlines from Newseum

A bipartisan deal to expand background checks on gun buyers, forged by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, is a step forward in a Senate debate on gun laws beginning Thursday. While the agreement falls short of what President Obama was hoping for in his gun proposals package, it may set out a promising path for meaningful gun control legislation — something that the president has pushed hard for since since the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown, Conn.

The Senate will cast its first vote this week on President Barack Obama's proposals to curb gun violence, which face a rough ride in Congress due to opposition from Republicans and gun rights activists. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid scheduled a procedural vote for Thursday to open debate on gun control and Democratic aides said they expect to defeat Republican efforts to block the bill from reaching the Senate floor.

Gun control efforts in Congress cleared a significant hurdle Wednesday as the Senate prepared to open what could be a weeks-long debate, even as opponents plotted a shift in strategy aimed at undermining a comprehensive package of legislation. Gaining enough support simply to open the debate has required extensive negotiation and legislative maneuvering, testimony to the difficult politics of gun control. If the Senate proceeds as scheduled Thursday, it will mark only the third time in a generation that a significant gun measure has come to the floor.

All the doom-and-gloomers need to read this and understand it: this is an uphill battle. Recognize success, such as it is, and build on it. The Newtown families have been an extraordinary force, as has local activism and the tireless work of advocacy groups around the country. This is a long term commitment.

Mandating seat belts took 19 years from Ralph Nader's Unsafe at Any Speed to the 1984 NY State first-in-nation law. Sensible gun legislation will take however long it takes."

David Guth, a tenured associate professor of journalism, tweeted Monday: ""The blood is on the hands of the #NRA. Next time, let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you."" The words came following the Navy Yard shooting in Washington.

Guth was put on paid administrative leave Friday, and the university has taken steps to distance itself from the tweet. In a statement reported by Fox4 in Kansas, the school's vice chancellor called the tweet ""repugnant,"" while Ann Brill, Kansas' journalism dean, said the university does not agree with Guth and does not ""advocate violence directed against any group or individuals.""

#NavyYardShooting The blood is on the hands of the #NRA. Next time, let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you. — David Guth (@DWGuth) September 16, 2013

While the university has taken steps against Guth, Republican state lawmakers want Guth fired. If he isn't, they say, the school could face consequences. State Senate President Susan Wagle (R-Wichita) and Senate Majority Leader Terry Bruce (R-Hutchison) have both issued statements calling for Guth's dismissal. State Sen. Greg Smith (R-Overland Park) released a statement Friday saying that unless further action is taken against Guth, he will react.

""As a public educator in the Kansas high school education system, I am often consulted by my students as to which college they should attend,"" Smith said in his statement. ""As long as Professor Guth remains employed by the University of Kansas I will no longer recommend the university as an institution worthy of attendance by any of my students nor, as a state senator, will I support any budget proposals or recommendations for the University of Kansas.""

Other Republican lawmakers echoed Smith's comments about the university budget. State Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (R-Palco) told The Huffington Post that the university's latest budget proposal is arriving this week on lawmakers' desks -- and it asks for an increase. Swift action against Guth is needed to show that the university does not tolerate his tweet, Couture-Lovelady said.

""It is a university decision,"" Couture-Lovelady said. ""We are elected representatives of the people who develop the budget for the university. I could see something like this being detrimental to their cause. Things like this hurt their cause, and it's unfortunate. I want to see them continue to grow.""

State Rep. Brett Hildabrand (R-Shawnee), one of the most vocal pro-Second Amendment legislators in Kansas, told HuffPost that he and other lawmakers have been in contact with the university to express their opinions that Guth should be fired.

""He went after the children of NRA members, and some of those children could be students in one of his classes,"" Hildabrand said. ""That sets up a hostile environment for the students.""

Guth has been standing by his comments, telling Fox4KC Thursday that he does not want people to be shot.

""If you look at how I structured the statement, I didn’t really bring [the NRA’s) children into it,” he said, according to Fox4KC. “I carefully structured the statement to make it conditional, but apparently it was too much of a nuance for some people.”

“I don’t want anybody harmed. If somebody’s going to be harmed, maybe it ought to be the people who believe that guns are so precious that it’s worth spilling blood over,” Guth added, according to Fox4KC. Guth did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.

Several lawmakers expressed concern that Guth's administrative leave is paid. Rep. Reid Petty (R-Liberal) said that while he doesn't think administrative leave is enough of a sanction for Guth, it's not the job of the legislature to interject itself into Guth's employment status.

""I don't think that it is appropriate for us,"" Petty said. ""We can share our opinions and you have the chancellor and the Board of Regents. If you had a pattern of professors saying outrageous things, then we could.""

Jack Martin, University of Kansas spokesman, said the university did not have a comment on the legislators. He referred back to the statement the school released announcing Guth's suspension.

All of the legislators contacted by HuffPost said they agree that Guth has a First Amendment right to free speech. But, they said, he's paid by the taxpayer and has embarrassed the state.

""He has freedom of speech. Speak all he wants as a former KU professor,"" state Rep. J.R. Claeys (R-Salina) told HuffPost. ""When he voices an insensitive and threatening opinion, he doesn't get to take the good image of our institutions down with him.""

UPDATE: 10:30 p.m. -- Guth told The Huffington Post in an email he agreed with University of Kansas officials' request to take paid administrative leave because of the threats. He explained:

""I have had conversations with the university and have agreed to this action -- an administrative leave with pay -- in light of the abusive email threats I and others have received. It is in it the best interests and peace of mind of our students that I remove myself from the situation and let cooler heads prevail. It is unfortunate that my comments have been deliberately distorted. I know what I meant. Unfortunately, this is a topic that generates more heat than light. I don't think any further comment would be appropriate at this time."""

The Manchin-Toomey amendment allows interstate sales and protects owners driving across state lines

Gun rights group says it%27s %22giving up an inch to get a mile%22

Gun control advocates want broader background checks but say amendment improves the current law

WASHINGTON -- The compromise background check provisions the Senate will begin debating Tuesday closes the gun show ""loophole,"" but also expands some gun rights. Activists on both sides of the gun debate say they see things to like in the measure.

The 49-page amendment by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., allows for interstate firearm sales, precludes states from enforcing local gun laws when gun owners are transporting guns across state lines, and imposes a 15-year prison term for any government official who keeps gun ownership records.

Gun rights activist Alan Gottlieb said that in this amendment, the gun lobby is ""giving up an inch to get a mile.""

""The bill gives us a lot of things we've been fighting for in Congress that I haven't been able to achieve in years,"" said Gottlieb, chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.

The group, which calls itself the ""common sense gun lobby,"" had input into the drafting of the amendment, as did the National Rifle Association. The NRA opposes the Manchin-Toomey amendment, calling it ""misguided.""

The amendment also allows state concealed carry permits to be used in place of a federal background check, allows active-duty military to buy guns in their home states, and speeds up sales by reducing the turnaround time for background checks.

The Manchin-Toomey deal helped to break a threatened filibuster of the gun bill last week, allowing the Senate to take it up beginning Tuesday and possibly continuing for weeks.

It closes the ""loopholes"" for gun shows and Internet sales, but stops short of the universal background checks contained in the original bill -- proposed by President Obama and supported by 83% of Americans in a USA TODAY/Pew Research Center poll.

""Our assessment is at the end of the day is that this something that will do more good than bad, and it will save lives,"" said Ladd Everitt of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which includes religious groups, doctors and public health organizations. ""This is not a universal background check bill, and that's unfortunate.""

For example, the bill would exempt gun sales -- such as flea markets -- with less than 75 guns. It would maintain a friends and family exemption and other unadvertised ""word of mouth"" sales.

One key provision that both sides support: Beefing up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to include mental health records and other convictions missing from the current database. Manchin said the bill uses a ""carrot-and-stick"" approach, spending $400 million over four years to upgrade the system, but withholding federal funds from states that don't improve their data. It is not clear where the funding for this provision would come from.

The amendment is the first of what could be dozens of amendments to the gun bill, from both sides of the aisle. As of Monday, only five amendments had been formally introduced. The other four are:

• The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act (Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. and two co-sponsors) increases the maximum penalty for ""straw buying"" a firearm from a federally licensed dealer — that is, buying a gun for someone else to evade a background check — to 15 years. It also bans the transfer of guns to someone the seller knows is prohibited from owning firearms, and makes it a crime to smuggle firearms out of the United States.

• The Assault Weapons Ban (Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and 22 co-sponsors) prohibits the sale, transfer and importation of assault rifles, including 157 specifically mentioned in the law. The definition is broader than the ban in place from 1994 to 2004 but grandfathers current lawful owners of assault weapons.

• The Large-Capacity Magazine Feeding Devices Amendment (Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. and 21 co-sponsors) bans magazines and other devices holding more than 10 rounds. It exempts .22 caliber rifles, and ownership by current and former police officers for on- or off-duty use.

• The No Firearms for Foreign Felons Act (Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and three co-sponsors) expands the offenses that disqualify someone from purchasing a firearm to include felony convictions in foreign courts. But there's an exception if the convict can show a denial of due process or that the offense would not have been illegal in the United States."

The federal suit, filed in Buffalo, said the law violates the constitutional rights of ""law-abiding citizens to keep commonly possessed firearms in the home for defense of self and family and for other lawful purposes.""

In announcing the NRA's support for the lawsuit, Chris Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""usurped the legislative and democratic process"" in passing the measures without sufficient input from the public.

“Despite the wishes of Governor Cuomo, law-abiding citizens have a fundamental right to keep commonly possessed firearms for defense of themselves and their families and for other lawful purposes including the enjoyment of New York’s rich hunting and sporting heritage,” Cox said in a news release.

The challenge takes aim at two key provisions of the law: a lower limit on magazine capacity and an expansion of the state's assault weapons ban to include some popular and formerly legal semi-automatic rifles.

The law pushed through by Cuomo on Jan. 15 -- the first new gun restrictions in the nation following the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. -- also requires registration of an estimated 1 million older guns.

Other provisions require five-year renewals of handgun licenses statewide, direct mental health professionals to notify authorities of patients deemed likely to seriously hurt themselves or others and require federal background checks for private gun sales in New York. It will require registration of ammunition sellers and buyers.

The law also reduces the size of legal magazines from 10 bullets to seven, though lawmakers and Cuomo have recently proposed amending that.

The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, the lead plaintiff and NRA affiliate, said it was bringing the suit on behalf of its 45,000 members. President Tom King has estimated there are about 4.75 million gun owners among New York's 19 million residents. Other plaintiffs include the Westchester County Firearms Owners Association, Beikrich Ammunition Corp., Blueline Tactical & Police Supply, gun manufacturer Bedell Custom and the Sportsmen's Association for Firearms Education.

""Criminals have and use magazines without any limitation in capacity. The act's provisions on magazines put law-abiding citizens at a grave disadvantage to criminals, who will not comply with the seven-round limit,"" the suit said. Likewise, it said the ban on assault weapons, ""a pejorative term,"" is being broadened ""to describe countless numbers of rifles, handguns and shotguns that were commonly possessed under prior law.""

The suit seeks a ruling that both provisions violate the constitution's Second Amendment right to bear arms and the 14th Amendment right to equal protection under the laws as well as injunctions stopping enforcement. The suit does not challenge many other provisions, including stronger penalties for gun crimes.

State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, named along with Cuomo as a defendant, said Thursday the law is ""making New York communities safer, while ensuring constitutional protections to responsible gun owners. My office will continue to aggressively defend the protections embodied in the law because every New Yorker deserves to live in a safe neighborhood free from the threat of gun violence,"" he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/yorks-assault-weapon-registration-begins-150938487.html,,[],New York's assault weapon registration begins,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Key measures of New York's tough new gun law kicked in Monday, with owners of firearms now reclassified as assault weapons required to start registering the firearms and new limits on the number of bullets allowed in magazines.

As the new provisions took effect, New York's affiliate of the National Rifle Association planned to file a court request for a federal injunction to immediate halt to the magazine limit.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls those and other provisions in the state's new gun law common sense while dismissing criticisms he says come from ""extreme fringe conservatives"" who claim the government has no right to regulate guns.

""Yes, they are against it, but they are the extremists and the extremists shouldn't win, especially on this issue when it is so important to the majority,"" Cuomo said in a radio interview last week. ""In politics, we have to be willing to take on the extremists, otherwise you will see paralysis.""

New York's new gun restrictions, the first in the nation passed following December's massacre at a Connecticut elementary school, limit state gun owners to no more than seven bullets in magazines, except at competitions or firing ranges.

The new regulations in New York commence as the U.S. Senate prepares to debate expanded gun legislation and weeks after Connecticut joined Colorado in signing into law tougher new gun restrictions.

The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, the state's NRA affiliate, has a pending federal lawsuit against the new provisions. Attorney Brian Stapleton said the request for an immediate halt to the magazine limit would be filed electronically, probably late Monday or possibly early Tuesday.

The law violates the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens ""to keep commonly possessed firearms"" at home for self-defense and for other lawful purposes, the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association said in court papers. It is advising members to obey the law in the meantime.

Story continues

""We are lawful and legal citizens of New York state and we always obey the law,"" association President Tom King said. ""It's as simple as that.""

The new registrations, required over the next year, will be the group's focus later, King said.

State Police posted forms Monday on their website for registration, which can be filed electronically. Owners of those guns, now banned from in-state sales, are required within a year to register them. Alternatively, they can legally sell them to a licensed dealer or out of state by next Jan. 15.

Rich Davenport, recording secretary of the Erie County Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs, said their nearly 11,000 members are united in opposition to the law, which he considers a hasty, illogical and emotional response to the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. He also questioned likely compliance with the registration requirement.

""I'm guessing it'll be pretty low,"" said Davenport, a longtime hunter. He said that even though he's not personally affected by the registration provision, ""I'm offended as an American.""

The toughest part of the new statute — banning in-state sales of those guns newly classified as ""assault weapons"" — immediately took effect Jan. 15. The new classification related to a single military-style feature, such as a pistol grip on semi-automatic rifles with detachable magazines. Other listed features include a folding or thumbhole stock, bayonet mount, flash suppressor, or second protruding grip held by the non-trigger hand.

It requires owners to register an estimated 1 million guns previously not classified as assault weapons by April 15, 2014, though law enforcement officials acknowledge they don't know exactly how many such guns New Yorkers have.

The assault weapon definition also applies to some shotguns and handguns. They include shotguns that are semi-automatic, or self-loading, and have another feature, such as a folding stock, a second handgrip held by the non-shooting hand or the ability to accept a detachable magazine.

Also covered are semi-automatic pistols that can take detachable magazines and have another feature, such as a folding or thumbhole stock, a second handgrip and a threaded barrel that can accept a silencer.

Many county boards in New York have passed resolutions urging at least partial repeal of the law while warning that new registration requirements would be a costly burden on them.

Herkimer County Clerk Sylvia Rowan said Thursday she had received no registration forms for those guns. ""There's a lot of confusion on this,"" she said.

Rowan noted that she had received few formal requests filed from the holders of the county's 12,000 pistol permits to exempt their information from public disclosure, something else authorized under the new law.

Passed Jan. 15, a month after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., the statute originally banned magazines with more than seven bullets effective April 15. Connecticut officials said that shooter Adam Lanza used a semi-automatic Bushmaster AR-15 and five 30-round magazines to kill 20 children and six adults in minutes.

However, acknowledging that manufacturers don't make seven-bullet magazines, the Cuomo administration and New York lawmakers amended their law on March 29, keeping 10-bullet magazines legal but generally illegal to load them with more than seven bullets.

The statute restates the ban on magazines with capacity to hold more than 10 bullets, while adding also banning those that were grandfathered in under the old law.

The new Colorado bill, signed into law last month, bans ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.

Bruce Abramski is a former police officer whose uncle wanted to buy a firearm. His uncle is a law-abiding person who can legally purchase, but since Abramski is a former policeman, there are gun shops where he can buy firearms at a discount. Thus, he decided to buy the gun for his uncle.

Everyone who purchases a firearm at a federally-licensed firearm retail store is familiar with Form 4473. The form is created by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and, among other things, asks whether you are the actual purchaser of the firearm, versus purchasing for someone else. Form 4473 tells you that if you say you are not the actual buyer, you cannot purchase the gun.

Abramski and his uncle checked with several gun dealers, all of whom said the legal way to proceed was for Abramski to purchase in his home state of Virginia as the actual buyer, then go to his uncle’s home in Pennsylvania, where they could go to another federally-licensed firearm dealer to have his uncle fill out the same ATF paperwork and undergo the same background check, then have the firearm transferred to the uncle.

Abramski did so. Then he was charged and convicted of a federal felony for making a false statement that is “intended or likely to deceive” a gun dealer “with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the [gun] sale.”

Federal appeals courts with jurisdiction over many of the states in America understand that this provision of federal law is designed only to prevent “straw man” sales, where a buyer obtains the firearm on behalf of a convicted felon, domestic batterer, mentally ill person, or some other sort of person prohibited from buying guns. It is to make sure someone doesn’t get a gun on behalf of someone else who would be refused the sale after they failed a federal background check. In the Supreme Court’s words from 1976, it is to “keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency.” It was not written to prevent a policeman from being a nephew who tried to save his law-abiding uncle some money.

Nonetheless, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond (with jurisdiction over the Mid-Atlantic states) agreed with two other federal appeals courts in holding that when Abramski checked the box affirming he was the purchaser, he committed a serious federal crime.

If Abramski purchased the gun on his own, then decided to give it to his uncle as a free gift, that would be legal. Or if Abramski bought it for himself, then the following week decided to sell it to his uncle, that would be legal. But because his uncle wrote him a check for the gun before Abramski went to the store to buy the gun, and thus was acting as his uncle’s agent to buy a gun, Abramski became a federal felon.

Question 11a on Form 4473 is poorly worded. That wording was chosen by ATF, not Congress. If Question 11a instead asked if you are purchasing on behalf of someone who cannot legally purchase a firearm, then Abramski would honestly have said “no,” and there would not be any criminal conviction.

On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court granted review in Abramski v. U.S. Arguments are likely around February, with a decision before July 2014.

(The Washington Post)

President Obama delivered an impassioned and urgent plea in West Hartford, Conn., Monday evening for swift action, asking a state still shaken by the Newtown school massacre why there isn’t more support in Congress for gun control legislation. (The Washington Post)

New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, one of the nation’s most committed and deep-pocketed gun-control proponents, is ratcheting up pressure on lawmakers by launching a new system to grade them based on their votes and statements on gun issues.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the nonprofit group financed by Bloomberg (I), will unveil a scoring system Tuesday to award lawmakers grades of A through F, much like the National Rifle Association, which has derived much of its power by deploying letter rankings against politicians at election time. The group’s strategists briefed The Washington Post on the plans ahead of Tuesday’s announcement.

“For decades, the NRA has done an admirable job of tracking to minute detail how members of Congress stand on gun bills. We’ve simply decided to do the same,” said Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which is chaired by Bloomberg and is made up of more than 900 mayors from across the country.

This is Bloomberg’s latest move to establish his organization as a counterweight to the influential NRA and to create legislative momentum on Capitol Hill around President Obama’s proposals to toughen the nation’s gun laws.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns will start airing a 60-second ad on Tuesday featuring Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse Lewis, was killed in December’s elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn. The group is spending more than $1 million to air the ad on cable news in Washington and on television stations in 10 targeted states, officials said.

View Graphic How the NRA exerts influence over Congress

The group is targeting Sens. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Daniel Coats (R-Ind.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.).

The group also this week will begin airing a new television ad statewide in Pennsylvania focused on Toomey, who quietly has been negotiating on a compromise on expanding background checks with Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). The ad highlights Toomey’s past statements in support of the idea and urges Pennsylvanians to call his office to “demand action” when a background-check bill comes up for a vote in coming days.

The group’s new ratings system would produce a scorecard for senators and representatives that could serve as a guide for voters as well as campaign donors heading into the 2014 midterm elections and in future campaign cycles.

Glaze outlined a sophisticated algorithm that would weigh lawmakers’ votes on gun bills as well as their public statements and other actions to issue overall letter grades.

“Not every member can vote for every bill, but if not, there are other things they can and should be doing, and we will have our eye out for those as well,” Glaze said.

A good grade could reward a vulnerable lawmaker for backing tougher gun laws, the thinking goes, while a poor grade would publicly shame a politician who votes against popular ideas such as universal background checks.

Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor, has said he would tap his personal fortune to finance television ad campaigns defending lawmakers who vote for gun-control measures and attacking those who do not.

Earlier this year, Bloomberg spent more than $2 million on an ad blitz for a special primary election in an Illinois congressional district to deny the seat to NRA-backed former congresswoman Debbie Halvorson, a Democrat.

The Mayors Against Illegal Guns scoring system was developed in part because major political donors who support gun control have been seeking guidance about how to direct their contributions in upcoming election cycles, Glaze said.

Some influential Democratic benefactors, including businessman Kenneth Lerer and technology entrepreneur David Bohnett, have warned publicly that they will not write another check to Senate Democrats who do not vote to expand background checks.

“The appetite for information about where members are is very high,” Glaze said. Of the scorecard, he added: “We don’t intend that this will be a tree falling in the forest. We intend for people to have all the information they need to make sound voting and political-contribution decisions.”

The grading system is most directly a threat to Democrats from conservative states such as Arkansas, Montana and North Carolina who could feel compelled to vote against some gun measures because of the large number of gun owners in their states yet rely on donations from liberal donors in places such as California and New York to fuel their campaigns.

It is too soon to know whether Bloomberg’s new and untested scorecard will have the same impact as the NRA’s. For decades, Republicans as well as Democrats from more conservative states — including Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) — have campaigned on their “A” ratings from the NRA.

“The reason NRA scorecards are effective is that they have the weight of approximately 5 million dues-paying members and tens of millions of other supporters behind them,” NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said. In a dig at Bloomberg, he added, “We’ll take that over the purse of one billionaire any day of the week and twice on Sunday.”

Mayors Against Illegal Guns has been airing television ads in 10 key states for two weeks, and the results are uncertain. The group is trying to pressure lawmakers to vote for expanding background checks, but a deal in the Senate has proved elusive and many of the targeted senators have been circumspect about their positions.

“It is close to impossible to get a senator who is the subject of an ad to tell you whether it helps or it hurts,” Glaze said. “I think the proof will be in what the Senate ends up producing.”

An agreement would be a bold first step toward consideration of legislation to limit gun violence in the wake of the mass shootings at a Connecticut elementary school in December and comes as the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected this week to begin considering new proposals to limit gun violence.

The talks, led by two Democrats and two Republicans, are expected to earn more GOP support in the coming days and likely enough to move the bill through the Senate, according to senior aides of both parties who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

“These negotiations are challenging, as you’d expect on an issue as complicated as guns,” the chief negotiator, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), said in a statement Saturday. “But all of the senators involved are approaching this in good faith. We are all serious about wanting to get something done, and we are going to keep trying.”

Resolution of whether to keep records of private sales is key to earning the support of one of the Republicans involved in the talks, Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, who has a solid A-rating from the influential National Rifle Association and could provide political cover for lawmakers of both parties who are wary of supporting the plan.

Coburn has declined to comment on the talks, saying recently that “I don’t negotiate through the press.”

Democrats say that keeping records of private sales is necessary to enforce any new law and because current federal law requires licensed firearm dealers to keep records. Records of private sales also would help law enforcement trace back the history of a gun used in a crime, according to Democratic aides. Republicans, however, believe that records of private sales could put an undue burden on gun owners or could be perceived by gun rights advocates as a precursor to a national gun registry.

Coburn and Schumer are joined in their talks by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), while aides in both parties anticipate that Republican Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Susan Collins (Maine) could also endorse the plan soon. McCain and Collins have said they generally support legislation expanding background checks, while a Flake spokeswoman said Saturday that he is still reviewing the proposal.

More Republican support is anticipated in part because the four senators involved in the talks have agreed that any new background check program would exempt private transactions between family members or people who completed a background check in order to obtain a concealed-carry permit, according to aides.

But the four senators are grappling with how to make the process of obtaining a background check as seamless as possible for private dealers while also ensuring that someone keeps a record of the transaction.

Senators are considering whether to establish a new online portal where buyers and sellers could conduct the background check or to allow federally licensed gun retailers like Wal-Mart or Dick’s Sporting Goods to charge a small fee to conduct background checks for private dealers, aides said. A record of the sale then could be turned over to a licensed retailer, sent to the gun’s manufacturer or kept by the seller.

The background check proposal is considered the most politically viable plan among several introduced in the weeks since the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. Schumer is facing pressure from the White House and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) to draft a bill by this week in time for the committee to consider as early as Thursday, when the panel is scheduled to meet to review bills.

Aides expect that the committee will not pass a comprehensive bill, but instead will refer individual proposals to the full Senate. In addition to the background check bill, aides expect the panel to approve a bill that would make gun trafficking a federal crime for the first time. Less certain is the fate of bills limiting the size of ammunition magazines and a ban of military-style assault weapons; those measures face opposition from Republicans and some moderate Democrats.

During a town-hall meeting in Arizona last week, McCain bluntly told the mother of a victim of the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting that the assault weapons ban will not pass in the House or Senate “because a majority of members of Congress don’t support it.”

Meanwhile, House Republicans are beginning work on gun legislation even though GOP leaders have said the House would not touch the issue until after the Senate acted.

“We’re obviously interested in what the Senate does, but we are hard at work on this issue right now, studying information available,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in an interview with C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” program airing Sunday that included questions from a Washington Post reporter.

Goodlatte added that any discussion of new gun laws should come only if the Obama administration steps up enforcement of current laws.

“There are laws on the books right now that prohibit the illegal sale of firearms to people who shouldn’t be buying them, people who shouldn’t be selling them, and they’re just not being enforced as well as they could be,” Goodlatte told C-SPAN. “It would save a lot of lives if they were.”

Nine states have proposed such legislation since President Obama and fellow Democrats in the Senate began trying to tighten federal gun laws in the wake of several mass shootings that occurred within months of each other.

“There’s a lot of momentum,” Montana activist Gary Marbut told FoxNews.com on Monday.

Marbut was behind the original Firearms Freedom Act, which says the Commerce Clause allowing Congress to regulate inter-state commerce does not apply to the in-state manufacturing, selling and ownership of firearms. Montana passed the bill in 2009.

Since then, a host of other states have tried to pass copycat legislation. Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington have proposed such legislation since January -- following the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting in which 20 first-graders and six adults were killed inside a Newtown, Conn., elementary school.

However, Montana's legislation is hardly settled law. Shortly after the law passed in his state, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote Marbut to say federal law still supersedes.

Marbut acknowledges he wrote the legislation to set up a legal challenge and “roll back a half a century of bad precedent.”

The bill is scheduled to finally get its day in court when the Ninth Circuit begins oral arguments March 4. Marbut expects to lose in the liberal-leaning court, which includes San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Ore. But he thinks such a decision will put him in a better position to appeal to the country’s highest court.

“The mood of the country is right for the Supreme Court to consider what I think is a great mistake,” said Marbut.

Marbut, a shooting-range supplier, says existing big-name gun manufacturers are “not players” in the case because they have a nationwide market regulated by federal law. However, small upstart companies including gunsmiths and mom-and-pop operations would likely be able to make and sell guns within states, if the courts rule in his favor.

“Making firearms is not rocket science,” Marbut said.

The proposals have gotten plenty of pushback. State Democratic Rep. Robyn Driscoll criticized the Montana legislature for passing the law at the time, telling The Wall Street Journal a couple years ago that lawmakers wouldn’t support funding for education or women’s clinics but passed “this blatantly unconstitutional bill to pay for a Supreme Court fight.”

Montana passed the law at a time when gun control still was not widely discussed on Capitol Hill. Now, Obama and Senate Democrats have proposed legislation that essentially calls for a universal background check for potential gun buyers and re-instituting a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

While the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights advocacy groups have mounted their opposition based largely on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, Marbut is focused on the 10th Amendment that focuses more on the limits of federal power.

Eight states including Montana, Arizona, Alaska and Tennessee have passed similar legislation, while 17 have had bills proposed but not passed in prior sessions."

He and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. have spent weeks crisscrossing the country, making a forceful case for a package of laws that would reduce gun violence. At every stop, including one on Wednesday in Denver, he has demanded that Congress require universal background checks, ban assault weapons and large ammunition magazines, and prohibit gun trafficking. He has invoked the bloodshed in Newtown, Conn., and the daily toll that adds up to 30,000 gun deaths a year.

“If there is just one step we can take to prevent more Americans from knowing the pain that some of the families who are here have known, don’t we have an obligation to try?” he asked in Denver. “Don’t we have an obligation to try?”

But the president has been unable to break through the blockade set up by one of the most powerful and relentless lobbies in Washington. The assault weapons battle has already been lost, and it is increasingly doubtful that there will be enough votes in the Senate to support the expansion of background checks, the centerpiece of Mr. Obama’s agenda. (Sixty votes will be required to break the filibuster promised by the most extreme Republican senators, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.) Even the gun trafficking provision, which seemed the easiest to pass, is being torn apart by the National Rifle Association, which put forward a substitute version that would eviscerate the prohibition on straw purchases of guns.

The gun lobby is a combination of forces that includes manufacturers, hunters and hobbyists, political opportunists, and a fanatically active faction that believes guns are needed to fight off the conquest of freedom by the government. That faction is represented by the group Gun Owners of America, which has spent the months since Newtown doing tremendous damage, insisting that expanded background checks will lead to a gun registry that will assist a secret plan by the president to seize every firearm."

The combatants in the political debate over gun violence have a new issue: the White House photo of President Obama skeet shooting.

""One picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun-control scheme imaginable,"" said a statement from Andrew Arulanandam, spokesman for the National Rifle Association.

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre dismissed the photo on Fox News Sunday, saying Obama's call for universal background checks will lead to a national registry of guns. LaPierre said, ""I don't think you can trust these people.""

Senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeted out the photo Saturday, responding to those who questioned Obama's statement that he had shot skeet at Camp David. Pfeiffer wrote, ""For all the 'skeeters:' POTUS shoots clay targets on the range at Camp David on Aug. 4, 2012.""

David Plouffe, a longtime adviser to the president, taunted the president's critics on Twitter. After the photoshop release, Plouffe wrote, ""Attn skeet birthers. Make our day - let the photoshop conspiracies begin!""

Later, Plouffe tweeted, ""Day made. The skeet birthers are out in full force in response to POTUS pic. Makes for most excellent, delusional reading.""

The issue initially surfaced a week ago during an interview with The New Republic:

""The New Republic: Have you ever fired a gun?

""Obama: Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.

""The New Republic: The whole family?

""Obama: Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.

""Part of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas. And if you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were ten, and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your family's traditions, you can see why you'd be pretty protective of that.

""So it's trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months. And that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/16/conservatives-confident-on-gun-measures/,2013-03-16 00:00:00,[],Conservatives confident federal gun measures will be scaled back,"Conservatives are all but declaring victory on their defense of gun rights, exuding confidence as calls for aggressive controls in the wake of the Newtown elementary school massacre have given way to scaled-back expectations to firearm restrictions in Congress.

""They can call me crazy and whatever else they want, but NRA's nearly 5 million members and America's 100 million gun owners will not back down — not now, not ever,"" an emboldened Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, told conservatives gathered at an annual conference. He pointedly ignored President Barack Obama's most restrictive proposals in his speech, using it instead to assail the one that has the potential of getting approved — a near-universal background check for gun owners.

It's a sign that LaPierre — and others at the Conservative Political Action Conference — thinks the nation's largest pro-gun lobby has successfully beaten back the most limiting proposals.

Indeed, a bipartisan deal on near-universal background checks for firearms buyers remains a real possibility. And Congress still could pass a ban on high-capacity magazines. But Democrats haven't been able to muster enough support, even within their own ranks, to push through an assault weapons ban.

That's by far the most restrictive of the series of changes Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have sought following the Connecticut school shooting that killed 26 children and educators and a series of deadly shootings in Aurora, Colo., Oak Creek, Wis., and elsewhere.

In the hallways of the Conservative Political Action Conference, many activists echoed LaPierre. Few of them talked with urgency about the outcome of an assault weapons ban or some of the other proposed restrictions. And many exuded a quiet confidence that a divided Congress won't act on even the more modest proposal to implement mandatory background checks.

""I don't think it's going to get done,"" said Randy Smith, a California technology company owner. ""There's no way.""

Mel Wilcox, a medical professor from Birmingham, Ala., who owns guns and hunts, said he ""doesn't really have a problem"" with the mandatory background checks but said he didn't expect Congress to act. ""I don't think they'll ever push something through,"" he said.

Several activists pointed to simple arithmetic to explain their confidence in limited gun measures: Republicans remain adamantly opposed to restrictions to assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and several Senate Democrats are facing re-election next year in rural states populated with many gun owners.

""There are too many Democrats who know they won't last long,"" said William Temple, a tea party member from Brunswick, Ga.

Connor Martin, Marine veteran and a gun owner from Bay City, Wis., said the upcoming re-election campaigns of several Senate Democrats, including Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Max Baucus of Montana, would make it extremely difficult for Democrats to muster enough votes to pass the changes.

It's clear where Republicans in Congress stand on the measures.

Every Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted against bills the panel approved this week on background checks and the assault weapons ban. A third measure toughening federal penalties against illegal gun trafficking won committee passage last week with the support of only one Republican — Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the top GOP committee member. The other seven GOP senators opposed it. A fourth bill, slightly increasing federal aid for school safety, passed the committee with bipartisan support.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has said he will decide soon how to bring the measures to the Senate floor, where debate is expected next month.

In his speech, LaPierre called the proposal for mandatory background checks for gun owners a ""placebo"" that would not make schools or streets safer but would lead to a registration of lawful gun owners — lists that he said could be made public in local newspapers.

""In the end, there are only two reasons for government to create that federal registry of gun owners: to tax them or to take them,"" he said.

LaPierre ridiculed Biden's suggestion during a Facebook town last month that women like his wife, Jill, could fire ""two blasts"" from a shotgun if they felt threatened.

""Have they lost their minds over at the White House?"" LaPierre said, noting that Biden has had armed protection in the Senate and as vice president. ""You keep your advice. We'll keep our guns.""

Support for the NRA was omnipresent at the conference. Many participants wore red NRA stickers on their coats with the motto, ""Stand and Fight,"" and an NRA booth in the conference's exhibit hall offered bright-orange bags with pamphlets and bumper stickers carrying the group's message. The sign above the booth underscored the NRA's heft: ""I'm a bitter gun owner and I vote.""

Prominent Republicans have expressed support from the podium.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told attendees that the path forward for the GOP was ""rooted in respect for the Constitution and respect for the individual. Part of that respect is allowing Americans to freely exercise one of their most basic rights, the right to bear arms.""

The White House expressed support Friday that some compromise could be found. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said aboard Air Force One en route to Chicago that nothing proposed by Obama would ""take a firearm away from a law-abiding citizen.""

""There's plenty of common ground for us to seize, to move forward, that would reduce gun violence in our communities,"" Earnest said."

Obama addresses a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night

Rep. Steve Stockman%2C R-Texas%2C opposes Obama%27s gun proposals

Rocker Ted Nugent, who made fiery comments about the Obama administration last year, will be attending the State of the Union address on Tuesday as a guest of GOP Rep. Steve Stockman.

The Secret Service talked to Nugent last year after the musician, a long-time NRA board member, criticized President Obama and the Supreme Court at the National Rifle Association meeting in St. Louis.

Nugent, who supported Republican Mitt Romney for president, said if Obama won re-election, ""I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year.""

The rocker, best known for his hit 1970s hit Cat Scratch Fever, said he never threatened Obama and described his Secret Service sit-down as a ""good, solid, professional meeting.""

Stockman's office will be scheduling interviews for Nugent after Obama's remarks to a joint session of Congress. Each rank-and-file member of Congress is entitled to invite one guest to these joint sessions.

""I am excited to have a patriot like Ted Nugent joining me in the House chamber to hear from President Obama,"" said Stockman, R-Texas. ""After the address, I'm sure Ted will have plenty to say.""

Stockman, who returned to Congress in January after a 16-year hiatus, garnered headlines by threatening to impeach Obama if he used executive privilege to push gun-control legislation. Obama has proposed several measures, including a new assault weapons ban, a limit on the capacity of ammunition clips, and universal background checks.

The gun legislation faces fierce resistance from Republicans in Congress. Stockman, who backed off the impeachment threat, recently introduced legislation to repeal zero-tolerance laws for guns in school zones.

It used to be that law enforcement couldn't search you without probable cause, but now we're becoming a quasi-police state where one minute you're home quietly reading 50 Shades of Grey, and suddenly there's a SWAT team in your living room waving guns. And you're going, ""No, no, Katt Williams lives next door!""

Now, last month, while no one was taking anyone's guns from anybody, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to reauthorize a program where they can collect data on any American citizen and hold onto it forever. They can look at your e-mails, your texts, your Skypes, and not a peep out the crowd that's always bitching about what the framers intended. In fact, the answer from almost everyone seems to be, ""Oh what the hell, the airport screeners have already seen my ass anyway.""

The Facebook generation, especially, doesn't seem to care that Big Brother knows everything about you — what books you read, what movies you watch, your Match.com account, your other Match.com account when you're feeling a little freaky and wanna meet the sort of woman your regular Match.com account wouldn't approve of.

Call me old school, but I don't want the feds Googling what I'm Googling. It's bad enough when Netflix pries into my private life. ""You watched The Walking Dead and Zombieland. You might also like this interview with John McCain.""

(audience laughter)

I don't want the government doing that! ""You downloaded this article favoring the legalization of marijuana. You might also like being incarcerated.""

You know, they always say these programs are just to catch terrorists. The next thing you know, they're using them to shut down the pot dispensaries. And that place was right on my way home! Now I gotta go to Valley Village!

Doesn't anyone care that this is the new normal? I guess not, because gun nuts don't care, and neither do liberals. When Bush did warrantless wiretapping, oh, he was wiping his ass with the Constitution. But when Obama does it, oh well, whatever helps Jessica Chastain find bin Laden, we're good with that.

(smattering of audience applause)

Yeah, both parties compete mightily to appear to be the greater champion of our freedoms, but the only thing that still has bipartisan support in Washington is not giving a shit about privacy.

And when you talk to the NRA types, as I like to do down at my local moose lodge, they actually believe that what protects their rights isn't laws, or courts, it's that they have a gun. They think that's what keeps the government from going too far. Without guns, Obama would become an emperor and force everyone to gay marry, but he can't because a guy in Kentucky named Skeeter has a .22.

(audience applause)

Except that, you know, while you guys were buying guns to protect your other guns, sittin' up on the porch there, waitin' for Obama's Negro Army to come confiscate your weapons and go all Django Unchained on your ass — that's when we lost all the stuff in the Bill of Rights, about trials and juries and warrants.

You see, the Redcoats — they never wanted your gun. They wanted your liberty. And that's why the Founding Fathers said you could have the gun, dumbass! And now the only right we have left is the guns, and left nothing left to use the guns to protect! We're like a strip club with a million bouncers and no strippers!"

Parents at a high school near Dallas say the authors of a book on U.S. history misfired when they defined the Second Amendment -- and now one of the book's co-authors says the book is being revised.

The work book used at Guyer High School in the city of Denton, ""The United States History: Preparing for the Advanced Placement Examination,"" includes the ""summary"" definition of the Second Amendment to include the right to ""keep and bear arms in a state militia.""

The edited definition is seen by gun-rights advocates as an affront to the Second Amendment, which states in full: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""

Parents at the school criticized the book for distorting the definition of the Second Amendment in favor of those opposed to gun rights.

John J. Newman, the book's co-author, told FoxNews.com that the text of the book was written before the 2008 Supreme Court ruling, District of Columbia v. Heller, which protects individuals' rights to possess firearms. He said the book's only intent was to summarize the Second Amendment and admitted that the current definition is incorrect. But he said a revised and corrected edition is set to be sold in May 2014.

""There was no devious intention in the definition,"" Newman said.

The book is a supplement to the actual text book, ""American Pageant."" The school says the text book gives the exact Bill of Rights.

""The teachers and the staff are aware of this ""summary statement"" and are teaching the amendments from the classroom textbook,"" a statement from the Denton School District said. ""Please be assured that Denton ISD history teachers are disseminating the correct information on the Second Amendment.""

Sean Getts, who has a daughter who is a junior at Guyer High School, told FoxNews.com she noticed the wording of the amendment and alerted him.

""I don't know if it was intentional or not, but clearly these authors interpreted the amendment in favor of gun control,"" he said. ""I'm mainly concerned how this ends up in our school system.""

Getts had posted the book's definition on Facebook and it went viral.

""I don't think the definition was put in the book in good faith,"" said Stephen Halbrook, a Second Amendment expert and author of ""The Founders' Second Amendment.""

""It's actually a total perversion of what the Second Amendment stands for.""

He told FoxNews.com that the equivalent of this book's definition would be defining the First Amendment as: you have the right to free speech, as long as you speak in a state-sanctioned group.

Halbrook, who argued Second Amendment cases in front of the Supreme Court, said the book's authors could have edited the definition to: ""A militia is necessary for a free state, and people have right to keep and bear arms."""

The group also spent $500,000 on Wednesday alone, on an advertising campaign criticizing “Obama’s gun ban” and using Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a deep-pocketed gun control advocate, as a foil. “Tell your senator to listen to America’s police instead of listening to Obama and Bloomberg,” the ad said.

The action on Wednesday was initially supposed to be only the first series of votes in a debate to take days if not weeks. But as the measures’ chances faded this week, Senate leaders decided to rush the process, reaching a bipartisan agreement to hold nine votes in succession, each with a 60-vote threshold for passage.

Using the 60-vote hurdle so early in the process allowed Democrats to prevent the passage of an amendment mandating that any state with a concealed-weapons law, no matter how rigorous, would have to recognize the concealed-weapons permit of residents from any other state. The amendment received 57 votes in favor, including those of 12 Democrats, and 43 votes against.

Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a lifelong backer of the N.R.A. who also pushed for new restrictions in recent weeks, made one last plea for his amendment, which would extend background checks to Internet and gun show sales. While acknowledging that “the politics are risky,” he said it was “a defining time in politics, where you know the facts are on your side.”

The bipartisan measure, which had appeared to have a strong chance of passage, received 55 votes before Mr. Reid changed his vote to “no” to preserve the parliamentary right to bring the measure up again. Four Republicans voted “yes”: Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a co-author of the legislation; John McCain of Arizona; Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois; and Susan Collins of Maine. An equal number of Democrats voted “no”: Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All are from states that Mr. Obama lost by wide margins last fall, and all but Ms. Heitkamp face difficult re-election campaigns in 2014.

Debate over the measures consumed the Senate on Wednesday, with speeches from both sides meant to stir emotions. “I choose to vote my conscience,” Mr. Reid said, announcing his decision to vote for the bans on assault weapons and magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition, “because, if tragedy strikes again — if innocents are gunned down in a classroom or a theater or a restaurant — I could not live with myself as a father, as a husband, as a grandfather or as a friend knowing that I didn’t do everything in my power to prevent it.”

The assault weapons vote was 40 in favor and 60 against. The magazine ban fell with 46 in favor and 54 against."

The National Rifle Association, which is adamantly opposed to the bill in its current form, has already threatened to keep careful score of lawmakers' positions, even on procedural votes.

The pressure from the gun lobby, as well as lingering concerns from lawmakers in states with a tradition of gun rights that the bill could limit them, continue to make final passage a heavy lift.

Sen. Chuck Schumer said it would be a ""struggle"" to get the necessary votes to advance to final passage.

The Senate voted 68-31 Thursday to advance to debate on the bill. What follows will be a string of votes on amendments, at least one of which -- on reining in the background checks provision -- is considered vital to winning conservative and moderate support. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., offered a compromise measure that would expand background checks to gun-show and Internet sales, while exempting some casual transactions among family members and others. It is meant to assuage concerns that the current version could be a burden on hunters and families exchanging firearms among them.

Republicans could also throw up amendments in the days ahead that would turn off Democrats.

And, importantly, Senate leaders will likely have to marshal another round of 60 votes in order to cut off debate and proceed to final passage. That procedural vote could be more difficult than Thursday's, as Schumer acknowledged.

NRA Institute for Legislative Action Director Chris Cox, in a pointed letter to senators this week, reminded them that the NRA is watching their votes carefully -- on everything from amendments to procedural matters.

""Given the importance of these issues, votes on all anti-gun amendments or proposals will be considered in NRA's future candidate evaluations,"" Cox wrote. He urged the Senate to replace many of the bill's provisions with language focused on the mental health system, school security and prosecuting violent criminals.

""Rather than focus its efforts on restricting the rights of America's 100 million law-abiding gun owners, there are things Congress can do to fix our broken mental health system; increase prosecutions of violent criminals; and make our schools safer,"" he wrote.

The NRA has already announced that the Manchin-Toomey proposal on gun checks still does not do enough to protect Second Amendment rights.

Reid is looking to start the votes on amendments -- including the Manchin-Toomey proposal -- early next week. Proponents say expanded background checks, along with proposals to toughen penalties for gun trafficking and boost school security aid, are common-sense measures that could help reduce the likelihood of tragedies like the Newtown school shooting last December."

The massacre in Newtown%2C Conn.%2C has prompted calls for gun restrictions

Aides say Sens. Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey could have a deal early this week

Gun-control advocates have called for expanded background checks

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Congress returns Monday from a two-week recess with gun control legislation high on the Senate's agenda as President Obama looks for a breakthrough in his efforts to curb gun violence following the December massacre at a Connecticut school.

The administration moved quickly after the shooting amid concerns that the high emotions would settle and politics would go back to normal on one of the country's most sensitive issues. The country's top gun lobby has opposed the gun control drive, and the president's proposals have weakened in the months since the shooting amid fears that the more controversial ones, such as an assault weapons ban, will harm an overall gun control package.

On Monday, Obama travels to Connecticut to again make the case for gun legislation.

Senators could start debating gun legislation before week's end, but leaders might take more time to seek a breakthrough deal on expanding background checks for gun buyers — the proposal seen as having the best chance of passage.

Two influential senators, one from the Democrats and one from opposition Republicans, are working on an agreement that could expand background checks on firearms sales to include gun shows and online transactions, Senate aides said Sunday.

Federal background checks are currently required only for transactions handled by the roughly 55,000 federally licensed firearms dealers. Private sales such as gun show or online purchases are exempt. The system is designed to keep guns from criminals, people with serious mental problems, some drug abusers and others.

After the Connecticut massacre, Obama proposed applying the requirement to virtually all firearms sales. Gun control advocates consider expanded background checks to be the most effective step lawmakers could take to curb gun violence.

The NRA and other critics say the checks are ignored by criminals, and they fear that expanding the system could be a step to the government maintaining files on gun owners.

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey could reach an accord early this week, said the aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private talks.

Manchin is a moderate who touts a top ""A'' rating from the National Rifle Association, the influential gun rights lobbying group which has led the opposition to Obama's gun control drive. Toomey has solid conservative credentials.

Their united front would make it easier for gun control advocates to attract support from moderate Democrats who have been wary of supporting the effort and from Republicans who have largely opposed it so far.

With conservative Republicans threatening to use legislative maneuvers to prevent a final vote on gun control legislation, Democrats will need 60 of the chamber's 100 votes to prevail. There are 53 Democrats and two Democratic-leaning independents in the Senate.

Sen. John McCain urged his fellow Republicans to allow debate on gun legislation to go forward without the maneuver. However, he declined to express support for an expanded background check bill.

Other Obama gun control priorities include banning assault weapons and ammunition magazines with more than 10 rounds. Both bans are expected to be offered as amendments, but the assault weapons ban seems sure to be defeated, and the high-capacity magazine prohibition also faces difficult odds.

Gun control advocates are worried their allies might cut a deal that goes too far.

""We want a vote on the issues. We don't want them watered down so they're unrecognizable,"" said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""If they can't vote for it, let the American people judge them on that. Don't let a dumbed-down bill be the outcome of this.""

Justice Department figures show that from 1994, when the current background check system began, through 2010, 118 million potential gun buyers were checked and 2.1 million were denied firearms. Defenders say the data proves the checks prevent many dangerous people from getting weapons.

With or without an agreement, the Senate gun legislation would toughen federal laws against illegal firearms sales, including against people who buy firearms for criminals or others barred from owning them. The legislation also would provide $40 million a year, a modest increase from current levels of $30 million, for a federal program that helps schools take safety measures such as reinforcing classroom doors

Also high on Congress' agenda as it returns is immigration, where a decisive moment is approaching.

Bipartisan groups in the House and Senate are expected to present legislation as early as this week aimed at securing the U.S. border, fixing legal immigration and granting legal status to the estimated 11 million who are in the United States without authorization. That will open months of debate on the issue.

Lawmakers will also devote time to the 2014 budget that Obama plans to release Wednesday. It calls for new tax increases, which Republicans oppose, and smaller annual cost-of-living increases in Social Security pension payments to retirees and other government benefit programs, over the objections of many of the president's fellow Democrats.."

Background checks have become the focus of federal gun control legislation. Who should get background checks? Share your views with CNN iReport

(CNN) —

Saying he hopes it sets an example for the nation, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy on Thursday signed what advocacy groups call the strongest and most comprehensive gun legislation in the nation.

The new law bans some weapons as well as the sale or purchase of high-capacity magazines like those used in the Newtown shooting in December that left 20 children and six adults dead.

It also requires background checks for all gun purchases.

“This is a profoundly emotional day, I think, for everyone in this room,” Malloy said at the signing ceremony. “We have come together in a way that relatively few places in our nation have demonstrated an ability to do.”

However, he noted, “Today does not mark the end of our efforts” to combat gun violence.

With the governor’s signature, Connecticut became the third state to pass such tough measures since the December rampage in Newtown. New York and Colorado passed gun-control legislation limiting magazine capacity, among other provisions.

Similar legislation appears stalled in Congress despite overwhelming public support for background checks and substantial – although diminished – support for major gun restrictions in the wake of the Newtown killings.

Connecticut’s measure sends a message to the nation, Senate President Don Williams said Wednesday, before lawmakers approved the final draft.

“Democrats and Republicans were able to come to an agreement on a strong, comprehensive bill,” he added. “That is a message that should resound in 49 other states, and in Washington, D.C., and the message is we can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in Congress.”

Despite disappointment in a provision in the Connecticut bill that allows people who already own high-capacity magazines to keep them, a gun control advocacy group praised the state legislation as historic.

“It doesn’t have everything we wanted, but it was everything that could be done within the political reality we were facing,” Connecticut Against Gun Violence said Wednesday in a statement on its website.

Critics have argued the legislation will do nothing to stop someone like Adam Lanza, who carried out the Sandy Hook school killings December 14 with an assault-style weapon and high-capacity magazines.

“In his case, he stole the guns and went on a murderous rampage,” Scott Wilson, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, previously has said. “Limiting magazine capacity or mandating registration will only affect law-abiding persons, not criminals bent on murder.”

Lanza used weapons that were registered to his mother, who he also killed that day.

NRA ‘plucks the bird’ to weaken gun proposals

What the bill does

The Connecticut measure adds more than 100 guns to the state’s list of banned assault weapons, limits the capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 rounds and bans armor-piercing bullets.

While the new law allows current owners of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds to keep them, it requires those people to register the magazines with the state, and forbids owners from loading them with more than 10 rounds outside their homes or while at a gun range.

The legislation also creates the nation’s first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of dangerous weapons. The registry will be available only to law enforcement agencies.

It also requires eligibility certificates for the purchase of any rifle, shotgun or ammunition, and significantly increases penalties for illegal possession and trafficking of guns.

It also requires background checks for all firearms sales, including at gun shows, and creates safety standards for school buildings.

Debate on the legislation was emotional at times.

Sen. Beth Bye spoke for five minutes, noting it was the same amount of time that the shooting lasted at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

She recalled how parents hoping to be reunited with their children were directed to a building near the school after the shootings, but “20 of those parents came back with a state trooper and not their child.”

Some people questioned whether the law deals enough with the state’s mental health system, a reference to the presumed mental condition of the shooter.

The legislation allows school districts to require “mental health first aid” training for school personnel and creates a task force to examine the state’s mental health system. Additionally, it alters state insurance regulations to beef up mental health care coverage.

Newtown shooting details revealed

Reassuring gun owners

Republican House Minority Leader Larry Cafero, a member of the bipartisan task force that drafted the bill, reassured gun owners they wouldn’t lose their guns or ammunition magazines, “so long as they follow our rules and register,” he said.

“Are there tighter restrictions on their use, etc.? Absolutely. We also were able to see as part of this legislation the repeal of early release for violent criminals.”

Families of the children slain in Newtown were disappointed the larger-capacity magazines were grandfathered in. They asked had for an across-the-board ban.

Malloy had backed the broader ban, saying banning the future sale of high-capacity magazines “would not be an effective solution.”

But Wilson said the magazine limits will have no impact on crime.

“It is ludicrous to expect people that have firearms capable of holding 15 rounds to only load 10 rounds inside of them,” he objected. “Do criminals really care about these laws?”

Obama: ‘Shame on us’ if Newtown doesn’t bring new gun legislation

National fight

The move in Connecticut comes as the nation is in a heated gun debate.

President Barack Obama has been waging a public pressure campaign for tougher gun laws, an effort he continued Wednesday in Colorado – site of two of the nation’s most notorious mass shootings, in 1999 at Columbine High School and last year at an Aurora movie theater.

“There doesn’t have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our Second Amendment rights,” Obama said.

Obama is fighting intense opposition from the National Rifle Association, which sees restrictions as unconstitutional and ineffective.

Lawmakers in 36 states also have proposed legislation that would negate federal gun control initiatives, according to the non-profit Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group.

Despite a spike in support for the strictest gun control initiatives in the immediate aftermath of the Newtown shootings, a CNN/ORC International poll this month found support for major restrictions may be fading.

The poll, released March 18, found that while a majority of Americans favored major restrictions shortly after the shootings, that support had fallen to 43%.

A survey released Wednesday by MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” and Marist College found that 60% of respondents want stricter laws governing the sale of firearms.

Support for broader background checks on prospective gun owners remains overwhelming.

The MSNBC poll showed 87% of respondents support expanded background checks, with strong backing from Democrats, independents and Republicans.

A poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University pegged support for universal background checks at 91%. That was despite 48% of those polled conceding that such checks could form a database for later confiscation efforts.

The Firearm Risk Protection Act, pushed by Rep. Carolyn Maloney and seven co-sponsors, follows efforts at the state level to create the controversial new kind of insurance for gun owners.

""For too long, gun victims and society at large have borne the brunt of the costs of gun violence,"" Maloney said in a written statement. ""My bill would change that by shifting some of that cost back onto those who own the weapons.""

The likelihood, though, of Maloney's bill gaining any traction is slim. Republicans control the House, and even states where Democrats have sizeable majorities have not approved the insurance idea.

Six states -- California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania -- have all introduced gun liability insurance legislation over the past few months. None has produced any results.

More On This...

In Illinois, the House rejected a measure 34-74 that would require people carrying concealed weapons to also carry $1 million in liability insurance. Chicago Democrat Kenneth Dunkin was behind the defeated bill. He said an insurance policy would cost between $500 to $2,000, but Illinois Republicans successfully argued the costs were too high for citizens exercising their constitutional right to carry a gun, and the bill was defeated.

Last week, a similar measure in Connecticut was withdrawn following a two-hour hearing on the issue. Connecticut's proposal would require firearm owners to maintain excess personal liability insurance and self-defense insurance.

In Maryland, a bill that sought mandatory firearm liability insurance for gun owners was also recently withdrawn.

Because there have been so many setbacks on state levels, many have argued that trying to pass a liability insurance mandate on a national level would be near impossible.

Still, Maloney maintains she won't back down from the fight.

""We have a long history of requiring insurance for high-risk products -- and no one disputes that guns are dangerous,"" she said in her written statement. ""While many individual states are debating this issue right now, it makes more sense for Congress to establish a national requirement to allow the insurance markets to begin to price the risks involved consistently nationwide.""

Maloney also supports proposed bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The push in Congress for a renewed assault weapons ban has faltered. Though it is expected to get a vote as an amendment to a broader gun control package, few expect it to pass. The debate in Congress lately has centered on whether lawmakers can agree to a system of near-universal background checks."

Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature also restricted the controversial oil-drilling technique known as fracking and allowed transgender students to choose which school restrooms to use and sports teams to join, based on their gender identity.

California’s willingness to address contentious policy issues, many of which have remained suspended in Washington’s partisan divide, comes in the state’s new era of one-party rule. Democrats hold the governor’s office, every other statewide post and supermajorities in both houses of the Legislature – political dominance not seen here in more than a century.

While Congress was gridlocked on immigration issues last year, for example, Brown and state lawmakers approved more than a dozen bills on the subject.

One bars local law enforcement officials from detaining immigrants in the country illegally longer than necessary so that federal immigration authorities can take them into custody, if they are accused of only minor crimes. Immigrants would have to be charged with or convicted of a serious offense to merit a 48-hour hold and transfer to U.S. immigration officials under the controversial new measure known as the Trust Act.

The stricter gun controls were enacted in the wake of the 2012 shooting deaths of 20 students and six adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

One of those restrictions is a five-year ban on firearm possession by anyone who makes serious threats of violence to psychotherapists. The law requires those mental health professionals to notify law enforcement of such threats within 24 hours.

The governor signed 800 bills last year, and most of them kick in Wednesday. Others became law immediately upon his signature or will take effect later.

California’s minimum wage will rise to $9 an hour from $8, for example, but not until July 1. It will climb to $10 by January 2016.

And a new law permitting driver’s licenses for immigrants who are in the country illegally will start Jan. 1, 2015, after new DMV guidelines are developed. The agency has said it may be able to issue the first licenses late this year, if public hearings and the drafting of rules go smoothly.

The new state laws include:

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/06/Criminals-Continue-to-Ignore-Gov-Efforts-to-Make-DC-Gun-Free,2013-07-06 00:00:00,['Brandon Darby'],Recent D.C. Arrests Demonstrate Futility of Gun Bans,"Washington, D.C. has historically been one of America’s most difficult places for law-abiding citizens to obtain and own a firearm, especially a handgun. D.C. had a complete ban on handguns since 1976 until a 2008 Supreme Court decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, that struck down what was ruled an unconstitutional ban.

“Local lawmakers in DC have managed to keep a de facto ban in tact by making it very difficult for law-abiding citizens to get guns,” said AWR Hawkins, Ph.D, a military historian and writer for Breitbart News. He pointed out in an interview for this article that D.C. officials’ gun control efforts only affect law-abiding citizens while criminals simply ignore the laws.

He pointed out that criminals did not pay attention to the past unconstitutional handgun ban or any of the D.C. rules on keeping guns unloaded and unlocked or disassembled. Dr. Hawkins explained his views on the previous formal ban and the now de facto ban:

These laws clearly give criminals the upper hand in at least two ways: 1) They make it clear that law-abiding citizens will be unarmed (defenseless) against an armed attack as they go through their daily routines on the streets of DC. 2) These laws are so burdensome they actually dissuade people from getting guns to begin with.

Dr. Hawkins’ analysis is reinforced greatly by the recent July 2, 2013 prison sentences handed down in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to six narcotics traffickers and money launderers. The U.S. Attorney’s office said “agents and detectives seized multiple handguns, more than a kilogram of powder cocaine, large quantities of crack cocaine, and over $40,000 in cash.”

The U.S. Attorney’s office described the investigation that led to the six arrests, prosecutions, and sentences as “a long-term investigation.” This indicates that the area’s gun-bans resulted in an extended period of time where the only people carrying firearms were criminals with no regard for law. The case further indicates that even with some of the nation’s strictest guns laws, it took a long-term effort to apprehend and charge gun-toting felons and prevent their guns from being a threat to law-abiding citizens who are left defenseless against such criminals."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/opinion/gun-reform-for-a-generation.html,2013-01-17 00:00:00,[],President Obama’s Plan for Gun Reform - The New York Times,"•

Mr. Obama’s bills would require universal criminal background checks for all gun sales, doing away with the loopholes for gun shows, private sales and Internet sales that have exempted 40 percent of all gun sales from those checks. He called on Congress to reinstate and toughen the ban on assault weapons that was allowed to expire in 2004. He wants to restore a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines and to ban armor-piercing bullets that are used by criminals to kill police officers. The president asked Congress to pass a $4 billion measure intended to retain 15,000 police officers who are being laid off as states and localities react to the recent recession and to budget cuts from Washington.

Mr. Obama also issued executive orders to make the background checks system more comprehensive and strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws. He is ending a freeze on research into gun violence at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was imposed by lawmakers at the behest of a gun lobby that is terrified by the prospect that gun violence could be viewed, as it should be, as a public health issue. He also signed an order making it clear that doctors and other health care providers are not prohibited by any federal law from reporting their patients’ threats of violence and that the health care reform law “does not prevent doctors from talking to patients about gun safety.”

Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. acknowledged that getting any of the president’s proposals through Congress was going to be a herculean task. Mr. Biden said, “I also have never seen the nation’s conscience so shaken by what happened” in Newtown. We have hoped, too, that the murders last month would finally inspire action, especially if Americans pressured their representatives in Congress to do something about this crisis.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden will have to make good on Mr. Obama’s promise to do everything they can to fight for these proposals in Congress — and that will mean twisting arms and making threats to members of his own party as well as to Republicans.

The gun lobby is focused within the Republican Party, but Democratic lawmakers have also been to blame for failing to pass meaningful gun regulations. Already, some Democrats who should be strongest on gun controls are showing familiar signs of weakness.

Senator Pat Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will be needed as a leader in this effort but has been mumbling about the need to hold extensive hearings. And Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, was making ominous, cowardly remarks over the weekend about tailoring whatever the Senate does to what he thinks could get through a House dominated by the far-right fringe of the Republican Party. He has started to wriggle away from the idea of an assault weapons ban, for example.

This is not a time for lawmakers to do the politically safe thing or the N.R.A.-approved thing, even if they know it is less than needed. It is time to reach for big ideas and strong laws on gun violence.

A mere twenty years ago, “gun free zones” made their way to these facilities under the watch of President Bill Clinton.

According to a Washington Times editorial written days after the Nov. 5, 2009 attack on soldiers at Fort Hood, one of Clinton’s “first acts upon taking office… was to disarm U.S. soldiers on military bases.”

Clinton’s actions birthed Army regulations “forbidding military personnel from carrying their personal firearms and making it almost impossible for commanders to issue firearms to soldiers in the U.S. for personal protection.”

In other words, thanks to Clinton, citizens who join the military to use guns to defend liberty abroad cannot practice their constitutional right to keep and bear arms while on active duty at home.

As the Times editorial board put it: “Because of Mr. Clinton, terrorists would face more return fire if they attacked a Texas Wal-Mart than the gunman faced at Fort Hood.”

The same theme ran true at the Navy Yard in DC on September 16. Police were called after the shooter opened fired, and reports indicate it took approximately three to seven minutes for them to arrive. Each minute is an eternity when a lunatic with a weapon decides the “gun free zone” rules do not apply to him.

Peters'],House Votes to Extend Gun Law Without New Provisions for 3-D Printed Firearms,"WASHINGTON — The House voted on Tuesday to extend a law banning firearms that can pass undetected through airport X-ray machines, but left out provisions that law enforcement officials say are necessary to combat the growing threat of guns made with 3-D printers.

The legislation was approved overwhelmingly on a voice vote, meaning House members on both sides of a politically fraught gun-safety issue avoided having their individual votes officially recorded.

The focus now shifts to the Senate, where Democrats will introduce a stricter measure of their own next week, along with the extension the House passed.

But they are expected to act on Monday, the day the law expires. That leaves little time for senators to debate the more controversial aspects of the legislation, which would impose new restrictions on 3-D printed weapons."

Larry Ward, chairman of Gun Appreciation Day, appeared on CNN Friday to defend the nationwide gun rally, which is scheduled for Jan. 19 -- just two days before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Talking Points Memo notes.

Ward insists that Gun Appreciation Day, which calls on gun activists across the nation to rally in support of the right to bear arms and against President Barack Obama's “post-Sandy Hook assault on gun rights,"" actually ""honors the legacy of Dr. King.""

""We are looking for a peaceful protest,"" Ward said. Continuing, ""I think Martin Luther King, Jr. would agree with me if he were alive today that if African Americans had been given the right to keep and bear arms from day one of the country’s founding, perhaps slavery might not have been a chapter in our history.""

Maria Roach, founder of United for Change USA, an organization dedicated to prison reform and gun violence prevention, called Ward's comments simply ""ridiculous.""

""Slavery means that you are a possession,"" she said on CNN. ""Slaves were a possession, just like a gun."" She continued to criticize Ward for celebrating weapons just two days before celebrating the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was assassinated in 1968 by a single shot.

Think Progress' Aviva Shen notes the caveats in Ward's armed-slaves argument:

Ward also neglects to mention that in fact there were many armed uprisings by slaves, as early as 1526. Armed revolts almost always failed, and often led to retribution by the slave owners, who had the justice system on their side. Most famously, Nat Turner led a rebellion that resulted in 60 white deaths and 100 black deaths. The state later executed 56 blacks accused of being involved in the insurrection, and white mobs beat and killed at least 200 others in revenge.

Gun Appreciation Day, backed by a coalition of conservative groups, not only coincides with MLK Day, but also Obama's second inauguration.

Roach's United for Change USA has launched a petition to stop Gun Appreciation Day, according to ABC News. ""Gun groups are planning to have a National Gun Appreciation Day on January 19th, the same weekend that Americans celebrate the life and service of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an American leader who was assassinated by a rifle's bullet,"" reads the petition. ""This is an outrage and a slap in the face to Americans who value life and freedom!""

As of Friday, the petition had garnered more than 26,000 of the 30,000 signatures needed on SignOn.org."

Gun-grabbers around the globe believe they have it made.

You see, only hours after re-election, Barack Obama immediately made a move for gun control...

On November 7th, his administration gleefully voted at the UN for a renewed effort to pass the ""Small Arms Treaty .""

But after the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut -- and anti-gun hysteria in the national media reaching a fever pitch -- there’s no doubt President Obama and his anti-gun pals believe the timing has never been better to ram through the U.N.’s global gun control crown jewel.

I don't know about you, but watching anti-American globalists plot against our Constitution makes me sick.

This Spring, the United Nations went back into session to finalize their radical so-called “Small Arms Treaty.”

With the treaty finalized, a full U.S. Senate ratification showdown could come any time President Obama chooses and there will be very little time to fight back.

If we’re to succeed, we must fight back now .

That's why I’m helping lead the fight to defeat the UN ""Small Arms Treaty"" in the United States Senate.

And it's why I need your help today.

Will you join me by taking a public stand against the UN ""Small Arms Treaty"" and sign the Official Firearms Sovereignty Survey right away?

Ultimately, UN bureaucrats will stop at nothing to register, ban and CONFISCATE firearms owned by private citizens like YOU.

So far, the gun-grabbers have successfully kept many of their schemes under wraps.

But looking at previous attempts by the UN to pass global gun control, you and I can get a good idea of what’s likely in the works .

You can bet the UN is working to FORCE the U.S. to implement every single one of these anti-gun policies:*** Enact tougher licensing requirements , making law-abiding Americans cut through even more bureaucratic red tape just to own a firearm legally;

*** CONFISCATE and DESTROY ALL ""unauthorized"" civilian firearms (all firearms owned by the government are excluded, of course);

*** BAN the trade, sale and private ownership of ALL semi-automatic weapons ;

*** Create an INTERNATIONAL gun registry , setting the stage for full-scale gun CONFISCATION.

I'm sure I don't have to tell you this is NOT a fight we can afford to lose.

Ever since its founding 65 years ago, the United Nations has been hell-bent on bringing the United States to its knees .

To the petty dictators and one-world socialists who control the UN, the United States of America isn’t a ""shining city on a hill"" -- it’s an affront to their grand designs for the globe.

These anti-gun globalists know that as long as Americans remain free to make our own decisions without being bossed around by big government bureaucrats, they’ll NEVER be able to seize the worldwide power they crave.

And the UN’s apologists also know the most effective way to finally strip you and me of ALL our freedoms would be to DESTROY our gun rights.

That’s why I was so excited to see the National Association for Gun Rights leading the fight to stop the UN ""Small Arms Treaty!""

Will you join them by going on record AGAINST global gun control and sign the Official Firearms Sovereignty Survey today?

The truth is there’s no time to waste.

You and I have to be prepared for this fight to move FAST .

The fact is the last thing the gun-grabbers at the UN and in Washington, D.C. want is for you and me to have time to mobilize gun owners to defeat this radical agenda.

They’ve made that mistake before, and we’ve made them pay, defeating EVERY attempt to ram the UN Small Arms Treaty into law since the mid-1990s.

But now time may not be on our side.

And worse ... the UN Small Arms Treaty is no longer the only UN scheme threatening our gun rights.

More and more of the UN's radical agenda is slipping through covertly, under the cover of domestic legislation.

Not long ago, Obama told Sarah Brady from the anti-gun Brady Campaign, ""I just want you to know that we are working on [gun control]. We have to go through a few processes, but under the radar.""

In fact, Hillary Clinton’s State Department recently bragged that Project Gunrunner and Operation Fast and Furious are implementations of the UN's anti-gun agenda!

And I'd place a wager that Obama's M1 Rifle Re-importation Ban was also the UN's agenda dutifully executed by his administration.

Anti-gun UN policy that NEVER received a single vote in the United States Congress !

The UN met recently to pass a final version of the ""Small Arms Treaty"" to be sent for ratification by the Senate.

So if you and I are going to defeat them, we have to turn the heat up on Washington now before it’s too late!

1. Do you believe the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Second Amendment are the supreme law of the land?

2. Do you believe any attempt by the United Nations to subvert or supersede your Constitutional rights must be opposed?

""Yes!"" to these questions, please If you saidto these questions, please sign the survey the National Association for Gun Rights has prepared for you.

But I hope you'll do more than just sign your survey today .

With your help, the National Association for Gun Rights will continue to turn up the heat on targeted Senators who are working to implement the UN ""Small Arms Treaty.""

Direct mail. Phones. E-mail. Blogs. Guest editorials. Press conferences. Hard-hitting internet, newspaper, radio and even TV ads if funding permits. The whole nine yards.

Of course, a program of this scale is only possible if the National Association for Gun Rights can raise the money .

But that’s not easy, and we may not have much time.

In fact, if gun owners are going to defeat the UN's schemes, pro-gun Americans like you and me have to get involved NOW!

So please put yourself on record AGAINST the UN Gun Ban by signing NAGR’s Firearms Sovereignty Survey

And every dollar counts in this fight so even if you can only chip in $10 or $20 , it will make a difference.

Thank you in advance for your time and money devoted to defending our Second Amendment rights.

For Freedom,

Rand Paul

United States Senator

P.S. Only hours after re-election Barack Obama immediately made a move for gun control...

On November 7th, his administration gleefully voted at the UN for a renewed effort to pass the ""Small Arms Treaty.""

What’s worse, the UN met in March to pass the final version of the treaty that will be sent to the Senate for ratification.

If we’re going to defeat the UN ""Small Arms Treaty,"" gun owners have to turn the heat up now before it’s too late !

Please return your Firearms Sovereignty Survey and put yourself squarely on the record AGAINST the UN ""Small Arms Treaty."""

In Pennsylvania, state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe declares that gun control advocates have “gone far enough.” And in North Dakota, state Rep. Roscoe Streyle says, “We know what’s right for our citizens.”

They are among a wave of lawmakers in at least 20 states who are pushing back against the Obama administration’s drive to pass tougher gun laws after the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. They seek to exempt their states from any new federal regulations.

Even before Congress votes on new gun laws, some state legislators are intent on promoting bills like the Firearms Freedom Act — introduced in Alabama, Michigan and Oklahoma, among other states — based on a theory that guns and ammunition made and kept within state borders do not involve interstate commerce and are out of Washington’s reach.

Other bills — such as Pennsylvania’s proposed Right to Bear Arms Protection Act — would make it a felony, punishable by up to seven years in prison for government officials to attempt to enforce new federal gun restrictions in their states. A Tennessee bill declares that any federal action seeking to restrict gun ownership in the state “shall be deemed an intentional violation of state sovereignty and shall be unenforceable within the borders of Tennessee.”

Wyoming’s Republican-controlled House has sent to the state Senate, on a 46-13 vote, a measure declaring unenforceable any future federal ban on semiautomatic weapons or limits on the size of ammunition magazines that remain exclusively in the state.

President Obama has called for background checks for all gun sales and reinstatement of bans that expired in 2004 on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Obama alluded to those proposals in his State of the Union address Tuesday, calling on Congress to bring them up for a vote.

A White House spokesman declined to comment on the wave of state legislation.

The spate of proposed state laws reflects the national schism of opinion on gun control.

While lawmakers in a number of states fight the Obama administration’s efforts, New York recently passed a tougher gun law. California is also considering strengthening its laws, including requiring background checks for anyone who buys bullets. Maryland is weighing new limits, including licensing for handgun buyers.

A group of Colorado Democrats is quickly moving forward with legislation to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines, expand background checks and hold gun makers and sellers liable for damage caused by their weapons, though that could conflict with a 2005 federal law shielding the industry from certain lawsuits.

Some legal experts said the states’ proposals to limit gun control would be unlikely to withstand a constitutional challenge. And it’s uncertain whether any will be signed into law.

A spokesman for Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, said the governor believed there were “plenty of ways for Wyoming to send a message voicing concern about infringements on the 2nd Amendment, but he is concerned about creating an unenforceable law.”

In Virginia, a GOP-sponsored measure to prohibit local and state officials from assisting federal authorities in enforcing any new gun restrictions ran into trouble after lawmakers raised concerns that it could cost the state federal aid.

A number of the gun rights measures are patterned after a 2009 Montana law. Its constitutionality is before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, with oral arguments set to begin in March.

Legal experts cite a 2005 Supreme Court ruling upholding federal restrictions on homegrown marijuana in California as the precedent that stands to doom the spate of gun exemption laws. The court ruled that because marijuana moved in a national market, the federal government could regulate its use, even if it were grown and used only in California.

“There’s apparently some people out there who have yet to read the Constitution,” said Ladd Everitt of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

But the bills are also designed to sway federal lawmakers. “It is time to send a message to those in Washington, D.C., that we will not stand for the continual erosion of our rights and freedoms,” Nebraska state Sen. Charlie Janssen said in an Internet message seeking support for his bill.

Metcalfe, a Republican who is the chief sponsor of the Pennsylvania Right to Bear Arms Protection Act, said the measure had generated more public reaction than any bill he had sponsored in 15 years in office.

The disparate state responses underscore the difficulty of reaching a political consensus on an issue that often divides lawmakers not just by party affiliation but also geography.

Indeed, after New York acted to tighten gun laws, Texas Atty. Gen. Greg Abbott ran an Internet ad inviting New Yorkers to keep their guns and come to the Lone Star State.

The first page offers an executive summary of what follows along with references to Sandy Hook, Newtown, Aurora, Oak Creek and Tucson. It closes by once again focusing on children, “If even one child’s life can be saved, then we need to act.”

The rest of the document is broken into four major points with many sub-sections. Point one is closing background check loopholes and it opens with another reference to Sandy Hook:

We must strengthen our efforts to keep guns from falling into the wrong hands…The single most important thing we can do to prevent gun violence and mass shootings, like the one in Newtown, is to make sure those who would commit acts of violence cannot get access to guns.

The guns used in the Newtown shooting were bought legally by the shooter’s mother. He stole her guns, shot her while she slept and made his way to the school. There is literally nothing in this section that, if enacted, would have changed the outcome. Sub-points include expanding background checks and insuring all states are contributing to the national database of people with mental illness. These might be worthy changes but again suggesting it would have stopped what happened in Newtown is pure emotional manipulation.

Step two is to ban “military-style assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines. This is essentially an effort to reinstate the ban which existed from 1994-2004. But this section also includes four other sub-sections covering everything from additional law enforcement “tools” to spending federal money on gun violence research.

One of the priorities in this section is a “national responsible gun ownership campaign.” The document isn’t specific but this would likely be modeled on other government campaigns such as the one against smoking or drug use (“This is your brain on guns”). In practice this could be safety tips about gun storage or it could becomes a media slush-fund to stigmatize gun owners as heartless monster, like the people who let their second hand smoke waft toward babies.

The big budget item in this section is a plan to spend $4 billion keeping 15,000 cops “on the streets.” But again it’s not clear how this priority connects to any of the mass shooting incidents the document is ostensibly aimed at preventing. How will 15,000 more cops prevent the next school shooting if they are not on campus when the shooting begins?

In section three we finally get to “Making Schools Safer” which really ought to be the focus. Obama is proposing funding for 1,000 school resource officers at a cost of $150 million. This is a fraction of what he proposes to spend on cops in general ($4B) and seems insignificant in a country with more than 70,000 public schools. Chances that your elementary school will get an armed officer as a result of this program are exceedingly slim.

The other parts of this section include insuring schools have an emergency management plan and creating a “safer climate” at schools. The former seems like a good idea but the latter is rather vague. It involves spending $50 million to have the Department of Education train 8,000 schools to “improve climate.” There is a mention of “more intensive steps for groups of students exhibiting at-risk behavior” but it’s not clear from the document what this means or which groups are at risk.

Section four is titled “Improving Mental Health Services.” Here the documents suggests but never quite says outright that mental issues were involved in the shootings at “Newtown, Tucson, Aurora, and Virginia Tech.” The proposal involves training teachers to identify troubled kids and then insure they get treatment. It also lays out a proposal to train 5,000 mental health professionals to work with kids and young adults.

The mental health approach does seem like common sense though it’s not clear the items proposed would have prevented the shootings mentioned prominently in the document. Adam Lanza, Jared Loughner and Seung-Hui Cho were all known to have social/mental problems by their parents and teachers. They had been identified (James Holmes’ problems seem to have cropped up later) but obviously didn’t get sufficient help. Is that because help wasn’t available or because their parents wanted to avoid the stigma?

The President’s gun proposal throws a lot of progressive spaghetti at the wall (to mix metaphors) in the hope that some of it will stick. Some of it will and perhaps some of it really should, but the items which seem most likely to prevent another Sandy Hook–cops in schools, mental health intervention–receive less money and attention than the ones designed primarily to please Obama’s progressive constituency. It’s an odd mix until you realize this is as much a political document as it is a practical one."

With the Senate set to begin what is expected to be a long and difficult debate on gun-control legislation, it's no surprise that President Obama would dedicate his weekly address to making another pitch on the issue.

But for this week's address, President Obama made a highly unusual move and passed on the duty to someone he believes can make the argument better than him: the mother of a 6-year-old child that was gunned down in the Newtown, Conn., mass shooting that has spurred a national debate on nation's gun laws.

Francine Wheeler used the address to speak of her anguish since her son Ben's death, and called on Americans to ""convince the Senate to come together and pass common-sense gun responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would happen to us.""

""Sometimes, I close my eyes and all I can remember is that awful day waiting at the Sandy Hook Volunteer Firehouse for the boy who would never come home – the same firehouse that was home to Ben's Tiger Scout Den 6,"" Wheeler said. ""But other times, I feel Ben's presence filling me with courage for what I have to do — for him and all the others taken from us so violently and too soon.""

The president has only passed on his address once during his presidency. He tapped Vice President Biden to deliver the weekly address in December 2010, while the president was in Afghanistan.

Here's what Wheeler said:

Hi. As you've probably noticed, I'm not the President. I'm just a citizen. And as a citizen, I'm here at the White House today because I want to make a difference and I hope you will join me.

My name is Francine Wheeler. My husband David is with me. We live in Sandy Hook, Conn.

David and I have two sons. Our older son, Nate, soon to be 10 years old, is a fourth grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our younger son, Ben, age 6, was murdered in his first-grade classroom on Dec. 14, exactly four months ago this weekend.

David and I lost our beloved son, but Nate lost his best friend. On what turned out to be the last morning of his life, Ben told me, quite out of the blue, ""I still want to be an architect, Mama, but I also want to be a paleontologist, because that's what Nate is going to be, and I want to do everything Nate does.""

Ben's love of fun and his excitement at the wonders of life were unmatched. His boundless energy kept him running across the soccer field long after the game was over. He couldn't wait to get to school every morning. He sang with perfect pitch and had just played at his third piano recital. Irrepressibly bright and spirited, Ben experienced life at full tilt.

Until that morning. Twenty of our children and six of our educators – gone. Out of the blue.

I've heard people say that the tidal wave of anguish our country felt on 12/14 has receded. But not for us. To us, it feels as if it happened just yesterday. And in the four months since we lost our loved ones, thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun. Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief.

Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy.

Sometimes, I close my eyes and all I can remember is that awful day waiting at the Sandy Hook Volunteer Firehouse for the boy who would never come home — the same firehouse that was home to Ben's Tiger Scout Den 6. But other times, I feel Ben's presence filling me with courage for what I have to do — for him and all the others taken from us so violently and too soon.

We have to convince the Senate to come together and pass common-sense gun responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would happen to us.

When I packed for Washington on Monday, it looked like the Senate might not act at all. Then, after the president spoke in Hartford, and a dozen of us met with senators to share our stories, more than two-thirds of the Senate voted to move forward.

But that's only the start. They haven't yet passed any bills that will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. And a lot of people are fighting to make sure they never do.

Now is the time to act. Please join us. You can talk to your senator, too. Or visit WhiteHouse.gov to find out how you can join the president and get involved.

Help this be the moment when real change begins. From the bottom of my heart, thank you."

“It’s a very significant decision,” he said, “and it involves the personal responsibility of the parent and personal responsibility of the child.”

Trying to Reverse a Trend

The shooting sports foundation, the tax-exempt trade association for the gun industry, is a driving force behind many of the newest youth initiatives. Its national headquarters is in Newtown, just a few miles from Sandy Hook Elementary School, where Adam Lanza, 20, used his mother’s Bushmaster AR-15 to kill 20 children and 6 adults last month.

The foundation’s $26 million budget is financed mostly by gun companies, associated businesses and the foundation’s SHOT Show, the industry’s annual trade show, according to its latest tax return.

Although shooting sports and gun sales have enjoyed a rebound recently, the long-term demographics are not favorable, as urbanization, the growth of indoor pursuits like video games and changing cultural mores erode consumer interest. Licensed hunters fell from 7 percent of the population in 1975 to fewer than 5 percent in 2005, according to federal data. Galvanized by the declining share, the industry redoubled its efforts to reverse the trend about five years ago.

The focus on young people has been accompanied by foundation-sponsored research examining popular attitudes toward hunting and shooting. Some of the studies used focus groups and telephone surveys of teenagers to explore their feelings about guns and people who use them, and offered strategies for generating a greater acceptance of firearms.

The Times reviewed more than a thousand pages of these studies, obtained from gun industry Web sites and online archives, some of them produced as recently as last year. Most were prepared by consultants retained by the foundation, and at least one was financed with a grant from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service."

Eight weeks after the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders, a ban on the kind of semi-automatic rifle used by the killer remains elusive – if not impossible.

Such a ban became a rallying cry for victims’ families, advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the Newtown shootings in December.

President Barack Obama still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in America, especially in major cities.

However, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association and millions of American gun owners has shifted debate away from prohibiting specific weapons to making it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns.

Along with a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, Obama also wants to limit magazine clips to 10 rounds, expand background checks to all gun sales, crack down on gun trafficking, and strengthen efforts to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.

The multi-faceted proposal provided Congress with options on legislation, enhancing chances of passing some provisions, said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a Washington think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues.

Gun violence plans: What’s in the works

While her group supports a renewed ban on military style weapons, Erickson Hatalsky said “political reality” dictated a different approach.

“Keeping guns out of the wrong hands is not only more politically palatable but also more effective to stop gun violence,” she explained.

That strategy reflects “an understanding of gun crime in the country,” she added.

Opinion polls back up her assertion.

A Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday showed that 92% of respondents support expanding background checks to all gun sales. In households with guns, support was 91%.

However, a majority of households with guns opposed a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, while the full survey showed 56% of respondents backed the provision.

The poll also found that 46% of respondents believe the NRA better reflects their views on guns, compared to 43% for Obama.

Newtown calls on Connecticut to ‘show America the way’ on gun control

Diverse views in America

Obama acknowledged on Thursday that Americans have diverse views on the issue, depending on where they grew up and how they live.

“There are different realities and we have to respect them,” he told House Democrats at their policy retreat, noting rural hunters and urban dwellers come from distinct gun cultures.

At the same time, the president called for action, saying “there are commonsense steps we can take and build a consensus around, and we cannot shy away from taking them.”

Earlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney made clear that the goal was progress on reducing gun violence, rather than any specific provision.

Carney called proposals backed by legislators from both parties “the first progress we’ve seen in many, many years dealing with gun violence.” But none of the measures he mentioned – expanded background checks, cracking down on gun trafficking, criminalizing “straw” purchases in which legal buyers obtain weapons for those unable to do so – included a new ban on semi-automatic weapons.

Gun debate: Where is the middle ground?

NRA President Bob Keene said he expected few substantive changes in law because “people are smarter than politicians,” which means “common sense ultimately prevails.”

“They hope that they can use emotion to achieve an anti-firearms agenda that they haven’t been able to achieve in the past,” Keene told a recent Christian Science Monitor breakfast event.

“I am convinced that as these things are discussed, that we’re going to come out about where we have come out in the past,” he added.

His organization keeps a scorecard for each Washington legislator on gun issues, and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates.

In the nearly two months since the Newtown shootings, Obama and the White House have sought to maintain public attention on the issue.

Loaded language poisons gun debate

Vice President Joe Biden will take part in a roundtable discussion on gun violence on Monday in Philadelphia.

Four days later, Obama will award the Presidential Citizens Medal – the nation’s second-highest civiian honor – posthumously to the six educators killed with the 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

In Congress, some influential Democrats join virtually all Republicans in opposing, or at least questioning, a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who gets high marks from the NRA for his opposition to past gun control efforts, has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban.

According to Reid, a bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban, but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate.

Weapons like the Bushmaster mimic the appearance and some features of fully automatic military rifles, though they technically do not meet the definition of an assault weapon because they are semi-automatic – meaning each shot requires a trigger pull.

Supporters of a ban say such weapons have no place in the general public because they are designed solely for rapid-fire killing capacity, rather than hunting or sport shooting.

Opinion: Nothing stops a bullet like a job

Right to bear arms

The NRA and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms. Even partial steps in that direction, such as prohibiting specific models, are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of Second Amendment rights, they argue.

In recent decades, the NRA has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls – such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top Democrats in the 1980s and 90s – to the incremental measures under consideration now.

Erickson Hatalsky of Third Way noted examples of the NRA’s influence in the last significant gun legislation – the Brady Bill of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers, followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later.

While the Brady Bill led to the background check system in use today, the NRA made sure it didn’t apply to private sales, such as those at gun shows, she said.

How the violent mentally ill can buy guns

Obama and other Democrats now want to close what they call a loophole to make background checks a requirement for any gun sale.

The issue gained prominence after the Columbine high school shootings in 1999 in which three guns used by the two underage killers had been purchased by 18-year-old Robyn Anderson at a Colorado gun show to avoid a background check.

Anderson later told a Colorado House of Representatives committee that the gun purchases had been “too easy.”

“I wish it had been more difficult,” she said. “I wouldn’t have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check.”

The 1994 weapons ban targeting military style weapons was gone 10 years later, when Congress let it expire in the administration of President George W. Bush – an outcome sought by the NRA.

Keene and other NRA officials argue the ban failed to reduce gun violence because it targeted firearms used in only a fraction of the nation’s gun violence. They also contend the government isn’t properly enforcing the background checks created by Brady Bill, making an expansion illogical.

“We are not willing to support measures we feel unduly burden innocent and law-abiding Americans, and on the other side do not have any real impact on the problem we’re trying to solve,” Keene said.

To Erickson Hatalsky, the goal is to get laws on the books that make it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns – either through private sales or from traffickers through straw purchases.

Minor exceptions would apply to family members giving guns to each other, or people borrowing guns on a hunting ground, she said.

“How are they going to stop somebody who’s a gun trafficker if there’s no federal law against that now,” she wondered.

January’s FBI gun background checks are second-highest

Limits on magazine rounds

A tougher issue involves proposed limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, she said. Larger capacity magazines allow semi-automatic weapons to fire dozens of rounds in seconds.

At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control last week, Mark Kelly argued that the proposed limit could have prevented the death of a young girl in the Tucson, Arizona, attack that seriously wounded his wife – former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

According to Kelly, the 13th shot fired killed 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, and the shooter got tackled when trying to reload. With a 10-round limit, Green might still be alive, he said.

Gabby and Mark: The new ‘Bradys’ of gun control

The NRA and its supporters say larger-capacity magazines are popular, with millions already in the possession of American gun owners who want them to feel secure against criminals armed with similar firepower.

They also contend citizens have the right to such weaponry to protect against future government tyranny, which they say was the intent of the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms.

Erickson Hatalsky rejected any inference by the NRA or its supporters that Obama’s proposals or other measures being discussed in Congress amount to taking away people’s guns.

She praised the president’s strategy of presenting a broad package for Congress to consider, saying: “It behooves people who are working on this issue to keep the NRA arguing about lots of different issues, rather than allowing it to concentrate on one and defeat it.”

Ted Nugent sings praises of gun ownership

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/17/Obama-Throws-a-Tantrum-Over-Gun-Control-Defeat,2013-04-17 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Obama Throws Tantrum over Gun Control Defeat,"President Barack Obama lashed out defiantly and viciously at political opponents who defeated his efforts to expand federal gun regulations today. Standing with families of victims of the Newtown school shooting at the White House, the president claimed that opponents of expanded federal background checks had “no coherent arguments” for their position, and that the “gun lobby” had “willfully lied” in the course of the debate.

Ironically, while accusing others of lying, President Obama resorted to false claims and statistics about current laws, including the repeatedly debunked argument that 40% of gun sales are private, and that guns can be bought over the Internet without background checks. It was partly the dishonesty of those very arguments that had led potential supporters of new bipartisan legislation to doubt the administration’s motives in supporting the bill.

The administration’s defeat came earlier Wednesday, when the Senate failed to pass a cloture motion to end debate on a bipartisan proposal introduced by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). Only 54 votes of the necessary 60 votes could be found to support an expanded federal background check system (among other changes), partly because of fears that extending such checks would require the creation of a federal gun registry that could lead to confiscation.

The failure brought an end to four months of fervent campaigning by the president during which he used the Newtown disaster–or, in the eyes of many critics, exploited it–to make an argument about the urgent need for new laws, even if such laws would not have prevented the Newtown atrocity itself. Many Democrats rallied behind him, hoping at first to pass a new assault weapons ban, then abandoning that effort for more modest regulations.

Along the way, the administration lost the support of Democratic Senators in conservative states, many of whom will face re-election in 2014. President Obama made clear his intention to use Wednesday’s defeat to rally supporters against Republicans, whom he blamed directly and angrily, suggesting that they had defied the will of the American people and attempted to silence the families of Newtown victims who had a “right” to be heard in the debate.

Forced to cover a rare political defeat for the president, the mainstream media largely echoed his emotions. Virtually all of CNN’s correspondents agreed that the Manchin-Toomey bill had been defeated because of the power of the National Rifle Association and the fear of politicians afraid to take on Second Amendment activists. None considered that support for gun control has been declining, or that the legislation itself was deeply flawed.

Again and again, President Obama noted that 90% of Americans, and a majority of National Rifle Association members, supported expanded background checks. The former constitutional law lecturer seemed to expect that that majority’s will should be self-executing, ignoring the fact that constitutional rights like the Second Amendment exist precisely to protect minorities against majoritarian passions and presidential demagoguery.

Indeed, while the president described the failure of the legislation as a failure of “Washington,” it was also–and primarily–a failure of his administration. A White House operation and Obama campaign apparatus that is regarded as brutally effective ought to have been able to sell a proposal allegedly supported by 90% of the voting public. Yet persistent troubles in execution and failures of policy raise questions about whether Obama secretly preferred failure to success.

His opponents, the president insisted, refused to make it more difficult for “dangerous criminals” to buy weapons–ignoring one of the core arguments of the other side, namely that dangerous criminals frequently ignore the law to obtain weapons, while law-abiding citizens bear the burden of new rules and restrictions. He reduced his opponents’ motives to pure politics, accusing them of being afraid of being punished by an organized, determined minority.

Rarely have Americans ever seen a president attack his opponents so viciously, expressing and evoking such visceral emotions–especially at a time of mourning. President Obama’s tirade contrasted with his reserved, measured response to the Boston Marathon bombings, in which he urged Americans to speak and act with restraint. If this has been, as he claimed, “a pretty shameful day in Washington,” the president’s tantrum was the most shameful moment of all."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/us/in-california-new-package-of-gun-laws-but-one-snag.html,2013-10-12 00:00:00,['Ian Lovett'],"In California, New Package of Gun Laws but One Snag","LOS ANGELES — Democrats in the California Legislature passed a sweeping package of gun control bills after a string of mass shootings across the country, cracking down on assault rifles, high-capacity magazines and lead ammunition. But on Friday, Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat, vetoed several key pieces, including a ban on semiautomatic weapons that many had considered the toughest restriction on gun ownership in the country.

The bill, by Darrell Steinberg, the State Senate president pro tem, would have banned semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines. Mr. Brown, calling the bill overly broad, said the ban would have unduly constrained hunters and others using guns legally.

“The State of California already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, including bans on military-style assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines,” Mr. Brown wrote in a veto statement. “I don’t believe this bill’s blanket ban on semiautomatic rifles would reduce criminal activity or enhance public safety enough to warrant this infringement on gun owners’ rights.”

Mr. Brown signed several other pieces of gun legislation on Friday, including curbs on high-capacity magazines, a ban on lead hunting ammunition, new limits on firearms storage and several measures intended to keep mentally ill people from possessing firearms."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-offers-gun-control-steps-135409085--politics.html,,[],Obama offers new gun control steps,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Striving to take action where Congress would not, the Obama administration announced new steps Thursday on gun control, curbing the import of military surplus weapons and proposing to close a little-known loophole that lets felons and others circumvent background checks by registering guns to corporations.

Four months after a gun control drive collapsed spectacularly in the Senate, President Barack Obama added two more executive actions to a list of 23 steps the White House determined Obama could take on his own to reduce gun violence. With the political world focused on Mideast tensions and looming fiscal battles, the move signaled Obama's intent to show he hasn't lost sight of the cause he took up after 20 first graders and six adults were gunned down last year in an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

Vice President Joe Biden, Obama's point-man on gun control after the Newtown tragedy thrust guns into the national spotlight, unveiled the new actions Thursday at the White House.

""It's simple, it's straightforward, it's common sense,"" Biden said in the Roosevelt Room.

One new policy will end a government practice that lets military weapons, sold or donated by the U.S. to allies, be reimported into the U.S. by private entities, where some may end up on the streets. The White House said the U.S. has approved 250,000 of those guns to be reimported since 2005; under the new policy, only museums and a few other entities like the government will be eligible to reimport military-grade firearms.

The Obama administration is also proposing a federal rule to stop those who would be ineligible to pass a background check from skirting the law by registering certain guns, like machine guns and short-barreled shotguns, to a corporation or trust. The new rule would require people associated with those entities, like beneficiaries and trustees, to undergo the same type of fingerprint-based background checks as individuals if they want to register those types of guns.

Story continues

""It's a very artful dodge to get around people who are not capable, constitutionally or legally, of owning a weapon,"" Biden said.

The National Rifle Association dismissed the administration's moves as misdirected, arguing that background checks for corporations and a ban on reimporting outdated guns wouldn't keep criminals from getting weapons.

""The Obama administration has once again completely missed the mark when it comes to stopping violent crime,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ""This administration should get serious about prosecuting violent criminals who misuse guns and stop focusing its efforts on law-abiding gun owners.""

Joined by Attorney General Eric Holder, Biden formally unveiled the new measures Thursday while swearing in Todd Jones, whose confirmation to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after six years of political wrangling to fill that position was another of Obama's post-Newtown priorities. A Senate deal to approve the president's pending nominations after Democrats threatened to change Senate rules cleared the way for Jones' confirmation last month.

Still out of reach for Obama were the steps that gun control advocates and the administration's own review say could most effectively combat gun violence in the U.S., like an assault weapons ban and fewer exceptions for background checks for individual sales. Only Congress can act on those fronts.

There is scant evidence that support for gun control legislation has grown substantially since April, when efforts died in the Senate amid staunch opposition from the NRA and most Republican senators.

""Sooner or later, we are going to get this right,"" Obama said that day in the White House Rose Garden, with the families of Newtown victims and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords — herself a victim of a gunman — at his side. ""The memories of these children demand it, and so do the American people,"" the president said at the time.

In the months following the Senate vote, Biden has claimed that at a handful of lawmakers who opposed expanded background checks have told him privately they've changed their minds and want another chance. But Biden and White House officials have not named any of those lawmakers.

Renewing his pledge to keep working for legislative fixed, Biden suggested that one opportunity for improving prospects for gun control may come next year in the midterm elections. Liberal groups and those supporting gun control have vowed to hold accountable in 2014 those lawmakers who voted against gun control.

""If Congress won't act, we'll fight for a new Congress,"" Biden said. ""It's that simple. But we're going to get this done.""

These days, Obama and Biden mention gun control with far less regularity than when it appeared the Senate was poised to take action, although Obama did meet Tuesday with 18 city mayors to discuss ways to contain youth violence. And with immigration and pressing fiscal issues dominating Congress' agenda, the prospects for reviving gun legislation appear negligible.

With Jones' confirmation at ATF, the White House has completed or made significant progress on all but one of the 23 executive actions Obama had previously ordered in January, the White House said. Still lingering is an effort to finalize regulations to require insurers to cover mental health at parity with medical benefits, although the White House said that it is committed to making that happen by the end of 2013.

The new rules for guns registered to corporations will follow the traditional regulatory process, with a 90-day comment period before ATF reviews suggestions and finalizes the rule. It would only apply to certain types of guns that must be federally registered. Last year, ATF received 39,000 requests to register guns to corporations and trusts.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/obama-end-long-fight-over-gun-violence-research-201708897.html,,[],Can Obama end the long fight over gun violence research?,"As part of his 23 executive actions addressing gun violence, President Barack Obama announced on Wednesday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must begin researching the causes of that violence.

“We don't benefit from ignorance,” Obama said at the White House. “We don't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence.” The president also asked Congress to infuse the agency with an extra $10 million for this research, which will include studying whether violent video games and other media images have an effect on violence levels.

For those who didn't tune in to the congressional battles of the '90s, this announcement might seem odd. Why doesn't the CDC, which is dedicated to helping Americans prevent disease and injury, already study the causes and effects of firearm-related violence?

As with most highly charged political battles, it depends on which side you ask.

The CDC used to conduct extensive research into gun violence, but comments by CDC officials about the dangers of guns sparked a backlash. In 1994, A CDC official who oversaw the section of the agency that researched gun violence told the Washington Post, ""We need to revolutionize the way we look at guns, like what we did with cigarettes. Now it is dirty, deadly and banned."" Around the same time, a CDC-funded nonprofit published a pamphlet encouraging people concerned about gun violence to “organize a picket at gun manufacturing sites” and write to their local politicians about gun control.

By 1996, outraged House Republicans had had enough: They led the effort to defund the part of the CDC that researched gun violence, and added a special rule preventing the agency from engaging in any activity that promoted gun control.

After the defunding, the CDC's spending on gun research dropped from a few million dollars a year in the 1990s to zero dollars today, and a larger message was sent to agencies that wading into gun research or data collection could lead to trouble with Congress. Separate federal actions limited other agencies' ability to collect data on gun ownership.

Story continues

Over the years, pro-gun advocates and some social science researchers have contended that public health researchers who worked for or were funded by the CDC had a clear anti-gun agenda that led to sub-par and politically motivated research. That bias has not changed even though the CDC funding has dried up, they say.

""The ideology of the medical/public health researchers has not changed, and the quality of their research has not improved,"" says Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. Kleck contends that his research on gun ownership and violence, which is often cited by the pro-gun rights side, is ignored by public health gun researchers.

In the public health research world, however, there's a near consensus that a gun lobby-backed campaign against the CDC has purposely suppressed research on the subject for political reasons, a setback that has left the field decades behind. Published academic research on firearm violence fell 60 percent between 1996 and 2010, according to a report by the pro-gun control group Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Justice Department's research arm all completely stopped or dramatically reduced their funding for gun-related research over the same period.

Researchers, many of whom depend upon federal grants, moved to other topics or reduced their firearms-related output.

""It's been very hard for people on soft money like myself to get funding for a lot of research,"" says David Hemenway, director of Harvard University's Injury Control Research Center. (""Soft money"" means researchers are responsible for raising their own funds.)

Larry Cohen, founder of the nonprofit Prevention Group and a leader in the movement to define violence as a preventable public health issue, says the defunding of the CDC had a ""chilling impact"" on research in the gun violence field. After the defunding, ""for the most part the research went away, so it had its desired effect,"" he says.

Questions including the safest way to store weapons in the home and whether firearm safety classes work have not been addressed, public health researchers say. ""We're nearly 20 years behind in our ability to really ask these kinds of important questions,"" said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.

It's unclear how much of an effect the president's announcement will have on the field, however. A spokeswoman from the CDC said the agency will not begin doling out gun research funds until financial year 2014. Without the additional funds from Congress, it's unclear how much the CDC would be able to give out. If Congress complies with Obama's request to hand over $10 million for gun violence research, however, a bigger impact could be made.

""It would be a very needed breath of fresh air for Congress to allow the CDC to study this issue,"" Cohen says. The move may also remove a climate of fear around the research, public health researchers hope.

But those who pushed for the defunding in the 1990s worry the CDC could now push for more restrictions on guns through their research. ""I'm concerned that if President Obama's recommendation to restore funding to the CDC is implemented that we are going to see once again the same thing that we saw back in the 1990s,"" says Dr. Tim Wheeler, a retired physician and the head of Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership. ""We're going to see a very powerful and very prominent federal agency using tax money to advocate for gun control and generating these pseudo-scientific studies to back it up.""

Many public health researchers do believe gun ownership can be a health hazard, especially when it comes to suicide. Cohen says he hopes the surgeon general will release a report on suicides and firearms.

A National Academy of Sciences review of gun-related research in 2004 found that higher gun-ownership rates are associated with higher suicide rates. The report did not find evidence that right-to-carry laws lead to either an increase or decrease in violent crime.

The report also noted that researchers are hog-tied by a lack of good data on firearms collected by the government, including data on gun ownership. Without this data, it's hard for researchers to make strides, even with federal funds."

In the lawsuit in filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Maryland, the plaintiffs argues the the Second Amendment and case law protect their right to own assault rifles and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, The Baltimore Sun reported.

The plaintiffs include the Maryland Licensed Firearms Dealers Association, the Maryland State Rifle and Pistol Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore, and several other organizations, individuals and gun shops, according to the report.

The new gun law Maryland lawmakers passed earlier this year bans 45 types of assault weapons, but people who own them now will be able to keep them. The law also limits handgun magazines to 10 rounds and requires people to submit fingerprints to the state police to get a license to buy a handgun.

A spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association told The Baltimore Sun lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to ask a judge Friday for an injunction to prevent the law from taking effect.

A spokeswoman for Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat, said she expects the law will withstand the group's legal challenge.

""The vast majority of Marylanders support these common-sense efforts to reduce gun violence,"" spokeswoman Samantha Kappalman told the newspaper. ""The new law will take effect on Tuesday, and it will make families safer.""

John Josselyn, Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore's legislative vice president, said in a statement that the restrictions are ""an unconstitutional violation"" of the Second Amendment rights of ""law-abiding, responsible citizens.""

""Together we are drawing a line in the sand where Maryland’s gun control agenda tramples the fundamental individual right to defend oneself and family in the home,"" Josselyn said.

A spokesman for the Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore Inc., one of the plaintiffs, said the new laws would keep honest citizens from being able to ""choose effective firearms for defense in the home.""

The pending new law has prompted a huge increase in applications for firearm purchases, and a backlog has resulted. In the last two weeks, state troopers said applications are coming in at the rate of 1,000 per day.

Maryland State Police said Tuesday residents who have submitted handgun purchase applications before new requirements go into effect next week will not have to obtain a handgun qualification license.

The agency said that troopers will not enforce the new requirements, which also include background checks and fingerprinting, on applications submitted by Sept. 30.

Troopers said as of Friday, slightly more than half of the more than 100,000 purchase applications received had been processed.

The agency began 24/7 operations in December to process the applications, but the backlog continued to grow.

Earlier this month, state police said 20 law enforcement officers from other agencies began helping with background investigations. State law requires that the investigations be conducted by police officers.

Troopers also said that beginning last week, 24 data entry employees from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services have been inputting information from applications. State police said several security measures were being taken to limit the access of DPSCS employees to the State Police database.

http://news.yahoo.com/minn-capitol-sees-spike-gun-notices-230044241.html,,[],Minn. Capitol sees spike in gun notices,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Handgun holstered on his hip, Anthony Triemert showed up to Minnesota's Capitol on Friday for the latest in a number of recent legislative hearings on various gun control proposals.

""I just came down here today to show support for Second Amendment rights,"" he said. But Triemert's right to carry a loaded gun is safe in this building. Minnesota is one of at least nine states that allow people to carry guns into the brick-and-mortar homes of government.

All he and other Minnesotans have to do is notify the Minnesota Department of Public Safety in advance. As hundreds of pro-gun activists have streamed into the state's legislative hearings on gun controls, such notifications have spiked in the last month — almost 1/5th of all notifications given since the current permit law took effect in 2006.

Between Jan. 18 and Feb. 22, 150 people notified DPS of the intent to carry their weapons on the Capitol complex. By contrast, only 56 such notifications were filed in all of 2012. And since the law took effect, a total of 723 individuals have notified the agency.

On Friday, gun rights activists again came out in force for the second day of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Most of them didn't wear their guns openly like Triemert, though he was not the only one. An auto mechanic from Brooklyn Park who's now on disability, Triemert said he wears the gun almost everywhere he goes.

""I don't believe in gun safe zones. I think it's an advertisement for a killing zone,"" Triemert said, noting he carries a weapon for protection because of his own physical limitations.

Private establishments in Minnesota are allowed to post signs stating that guns are not allowed on the premises. But no such rules are in place at the Capitol, which has no metal detectors at its public entrances.

""I don't like people carrying weapons in the Capitol,"" said Sen. Barb Goodwin, DFL-Columbia Heights, a Judiciary Committee member and outspoken gun control supporter. ""This is a place where controversial decisions are made all the time. Emotions can run high.""

Story continues

Still, Goodwin said, any nerves about guns in the Senate hearing room wouldn't dissuade her from speaking out. Armed State Patrol officers were posted at the House and Senate hearings, a relative rarity in legislative proceedings.

Goodwin said she and colleagues tried to prohibit guns in the Capitol in 2006, but lacked the votes to do so. Some lawmakers have acknowledged carrying their own weapons at the Capitol, including Republican Rep. Tony Cornish of Good Thunder, a strong opponent of tighter gun laws.

Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-ST. Louis Park, and state Rep. Michael Paymar, DFL-St. Paul, both plan to assemble separate sets of gun control measures for lawmakers to consider. But there's been no talk of changing the state's carry permit law that allows guns at the Capitol.

Latz has said he would not pursue an assault weapons ban, which is sought by gun control activists but strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association and its allies.

Since Latz took that off the table, the debate has increasingly focused on a bill that would require background checks for all gun purchases in Minnesota — not just those that go through federally licensed dealers, but also sales at gun shows, online and between individuals. The NRA and Minnesota pro-gun groups oppose that measure, too.

Joe Isaacs, a real estate agent from the Stillwater area who has helped organize gun control opponents at the Capitol hearings, said he typically wears his gun everywhere. He notified DPS of plans to wear it at the Capitol, but changed his mind after realizing it could be seen as a provocative act.

""It could have been a distraction, and take the focus off the issue,"" Isaacs said. ""I don't wear it to be political. It's for safety."""

(AP) — The big brick Remington gun factory pieces together military-style rifles in a state that has just banned their sale after a string of mass shootings led to a national outcry over civilian ownership of them.

Residents of Ilion see the issue far differently: The gun factory is a major local employer and a source of pride for almost two centuries.

As Mayor John Stephens put it, ""Remington is Ilion. Ilion is Remington.""

Little wonder that residents in this blue-collar stretch of the Mohawk Valley are defending Remington after state lawmakers banned the sale of semi-automatic rifles like the Bushmaster weapon made there. The move came after the weapon was linked to gunmen in the deadly Connecticut school shooting and in the Christmas Eve slayings of two firefighters in western New York.

Remington employee Tom Bradle said don't blame the guns in mass shootings, blame the shooters.

""It's the person that pulls the trigger. I don't care what kind of gun it is,"" Bradle said as he walked back to the factory from lunch break on a chilly, gray day recently.

Chad Delmedico, who works on Remington's Model 700 bolt-action rifle, said it more simply: ""We have a bum rap.""

Remington has been intertwined with Ilion since shortly after Eliphalet Remington crafted a flintlock rifle on his father's forge in 1816. Even the elementary school shares the company's name. Company officials did not respond to calls seeking comment, but locals say the factory employs about 1,200 people and produces Bushmaster, Marlin and H&R products.

Parts of the Remington Arms Co. factory, with its imposing four-story front of brick and old-style, multi-paned windows, date back to the days when upstate New York was a manufacturing powerhouse. But factory jobs have become rarer in the string of modest towns along the Mohawk River, and Ilion, with about 8,000 residents, depends heavily on Remington.

Stephens, the mayor, was disgusted by the news last month of 20 first-graders and six adults killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. But he is critical of the New York state law approved last week banning certain semi-automatic rifles and large-capacity magazines and calling for background checks on ammunition purchases, among other measures. He dismisses the idea that there's an emotional link between Newtown and Ilion.

Story continues

""Are people disappointed and distraught?"" Stephens asked. ""Do they feel bad and are they sad? Absolutely! Absolutely! I would never wish that on anyone, never. But as far as an emotional attachment between us and them, I don't see it.""

Stephens voiced a sentiment heard frequently in this largely conservative area: New York's law and the sweeping gun regulation package proposed recently by President Barack Obama are wrongheaded.

The New York law, starting when Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed it Jan. 15, defined as illegal assault weapons semi-automatic rifles that accept detachable magazines and have one additional military-style feature such as a pistol grip, flash suppressor or bayonet mount. The old law required two such features.

At the State Bowling Center next to the Remington factory, Rod Brown said the weapon that the Newtown gunman used could easily have been a Smith & Wesson or a Browning instead of a Bushmaster model.

Kelley Holmes-Morton in her salon, Heads-R-Turning, said she is a National Rifle Association member who believes gun makers are not to blame. And Betty Watkins said as she pumped gas that the Second Amendment, about people's right to bear arms, is being ""pushed around and misused.""

Robbi Breit at the Sellers Avenue consignment shop seemed more conflicted than others in Ilion but still feels that closing Remington won't end gun violence.

""I cried my heart out"" after Sandy Hook, she said. ""I'm torn between both sides. But you can get another job. You can't get another kid.""

Bushmaster is owned by Freedom Group Inc., the largest firearms maker in the U.S., which has its headquarters on Remington Drive outside the neighboring small towns of Madison and Mayodan, N.C.

No guns or ammunition are manufactured there. Most people around know the 43,000-square-foot building near the high school and the Walmart as the home of Remington Arms, which moved to the site in the mid-1990s, and not the weapons conglomerate Freedom Group has become, said Mayodan Town Manager Michael Brandt.

""They're not big contributors to the community like a typical large company would be in an area,"" Brandt said. ""This is where they're located, but we don't really see much of them.""

Word that Freedom Group is for sale and changes are looming has generated little local concern in an area where surviving textile producers and a Miller-Coors brewery are bigger employers, said Sharon Chirichella, who runs a temporary staffing agency and is an officer with the local chamber of commerce.

That contrasts with Ilion, where the concern among people is the future of Remington. The company had said last March it could leave New York if the state went ahead with a move to add unique identifying information on spent bullet casings. That proposal is off the table, but people in town wonder where things stand in the wake of the new state law, which does not affect Remington's ability to manufacture military-style weapons.

""If I'm an executive at Remington, what's my attitude going to be toward the state that bans one of the premier products that I produce?"" local Assemblyman Marc Butler asked.

Obama's gun control proposal added more uncertainty. Jamie Rudwall, who has worked at the plant since 1995 and is president of the United Mine Workers of America Local 717, said he expected the gun business to increase in the short term amid new regulatory proposals, but he worries about jobs in Ilion long term.

""We've been here almost 200 years,"" he said. ""I hope to be here another 200.""

But her presence was powerful.

Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, shot in the head by a Tucson gunman in 2011, opened the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on gun violence in dramatic fashion Wednesday.

""OK,"" she began, steeling herself before a packed yet hushed committee room.

""Speaking is difficult,"" she continued, pronouncing each syllable with deliberation.

This former congresswoman, once blessed with a politician's easy gift of gab, spoke in a high pitch, her voice almost childlike.

""I need to say something important. Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something.

""It will be hard, but the time is now. You must act. Be bold, be courageous, Americans are counting on you.""

Giffords, her every movement labored, punctuated her conclusion by raising a clenched fist to her chest.

And that was it.

Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, gently guided her from the table, then returned to fill out the picture.

""Gabby's gift for speech is a distant memory,"" Kelly said. ""She struggles to walk and she is partially blind. And a year ago, she left a job she loves, serving the people of Arizona.""

Giffords' appearance at the witness table offered rare insight into her condition. Her family has closely guarded her privacy and the details of her impairment.

Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida told CNN it takes her good friend ""a tremendous amount of rehearsal and practice"" to utter even a few sentences.

""What she did today was remarkable,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""You could hear the emotion and the power behind the statement she was making because she feels so strongly about this.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama was looking forward to seeing Giffords and Kelly later Wednesday, and that everyone at the White House was heartened by her appearance on Capitol Hill.

Giffords has made only a few public appearances and interviews since the January 2011 shooting, including reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democratic National Convention and casting a single vote in August 2011 on legislation to raise the federal debt limit.

She resigned her seat in Congress a year ago to focus on her recovery. Giffords and Kelly, both gun owners, have formed a political action group called Americans for Responsible Solutions, aimed at promoting gun restrictions.

Gun control is an issue that really hasn't been debated in Congress for more than 10 years. It rarely gets an airing and engenders strong emotions.

And so it was that both sides did their all to ensure maximum impact from Wednesday's hearing.

Giffords was clearly happy to do her part."
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-18/news/ct-met-illinois-legislature-0519-20130518_1_illinois-senate-carry-bill-raoul,2013-05-18 00:00:00,"['Rafael Guerrero', 'Chicago Tribune Reporter']",Illinois concealed carry bill stalls,"— The push to pass a more restrictive concealed carry measure stalled late last week as support began to drop off before a key vote in the Illinois Senate.

The legislation represents the latest attempt to address a federal appeals court order setting a June 9 deadline for Illinois to fashion a new law that would allow citizens to carry concealed weapons in public. Illinois is the only state in the nation that does not have some form of concealed carry law on the books.

Shortly after the proposal won approval in a Senate committee Thursday, opponents turned up the heat.

""For a day at least, the extremists have prevailed,"" said Sen. Kwame Raoul, the South Side Democrat who sponsored the proposal and hoped to call it for a vote in the full Senate on Friday.

""My interest was to try to negotiate, to create something that balanced the interests of the goal of the Second Amendment as it's been interpreted by the courts and preserving, as my top priority, public safety,"" Raoul said.

Gun debates divide legislators along regional rather than political party lines, with Downstate lawmakers opposed to restrictions on gun rights, those from Chicago supportive of tighter control and suburban counterparts split.

The lineup against the Raoul legislation is long. The National Rifle Association weighed in heavily against the bill, and hundreds of people filed committee witness slips as opponents.

The Raoul bill spells out who can carry concealed handguns and where they can carry them. It also gives Chicago a chance to launch its own investigation into applicants who want permits to carry weapons in public in the city along with a separate permit for the rest of the state.

In the House, Speaker Michael Madigan has worked on a separate version after both a restrictive New York-styled concealed weapons bill and a less-restrictive, NRA-backed bill failed. Madigan has made it clear to some lawmakers, including senators, that a better bill may be under development in the House. That could have tempered support for Raoul's bill.

Madigan spokesman Steve Brown said he knew some rank-and-file lawmakers had reached out to senators about the Raoul legislation but was ""not aware"" of Madigan making efforts to peel off support.

Rep. Brandon Phelps, the leading gun rights voice in the House, said there is ""no way"" Raoul's bill could pass his chamber. Phelps indicated that discussions include creating a review board that would weigh appeals over objections that local law enforcement officials would lodge against permit applicants as potential threats to themselves or the public.

Lower school age

The Senate approved a measure Friday to lower the age children would be required to attend school from 7 to 6. Supporters say it would put Illinois in line with other states that already place children in classrooms at a younger age.

Under the measure, children who turn 6 years old on or before Sept. 1 each year would be required to enroll in kindergarten. For Chicago schools, the change would go into effect for the school year that starts this fall. For other school districts, it would not go into effect until July 2014. Children who are home-schooled are exempt. The bill now moves to the House, where a similar attempt passed last month.

Sponsoring Sen. Kimberly Lightford, D-Maywood, said children cannot be expected to excel, much less keep up, if they start school at 7 when students in other states are already grades ahead. She pointed to a Tribune report that found nearly 18 percent of Chicago kindergartners and first-graders were chronic truants during the 2010-11 school year.

Opponents argued that parents should have the final say on when their kids are ready for school and said costs in small school districts could be prohibitive.

Calls for firing

More than a dozen African-American and Latino senators notified Senate President John Cullerton and Gov. Pat Quinn that they opposed the governor's reappointment of former state Rep. Julie Hamos as director of the Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

""Director Hamos has demonstrated her priority to care for the poor and the institutions they rely on is secondary to simply cutting the budget regardless of the consequences,"" said a letter signed by Chicago Democratic Sens. Martin Sandoval and Donne Trotter.

Standing behind Hamos, a Quinn spokesman hailed her as a ""dedicated public servant"" who last year led her agency through the ""challenging process of saving the state's Medicaid system from collapse"" and who is now leading the effort to implement President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act in Illinois.

http://news.yahoo.com/gun-control-backers-senate-defeat-wont-stop-us-065741656--politics.html,,[],Gun control backers: Senate defeat won't stop us,"WASHINGTON (AP) — One day after the demise of gun control legislation, Senate supporters of the measure vowed to try again, while a leading opponent accused President Barack Obama of taking the ""low road"" when he harshly criticized lawmakers who voted against key provisions.

""When good and honest people have honest differences of opinion about what policies the country should pursue about gun rights...the president of the United States should not accuse them of having no coherent arguments or of caving to the pressure,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.

The fate of the bill was sealed in a string of votes on Wednesday, when Republicans backed by a small group of rural-state Democrats rejected more extensive background checks for gun purchasers and also torpedoed proposed bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The Senate delivered its verdict four months after a shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., left 20 first graders and six educators dead. The tragedy prompted Obama to champion an issue that Democrats had largely avoided for two decades, and that he himself ignored during his first term in the White House.

Though the gun control bill was moribund for the foreseeable future, the Senate approved two minor amendments on Thursday. One by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., cutting aid to state and local governments that release information on gun owners, was approved 67-30. Another by Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., bolstering federal mental health programs passed 95-2.

Cornyn said he agreed with Obama that Wednesday had been a shameful day but added it was because of the president's own comments, rather than the events on the Senate floor.

""He could have taken the high road...instead he chose to take the low road, and I agree with him it was a truly shameful day.""

Cornyn spoke shortly after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the struggle for tougher gun legislation was not over.

Story continues

""This is not the end of the fight. Republicans are in an unsustainable position,"" he said, after voting with few exceptions against a tougher requirement for background checks for gun purchasers, a proposal that shows very high support in most public opinion polls.

Reid offered no timetable for renewing the drive to enact legislation that Obama has placed near the top of his domestic agenda.

Another Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, said the proposed expansion of background checks that he co-authored would have passed easily had it not been for the National Rifle Association's decision to take the vote into account in deciding which candidates to support or oppose in 2014.

""If they hadn't scored it, we'd have had 70 votes,"" he said. Instead, it drew 54, six short of the 60 needed to advance.

Manchin also told reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Wall Street Journal that the outcome would have been different if the Senate had acted more quickly after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. ""If we'd have gone to a bill like this immediately, boom,"" he said, predicting it would have received 65-70 votes.

Later, in the Capitol, he renewed his accusations that the NRA had spread lies about the proposal he had hoped to pass, and that fellow lawmakers had evidently believed them. ""Reading is a lost art,"" he said.

Obama spoke in clipped, angry tones at the White House on Wednesday after the Senate scuttled legislation he had campaign for energetically.

""I see this as just Round One,"" the president said, flanked by relatives of Newtown's victims and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011.

Looking ahead to the 2014 congressional elections, he added, ""If this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.""

Obama blamed lawmakers' fear that ""the gun lobby would spend a lot of money"" and accuse them of opposing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.

A spokesman, Josh earnest, told reporters on Thursday, ""we're pretty close to a consensus on this just about everywhere except in the United States Congress. And as the President alluded to yesterday, I think that is an indication of the pernicious influence that some special interests have in the United States Congress. And that is going to require a vocalization of public opinion to overcome it.""

Emotions were high on Wednesday at the Capitol.

When the background check amendment failed in the Senate, Patricia Maisch, watching from a visitors' gallery, shouted ""Shame on you!"" Maisch helped restrain the gunman at the 2011 Tucson shooting in which six people died and 13, including Giffords, were wounded.

The shooting deaths in December of 20 children and six adults in Newtown as well as mass shootings in Colorado and Arizona, spurred Democratic legislators in California to look for ways to tighten the state’s gun laws, which are already some of the toughest in the nation.

“We all can recite the horrific acts that have occurred in our country over the last year,” said Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). “These bills attempt to respond to those well publicized tragedies and many more that go unpublicized.”

The measures include a requirement that Californians who want to buy ammunition, and the vendors who sell it, would have to submit personal information for a background check to determine whether they have a criminal record, severe mental illness or a restraining order that would disqualify them from owning guns.

The goal of SB 53 is “to ensure that criminals and other dangerous individuals cannot purchase ammunition in the state of California,” said Sen. Kevin De Leon (D-Los Angeles), the bill’s author.

“To purchase a product that has the potential to maim or kill another human being you can (now) walk into a gun store, no questions asked,” he added. “I think that’s a little outrageous.”

Ammunition purchasers would submit their information and a $50 fee to the state Department of Justice which would maintain a list of qualified buyers that would be checked by ammo stores. Purchasers would have to show their driver’s license or other ID at the time they buy bullets.

Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Gerber) opposed the measure as too broad. “We are criminalizing legal, historic behavior in the state of California and putting onerous burdens and regulations and requirements on law-abiding citizens.”

Sen. Roderick Wright of Inglewood was one of four Democrats to vote against the bill. He said the Constitution guarantees citizens the right to own guns. “Implied in that is the right to buy the ammo to go with it,” Wright said before the 22-14 vote.

The Senate also approved a bill that would outlaw the sale, purchase and manufacture in California of semiautomatic rifles that can accept detachable magazines. SB 374 also would require those who own such weapons to register them with the state.

Other measures approved by the Senate would ban the possession of ammunition magazines capable of holding more than 10 bullets, and regulate mechanisms, called “bullet buttons,” that allow the quick replacement of ammunition magazines on semiautomatic rifles.

All the bills next go to the Assembly for consideration.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn, both Republicans, have made overtures to Colorado-based Magpul Industries and other manufacturers, suggesting that they relocate.

Magpul, a manufacturer of ammunition magazines for firearms, has threatened to leave Colorado if the state enacts a ban on high-capacity magazines.

Perry, who reportedly sent letters to 26 firearms and ammunition manufacturers earlier this month, told Magpul that there is no other state ""that fits the definition of business-friendly like Texas,"" according to the Denver Post.

Perry's letter to Connecticut-based gun maker Mossberg & Sons reads in part, ""As you consider your options for responding to unwarranted government intrusion into your business, you may choose to consider relocating your manufacturing operations to a state that is more business-friendly,"" according to CTMirror.org.

Gunn sent letters Thursday to 14 gun manufacturers in Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and North Carolina.

""I am personally inviting you and your company to come to the great state of Mississippi,"" Gunn wrote in a letter to Colt's Manufacturing Co. in Connecticut. ""In our state, you will not be criticized for providing good to the law abiding citizens who enjoy hunting, shooting or who just want the peace of mind that comes with the constitutional right to protect their families.""

Leaders from other states have sent letters to some or all of the companies asking them to come to their homes. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, has made an overture. Also chiming in have been U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., and officials from Alabama, Idaho, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Gunn's list also included the American unit of SIG Sauer in New Hampshire and North Carolina's Remington Arms Co. Both those states have little apparent movement toward tighter restrictions on guns and ammunition.

When asked how Gunn made up the list, spokeswoman Meg Annison said he had looked at high-profile arms makers who had threatened by gun control. She said Remington's factory in New York is why it made the list.

States where there's little movement to restrict firearms have trying to use their pro-gun culture as a way to lure gun makers away from their traditional production bases in the Northeast and Midwest.

Mississippi has five makers of firearms and ammunition, according to Mississippi Development Authority records. The most prominent of those is Olin Corp.'s Winchester unit in Oxford. The state lured Olin to Oxford from East Alton, Ill., after the company couldn't reach a wage-reduction deal with its union in Illinois and Mississippi put up $25 million in incentives.

Also in Mississippi, Precision Delta Corp. makes ammunition in Ruleville, MAC makes polymer bullet casings in Bay St. Louis, Nammo Talley assembles shoulder-launched rockets in Columbus and BAE Systems completes howitzers in Hattiesburg.

“Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,” senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told “Fox News Sunday.” “Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to … essentially enact the Romney economic plan. The American people rejected that, and Republicans shouldn't be doubling down on it.”

The White House effort comes three days before Obama releases his 2014 budget, which is expected to include a mix of tax increases and cuts to such entitlements as Social Security and Medicare.

“You can do both,” Pfeiffer said on ABC’s “This Week.” “That’s what you’ll see. … What we won’t do is cut our way to prosperity.”

However, the outline of the plan has already been criticized by Republicans and some of the president’s staunchest supporters.

More On This...

The release of the budget Wednesday, which will be followed by Obama meeting for dinner with Senate Republicans, is just part of a busy week in Washington.

Congress returns from a two-week break with the Senate attempting to reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration-reform legislation, and the leaders of the Democrat-controlled chamber trying to finish a gun-control proposal that might or might not include the contentious universal background checks for buyers.

Pfeiffer told Fox the meeting with Senate Republicans is simply an attempt to find a “caucus of common sense,” not end run leaders of the Republican-controlled House.

Last week, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Obama’s budget blueprint holds reforms “hostage” to tax increases. Organized labor also expressed its disappointment in the plan.

""The president should drop these misguided cuts in benefits and focus instead on building support in Congress for investing in jobs,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said.

Obama supporters disagree particularly with the part of his spending plan that calls for a new inflation formula that would reduce the annual cost of living adjustments for a range of government programs, including Social Security and benefits for veterans.

Still, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed optimism Sunday about the plan, suggesting it was at least a starting point toward an elusive, long-term budget deal between Democrats and Republicans.

""The president is showing a little bit of leg here,” Graham said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “This is somewhat encouraging. We're beginning to set the stage for the grand bargain.”

Among the highlights of the president’s plan is spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, replacing the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequester, over the same period.

The proposal also is expected to include new spending for public works projects, early education and job training, as well as $580 billion in new taxes that Republicans oppose.

Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute $4.3 trillion to total deficit reduction by 2023.

On Saturday, the president said his budget was not his “ideal plan,” but it was a compromise that he would be willing to accept.

The House and Senate have already passed their own budget plans. The House plan cuts $5.7 trillion in spending and balances the budget in 10 years while the Senate plan increases taxes by $1 trillion.

The (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal

Federal court backed Wilmington Housing Authority ban on guns

NRA backed plaintiffs want state courts to decide

Ruling could set national precedent for gun restrictions in public housing

PHILADELPHIA -- Having lost a federal court battle over restrictions on guns in Wilmington public housing, plaintiffs backed by the National Rifle Association have asked an appeals court to send the matter back to Delaware courts.

Attorney Francis G.X. Pileggi told a panel of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday that Delaware's Constitution provides for a far broader right to keep and bear arms than the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, so this case – involving limits on those rights – would best be resolved at the state level.

Wilmington Housing Authority attorney Barry M. Willoughby, however, argued that having lost in federal court, the NRA is attempting to get a do-over.

""What we have here is an attempt by the plaintiff to use a legal gambit to deny this court jurisdiction,"" Willoughby said, adding that the plaintiffs did not attempt to set aside state issues during the lengthy and hard-fought federal litigation.

National experts have said that ruling in this Delaware case could set a national precedent for how far public housing authorities are allowed to restrict gun ownership by residents.

The initial NRA-backed lawsuit was filed in June 2010 in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to overturn a flat ban on all guns in Wilmington public housing. The suit was transferred to U.S. District Court at the request of the city housing authority because it involved federal constitutional issues.

Shortly after the case ended up in District Court, following several rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court, the WHA dropped its flat ban on all weapons without a trial and allowed residents to keep guns for protection, though it limited guns in common areas like lobbies, lounges and laundry rooms.

The NRA, however, did not drop the lawsuit and forced a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Stark on claims that the new gun restrictions were unconstitutional.

In August 2012, Stark sided with the WHA, ruling the restrictions were limited and reasonable and did not violate Second Amendment rights."

It is legal to carry an unloaded rifle

He was also carrying a Glock 19C pistol

Cindy Yorgason has been amazed at the attention her Facebook posting has received

RIVERDALE, Utah (AP) — Hours after President Obama called on Congress to ban assault weapons, one man's protest raised some eyebrows at a Utah store.

An Ogden woman snapped a few photos of a man standing inside a J.C. Penney on Wednesday with a big gun slung over his shoulder.

Cindy Yorgason said that even for a firearm-friendly state like Utah, it was out of the ordinary.

""I've seen someone carrying on their hip or leg, but I have never seen anyone openly carrying an assault rifle,"" she said.

Yorgason took two photos of the man and posted them on Facebook, where they received hundreds of comments and have since been shared more than a thousand times. She said she's ""incredibly amazed"" at the attention the images received.

She wasn't alarmed when she spotted him with the weapon but Yorgason thinks the man took it too far while trying to make a statement.

""I just think it's inappropriate,"" she said.

The man, identified as Joseph Kelley, 22, told The Salt Lake Tribune he wanted to demonstrate that the weapons aren't dangerous when handled by law-abiding citizens.

Kelley said he's a former member of the military and alerted police in advance that he would be carrying the weapon, which he identified as an unloaded AR-15.

Kelley was also carrying a Glock 19C on his hip.

He said he received positive reactions from people who spotted him.

Attempts by the Associated Press to reach Kelley were unsuccessful.

Local law enforcement authorities said they didn't receive any calls related to the incident or any notice from Kelley, Riverdale City Police Lt. James Ebert said.

But if the gun is unloaded, ""then you're well within your rights to carry a firearm,"" Ebert said."

""I really felt like this ordinance was a security sign for our city. Basically it was a deterrent ordinance to tell potential criminals they might want to go on down the road a little bit.""

According to the council's agenda, the purpose of the ordinance is in ""opposition of any future attempt by the federal government to confiscate personal firearms.""

Resident Lamar Kellett told WXIA that his town is going too far.

""What's the point?"" asked Kellett. ""By their own admission this is a sham. It's just for play.""

Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) criticized New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's federal gun control push on Tuesday, advising the mayor that he should be more worried about gun violence in his own city than in North Dakota, the Grand Forks Herald reported.

""North Dakota continues to have one [of] the highest rates of gun ownership and lowest incidences of gun crime in the country,"" Heitkamp said in a statement. ""Yet New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg insists on taking gun-driven crime statistics in his city and from other major cities and trying to force those numbers into a narrative that just does not fit North Dakota.""

Heitkamp, who previously served as North Dakota's attorney general, added, ""I do not need someone from New York City to tell me how to handle crime in our state.""

Her statement came in response to the recent $12 million ad buy from Mayors Against Illegal Guns, pushing senators in key states -- including Heitkamp -- to support such gun control legislation as comprehensive background checks. Bloomberg, who co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns in 2006 and is personally financing the ad campaign, is spending roughly $156,000 in North Dakota.

""Frankly, there are far better uses for Mayor Bloomberg's $156,000 than buying ads attacking a way of life he clearly does not understand,"" Heitkamp wrote.

Bloomberg earlier defended the ad buy, saying that the campaign reflects the sentiments of most Americans. ""These ads bring the voices of Americans -- who overwhelmingly support comprehensive and enforceable background checks -- into the discussion to move senators to immediately take action to prevent gun violence,"" he said in a statement issued last week by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

According to survey data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, roughly 50.7 percent of North Dakotans own a firearm -- one of the highest rates in the country. Yet the state's annual gun homicide rate is below the national average, with less than 1.1 per 100,000 people dying from gun violence in North Dakota, compared to the national rate of 2.75 per 100,000.

Heitkamp attributed these figures to North Dakota's ""proud ... outdoor heritage,"" explaining that firearms owners in her state understand the rights and responsibilities that come with gun ownership.

""Gun ownership in North Dakota comes down to growing up in a culture where those rights come with an ingrained responsibility taught at a young age,"" Heitkamp argued.

""I wouldn't expect Mayor Bloomberg to follow my advice on how to run a major east coast city of over 8 million people, and I don't plan to follow his advice on what is best for North Dakotans,"" added Heitkamp, whose state has about 700,000 inhabitants.

This isn't the first ad campaign targeting Heitkamp's position on gun control. In January, less than a week after she was sworn in as senator, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence launched a series of ads attacking her pro-gun stance.

""No parent should have to send their children to school wondering if they will come home,"" that ad read. ""Shame on you, Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), for telling the country on Sunday that the Obama Administration's response to Newtown -- which may include universal background checks and a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines -- is 'extreme.'""

The coalition was responding to statements made by Heitkamp that the White House's gun control plans were ""way in extreme."""

A proposal on the issue was introduced this month by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who on Thursday again expressed his interest in getting the measure passed.

“I believe that the best way to interrupt the shooter is to have a mental health system that actually records and enters into the database people who should not be able to buy a gun,” Graham said.

He made his remark while voting against a bill passed by the committee to ban assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.

Graham’s proposal would require that people found mentally incompetent be added to the National Instant Criminal Background System – the database for all new gun sales.

Those added to the list would have to be found incompetent by a federal court or other official body. The proposal is based on a 2005 South Carolina case in which a women pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity for threatening to kill President George W. Bush. The woman, Alice Bolan, was later able to legally buy a gun and attempted to shoot somebody earlier this year.

“The … case is Exhibit A of a broken background check system,” Graham said. “As astonishing as it sounds, that actually happened.”

Graham’s proposal was introduced earlier this month and has bipartisan support.

""I’m a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights,” Arkansas Democrat Rep. Mark Pryor said in support of the bill. “That said, it’s evident that our background check system needs some improvements.”

Under the proposal, a person would be added to the database for such reasons as being an imminent danger to themselves or others, found guilty but mentally ill in a criminal case, found guilty by reason of insanity, found incompetent to stand trial, committed to a psychiatric hospital or required to have psychiatric outpatient treatment.

Meanwhile, several states are addressing the issue.

New York passed legislation that requires therapists to report to the state cases of potentially dangerous behavior. And the Maryland and Florida legislatures are considering similar legislation.

The Florida proposal attempts to close a loophole that allows the mentally ill to voluntarily commit themselves to treatment to avoid getting added to a database. The bill also would require the mandatory reporting of mental illness.

The U.S. Senate committee has now voted in favor of four gun-control measures: the assault weapons ban, more school safety aid, expanding federal background checks on potential gun buyers and helping authorities prosecute illegal gun traffickers.

However, the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines faces tough odds in passing the full Senate. The measure would need 60 votes, which would require support from Republicans and some Democrats seeking re-election in pro-gun districts."

USA TODAY

Incident happened at the Blue Mesa Grill in Arlington%2C Texas

Founder of mothers group says the women were holding a private meeting%2C not a rally

Open Carry Texas contingent%2C which included men%2C women and children%2C was armed with about two dozen semi-automatic rifles

The sudden appearance of about 40 armed men outside a Dallas-area restaurant this weekend was the latest confrontation between an open-carry gun-rights group and a mothers group advocating gun control that was meeting inside.

Police monitored the incident at the Blue Mesa Grill in Arlington, Texas, but took no action because it is legal to carry long guns openly in Texas.

""We are aware that a group did gather in a shopping area in Arlington Saturday,"" Tiara Ellis Richard of the Arlington Police office of communication said in an e-mail to USA TODAY. ""Officers were notified and arrived at the location. There were no issues that we are aware of, and no arrests occurred.""

One of four women who were meeting Saturday tried to file a police complaint on Monday but failed because she was told that no law had been violated, a spokeswoman for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense said Monday.

Shannon Watts, founder of the national gun control organization, said the mothers were holding a private meeting — not a rally — at the restaurant. She founded her group in the wake of the killings in Newtown, Conn.

Watts, whose organization is based in Indianapolis, said she was not at the restaurant at the time but was speaking on behalf of the four mothers, including a school teacher, who wanted to remain anonymous.

The Open Carry Texas (OCT) contingent, which included men, women and children, were armed with about two dozen semi-automatic rifles, which are classified as long guns in Texas and can be legally carried openly.

The two groups have been at odds since the mothers group successfully lobbied Starbucks to ban the open carrying of weapons in its coffee shops.

In April, a group of armed men also showed up at an MDA gun-control rally in Indianapolis, Watts said.

""We were surrounded by armed men, including some openly carrying loaded semi-automatic rifles,"" Watts said. ""Many of our moms had children with them. Unfortunately this is not a unique situation — it's happened in many states, including Indiana, Ohio, Oregon, Michigan and now Texas. If open carry is allowed, our rallies are often attended by armed protesters.""

In the Arlington incident, Watts said, the OCT apparently learned of the meeting through Facebook.

""They (the mothers) were sitting in the restaurant and all of a sudden saw cars pull up and these people were getting out of cars and pulling semi-automatic rifles out of their trunks,"" Watts said.

Kory Watkins, who organized the protests, told National Review's Charles C. W. Cooke that ""we were just out there peacefully assembling.""

""We walked down the street, away from where they were, and took a couple of pictures,"" he said. ""People were pulling over and honking and all that good stuff. When we were in the parking lot, one of them called us an (expletive) but that was it.""

Watts said the patrons of the Blue Mesa Grill were ""terrified.""

""They felt like in an armed ambush and had no idea why it was taking place,"" Watts said. She said one mom went from table to table ""to explain what was going on.""

Chris Barton, the CFO of Blue Mesa Grill, said that the manager called 911 at 11:35 a.m., shortly after the armed group arrived.

""When the manager called, he told them (the police dispatcher) what was going on,"" Barton said. ""They said that if they are having a peaceful demonstration, they are within their legal rights.""

He said the police did arrive as the group was leaving the restaurant area to walk to a nearby Hooters.

Watts said, however, that police told them on Monday that officers were already on the scene, keeping an eye on the incident.

The mothers group posted a photo online of the armed men outside the restaurant.

Open Carry Texas, however, reposted the same photo, added their own photo that was taken around the same time and included a message:

Many anti-gun groups have been posting this picture on their pages accusing these peaceful protesters of bullying and harassing members at their anti-gun rally. From this point of view, it looks like the gun owners are ready to confront someone. In reality, the peaceful gun owners were posing for a photo. Both pictures were taken at the same time, but one is good for anti-gun PR. Don't trust anything you see from the anti-gun pages.

Open Carry Texas says on its Facebook page that its purpose is to educate Texans about their right to openly carry rifles and shotguns in a safe manner and to ""condition Texans to feel safe around law-abiding citizens that choose to carry them.""

It also seeks to pass less-restrictive open-carry laws, especially pistols, which cannot be openly carried legally in Texas, and to foster a cooperative relationship with police ""with an eye towards preventing negative encounters.""

Kellye Bowman, a Houston activist with Moms Demand for Action, said her group is ""enemy No. 1"" to the open-carry groups.

She said the incident in Arlington was ""to confront"" and that ""there was no mistake what their intent was.""

Bowman said the Open Carry Texas group has been very high profile in recent months, including holding an unprecedented rally in front of the Alamo.

On Sunday, an open-carry group walked through a residential area of Kennedale, Texas, near Arlington, videotaping their interaction with a police officer. The group then posted the incident on YouTube, including their contention that they are not obliged to give their ID to police."

http://news.yahoo.com/ariz-bill-passed-makes-cities-153751047.html,,[],Ariz. bill passed makes cities sell turned-in guns,"PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona cities and counties would have to sell guns turned in at community buyback events instead of destroying them under a law passed by the Legislature.

The bill doesn't have any effect on guns seized by law enforcement, which already have to be sold to a federally licensed dealer under a law passed last year. But that didn't stop a lengthy debate that veered into the possibility that the gun used to shoot U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords might end up back on the street.

The bill is designed to eliminate a loophole in last year's law that requires police agencies to sell seized guns. Cities, including Tucson, have continued to hold buyback events and destroy the weapons, arguing that because they were voluntarily surrendered, they aren't covered by the law.

The Senate passed House Bill 2455 Tuesday on an 18-12 party-line vote and it now goes to Republican Gov. Jan Brewer for action.

Democrats argued that Republicans complain about the federal government when it requires the state to take action, yet they're quick to force local governments to do what they want.

""We hate it when the federal government mandates it to the state, and we're doing the same thing,"" said Sen. Lynne Pancrazi, D-Yuma. They also complained about victims having to deal with the knowledge that a gun that killed a loved one could end up back on the streets.

Republicans countered that allowing cities and counties to destroy guns that could be sold is a waste of taxpayer's money.

""It's not about protecting Second Amendment rights, it's about protecting the taxpayers,"" said Sen. Rick Murphy, R-Peoria. He also argued that the state doesn't require the destruction of cars involved in fatal accidents, so requiring guns to be destroyed is simply a feel-good measure that protects no one.

Murphy and Senate President Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert, pushed back at the argument against the state telling cities and counties what to do. Both noted that states retain rights not given to the federal government through the U.S. Constitution, while under the state constitution, cities and counties are subdivisions of the state.

During testimony before a House committee in February, Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox said buyback programs give people who no longer want guns in their homes a safe way to dispose of them. Some are worried the weapons could be stolen, and others want to prevent a family member from accessing them, she said.

""There are many, many reasons, but they would never fathom that the guns they turn in would be recirculated again,"" Wilcox said."
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/05/31/gun-control-just-got-even-more-difficult/,2013-05-31 00:00:00,['John Lott'],Why gun control just got even more difficult,"Gun control, an already difficult task, just got even more difficult.

The 3D printing revolution is well under way. This wonderful new technology will allow small companies and even individuals to manufacture a wide range of items, such as medical devices that fit each individual’s unique size and shape.

However, it is increasingly obvious that guns and gun parts can be made, even including entire assault weapons.

Unfortunately, the initial regulatory proposals will likely increase crime. As usual, new technology is hard to stop, and the Department of Homeland Security last week declared: ""Limiting access [to 3D-printing to make guns] may be impossible.""

Until now the stumbling block has been to design a gun that would be sturdy enough, something that can withstand the explosion when a bullet is shot down the barrel. In other words, you don’t want the gun to go off like a grenade in your hands instead of hitting the target.

Cody Wilson, the 25-year old founder of Defense Distributed, created a ruckus when he announced his successful design of a plastic gun that would operate like a normal one.

Plastic guns can’t be detected by metal detectors and would pose an obvious danger. But the hype so far exceeds what is practical.

When police in Australia downloaded the blueprint and easily made two plastic guns with a 3D printer, one of the two guns suffered “catastrophic failure” on its first shot. The other fired one successful shot before failing. The conclusion of the report the police released on last Friday was obvious: you are taking your life into your own hands if you use the plastic version of these guns.

That said, plastic guns are really a side issue, for 3D printers are increasingly allowing for other materials, including metal. Really all that needs to be metal are the gun’s steel barrel and firing pin.

Wilson used a metal nail for the firing pin. 100,000 copies of the handgun blueprint from Wilson’s website were downloaded around the world in just 2 days, with most of downloads coming from Spain, followed by the US, Brazil, and Germany.

The heavy downloads in Spain, Brazil, and Germany likely reflects attempts to evade their extremely restrictive licensing on semi-automatic handguns.

The Obama administration quickly stopped Wilson from distributing the file by threatening legal action, but it was already too late.

Legal or not, it doesn’t really matter: just as we've seen with movies, file sharing is unstoppable.

According to Torrent Freak, just a single episode of HBO’s Game of Thrones in 2012 was illegally downloaded an estimated 4.3 million times.

As of last Friday, after Wilson had stopped distributing the file, his blueprint could be downloaded from over 4,000 computers all around the world.

This blueprint is now among the top 10% most downloaded bit torrent files. Politicians just don’t seem to understand the new technology.

Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) and even the California state legislature are proposing to regulate 3D printing.

The proposal in California goes farthest and would treat 3D printers like guns, considering background checks, mandatory serial numbers, and even a registration process. But even if the government registered every printer, what is going to stop gangs from stealing these printers?

Would the government try to monitor what people do with legally owned printers?

Perhaps, in the end, people will need prior government permission for every item printed.

In any event, printers could soon be found everywhere.

Gartner, a company that specializes in evaluating technology research, predicts ""by 2016, enterprise-class 3D printers will be available for under $2,000.""

The cheapest 3D printers are already available for as little as $10,000. And what happens if we so thoroughly restrict access to printers?

Besides stifling technology generally, the issue has the same problem that's plaguing gun control: the most law-abiding citizens will be the ones obeying the law. Only criminals will get access to these inexpensively made guns, the Australian police made their guns for only $35 each.

This is a lesson Americans learned the hard way, for instance in Washington, D.C. and Chicago, where bans primarily disarmed law-abiding citizens and only increased violent crime.

Indeed, around the world, every time guns are banned, murder go up. Politicians must stop their wishful thinking. It is already exceedingly difficult to prevent criminals from getting their hands on guns. And technology is rapidly making gun control even more counterproductive."

There's rarely unanimity in any town, but in Newtown, on this...

EJ Dionne:

The real danger for Obama is that the coming months could become a summer of discontent if those who currently back the president lose track of where he wants to lead the country and abandon hope in Washington’s capacity to make things better. Already, there is a feeling of demobilization on the progressive side of politics. The liberal writer Paul Waldman captured the problem recently with this question on the American Prospect’s Web site: “What is the grand battle in which liberals are now engaged?” His response: “For the first time in a decade, there isn’t one.” While the next three years could well be “decisive for the liberal project,” he wrote, “it doesn’t feel that urgent to liberals.”

I dissent. Neither gun legislation nor immigration reform has passed yet. And the SCOTUS is key to everything, with aging Justices to be replaced.

David ignatius:

For an Obama administration that is struggling to find its voice in the second term, Rice’s elevation should be helpful. She will give the White House a compelling new focal point on foreign policy. People may not always agree with her, but they’ll know what she thinks. And perhaps she will galvanize sharper policy thinking from Obama himself, especially on Syria. But the Rice nomination brings some obvious risks: She is not a quiet inside player in the tradition of Brent Scowcroft, who was Donilon’s role model as national security adviser. She’s more in the tradition of extroverted policy intellectuals such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger, who used the media and other channels to shape events.

Because it's all about personality (and how well you get along with the press.)

NY Times:

Mr. Obama made no secret of how upset he was when he passed over Ms. Rice for secretary of state last winter amid a furor about the handling of the deadly attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya. But ever since, he has been choosing appointees and nominees he knew would provoke fights with Republicans, almost as if trying to redeem the moment. The unapologetic selections reflect a conclusion in the West Wing that when it comes to choosing personnel, the president can never satisfy Republicans who will find almost anyone objectionable. But his choices also highlight the complicated second-term balancing act for a president unconstrained by re-election concerns and therefore freer to challenge Congress, yet still hoping to forge deals by courting the opposition with dinners and White House meetings.

The West Wing is correct. And (message to the press) if life is complicated, don't oversimplify."
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-21/news/ct-met-illinois-concealed-carry-0621-20130621_1_gun-bill-quinn-spokeswoman-brooke-anderson-carry-bill,2013-06-21 00:00:00,"['Ray Long', 'Rafael Guerrero']",Concealed carry bill could provide face-saver for Quinn,"— With a fast-approaching federal court deadline to allow people to legally carry concealed weapons in Illinois, the political groundwork is being laid to let Gov. Pat Quinn stand tall on gun control while lawmakers prepare to override him if he breaks their delicately constructed compromise.

The political maneuvering is the result of a gun bill the General Assembly approved before adjourning at the end of May. A federal appeals court had thrown out the state's long-standing, last-in-the-nation concealed-carry ban but put a hold on its ruling until lawmakers came up with a law spelling out who can carry weapons and where they can take them.

The bill that landed on Quinn's desk is a mixed bag for a liberal Democratic governor with a long record of supporting tight gun control measures. On the one hand, the bill would ban guns from places like casinos, schools, stadiums the CTA and Metra. And it would preserve assault weapons bans already in place in Chicago, Cook County and elsewhere.

But both sides of the gun debate acknowledge the bill would allow handguns with 19 rounds to be carried in public. And the legislation would override local laws dealing with handguns, ammunition and restrictions on how to transport weapons from town to town.

Legislative leaders in both parties expect a scenario to unfold over the next couple of weeks that allows Quinn to save face and lawmakers to stick to what they voted for: The governor will veto or make changes to the bill and lawmakers then will override him and put the law on the books.

""I think he's going to veto or amendatorily veto the bill, requiring us to come back in the session to act on that veto,"" said Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago.

In addition, the gun bill's sponsor said House Speaker Michael Madigan on Wednesday went over the process for how to handle a Quinn veto or rewrite. ""There was talk brought up that the speaker had heard that the governor is expected to file an amendatory veto or a veto,"" said Rep. Brandon Phelps, D-Harrisburg.

Lawmakers are being told to prepare to come back to Springfield on July 8. The significance of that date? It's the day before Quinn's suggested deadline for lawmakers to come up with a solution for the state's heavily underfunded pension funds. It's also the day before the federal court order to invalidate the state's ban on concealed carry is scheduled to take effect.

The Quinn administration says little more than the governor is ""very carefully"" reviewing the bill. Quinn spokeswoman Brooke Anderson also noted Thursday: ""The governor has a long history of fighting violence. Public safety is always his top priority.""

Sen. Kwame Raoul, a South Side Democrat who played a leading role in concealed carry negotiations, said he talked to Quinn before and after the concealed carry bill passed. Raoul said Quinn is still concerned about a variety of provisions, ranging from businesses that don't want gun-toting customers having to post signs ""all over the place"" to giving towns without bans on assault weapons only 10 days to enact an ordinance once the bill becomes law.

""The governor's concerned that signing the bill might reflect too much of a concession,"" said Raoul, who predicted Quinn will issue some type of veto. ""He is still challenged with the end product.""

Legislative leaders don't seem worried about what Quinn ends up doing.

""At the end of the day,"" Madigan said, ""if the governor were to veto or to offer an amendatory veto, he'll be overridden.""

Whatever Quinn decides, lawmakers are just hoping he does it soon. On Thursday, nearly two dozen Senate Democrats led by Cullerton and Sen. Gary Forby, the lead sponsor from Benton in southern Illinois, sought to increase pressure on Quinn to act ""as soon as possible"" so lawmakers can respond, if necessary, to avoid a ""public safety and constitutional crisis.""

""Time is of the essence,"" the letter said.

For Quinn, the decision on the concealed carry bill is both a matter of policy and politics.

Quinn faces re-election next year, and a Democratic primary looms against either former White House chief of staff Bill Daley or Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, the speaker's daughter. Daley already has suggested that Quinn should veto the bill or toughen it up and send it back to lawmakers.

Cook County voters who account for the bulk of Democratic primary votes are overwhelmingly in favor of gun control. Taking a strong pro-gun control stand even if lawmakers end up overriding him allows Quinn to turn a loss into a potential win. Speaker Madigan said he expects Quinn to take action ""designed to advance his campaign for re-election.""

Quinn has shown he is willing to use his authority to propose changes in legislation that promote his own political views even if the chances of getting lawmakers to go along are slim. Last year he took a low-profile gun bill and inserted a semi-automatic assault weapons ban in the wake of shootings at a theater in Aurora, Colo. Lawmakers ignored his proposal.

For his part, Quinn has urged Attorney General Madigan to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court of the ruling that tossed out Illinois' ban. But she has called for passing legislation that would resolve the court battle. She's also exploring her legal options if no carry law is put on the books. The deadline for her to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court is July 24, but she wants to see what the governor does.

Nobody knows for sure what will happen if Illinois can't get a law in place by the July 9 appeals court deadline. Still, fissures are emerging that may foreshadow a state of confusion."

She took a rare step for any first lady into the legislative fight of the hour, saying her husband, President Obama, is “fighting as hard as he can, and engaging as many people as he can, to pass common-sense reforms to protect our children from gun violence.”

“These reforms deserve a vote in Congress,” she said, drawing loud applause from hundreds of Chicago’s business executives and civic leaders who were gathered at a luncheon to raise money for a new anti-violence initiative.

Obama spoke emotionally about attending the funeral in February of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old majorette who was shot in a city park not far from the Obamas’ Chicago house and just days after visiting Washington for President Obama’s inauguration ceremonies.

“As I visited with the Pendleton family at Hadiya’s funeral, I couldn’t get over how familiar they felt to me, because what I realized was Hadiya’s family was just like my family,” the first lady said. “Hadiya Pendleton was me, and I was her. But I got to grow up and go to Princeton and Harvard Law School and have a career and a family, and the most blessed life I could ever imagine. And Hadiya — well, we know that story.”

The first lady described how Pendleton was an honors student and had two devoted parents who were “hardworking people” and “churchgoing folks.” She said the Pendletons enrolled Hadiya in cheerleading and dance classes, as well as the majorette troop, to keep her active and out of harm’s way.

Obama drew parallels to her own childhood in the 1970s on the South Side of Chicago, where, she said, she had just a few more advantages than her peers — including opportunities and adult mentors who pushed her to succeed.

“In the end, that was the difference between growing up and becoming a lawyer, a mother and first lady of the United States and being shot dead at the age of 15,” Obama said.

The first lady described a tale of two Chicagos, lamenting that many children who live in the impoverished South Side have never visited the Art Institute, walked around Millennium Park, strolled Navy Pier or seen Lake Michigan.

“Many of them don’t even know that the University of Chicago exists, let alone dream of attending that university, or any university for that matter,” she said. “Instead of spending their days enjoying the abundance of riches this city has to offer, they are consumed with watching their backs. They are afraid to walk alone because they might be jumped. They are afraid to walk in groups because that might identify them as part of a gang.”

After her speech, Obama visited with students and counselors at Harper High School, one of Chicago’s most dangerous schools. Last year, 29 current or recent Harper students were shot, eight of them fatally.

“I grew up in South Shore,” Obama told the students. “My parents were working-class folks. There isn’t much distance between me and you. . . . In this world today, if you stay focused, you can make it happen. The best thing you can do in life is really be serious about education.”

In the days following Pendleton’s funeral, Michelle Obama decided she wanted to step outside her narrow focus on military families and childhood nutrition to confront the reality of gun violence, aides said.

She decided that Wednesday’s luncheon for a new $50 million public-private initiative to combat youth violence in Chicago would be the right setting to speak out. The event brought together a diverse cross section of the city’s most powerful residents — chief executives and pastors and financiers, Democrats as well as Republicans.

Obama was introduced by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), former White House chief of staff in the Obama administration, who is spearheading the fundraising effort. So far, they have raised $33 million, officials said.

Michelle Obama pitched the audience on investing in the program, saying she hopes other cities can replicate it. “This is going to take a serious and sustained investment over a very long period of time, people,” she said. “This is forever.”

The first lady’s aides described her new focus as part of a broader agenda on youth opportunity and empowerment. With her remarks coming amid a contentious debate on Capitol Hill over stricter gun laws, however, Michelle Obama risks being seen as leveraging her widespread popularity and nonpartisan appeal to advance her husband’s legislative agenda.

In advance of Wednesday’s speech, aides said, Obama did not plan to specifically mention gun-control legislation or call on Congress to do anything. In the end, however, the first lady decided to engage fully in the political debate.

After calling on Congress to vote on gun bills, she echoed the president, saying, “We can’t stop all of the violence in the world, but if there is even one thing we can do, even one step we can take to save another child or another parent from the grief that’s visited families like Hadiya’s, and so many others here today, then don’t we have an obligation to try?”

The National Conference of Democratic Mayors are now threatening to have their police departments boycott the purchase of guns from manufacturers who won’t adhere to the Obama Administration’s strictures.

The mayors are going to grade the manufacturers on their record of support vis-à-vis Obama’s plans for gun control, including universal background checks, the elimination of high-capacity magazines and sharing information on crime and mental health.

The leader of this crusade is Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, who stated:

When we were lobbying on Capitol Hill, it became clear that our goal of trying to pass laws that make it easier to make our communities safe was going to be opposed by the gun and ammunition manufacturers. We recognize as mayors, we help fund that, because we are one of the largest purchasers of guns and ammunition in the country. So at the Democratic mayors meeting last night, we agreed that we would all go back to our communities, gather information from our police chiefs and procurement officers about how many guns and how much ammunition we purchase, bring that in from the Democratic mayors so that we have a common list of how much money we’re spending, what purchases are pending and who we’re buying from.

Rybak added that the group will join Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns to grade the manufacturers.

Rybak concluded:

Then we’re going to do everything we can as mayors to use … the collective buying power of many millions of dollars in guns and ammunition, to support those who will support common-sense laws and oppose those who are fighting us in Congress. I am not going to have the people, the taxpayers of Minneapolis, pay for people to stop the Congress from passing laws that keep our people safe. It’s especially galling, paying money from our police departments to produce loopholes that allow illegal handguns into my communities that could be used against police officers.

On Friday night, the National Conference of Democratic Mayors resolved support for the gun control and public safety proposals of the White House."
http://news.yahoo.com/thousands-rally-against-stricter-gun-control-us-223627779.html,,[],Thousands rally against stricter gun control in US,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Gun advocates — some with rifles slung across shoulders or pistols holstered at the hip — have rallied peacefully in state capitals nationwide against President Barack Obama's sweeping federal gun-control proposals.

Summoned via social media for the ""Guns Across America"" event, participants gathered Saturday for protests large and small against stricter limits sought on firearms. Only a few dozen turned out in South Dakota and a few hundred in Boise, Idaho. Some 2,000 turned out in New York and large crowds also rallied in Connecticut, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington state.

The rallies came on a day in which accidental shootings at gun shows in North Carolina, Indiana and Ohio left five people hurt. The wounded included two bystanders hit by shotgun pellets after a 12-gauge shotgun discharged at a show in Raleigh, N.C., as the owner unzipped its case for a law officer to check at a security entrance, authorities said. A retired deputy there also suffered a slight hand injury.

About 800 people gathered for the ""Guns Across America"" event in Austin, Texas, as speakers took to the microphone under a giant Texas flag stamped with one word: ""Independent.""

""The thing that so angers me, and I think so angers you, is that this president is using children as a human shield to advance a very liberal agenda that will do nothing to protect them,"" said state Rep. Steve Toth, referencing last month's elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn.

Obama recently announced the gun-control proposals in the wake of a Connecticut elementary school shooting that killed 20 first-graders and six educators last month.

Toth, a first-term Republican lawmaker from The Woodlands outside Houston, has introduced legislation to ban within Texas any future federal limits on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, though such a measure would violate the U.S. Constitution.

In Arizona, Oregon and Utah, some came with holstered handguns or rifles on their backs.

One man in Phoenix dressed as a Revolutionary War Minuteman, completing his outfit with an antique long rifle and a sign reading: ""Tyrants Beware - 1776.""

""We're out here because this country has some very wise founding fathers and they knew they were being oppressed when they were a British colony,"" said another man at the Phoenix rally, Eric Cashman. ""Had they not had their firearms ... to stand up against the British, we'd still be a British colony.""

Rallies at statehouses nationwide were organized by Eric Reed, an airline captain from the Houston area who in November started a group called ""More Gun Control (equals) More Crime."" Its Facebook page has been ""liked"" by more than 17,000 people.

At the New York state Capitol in Albany, about 2,000 people turned out for a chilly rally, where they chanted ""We the People,"" ''USA,"" and ""Freedom."" Many carried American flags and ""Don't Tread On Me"" banners. The event took place four days after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the nation's toughest assault weapon and magazine restrictions.

In Connecticut, where task forces created by the Legislature and Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy are considering changes to gun laws, police said about 1,000 people showed up on the Capitol grounds. One demonstrator at the rally in Maine, Joe Getchell of Pittsfield, said every law-abiding citizen has a right to bear arms.

In Minnesota, where more than 500 people showed up at the Capitol in St. Paul, Republican state Rep. Tony Cornish said he would push to allow teachers to carry guns in school without a principal or superintendent's approval and to allow 21-year-olds to carry guns on college campuses.

Capitol rallies also took place in Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Vermont and Wisconsin, among other states.

Back in Texas, Houston resident Robert Thompson attended the rally with his wife and children, ages 12, 5 and 4. Many in the family wore T-shirts reading: ""The Second Amendment Protects the First.""

""What we are facing now is an assault weapons ban, but if they do this, what will do they do next?"" Thompson asked.

After the NRA school-guard strategy was denounced as crazy%2C Obama proposed armed guards in schools.

It%27s the gun critics who appear to be out of the mainstream.

Even Al Franken understands that voters might not be so keen on gun control

Ever since the Sandy Hook shootings, we've been hearing that now, at last, it's time for the National Rifle Association to drop its ""extremist"" views and accept the sort of gun control that Democrats — and their allies in the press — were pushing long before Sandy Hook. When NRA Executive Vice President Wayne La Pierre proposed armed guards in schools, it was portrayed as evidence of how out-of-touch the organization was. Democratic pundits called on Obama to crush the NRA while it was on the ropes — when they weren't calling for its members and officers to be killed.

Whose idea was it anyway?

But then a funny thing happened. After the NRA school-guard strategy was roundly denounced as outright crazy by the pundits, — the editors of the New York Times called it ""delusional, almost deranged"" — President Obama came out with ... a proposal for armed guards in schools. It is no small feat for an out-of-touch, on-the-ropes organization to get the president to basically endorse its signature policy proposal at a time of national debate.

But, then again, it turned out that 55% of Americans supported the NRA proposal. Turns out, it was the people calling it crazy — like the editors of the New York Times — who were out of the mainstream.

Meanwhile, pundits denounced gun-rights activists who said that the right to bear arms is in part a protection against government tyranny. Only a crazed militia type could possibly believe that, right? Except that — go figure — 65% of Americans see gun rights as a protection against tyranny. And only 17% say they disagree. Once again, it's the critics who appear to be out of the mainstream.

Outside the mainstream

And by out of the mainstream, I mean really out of the mainstream. According to a post-Sandy Hook Gallup poll, the NRA,with a 54% favorable rating, is actually more popular than President Obama. By contrast, Obama's most recent approval rating from Gallup was 48%. This is particularly striking given that the NRA has faced unrelentingly hostile treatment from most press and pundits, while President Obama has received treatment that is, to put it mildly, far more generous.

Even left-Democrat Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota says he's unsure about whether he'd support an assault weapon ban. This is, I presume, because he fears that even a blue state like Minnesota doesn't want more restrictive gun laws, and that a different position will hurt him in the coming election.

In other words, it seems likely that this Washington Post claim is right: That the NRA is actually winning.

How can that be? Simple enough. The NRA more closely reflects the views of most Americans on gun issues than do Democratic pundits — or Barack Obama.

Somebody's out of the mainstream, all right. It's just not the gun-rights supporters.

Whoever thinks the ad is about President Obama's daughters are missing the point completely or they're trying to change the subject. This ad is about keeping our children safe. And the President said he was skeptical about the NRA proposal to put policemen in all schools in this country. Yet he and his family are beneficiaries of multiple law enforcement officers surrounding them 24 hours a day. That's the real issue. Anything else is an attempted calculated distraction.

Are the president’s kids more important than yours? Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school? Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he’s just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security.

Right. That had absolutely nothing to do with the President's children, nor was it a personal attack on President Obama. We are just taking the ad out of context and using it as a distraction for our own ends.

These people are about as craven as they come. Good luck convincing anyone that criticism of this reprehensible message is a distraction.

Not even Joe Scarborough is buying it.

From the link at Media Matters:



Scarborough, who as a Congressman was a strong supporter of the NRA, responded to the ad, asking ""what's wrong with these people?"" He continued, pointing out that once Obama decided to run for president, his children ""have targets on their backs."" Scarborough also said that the NRA is now a ""fringe organization with millions of mainstream members."" He concluded by saying the ad was ""frightening and over the line"".

When the NRA loses someone as wingnutty as Joe Scarborough, you know they are backed into a corner. And now that we have them backed into a corner, it's time to push them back under that rock they crawled out from under."

The (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal

Federal court backed Wilmington Housing Authority ban on guns

NRA backed plaintiffs want state courts to decide

Ruling could set national precedent for gun restrictions in public housing

PHILADELPHIA -- Having lost a federal court battle over restrictions on guns in Wilmington public housing, plaintiffs backed by the National Rifle Association have asked an appeals court to send the matter back to Delaware courts.

Attorney Francis G.X. Pileggi told a panel of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday that Delaware's Constitution provides for a far broader right to keep and bear arms than the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, so this case – involving limits on those rights – would best be resolved at the state level.

Wilmington Housing Authority attorney Barry M. Willoughby, however, argued that having lost in federal court, the NRA is attempting to get a do-over.

""What we have here is an attempt by the plaintiff to use a legal gambit to deny this court jurisdiction,"" Willoughby said, adding that the plaintiffs did not attempt to set aside state issues during the lengthy and hard-fought federal litigation.

National experts have said that ruling in this Delaware case could set a national precedent for how far public housing authorities are allowed to restrict gun ownership by residents.

The initial NRA-backed lawsuit was filed in June 2010 in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to overturn a flat ban on all guns in Wilmington public housing. The suit was transferred to U.S. District Court at the request of the city housing authority because it involved federal constitutional issues.

Shortly after the case ended up in District Court, following several rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court, the WHA dropped its flat ban on all weapons without a trial and allowed residents to keep guns for protection, though it limited guns in common areas like lobbies, lounges and laundry rooms.

The NRA, however, did not drop the lawsuit and forced a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Stark on claims that the new gun restrictions were unconstitutional.

In August 2012, Stark sided with the WHA, ruling the restrictions were limited and reasonable and did not violate Second Amendment rights."

(CNN) - Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, plan to announce a bipartisan deal on background checks for gun shows and Internet sales at an 11 a.m. press conference today, CNN's Dana Bash has learned.

A Democratic leadership source says the compromise will likely be the first amendment to gun legislation being considered, after the Senate votes to begin the gun debate Thursday.



READ MORE: CNN Poll: Popular background checks also cause worry

The breakthrough background check agreement is a key part of gun legislation. Because it has been struck by two senators with strong support from the NRA, they hope to find the 60 votes that will be needed to overcome opposition to pass their amendment

The senate is expected to debate gun legislation for at least two weeks.

Democrats believe as many as a dozen GOP senators will vote with them, making up for the handful of pro-gun Democrats who might vote against beginning debate on the bill. Fourteen Republicans promise to filibuster taking up the measure.

Several Republican senators told CNN Tuesday they would only vote to begin debate on the bill if they were assured by Democrats they would be allowed to offer amendments to the legislation.

Democratic leaders want to give senators from both parties ample opportunities to amend the bill and are prepared to debate it beyond a scheduled recess the first week in May, if doing so will increase the chances of passage.

“The way you put together a coalition to pass the bill is to allow as many amendment votes as you can. We are willing to take the time to do that and have that process,” the aide said.

Those negotiators will now have more time to find common ground on language, since the gun debate is expected to be lengthy. Democratic leaders also argue any bill they put on the floor will represent a substantial improvement in gun safety.

Many of those additional votes could be politically difficult for centrist Democrats, especially those up for re-election in red states, as Republicans are expected to craft amendments designed to put those senators on the spot. Nevertheless, Democratic leaders have determined it’s a risk they need to take if they want to pass substantive legislation to respond to the mass shootings that have plagued the nation in recent years.

“Once we’re on it we want to have an open process where there are a lot of votes and we really work through that,” the aide said.

Last year%27s meeting drew 73%2C740 people in St. Louis

Event serves as both a business meeting and a kind of gun festival%2C complete with a concert and other events

Gun-control advocates see the organization as increasingly out-of-touch

HOUSTON — In some ways, the national debate over gun control has been good for the National Rifle Association.

The nation's largest and most powerful gun rights group holds its annual meeting in Houston this weekend, and it's expected to be its biggest and most-watched gathering ever — perhaps 80,000 people, more than 400 exhibitors, 600 credentialed media and perhaps a future presidential candidate or two.

""I don't think there's anything this year that's business as usual. We're in a very unique point in time as far as the Second Amendment is concerned,"" NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said. ""It's a demonstration of their passion, of the commitment and the resolve that the American people have toward their freedom.""

Last month, Senate Democrats suspended votes on major gun legislation after they failed to pass a key provision that would have extended criminal background checks for most firearm purchases.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who will speak to the NRA meeting Friday, said his message is that the Obama Administration isn't doing enough to prosecute gun crimes and keep schools safe.

""Millions of Americans stood up in the last few weeks and called on the Senate to uphold the Second Amendment,"" Cruz said. ""Everyone in my view ought to be focused on stopping violent crime.""

The annual meeting is required under the NRA's bylaws to elect people to its 76-member board of directors. But the event has become more than a business meeting, and includes a gun show, awards dinners, a political rally, a prayer service, book signings and a country music concert. For the lawyers, there are even continuing legal education credits available.

Last year's meeting — a required campaign stop for GOP candidates in an election year — drew 73,740 people in St. Louis. The exact attendance in Houston won't be known until next week, but organizers say they already had 70,000 confirmed attendees earlier this week. Requests for media credentials have doubled, to 600. And they've booked three times as many hotel rooms as the 2005 meeting, when it was last in Houston.

Greg Ortale, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the convention was booked five years in advance. One draw for Houston, he said, was the state's permissive laws on the carrying of firearms.

""They have some organizing and political rallies going on, but it's mostly trade show,"" The vast majority of the attendees are day-trippers who will drive from Texas and neighboring states, he said.

""It's a convention that a lot of families come to. It's unique in that respect. Most people don't take their families to an oil and gas trade show,"" Ortale said.

The convention is expected to draw protests, but will get a welcome from at least one unlikely host: Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the Democrat who represents downtown Houston in Congress. She's tried — unsuccessfully, so far — to arrange a meeting with NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre in an attempt to win him over on child-gun-safety legislation she has introduced.

""What I'd like to hear from the National Rifle Association, which has every right to gather in any city, is that they understand that we are a country without morality if we can't do something to protect our babies and our children,"" she said. ""I think that if Wayne would sit down, I honestly believe we could find a rational approach to gun safety and protecting our children.""

Other gun-control advocates were less optimistic, painting NRA leaders as right-wing ideologues financed by the firearms industry and increasingly out-of-touch with their own members. ""They espouse an insurrectionist, anti-democratic philosophy, and they have a lot of people on their board that, to put it lightly, you wouldn't want in polite company,"" said Josh Horwitz, director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

Josh Sugarmann, the director of the Violence Policy Center, said polls show most gun owners support universal background checks even more stringent than those blocked last month in the Senate. But nothing will happen in Houston this weekend to moderate the NRA's stance, he said.

""The golden era of NRA debates at their annual meeting is long over,"" he said. ""As far as any potential for a change in direction, the chances are zero."""

Emanating from different cultures, incapable of agreeing on how to make us all safer from firearms.

Their opposite views were in full voice last week in the Legislature during a marathon 10-hour committee hearing — longest anyone could remember — on gun bills.

Unlike in Washington, where gun control forces couldn’t muster enough strength in the U.S. Senate to pass legislation expanding background checks, a state Senate committee in Sacramento approved eight bills to strengthen California’s already stringent firearms regulations.

Unfortunately, without universal background checks nationwide — not only in gun stores, which already is the law, but at gun shows and via the Internet — California is vulnerable to Wild-West dealing in other states.

Criminals and mental misfits can buy virtually any weapon they want at a Nevada or Arizona gun show and cart it into California, circumventing this state’s tough background checks.

Advertisement

Actually, in Washington there was solid majority support for expanding background checks — 55 Senate votes. But because of that chamber’s arcane rules born of undemocratic filibusters, the bill needed 60, or a 60% supermajority.

In Sacramento, where Democrats overwhelmingly rule, most gun legislation can be passed on a simple majority vote.

Advertisement

One exception is a bill to speed up the confiscation of guns from Californians who bought them legally, but later were disqualified because of a violent crime, a restraining order or mental illness. There are roughly 20,000 people possessing around 40,000 firearms who aren’t supposed to have them.

The bill, SB 140 by Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), requires a two-thirds vote in each legislative house. It would appropriate $24 million to hire enough agents to seize the weapons.

Advertisement

But despite opposition by the gun lobby — it objects to using money from background check fees paid by gun buyers — the measure has been sailing through the Legislature. It passed the Assembly 57-10 last week, with only Republicans voting “no.”

This bill, however, offers a clear example of political polarization in the Capitol.

Advertisement

Republicans proposed a perfectly sensible amendment that would have required all the illegal weapons to be confiscated in one year, rather than over three as mandated by the bill. Democrats quickly tabled the amendment, cutting off debate.

“If we’re going to be serious about dealing with felons with guns, then we need to take advantage of the money and make it a priority,” Assemblyman Donald Wagner (R-Irvine), the amendment’s author, told me.

Advertisement

“A lot of folks on my [GOP] side want to do something. They don’t want to just be saying ‘no.’ But they didn’t even let us debate….

“I won’t say it’s impossible to come together. And I won’t say one side is entirely right and the other is entirely wrong. But both sides need to get beyond their hardened positions of the past.”

Advertisement

Hardened positions, however, dominated the long meeting of the Senate Public Safety Committee. Republicans followed the gun lobby in opposing every measure. Democrats passed all of them on party-line 5-to-2 votes.

“There’s a difference between opposing every bill and your saying, ‘We would support it if you did this or that,’ ” Steinberg, a Democrat from Sacramento, finally vented to gun lobbyists. “It would help your credibility.”

Advertisement

The committee approved bills to:

•Prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles that hold detachable magazines. SB 374, Steinberg. The senator called them “mass killing machines.”

Advertisement

• Ban even the possession of magazines holding more than 10 rounds. They’re already illegal to buy. SB 396, Sen. Loni Hancock (D-Berkeley).

• Require ammunition buyers to pass a background check and obtain a license. SB 53, Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles).

Advertisement

• Add repeated alcohol and drug offenses as reasons for denying gun ownership. SB 755, Sen. Lois Wolk (D-Davis).

• Require long gun purchasers to pass a written safety test. That’s already required for handgun buyers. SB 683, Sen. Marty Block (D-San Diego).

Advertisement

These and other bills passed by the committee perhaps could use some expert tweaking — even gutting — and the gun lobbyists are experts. But they’re such inflexible hard-liners that Democrats ignore them.

Just as intransigent were scores of citizens who lined up to emotionally argue for gun rights. They repeatedly voiced two familiar mantras: Gun control laws are unconstitutional because of the 2nd Amendment. And the laws don’t stop gun violence, they only harass innocent law-abiding citizens.

Advertisement

“My rights are protected by the United States Constitution and not affected by an L.A. Times poll,” protested one tea party member, referring to a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll that found overwhelming support for stricter gun controls.

Countering the constitutional argument, Steinberg quoted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in a 2008 opinion that affirmed the right of individuals to own firearms. “Like most rights,” Scalia wrote, “the right secured by the 2nd Amendment is not unlimited….

Advertisement

“The right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”

As for badgering law-abiding citizens, Steinberg noted that four killers in the last five mass shootings had no prior criminal records. And the fifth had been guilty only of a minor offense.

Murderers often are law-abiders until they’re not — until they shoot their wife or get fired and mow down former co-workers.

Also testifying were long lines of gun control advocates, including trauma surgeons and mothers, some of whom had lost children to gun fire.

Yes, these gun combatants are living in parallel universes. And so are Sacramento and Washington. Too bad they can’t figure out how to fire in sync at the same enemy: gun violence.

So at the end of a long, tiring day in Washington on Wednesday, the Carmel mother said her fatigue and concern percolated to the surface during a meeting about gun control in Indiana Republican Sen. Dan Coats' office

""I guess you could say I got a little emotional,"" she said. ""I didn't go to the 'ugly cry,' but my voice was cracking, and I was tearing up.""

Just getting an audience was an achievement for Paulson, 53, and the nascent group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. It was founded in December by Zionsville mother Shannon Watts after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newton, Conn.

The group now has 80 chapters and 80,000 members and made its first lobbying trip to the Capitol in advance of a vote on a gun proposal.

That bill, to ban assault weapons and ammunition magazines with more than 10 rounds, passed on a party-line 10-8 vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. It was the fourth gun-control proposal the committee approved in a week. The others would require federal background checks for all gun purchases, crack down on illegal gun purchases and beef up school safety.

About 200 members from Moms Demand Action split into small teams and visited congressional offices for 30 states. Paulson and Watts were in Coats' office when Paulson's emotions boiled over.

""I was a little embarrassed because the others in our group were so poised,"" she said. ""But they said a little emotion is good once in a while.""

Nikki McNally of Carmel, who also made the trip, said the group hopes to emulate Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

""Drunk driving seemed like the norm, and MADD changed the way we think about it,"" McNally said. ""We don't want owning assault weapons to be the norm.""

The group also visited the offices of Sen. Joe Donnelly and Rep. Andre Carson. Both are Democrats from Indiana.

McNally said the congressional staffers listened politely but were noncommittal about where their bosses would vote, or even stand, on the pending bills.

""I've done a lot of volunteering but never this type of thing,"" said Paulson, who works in finance and has two grown children. ""I found it frustrating because I want a position and the staffer often says, 'We are still looking at the issue.'""

Carson supports the background check legislation but wants to see a final version off the assault weapons bill, if it comes to the House, before he comments, said Blake Johnson, a spokesman.

""The congressman is fully aware of Moms Demand Action and appreciates what they are doing and that they started in Indiana,"" Johnson said.

Donnelly's office issued a statement. ""I will give serious consideration to proposals that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill without infringing on the rights of law-abiding gun owners,"" it read.

Coats' office did not respond to inquiries.

Though Moms Demand Action models itself after MADD, Mike Hammond, legislative director for Gun Owners of America, said he resented the comparison of gun owners to drunken drivers.

""It suggests that owning a gun is as culpable a behavior as getting into car drunk,"" he said. ""The difference is driving a car is a privilege, and owning a gun is a right protected by the Second Amendment.""

Gun Owners of America describes itself as more hardline than the National Rifle Association and opposes all the pending bills, including background checks, which experts say has the best chance of bipartisan support.

The bill would require private gun sellers to run criminal background checks on their buyers, something only gun shops have to do now.

Paul Helmke, a professor at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said Moms Demand Action has a chance to make inroads in gun control where other efforts failed.

""I think they have struck a chord, and it's the best chance for something to get done in years,"" said Helmke, the former president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and ex-mayor of Fort Wayne.

He said it is a little more difficult for politicians to ignore mothers than to brush off mayors or police chiefs .

""They don't have a good way to put them off because they don't deal with them every day,"" he said. ""It's hard to tell a mom to get lost."""

Six of those kids were killed.

Stories of note would have to include that of the 19-year-old man who killed his 13-year-old step-sister on her birthday, while handling an AK-47 in which he ""forgot he had a loaded magazine."" And the 16-year-old shot by his 15-year-old friend while ""playing a zombie game."" And the 4-year-old who killed his father, having found an unsecured gun in the friend's home the two were visiting. This one highlights the need for more universal gun safety precautions. Most parents probably wouldn't think about how any guns are stored in homes they're visiting, nor risk insulting their hosts by asking.

In a similar vein, the owner of the gun involved in the fatal shooting of a 10-year-old boy in San Diego this week insisted that it had been stored unloaded and separately from the ammunition, both of which had been hidden from his children. But hiding guns isn't the same thing as securing them. If you're depending on just not being inquisitive enough to find them, you might be kidding yourself. And if you're depending on them being disciplined enough not to touch them if they find them, how much do you know about the kids they play with, and how much faith have you got in them?

One story not so easily categorized as classic #GunFAIL, but of interest nonetheless is that of the stolen gun sales ring broken up by police at Martin County, Florida's ... Community Christian School. Of particular note here: ""Investigators went to the school and following several interviews, determined that one student had burglarized a home on six different occasions and stole five weapons from a safe.""

Here's some interesting follow-up from previous #GunFAIL episodes that show an interesting contrast. During the past week it was announced that suspects in two accidental child shooting cases, both from Oregon, would face no charges. The first involved a 4-year-old who found a gun and shot himself, and the second, an adult male who accidentally shot his girlfriend's 9-year-old daughter while practicing quick draws with a loaded pistol. By way of contrast, there was a third case resolved this week, involving a Minnesota father whose 4-year-old found his gun and killed his 2-year-old brother. No charges in the first two cases, but a guilty verdict and the possibility of 10 years in prison in the third.

Finally, one other story worth noting: the 69-year-old member of the St. Charles Sportsman's Club in Blackberry, IL, who accidentally discharged his shotgun inside the clubhouse, injuring 10 fellow club members. That's gonna be a tough one to explain come membership renewal time.

And now, below the fold, this week's compilation."

After winning a major victory over President Obama with the defeat of a gun-control bill in the Senate, the National Rifle Association will gather in Houston this weekend for its annual convention.

After winning a major victory over President Obama with the defeat of a gun-control bill in the Senate, the National Rifle Association gathered in Houston this weekend for its annual convention.

After winning a major victory over President Obama with the defeat of a gun-control bill in the Senate, the National Rifle Association gathered in Houston this weekend for its annual convention.

The National Rifle Association’s convention in Houston this weekend bristled with the combative and triumphant rhetoric of a group that achieved a major victory in 2013: completely defeating the White House-backed package of gun-control legislation.

On the surface, the gun-rights group seems stronger than ever with tens of thousands enthusiastic participants, record high membership and effusive approval for the path taken by the its leader, Wayne LaPierre.

Beneath the surface, however, some of the NRA’s allies are uneasy, saying publicly and privately that the organization is facing long-term — and even short-term — challenges on a scale it has not faced before.

Those challenges include changing demographics and patterns of gun ownership; a new willingness of gun-state lawmakers, particularly Democrats, to buck the NRA; and the rise of an organized and well-funded gun-control movement.

The concerns are playing out in a debate over whether the NRA and gun-rights advocates made a mistake by pugnaciously opposing all of this year’s major gun-control proposals — including legislation expanding background checks for gun purchases sponsored by two NRA-backed senators, Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.). That measure failed in a high-profile vote last month.

In recent days, one of the country’s best-known gun-rights advocates, Robert Levy, criticized the gun lobby for strenuously blocking the background check initiative on Capitol Hill. Levy, who was part of the legal team that won recent landmark gun-rights cases, also chairs the Cato Institute, an influential libertarian think tank that advocates for Second Amendment rights.

“The stonewalling of the background check proposal was a mistake, both politically and substantively,” Levy said recently, noting that public opinion favors such an approach. In an interview and in online blogs, Levy called for improvements in the legislation but noted overall that the Manchin-Toomey effort is “far better than the legal regime we now have.”

Levy has disagreed with NRA strategy in the past. But his views have been reinforced by others in recent weeks, most significantly by the votes of NRA-backed lawmakers who felt free to break with the gun lobby and support the background check proposal, particularly Democrats such as Jon Tester of Montana.

Pennsylvania may provide the most stark example of a reason for NRA worry. The state has one of the highest concentrations of NRA members in the country. Yet both senators — Toomey and Democrat Robert P. Casey Jr. — agreed to cross the NRA this year on its most high-profile vote of the year. In addition, three GOP House members from Pennsylvania, endorsed in the past by the NRA, have indicated support for the senators’ approach.

Still, NRA board member Grover Norquist says that NRA officials are thrilled with the results the NRA achieved this year on the state and national levels — accomplished despite the full-court press by the Obama White House and its gun-control allies.

A new report to be released this week by the Center for American Progress (CAP), a think tank with ties to the White House and the Democratic Party, looked into changes in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado, citing gains there resulting in part from the grass-roots efforts of gun-control forces.

For example, since 2008, New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) and the organization he founded and funds, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, has been active in the state, building a coalition of more than 150 mayors. Bloomberg’s organization also has been at work in other traditional gun states, such as Colorado and Virginia, where senators also supported the Manchin-Toomey background check proposal last month.

The support of purple-state senators for legislation that the NRA strongly opposes is not in itself an indicator of change. Members in the past have bucked the NRA, and some of them found themselves facing early retirement.

This time may be different, however, in part because of the demographic trends that seem to be running against the gun rights group. As the country becomes more suburbanized, gun culture is diminishing in popularity and influence and the gun-control movement’s support is increasing.

The CAP report, for example, notes that “while the number of guns in circulation in the country has continued to rise, the percentage of households that own guns has been steadily declining for the past three decades — reaching a low of 34 percent in 2012, down from an average of 50 percent in the 1970s.”

Perhaps most worrisome for the NRA is the flow of funds from Bloomberg to groups that are trying to take a page from the NRA playbook. The NRA remains one of the most potent political forces in American politics today because its members feel passionately about gun rights, and their passion is reflected in real political participation. But the “intensity gap” is closing, the CAP said.

“There is substantial evidence that the intensity gap has closed,” wrote the report’s author, Arkadi Gerney, who worked previously with the mayors’ group. He cited a Fox News poll conducted the day after the Toomey-Manchin vote, which “showed that three times as many Americans said that they were likely to support a candidate who voted for expanded background checks (68 percent) as a candidate who opposed expanded background checks (23 percent).” They also cited the example of Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who saw her approval drop since the vote and who has been dogged by gun-control advocates during a recent Senate recess.

NRA board members are aware of these new pressures, of course. Do they have regrets about the way the organization handled the background check issue with a defiant, oppositional post-Sandy Hook stance?

“None whatsoever,” said Cleta Mitchell, a board member who has served as outside counsel to the NRA in the past. “The NRA stands as a stalwart, as being true to principles and not caving.” The NRA has called for more armed guards in schools and greater attention to mental health issues and the role of violent video games and other entertainment.

Mitchell said she has concerns about the affects of Bloomberg’s spending, among them the hypocrisy of complaining by the White House and its allies on the left. “The president has the nerve to say the Senate vote outcome was due to ‘special interests.’ Why are the votes against the Second Amendment ‘principled’ and the votes on our side are ‘political?’ ” she asked.

The dedication of NRA members to protecting Second Amendment rights is an important asset for the group. Both sides in the debate over expanding background checks say the power of the NRA and the issue it champions will be visibly tested during the 2014 election campaign.

“We are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation fight for everything we care about,” LaPierre told the convention this weekend. The convention’s motto was “Stand and fight.”

http://news.yahoo.com/ny-fire-dept-squirrel-kill-draws-complaints-225428605.html,,[],NY fire dept.'s squirrel kill draws complaints,"HOLLEY, N.Y. (AP) — A weekend squirrel-shooting contest in upstate New York is a sell-out, with all 1,000 tickets spoken for, organizers said, despite a push by animal rights groups and others to cancel the event.

The 7th annual ""Hazzard County Squirrel Slam"" will raise money for the volunteer Holley Fire Department, the event sponsor.

Prizes ranging from $50 to $200 will be given out Saturday for the largest squirrel shot and the heaviest group of five squirrels. Five rifles and shotguns are to be raffled off, according to a flier on the western New York fire department's website.

Critics have sought to stop the event through online petitions and protests, calling the event cruel and a bad example for children. The contest targeting red and gray squirrels is open to anyone over age 12 with a hunting license.

""Declaring someone a winner for killing the most animals influences children and the wider community to believe that wildlife is unimportant and killing for a monetary prize is meritorious,"" Brian Shapiro, New York state director of the Humane Society of the United States, wrote in a letter to Holley Fire Chief Pete Hendrickson.

Supporters say hunting is just part of life upstate, including in the largely rural village of 1,800 people on the Erie Canal.

""This is a community of hunters and they're going to hunt anyways. Why not hold a fundraiser that will reach our community,"" the event's chairwoman, Tina Reed, told the Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester. She said the event has grown each year: This year, 1,000 tickets were made available after it sold out of 200 tickets last year.

Participants must abide by New York's hunting regulations, hunting only where it is permitted and killing no more than six squirrels in a single day. Shooting will be followed by a weigh-in, then a dinner.

State Sen. Tony Avella, a Queens Democrat, called the contest insane during an Albany news conference with the group Friends of Animals earlier this week. The group planned to protest outside the Holley Fire House on Saturday afternoon.

Story continues

Avella's upstate colleague, Sen. George Maziarz, a Democrat who represents Holley, defended the fundraiser, saying hunting, fishing and shooting sports are part of the region's lifestyle.

""It's like a fishing derby but it's squirrels, not fish,"" Maziarz spokesman Adam Tabelski said Friday.

Neither the fire department nor members of its board of directors returned telephone and email messages from The Associated Press."

The proposed ban on “high capacity” magazines and the call for universal background checks are both reflective of similar measures being pushed by Democrats around the country.

As I have made clear in earlier posts, if universal background checks are implemented, they will not only stop private sales and close the “gun show loophole,” but will also take away a grandfather’s ability to simply give his favorite rifle to his grandson or for a mother to give a handgun to her daughter for self-defense.

In both scenarios, the guns will have to be registered, the government will have to be notified, specified fees will have to be paid, and background checks will have to be performed.

The measure to add a fee to existing background checks for gun purchases is nothing less than a new state-level tax on gun purchases. If this law passes, the fee could eventually be raised high enough to rule out buying a gun in the first place.

The proposal to allow crime victims to sue gun manufacturers is very onerous for gun companies. Although it would ostensibly only apply to makers of “assault weapons” if implemented, Colorado state Sen. Greg Brophy (R) said it “is the equivalent of holding Coors, the distributor, and the 7-Eleven from which the 12-pack of beer was stolen responsible for the drunk-driving accident.”

Even if the law allowing Coloradans to sue gun manufacturers passes, it will be impossible to implement currently because a federal law bans lawsuits against gun manufacturers over the misuse of their products.

The state’s Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, has yet to show his hand regarding where he stands on all these proposals. One thing that is known is that 56% of Coloradans say the NRA best represents their views on guns and gun rights."

The email alert to Obama’s list of more than 20 million supporters was intended to flood Congress with calls in support of the President’s gun control proposals. After a week, it is clear the effort fizzled.

The Obama campaign’s action alert last week tickled lefty journalists like BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith. The White House stenographer took to twitter to boast about the mobilization.

So Messina unleashed the kraken on the congressional switchboard today — Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 25, 2013

Yeah, not so much.

Breitbart News talked with a dozen Congressional offices, in both the Senate and the House. None reported any increase in calls as a result of Obama’s action alert. One Senate office said that, in the week since the alert went out, they had received around 20 calls in support of gun control and around 150 in support of gun rights.

Without a doubt, Obama has built an impressive turnout machine for elections. His campaign has vowed to use this to mobilize on issues important to the White House. This initial failure, however, suggests it will be difficult to translate voter’s personal support of the President to specific issues.

In the weeks since the tragic shooting in Newtown, Obama has used the full wattage of his bully pulpit to press for actions on guns. The media has provided a powerful assist by devoting enormous attention to guns and the issue of gun violence. Yet, Obama’s well-oiled machine can’t generate enthusiasm from his supporters on the issue.

This is further evidence of the fundamental challenge faced by supporters of gun control. While large numbers of voters say they support more restrictions on gun rights, they aren’t particularly motivated by the issue. It is merely one of many issues they support. Those who believe in gun rights, however, are singularly motivated on the issue. Not only is their vote determined by that issue, their level of political engagement is determined by it as well.

Not even Obama can fix that math.

The poem, titled, “If My Vagina Was a Gun,” went like this:

If my vagina was a gun, you would stand for its rights,

You would ride on buses and fight all the fights.

If my vagina was a gun, you would treat it with care,

You wouldn’t spill all its secrets because, well, why go there.

If my vagina was a gun, you’d say what it holds is private

From cold dead hands we could pry, you surely would riot.

If my vagina was a gun, its rights would all be protected, no matter the body count or the children affected.

If my vagina was a gun, I could bypass security, concealed carry laws would ensure I’d have impunity.

If my vagina was a gun, I wouldn’t have to beg you, I could hunt this great land and do all the things men do.

But my vagina is not a gun, it is a mightier thing,

With a voice that rings true making lawmakers’ ears ring.

Vaginas are not delicate, they are muscular and magic,

So stop messing with mine, with legislation that’s tragic.

My vagina’s here to demand from the source,

Listen to the voices of thousands or feel their full force.

Some questions for Ms. Heim:"
http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/is-the-n-r-a-un-american/,2013-05-13 00:00:00,"['Stanley Fish', 'Errol Morris', 'The Conversation', 'The End', 'The Great Divide', 'All Contributors', 'Series']",Is the N.R.A. Un-American?,"Stanley Fish on education, law and society.

The more militant members of the N.R.A. and most of its leaders may be un-American.

By “militant” I don’t mean those who wish to protect recreational shooting and hunting; nor do I mean those who, like Justice Antonin Scalia, believe that there is a constitutional right to defend one’s home and family with firearms. These are respectable positions (although I am deeply unpersuaded by the second). I mean those who read the Second Amendment as proclaiming the right of citizens to resist the tyranny of their own government, that is, of the government that issued and ratified the Constitution in the first place.

The reason this view may be un-American is that it sets itself against one of the cornerstones of democracy — the orderly transfer of power. A transfer of power is orderly when it is effected by procedural rules that are indifferent to the partisan, ideological affiliations of either the party exiting power or the party taking power. A transfer is disorderly when it is effected by rebellion, invasion, military coup or any other use of force.

Those who are engaged in a disorderly transfer believe that their actions are inspired by the highest of motives — the desire to set right what has gone terribly wrong. Somehow the forces of evil have gained the levers of power, and unless they are dislodged, the values necessary to the sustaining of everything we cherish will be overwhelmed. Violence is ugly, but if tyranny is to be defeated, it may be necessary. Given tyranny’s resilience and its tendency to fill any available political space, we must always be ready; the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.



This is a familiar story; indeed it is the story — or at least one story — of the American Revolution, and that is why it is the story Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the N.R.A., told to a Senate committee in January: “Senator, I think without any doubt, if you look at why our Founding Fathers put [the Second Amendment] there, they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny.”

In 1990, Fred Romero, an N.R.A. field representative, put the case as clearly as possible: “The Second Amendment is not there to protect the interests of hunters, sport shooters and casual plinkers.” Rather, the “Second Amendment is … literally a loaded gun in the hands of the people held to the heads of government.” In response to statements like this (and there are many of them), President Obama recently said in a speech in Denver: “The government’s us. These officials are elected by you.” Or, in other words, how can the people’s enemy be the representatives elected by the people?

The N.R.A. militants have an answer. The purpose of the American Revolution was to secure the freedom of individuals and that means a minimally intrusive government. Representatives elected to safeguard that freedom may become intoxicated by their power and act in ways that restrict rather than enhance individual choice. At that point it is the people’s right and duty to rise against them. Measures limiting gun ownership are a sure sign that government is moving in the direction of central control and tyranny.

But who gets to decide that tyranny is imminent, and by what measure is the imminence of tyranny determined? That question was debated on patch.com by posters responding to a story about Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson, who had called the tyranny argument of LaPierre and others “creepy” and “scary.” A commenter posting under the name Sanchez explained that “Tyranny consists of many things we have experienced the last 4 years, the firearm issue the latest in the line of them.” The point was echoed and amplified by another commenter, William Gill: “The second amendment is the only one that can assure the protection of your other rights which are being attacked almost daily by the current administration.” (In short, the Obama administration = tyranny.) A commenter posting as Steve responded, “It’s not ‘Tyranny’ just because you were outvoted. That’s Democracy.”

Steve is standing up for the orderly transfer of power and saying that we don’t call it tyranny when the other guy’s ideas have carried the political day. But he is met immediately by two responses from other commenters. First, “Steve, you’re assuming that the voting process was above board! Let’s face it, this election in November was by no means above board.” That is, the election results did not reflect majority will but some form of corrupt manipulation. (Those conspiring to overthrow government cite a conspiracy theory as their justification.)

The second response cuts deeper: “We live in a Republic Steve … majority rules is a problem indeed” (Buck Harmon). Harmon is invoking the familiar distinction between a democracy and a republic. In a democracy the majority determines what the law is and could, at least theoretically, take away the rights of individuals for the sake of the “public good.” In a republic, majority will is held in check by constitutional guarantees that forbid legislation encroaching on individual rights even if 51 percent or 95 percent of the population favors it. (For example, Congress shall pass no law abridging the freedom of expression.)

It follows from this distinction that a government elected by the majority can begin to think it can do anything it wants to, can begin to act as if we lived in a democracy rather than in a republic, and when that happens, or is in danger of happening, there is what the former Senate candidate Sharron Angle called a “Second Amendment remedy.” Asked, in 2010, “Do we have enemies of the country in the halls of Congress?”, Angle replied, “Certainly people who pass these kinds of policies — Obamacare, cap and trade, stimulus, bailout.” Off with their heads, either metaphorically, or in sufficiently dire circumstances, literally.

So for Angle and others, that’s the shape of tyranny — legislation that, in their judgment, abridges constitutionally protected rights. Sanchez explains: “We are all to decide what tyranny is. Just as we decide what law we obey or not.” This antinomian declaration — our inner light will tell us when and when not to obey — flies in the face of another commonplace of democracy: ours is a government of laws not men (a declaration found in the 1780 Constitution of Massachusetts). A government of men is one in which laws issue from the will and desires of those who happen to be in authority. In a government of laws the preferences of men (and women), even those holding high office, are checked by the impersonal requirements of an impersonal law.

Another version of the commonplace is, no man is above the law. The opposite view was famously declared by Richard Nixon when he said, “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” N.R.A. militants like Sanchez and Angle are, in effect, an army of little Richard Nixons, deciding what laws to obey, and deciding too when lawmakers have failed to obey the law as they see it. Unlike Nixon, they don’t have an F.B.I., a Treasury Department and a standing army; but they do have the Second Amendment and the right, or so they claim, to take arms against a government they have judged to be wayward.

In the same thread quoted earlier, C. P. takes the logic to its conclusion: “Secession is near. Can’t wait. Which by the way is Constitutional.” It’s constitutional, in this view, because a government in the act of eroding constitutional values is itself unconstitutional and has become a tyranny. Therefore to oppose it by whatever means available, including force, is not to undermine constitutionality, but to affirm it. It is in this spirit that John Wilkes Booth cried “Sic semper tyrannis” (“thus always to tyrants”) just after he shot Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln famously said, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” Booth’s modern successors are saying that a house in the hands of tyrants does not deserve to stand and they are ready to bring it down with their constitutionally protected guns.

As Police Chief Johnson said, this is creepy and scary, but is it — to return to my original musings — un-American? Yes and no. On the one hand, nothing can be more American than throwing off the shackles of a government that has overstepped its bounds and disregarded the rights of its citizens. That’s how it all began. (“No taxation without representation.”) But on the other hand, the American tradition of accepting the results of elections — even when they bring with them policies you believe to be misguided at best and disastrous at worst — is in danger of being undermined when groups of armed people decide that the present leadership is infected by unpatriotic, socialist ideas and must be resisted at all costs.

A government founded in a revolutionary moment is always vulnerable to a determination by a zealous minority that its revolutionary ideals have been compromised by itself. When that happens, each side will engage in its favored rhetoric, one proclaiming, watch out, they’re coming for our guns, the other warning that militant right-wing nuts are preparing themselves for armed insurrection. One side will cry “tyranny”; the other will reply, “You guys are crazy.” And both will claim the title of true American. That’s where we are."

That moment marked a turning point in American history. It happened during the Eisenhower administration, when Susan would have been too young to appreciate its import.

But I think her choice of this question signals her belief that we are, once again, at a turning point when America will recoil in disgust having seen the true face of the threat to our liberty.

The McCarthy-Army hearings were notable for the fact they were the first hearings aired on TV. They had been going on for some time and could be followed on radio. But McCarthy's venality was not as obvious without the video. To give you an idea of how much of an impact these hearings had on popular culture, TV sales skyrocketed as people bought them to watch the hearings -- which dominated TV coverage for months.

The fact the NRA would target children shows how far out of bounds they are. Like McCarthy before them, they betray their wanton disregard for common decency. Hopefully, their fate will be that of McCarthy -- dying alone, forgotten, disgraced, and humiliated.

During the 2008 campaign, like many others, I harbored a dread for Obama's safety. It took me a long time to write about that, the pain of 40 year-old wounds ran deep. As I consider the depravity of the NRA's attack on the Obama children, I am shocked to realize how twisted these bastards are. As dark as the '60s were, no one ever seriously thought the Kennedy children were targets.

Searching my memory, I have a hard time finding a moment in history that could even come close to the nightmare these animals call forth with their dog-whistle. Unfortunately, I can think of such a time. The 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing in 1963. Remembering that event, it no longer shocks me that the NRA would conjure up that image. I would sooner be shocked that a rabid dog bit a child. At this point, there is only one thing left to do. We have to put them out of their misery, for our own protection:

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/20/missouri-house-bill-would-make-proposing-gun-control-illegal/,2013-02-20 00:00:00,[],Missouri House bill would make proposing gun control illegal,"A Missouri lawmaker is proposing to send colleagues to prison for introducing gun control legislation -- a plan that even its sponsor acknowledges has no chance of passage but nonetheless highlights the increasingly strident tone of gun measures in Missouri's generally pro-gun Legislature.

Rep. Mike Leara said Tuesday that he considers his bill a statement of principle. It would make lawmakers guilty of a felony punishable by up to four years in prison if they introduce legislation restricting gun rights.

""I have no illusions about the bill making it through the legislative process, but I want it to be clear that the Missouri House will stand in defense of the people's constitutional right to keep and bear arms,"" Leara, a Republican from suburban St. Louis, said in a written statement. He declined further comment.

Since last year's deadly mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut, state and federal lawmakers have grappled with gun legislation. President Barack Obama has proposed an assault weapons ban, background checks and restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines. But Missouri's Republican-led Legislature has taken a different approach -- more guns, not less.

State Rep. Stacey Newman, D-St. Louis, called Leara's measure ""unconstitutional"" and said she would go directly to prison if the bill passes. Newman is the sponsor of a measure that would require guns to be sold by a licensed dealer and force that dealer to conduct a background check.

Even one of Leara's fellow Republicans said he probably wouldn't support the bill.

""Everybody should have a right to introduce bills, even bad ones,"" said state Rep. Kevin Engler, of Farmington, a former state senator who has sponsored National Rifle Association-supported legislation in previous years.

Leara's measure comes less than a week after St. Louis-area House Democrats introduced legislation containing an assault weapons ban. That bill would require owners of semi-automatic weapons to surrender, destroy or send their guns to another state within 90 days of the measure's passage. Sponsoring state Rep. Rory Ellinger said he knows Missouri is a very conservative state, but he still wants a dialogue on gun safety.

Given the two-thirds Republican majority in the Legislature, the assault weapons ban probably won't even get a committee hearing. But that hasn't stopped Republicans from attacking the bill with fervor. Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Springfield, posted a YouTube video of a physical copy of the bill being shot with a handgun.

One lawmaker has questioned the wisdom of proposing legislation to the ideological extreme of both political parties.

""(Leara's bill) has as much chance of passing as (the assault weapons ban). Highlights the problem with proposing bills to get attention,"" tweeted Sen. Ryan Silvey, R-Kansas City.

While Leara's and Ellinger's bill are likely dead on arrival, a state House committee moved forward Tuesday on two proposals that would curb federal gun regulation. One proposal is sponsored by Rep. Casey Guernsey, R-Bethany, who said he has decided ""to take swift and strong actions to counteract the federal government."" Guernsey wants to criminalize the enforcement of any federal gun control laws enacted after Jan. 1, 2013.

The second measure would prevent federal regulation of guns that are manufactured in Missouri and remain inside the state's borders. The committee did not vote on either bill.

Even measures to address gun violence in schools have drawn out the ideological divides in the Legislature.

On Tuesday, Missouri's Senate gave first-round approval to a proposal that would give school districts the option to teach the National Rifle Association's gun-safety program to elementary school students and to allow teachers and other school personnel go through training on how to respond to armed intruders. The bill sponsored by Sen. Don Brown, R-Rolla, originally mandated schools implement both programs, but opposition from Democratic senators caused him to make the programs optional.

Brown's original bill was opposed by Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-St. Louis, who said it would do little to address the problem of gun violence by urban gang members whose parents don't supervise them. She said trying to train teachers to respond to ""gang bangers"" is a ""pretty dangerous thing,"" adding that ""a lot of our teachers are kind of petite.""

A Senate committee on Wednesday also considered a state constitutional amendment to broaden the right-to bear-arms by specifying that it is ""inalienable."" The measure sponsored by Sen. Kurt Schaefer, R-Columbia, would also require the state to oppose any ""infringement"" on that right."

NRA ad says Obama girls have armed protection in their school

Group calls Obama an %27elitist hypocrite%27 for opposing armed guards in all schools

White House issued angry response to mention of president%27s daughters

Before the policy fight could begin over the Obama administration's new proposals on gun regulation, the NRA had drawn intense criticism Wednesday for an ad critical of Obama that mentions his two children.

The ad calls Obama an ""elitist hypocrite"" because his daughters have Secret Service protection at their school, but the president has not embraced the NRA's proposal for armed security at all schools.

""Most Americans agree that a president's children should not be used as pawns in a political fight,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. ""But to go so far as to make the safety of the president's children the subject of an attack ad is repugnant and cowardly.""

The White House has discouraged coverage of Obama's daughters, Malia and Sasha, though they are regularly photographed accompanying their parents.

Donna Brazile, a former Democratic strategist, called the ad ""tasteless, mean-spirited and totally out of bounds.''

""It's wrong to target in advertising the family of the president of the United States, regardless of the issue,'' says John Weaver, a Republican consultant who worked for presidential candidates John McCain and Jon Huntsman. He called the ad ""tone-deaf'' and said the NRA is not in tune with public opinion after the Sandy Hook shootings. ""If they're trying to appeal to the broad cross section of America, or they're trying to appeal to swing votes in the Congress, this was not their best first step they could have taken. It comes across as unhinged.''

Political talk show host and former congressman Joe Scarborough, a Republican, said the ad, coupled with a new NRA shooting game mobile app, indicates the NRA is ""now a fringe organization. … What the NRA once was, it no longer is. This extremism is so frightening and so over the line.''

Like many issue ads, the video is barely appearing on television but was widely reported by news media after being posted online late Tuesday. It appears on the Sportsman Channel during an NRA-produced talk show.

In the ad, which doesn't show pictures of the Obama girls, a narrator says, ""Are the president's kids more important than yours? Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools, when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school? Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he's just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security. Protection for their kids and gun-free zones for ours.''

In 1999, eight months after the Columbine shootings, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told members at the group's annual convention that armed guards or police in schools should be a ""rare exception.'' After the Sandy Hook shootings, LaPierre announced an NRA proposal to put an armed guard in every school.

NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the ad is not about the Obama girls. ""If anyone thinks we're talking specifically about someone's children, they're missing the point completely,'' he said Wednesday. ""This isn't an issue about comparing the president's kids. This is an issue about school safety and protecting all our children, regardless of tax bracket and how important their parents are. The intent of our ad is to make sure that we point out that there is a double standard that exists.''

The ad includes images of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Vice President Joe Biden – all advocates of an assault weapons ban and other gun-control legislation – and NBC correspondent David Gregory. Obama said in an interview with Gregory that aired Dec. 30 that said he is ""skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools.""

A second video on the NRA.org website accuses Gregory of a double standard, citing a report from a conservative website that Gregory's children attend the same school as the Obama girls.

""NBC News firmly objects to the use of our journalists in any political ad,'' spokeswoman Erika Masonhall said in a statement.

Obama announced a plan for combating gun violence Wednesday, appearing with four children who had written to him asking him to stop gun violence. Kathleen McKinley, a conservative blogger, said neither side should be using children to stir emotions. ""You can't be outraged about using Obama's kids, if you're not outraged about Obama using other people's children. Both sides: Stop it,'' she said."

The measure, signed by President George W. Bush, promised to strengthen the 14-year-old National Instant Criminal Background Check System by establishing incentives and penalties to prod states to submit records of people legally barred under federal law from buying guns — including those who had been committed to mental institutions.

Advertisement

But today, that promise remains unfulfilled. More than half the states haven’t provided mental health records to the federal database that gun dealers use to check on buyers. And the gap in dealing with the mentally ill is just one of myriad problems that have hampered background checks.

In the shock that followed the Sandy Hook Elementary School killings last month in Newtown, Conn., improving that system has emerged as a major focus of the Obama administration’s plans for combating gun violence. Vice President Joe Biden, who could make recommendations to the president as soon as Tuesday, said he believed there was support for expansion to cover private gun sales, which make up much as 40% of all purchases but do not require background checks.

The history of the last change, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act, shows how difficult it will be to fix this broken system. Many states haven’t even begun to figure out which of their mentally ill residents should be included, or how to gather paper records from courthouses and mental hospitals. There is federal funding for the work, but not nearly enough.

Last year, after the 2010 Tucson shootings by a mentally ill Jared Lee Loughner, President Obama acknowledged in an opinion column that the law “hasn’t been properly implemented.”

The background check system, which became effective in 1998, was part of a 1993 law that prohibited people from possessing guns if they were convicted of a felony, addicted to drugs, committed domestic violence or were involuntarily sent to a mental institution.

Gun rights organizations, including the National Rifle Assn., have fought expansion of those checks. Though the NRA says it supports making sure the names of “violent schizophrenics” are in the database, the group also made it tougher for states to comply — by successfully lobbying for a provision in the 2007 law that requires an appeals process so the mentally ill can seek to have their gun rights restored. States must set that up before they can receive federal grants to help collect records.

As many as 2 million mental health records are not in the system, the National Center for State Courts has found. Gun control advocates say plugging holes like that could be one of the most effective ways to stem gun violence.

“Having 2 million prohibited purchasers out there whose names are not in the background check database is a ticking time bomb,” said Mark Glaze, executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

Tighter standards in 2007 might have prevented the Virginia Tech shooter, Seung-hui Cho, from buying guns. He passed two background checks even though a judge had found him to be a danger to himself and ordered him to get mental health treatment. The state had interpreted the law to cover only in-patient treatment, so his name wasn’t submitted. Virginia has since changed those rules.

Loughner too was able to pass background checks despite mounting evidence of mental problems; he had not been involuntarily committed to an institution or convicted of crimes, the main triggers under the law.

The 2007 improvement act was supposed to speed development of the system by providing grants to states to help pay for hunting down records and setting up electronic databases. But Congress has handed out just a fraction of the grants allowed. Last year, $125 million was authorized under the law, but just $5 million was appropriated.

“The cost of making those changes far outweighs the grant money coming in,” said Carol Cha, acting director for homeland security and justice issues at the Government Accountability Office. “So states are having to make that difficult choice.”

There has been progress, though. The number of gun sales denied for mental health reasons increased from 365 in 2004 to 2,124 in 2011, according to FBI data, although that still accounts for less than 2% of all denials. And the database now has 1.2 million mental health records, up from about 200,000 in 2004.

But most of those records came from just 12 states, while nearly half the states have sent in just a handful of names, according to a July GAO report. “Most states have made little or no progress in providing these records,” the report said.

Federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Defense, also have been slow to submit relevant records.

California in recent years has become one of the most cooperative states, submitting more than a quarter of a million mental health records to the federal database by October 2011, more than any other state, according to FBI statistics cited by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

For more than two decades, the state has kept centralized records on people who are ineligible under state law to possess firearms for mental health reasons. But because of privacy concerns, as well as differences in state and federal reporting standards, it took years for the state to begin sharing them.

California also goes beyond federal law in trying to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. The state bans firearms possession for five years after someone is placed on a 72-hour psychiatric commitment.

One of the main obstacles in developing the federal mental health database for the background check system is confusion over who should be included. The law says the database should include people who have been judged “mentally defective.”

“Not only is that term highly offensive, it’s completely outdated,” said Ron Honberg, policy director at the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “I think there’s a lack of clarity, so states are all over the map on how to interpret it.”

In Alabama, for example, state officials decided to submit the names of people who had been involuntarily committed to institutions only when they’d also been found guilty of an “inappropriate use of firearms” or shown to be a threat to do so. That turned out to be just 243 people, according to a report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

Some states have delayed over worries about privacy concerns. Others have antiquated database systems or say they don’t have the money to provide the records.

In Idaho, state officials have just begun to submit mental health records to the database, 17,000 so far of an estimated 60,000. But it took the state four years to prepare, said Dawn Peck, manager of the Idaho State Police criminal identification bureau.

The first challenge was passing the state law and setting up the appeals process, she said. An early version said judges could restore gun rights if there was “clear and convincing” evidence that the person wasn’t a threat. Peck said the NRA thought that was too tough; the Legislature set the bar lower, at a “preponderance” of evidence.

The NRA did not return calls seeking comment.

Once the law was passed, Peck said, the state began the laborious process of gathering two decades of files from county courthouses. “That’s probably the more cumbersome issue,” she said.

One huge hang-up: turning over the records is voluntary. The U.S. Department of Justice can penalize states that don’t participate by cutting other federal crime grants, but it has not done that.

“What the federal government does need to do,” Glaze said, “is enlarge both the carrots and the sticks necessary to get states to do the right thing.”

Advertisement

A proposed federal law, the Fix Gun Checks Act, aims to plug the holes in the system by making the checks apply to all gun sales and authorizing deep cuts in federal aid for states that don’t go along.

Pennsylvania is one of the states that hasn’t turned over any mental health records — even though some of the records are already in the state’s background check system. Republican state Rep. Todd Stephens, a former prosecutor, says the State Police have cited technical difficulties. He’s planning to submit a bill to speed the process.

“It ought to be a national initiative,” he said. “Barring a tragedy, we would have no way of knowing whether someone with a mental health history from Pennsylvania was buying a gun somewhere else.”

Obama appointed Biden–who throughout his career has opposed gun rights–to lead his gun-control task force after the horribly tragic Newtown shooting. Biden and Holder met Thursday with Jim Baker, director of the Federal Affairs Division of the NRA’s political arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. The meeting took place in the Old Executive Office Building, part of the White House complex adjacent to the West Wing.

It’s revealing that Obama and Biden brought Holder into the meeting. In 2008, when the Supreme Court decided the historic Second Amendment case D.C. v. Heller, Holder joined a brief arguing that the Court should uphold D.C.’s complete ban on gun ownership because the Second Amendment does not apply to private citizens. Holder’s position is that no American citizen has the right to own a gun, and the federal government can ban guns nationwide.

This casts doubt on Obama’s claim of being willing to find “common-sense solutions” and “middle ground” regarding firearms. Polls show 74% of Americans support their constitutional right to keep and bear arms, yet Obama taps two people from the other 26% to remake national policy on this issue.

According to sources familiar with the meeting, it seems NRA was asked to meet with Biden and Holder so that the White House could tell the country that the administration sought input from all sides of the gun-control debate before launching new gun-control measures. “It’s clear they brought NRA in to lecture us, not to have a serious discussion in good faith,” remarked one member of the NRA’s board of directors.

The NRA’s leaders are developing a multi-tiered strategy to combat threats on four fronts. First, anti-gun legislators in both the House and Senate are introducing gun-control bills. These are targeting so-called “assault weapons,” banning high-capacity magazines, shutting down gun shows, and seeking to create a national database of gun owners, complete with fingerprints.

Second is executive action without legislation, through executive orders and new agency regulations. NRA leaders are getting word of various possible routes where Obama will seek to act without any new laws, claiming that existing laws give him all the authority he wants. Given that Obama claims the power to make “recess appointments” when the U.S. Senate is not in recess (which the courts are likely to strike down) and the power to order churches who their leaders will be (a claim the Supreme Court unanimously rejected), many are concerned that he will likewise make a move against gun owners.

Third is foreign policy. Obama said he wants the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, which is officially intended to stop the illicit trade of small arms but would do so by giving the world body–most of whose members do not allow their citizens to own guns–authority to regulate gun ownership over the entire planet and obligate the United States to follow its dictates.

And fourth is at the state level. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo–an Obama ally planning a 2016 presidential bid–went on an anti-gun rant during his State of the State Address, saying that confiscating guns is possible. Meanwhile, Obama’s home state of Illinois is planning new anti-gun measures, as is California’s plan to restrict bullets, rendering guns useless.

Americans are taking sides. NRA membership has skyrocketed by over 100,000 new members in less than a month, as the White House organizes all its allies to push gun control. The Second Amendment survived by only a single vote in the 2008 Heller case, then again survived in another 5-4 vote in the 2010 case McDonald v. Chicago. If Obama gets more Supreme Court picks, they could overrule these cases to effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Supreme Law of the Land.

So the Second Amendment is becoming a major political fight in Obama’s second term, the latest battle over government power versus individual liberty in what some are calling a power grab by an imperial president.

But the NRA is growing frustrated with the courts, and it has taken its complaint to the Supreme Court, relying upon the advocacy skills of one of the nation’s leading lawyers, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul D. Clement.

gunswide

In unusually blunt language, Clement in two recent documents filed at the court is asking the Justices to live up to the full promise that the NRA saw when gun owners won a constitutional breakthrough on the Second Amendment at the court five years ago.

Clement’s basic argument now is that the court made a sweeping change in the constitutional meaning of the Second Amendment – “a watershed moment,” he calls it — and yet many lower courts have been acting as if the Supreme Court did nothing of the kind. He has even included retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in the complaint, for a ruling she wrote while sitting temporarily on a lower federal court (although he did not mention her by name).

The NRA for years has been in the forefront of a widespread campaign to broaden the rights protected by the Second Amendment’s guarantee of a “right to keep and bear arms” – a part of the Constitution since 1791. For years, the NRA helped pay for scholars’ research in support of the argument that the Amendment protects a very broad individual right to have a gun. That ran up against a widespread perception that the right existed only as a community right to arm, as with the colonial militia or the modern National Guard.

The personal right argument finally prevailed in the Supreme Court’s 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The court said that the right was not “absolute” and that it was subject to “reasonable restrictions.” Moreover, that initial ruling dealt only with a right to have a gun for self-defense in the home. Still, gun owners and the NRA quickly turned it into a legal rallying point to challenge a whole host of gun controls; they did not regard the new right as limited at all.

Story continues

Their cause advanced much further, in 2011, when the NRA was part of a winning coalition in the Supreme Court case of McDonald v. Chicago, extending the personal right protection to put some limits on state and local gun control laws, too. The Heller decision had struck down only a Washington, D.C., law banning handguns. Moreover, the McDonald decision made clear that the new right was a “fundamental” one, establishing it as a right of the highest constitutional order.

Clement has been an important ally of those pressing for an expansive Second Amendment right. He argued in the Heller case for the George W. Bush Administration, as Solicitor General, supporting a declaration of a personal gun right (a position that that administration had adopted in 2001). After leaving government, Clement was the NRA’s own lawyer as he argued for it in the McDonald case. And he is continuing now as the NRA’s advocate before the Supreme Court.

He unleashed his new challenge to the lower courts in late July, filing a new Supreme Court appeal for the NRA to protest a federal appeals court ruling upholding a federal law that bans licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to minors. “This case,” Clement wrote, “is part of a pervasive pattern of stubborn resistance to this court’s holding that the Second Amendment secures a right that is not just individual, but fundamental….The decision below is illustrative of the efforts of lower courts to limit Heller and McDonald to their facts while ignoring the clear import of their reasoning.”

The lower court (the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Cincinnati), the NRA filing said, had indicated “that law-abiding citizens do not possess Second Amendment rights at all unless the legislature deems them sufficiently ‘responsible’ to keep and bear arms.” Indeed, the document added, the Sixth Circuit had expressed doubts that “young adults even possess Second Amendment rights.”

What has been going on – not only in the courts but in other parts of government – is a campaign of “massive resistance to this court’s decisions,” Clement said. Officials and judges, he added, “have simply been unable to break habits formed during pre-Heller days.” There has been a concentrated effort, he asserted, at “limiting the scope of the Second Amendment to the precise circumstances at issue” in the two Supreme Court cases.

Earlier this month, Clement filed a new paper with the Supreme Court, a friend-of-the-court brief to support a Maryland man’s challenge to his state’s law that generally bans the carrying of handguns outside the home for self-defense purposes, unless the individual has a permit that can only be obtained with proof of a “good and substantial reasons” for fearing for one’s safety.

In Clement’s list of grievances about what the lower courts have been failing to do on Second Amendment rights, he said that another federal appeals court – the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York City – “would not even make a definitive ruling on whether the Second Amendment applies to a summer home.” It chose, instead, to ask a New York state court for an interpretation of a state gun control law rather than “giving immediate relief” to the gun owner in the case, Clement said. That ruling, in the case of Osterweil v. Bartlett, was written by retired Justice O’Connor, during a temporary judging assignment on that appeals court.

The individual involved in that case, Alfred Osterweil, lives in Louisiana, but has a summer home in Summit, N.Y., but was denied a permit to have a gun there. Clement is Osterweil’s lawyer in that case.

The NRA’s complaint, as spelled out by Clement in his new court filings, does not criticize the Supreme Court itself. But the Justices have refused, at least a half-dozen times in recent years, to grant review of new cases seeking to expand the Second Amendment right beyond the home. It’s that pattern the NRA and Clement intend to change.

http://news.yahoo.com/california-bill-ban-conversion-kits-automatic-weapons-003208770.html,,[],California bill would ban conversion kits for automatic weapons,"By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - California lawmakers on Wednesday voted to ban kits used to convert standard firearms into semi-automatics capable of firing more than 10 rounds of ammunition without reloading, although a stricter gun control measure was stalled. The conversion kit ban, one of a number of gun control bills making their way through the legislature in the waning days of the session, also prohibits the purchase of large capacity magazines in the state. ""Now, legally you can buy and you can sell conversion kits that allow you to convert conventional magazines so they can shoot many more than 10 rounds without reloading,"" said Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner of Berkeley, who sponsored the bill. Passage has not been easy for the more than a dozen gun control bills introduced by Democratic lawmakers in the wake of several mass-shootings, including the one at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut last year. Even so, the state has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. An assault weapons ban has been in place since 1989, passed after a mass shooting at an elementary school in Stockton. California Democrats control large majorities in both houses as well as the governorship. But many lawmakers owe their jobs to moderate and conservative voters in rural counties, and are hesitant to take on hot-button issues like firearm regulation. The bill banning conversion kits, for example, passed only after a provision requiring a database to track sales of ammunition in the state was removed. It passed on a vote of 43 to 30, with five Democrats joining the Assembly's 25 Republicans in opposition. The Senate had passed it earlier and it will now go to Governor Jerry Brown, who has not said that he will sign it. Another measure, to ban repeat drug and alcohol offenders, as well as people who commit some gang-related crimes, from gun ownership for ten years passed on a vote of 42 to 27. On Tuesday, lawmakers voted to ban new sales of semi-automatic rifles with removable magazines and to require people who already own such weapons to register them. A measure that would ban possession of large capacity ammunition magazines in the state was held up while supporters lobbied for votes. Republicans continued their opposition to the gun control measures on Wednesday, voting against them as a bloc and warning that the measures are threats to the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, who represents the Southern California community of Twin Peaks, said the bill banning conversion kits would wrongly target people who had innocently purchased equipment that might or might not be used to modify a weapon. ""Certainly we don't want to throw people in jail because they bought a couple of little springs and a few boxes of metal,"" he said.

President Barack Obama on Wednesday proposed background checks on all gun sales and bans on military style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of a package of steps to reduce gun violence in the wake of the Newtown school massacre last month.

Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will announce the proposals, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday.

They will be joined by a group of children who wrote letters to the president in the aftermath of the December 14 shooting rampage by a lone gunman who killed 20 students and six adults at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school, Carney said.

Obama will propose legislative steps he previously has backed, such as a ban on assault weapons, restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines and strengthening federal background checks of people attempting to buy guns, according to Carney.

The president also will push for other steps that could include executive actions on his part that don’t require congressional approval, Carney noted.

More specifically, the source – an official familiar with the process – said the president’s proposal will press for a ban on high capacity magazines with more than 10 rounds, universal background checks and a request that funds be made available to help treat mental illness and provide schools with support to enhance their safety.

Vice President Joe Biden led a panel assembled by Obama to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings. Biden’s recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced Wednesday.

Opponents promise a political fight, with an NRA spokesman saying Tuesday that the group has experienced what he called an “unprecedented” spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month.

An NRA spokesman said Tuesday the group has experienced what he called an “unprecedented” spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month.

Approximately 250,000 people have joined the organization’s existing 4.25 million members, according to NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.

“This is in direct response to the threats and accusations coming from” Obama and other political leaders, Arulanandam said, adding that “if anyone is wondering if the American people cared about the Second Amendment … those numbers give a very clear answer.”

In addition to new members, the NRA is also receiving an influx of financial contributions, he said.

“This is going to be a very expensive and hard-fought fight,” Arulanandam noted.

The federal government estimates that more than 300 million non-military guns are owned or available for purchase in the United States.

At the White House, Carney acknowledged the challenge, saying: “If these things were easy, they would have been achieved already.”

“It’s something we have to do together,” he said. “It’s something that cannot be done by a president alone. It can’t be done by a single community alone or a mayor or a governor or by Congress alone. We all have to work together.”

Carney also reiterated Obama’s belief in the Second Amendment right of citizens to be armed.

“He has made clear that he believes we ought to take common sense, and enact common sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights but prevent people who should not have weapons from obtaining them,” he said.

His executive actions signed Wednesday called for tougher enforcement of existing laws and required federal agencies to provide data for background checks.

The recommendations by Biden’s panel included as many as 19 executive actions, such as tougher enforcement of existing laws, legislators briefed by the vice president said Tuesday.

Obama could demand that agencies provide data for background checks that are supposed to accompany gun sales, ensuring that information included in the checks is as “comprehensive and complete as possible,” Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California told CNN.

The president also could immediately appoint a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which has been without a permanent chief for six years, Thompson said.

A Democratic member of Congress who was briefed on the recommendations said some of the 19 executive actions discussed included improving the way the government administers current law.

The legislator, speaking on condition of not being identified, cited loopholes in the federal database for background checks on gun sales as well as issues involving mental health checks as possibilities for executive action.

Across the country, more than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures. That figure, however, is a small fraction of overall gun sales.

Obama also called for more money to strengthen gun safety at schools, including hiring more counselors such as retired law enforcement officers to help educate students on gun issues. He also called for more funding for communities to hire more police officers, but stopped short of seeking the NRA’s proposal for armed guards at every school.

Obama has not ruled out issuing executive orders on some gun control measures to enforce laws already on the books, such as bolstering the way gun sales are tracked.

The president reiterated his desire on Monday for more robust background checks for gun buyers, keeping high capacity magazines away from criminals, and a ban on assault weapons.

“Will all of them get through this Congress? I don’t know,” Obama said. “But what’s uppermost in my mind is making sure that I’m honest with the American people and members of Congress about what I think will work, what I think is something that will make a difference.”

Working with Congress will be paramount in curbing gun violence, Thompson said, singling out a ban on high capacity magazines as an example of a measure that could garner Republican support. A full-scale assault weapon ban would be tougher to pass the GOP-controlled House, he argued.

Obama also said on Monday that the gun lobby was “ginning up” fears the federal government will use the Connecticut tragedy to seize Americans’ guns. At least part of the frenzy is little more than marketing, he implied.

“It’s certainly good for business,” the president said, responding to a question about a spike in weapons sales and applications for background checks since the December killings.

Biden has said he’s found widespread support for universal background checks and restrictions on the sale of high capacity magazines, which gun control advocates believe contribute to more bloodshed at mass shootings.

The influential NRA, among other gun rights groups, has vowed to fight any new gun restrictions – like an assault weapon ban.

Gun control advocates, gun violence victims, the NRA, video game makers and others have met with the Biden-led task force.

In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday signed into law a series of new gun regulations – the nation’s first since the Newtown shootings.

Both New York’s GOP-controlled Senate and Democrat-controlled Assembly approved the measure by overwhelming margins.

It includes a statewide gun registry and adds a uniform licensing standard across the state, altering the current system, in which each county or municipality sets a standard.

Residents are also restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets, rather than 10.

“The changes in New York are largely cosmetic,” said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, who described state’s existing regulations as “the toughest gun laws in the United States.”

Lawmakers in at least 10 other states are reviewing some form of new gun regulations in the new year.

Meanwhile, new national polls indicated a majority of Americans support some or most gun control measures.

By a 51%-45% margin, Americans questioned in a new Pew Research Center poll said it was more important to control gun ownership than to protect gun rights.

And by a 52%-35% margin, a new ABC News/Washington Post survey indicates the public says it is more likely to support some forms of gun control after last month’s massacre. However, the polls showed continuing divisions on political and gender lines.

NEWARK, N.J., Aug 8 (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a likely Republican contender for the White House in 2016, on Thursday signed into law 10 bills tightening restrictions on guns in the state.

The measures including banning the purchase of handguns by people on a federal watch list of potential terrorism suspects, stepping up penalties on some firearms violations and exempting gun records from the state's open public records law.

The moves made New Jersey the latest northeastern state to tighten gun laws in the wake of a December school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 26 young students and educators dead and sparked a renewed debate on gun control.

""These common-sense measures will both strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws and upgrade penalties for those who commit gun crimes and violate gun trafficking laws,"" said Christie, who is expected to easily win reelection this year.

In a nod to public pressure from gun-rights activists, he held off on signing other proposed measures that would have banned .50-caliber rifles, required dealers to log ammunition sales and allowed for instant background checks.

Gun rights, which are protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, are a contentions issue on the national stage. A gun-rights group in New Hampshire - the site of a key presidential nominating primary where Christie would want to do well should he run for president - warned that it would organize voters against him if he were to crack down on gun owners in New Jersey.

""There are still three major anti-gun bills on Governor Christie's desk, and we are watching,"" said Sam Cohen, executive vice president of Pro Gun New Hampshire.

Gun control supporters in New Jersey said the signings represented a step forward.

""Seeing these bills signed into law is a victory for New Jersey's communities,"" said Louis Greenwald, majority leader of the state assembly. ""Yet they do not go far enough in doing all we can to prevent gun-related tragedies from afflicting our families.""

Neighboring New York state and nearby Connecticut have recently tightened their already restrictive laws on gun ownership in the wake of the Newtown shooting.

Not all legislation aimed at guns this year will tighten restrictions. Illinois in July adopted a law allowing its residents to carry concealed guns, making it the last state in the nation to permit some form of possession of guns in public. (Editing by Scott Malone and Phil Berlowitz)"

http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-photo-shows-obama-skeet-shooting-233507241--politics.html,,[],White House photo shows Obama skeet shooting,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two days before President Barack Obama's first trip outside Washington to promote his gun-control proposals, the White House tried Saturday to settle a brewing mystery by releasing a photo to back his claim to be a skeet shooter.

Obama had set inquiring minds spinning when, in an interview with The New Republic magazine, he answered ""yes"" when asked if he had ever fired a gun. The admission came as a surprise to many.

""Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time,"" Obama said in the interview released last weekend, referring to the official presidential retreat in rural Maryland, which he last visited in October while campaigning for re-election. Asked whether the entire family participates, the president said: ""Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.""

Obama never mentioned skeet shooting prior to that interview.

The White House photo released Saturday is dated Aug. 4, 2012. The caption says Obama is shooting clay targets on the range at Camp David. Obama is seen holding a gun against his left shoulder, his left index finger on the trigger and smoke coming from the barrel. He is wearing jeans, a dark blue, short-sleeved polo shirt, sunglasses and earmuffs.

The National Rifle Association, which has rejected Obama's proposals, scoffed at the photo.

""One picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun-control scheme imaginable,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, the organization's spokesman.

The NRA opposes Obama's call for Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and says requiring background checks for all gun purchases would be ineffective because the administration isn't doing enough to enforce existing gun laws.

Asked at Monday's press briefing how frequently Obama shoots skeet and whether photos existed, White House press secretary Jay Carney said he didn't know how often. Pictures may exist, he said, but he hadn't seen any.

Story continues

""Why haven't we heard about it before?"" Carney was asked.

""Because when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs,"" Carney said.

Obama is accompanied almost everywhere by at least one White House photographer.

Carney declined to comment on the decision to release the photo, which he had announced on Twitter. The release appeared to be part of a strategy to portray Obama as sympathetic to gun owners and opponents of his gun-control measures who argue the proposals would infringe on an individual's Second Amendment right to bear arms.

A top official with the National Skeet Shooting Association said the photo suggests Obama is a novice shooter.

""This isn't something he's done very often because of how he's standing, how he has the gun mounted,"" said Michael Hampton, executive director of the San Antonio-based association.

Hampton said Obama's remark about ""skeet shooting all the time"" and the White House photo would have met less skepticism had the president spoken about his hobby months before this new debate over guns in the U.S.

""Once it becomes controversial and there's problems, to talk about it then, that's where it becomes very debatable and is not being received as well as if he would have done this six months ago,"" Hampton said.

In interview, appearing in The New Republic's Feb. 11 issue, Obama said gun-control advocates should be better listeners in the debate over firearms, which was sparked by the December killing of elementary school pupils in Connecticut. He also declared his deep respect for the long tradition of hunting in this country.

""I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake,"" Obama said. ""Part of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas. And if you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10, and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your family's traditions, you can see why you'd be pretty protective of that.""

""So it's trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months. And that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes,"" Obama said.

His gun control measures also have met resistance on Capitol Hill.

In Minneapolis on Monday, Obama plans to make remarks and discuss his proposals with local and law enforcement officials during a stop at the police department's special operations center. He's also expected to hear from community members about their experiences with gun violence.

Obama announced his proposals in mid-January, about a month after the Dec. 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

The Center for American Progress is recommending 13 new gun policies to the White House — some of them executive actions that would not require the approval of Congress — in what amounts to the progressive community’s wish list.

CAP’s proposals — which include requiring universal background checks, banning military-grade assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and modernizing data systems to track gun sales and enforce existing laws — are all but certain to face stiff opposition from the National Rifle Association and its many allies in Congress.

Obama — as well as Vice President Biden, who is leading the administration’s gun violence task force — has voiced support for many of these measures. Yet it is unclear which policies he ultimately will propose to Congress. Biden is planning to present his group’s recommendations to Obama on Tuesday.

CAP’s recommendations, presented Friday to White House officials and detailed in an 11-page report obtained by The Washington Post, establish a benchmark for what many in Obama’s liberal base are urging him to do after last month’s massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

But how well do you know the NRA's history and background? 1. Its first president might be better known for sideburns. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, formerly a gunsmith, bemoaned the Union's shooting inaccuracy and tactics in the Civil War. He became the NRA's first leader when it was founded in 1871 in New York with the goal to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis.'' The word sideburns is a play on Burnside's last name, used to describe the hair on the side of his face that curled around to join his mustache. Library of Congress/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

“There’s nothing here that interferes with the rights of people to have a gun to protect themselves,” CAP President Neera Tanden said. But, she added, “we have daily episodes where it seems that guns are in the wrong hands, and that’s why we think it’s important that the president acts.”

On Monday, Tanden will moderate a public discussion with three Democrats who have played leading roles in the gun debate: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who during the Clinton administration helped get the 1994 assault-weapons ban passed; Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), who helped write that bill as a House member; and Rep. Mike Thompson (Calif.), who chairs the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.

One of CAP’s suggestions to toughen federal regulation of gun sales is to make the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is currently an agency within the Department of Justice, a unit of the FBI. CAP says absorbing the ATF into the FBI would better empower the ATF to combat gun crime and illegal trafficking.

“It is a beleaguered agency lacking leadership and resources,” said Winnie Stachelberg, senior vice president of CAP. “It needs to be a well-functioning federal law enforcement agency, and we need to figure out ways to ensure that happens.”

CAP’s top recommendation is to require criminal background checks for all gun sales, closing loopholes that currently enable an estimated 40 percent of sales to occur without any questions asked. The organization also wants to add convicted stalkers and suspected terrorists to the list of those barred from purchasing firearms.

CAP is urging the Obama administration to back Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s proposal to ban assault weapons. The California Democrat wants to prohibit the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of military-style assault weapons and ammunition magazines that carry more than 10 bullets.

The group also suggests requiring firearms dealers to report to the federal government individuals who purchase multiple semiautomatic assault rifles within a five-day period. Current law requires reporting multiple purchases of handguns, but not semiautomatic assault rifles.

CAP also wants the administration to free public health research agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to study the impact of gun violence on injuries and deaths. For years, lawmakers, urged by the NRA, have placed riders on spending bills that restrict these and other agencies from conducting such research."

Pollak'],Schakowsky: Assault Weapons Ban 'Just the Beginning',"Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), a member of the Democratic Party’s leadership in the House of Representatives, suggested to Jason Mattera at a Feb. 13 women’s rights rally that plans for an assault weapons ban and private-sales background checks were only the beginning of a broader gun control agenda extending to handguns as well.

Schakowsky evidently did not recognize Mattera, a conservative video journalist and senior investigative reporter for Talk Radio Network, who infamously confronted Vice President Joe Biden in the Capitol. (Mattera introduced himself to Schakowsky by name but did not indicate that he was filming or that he is conservative.) She spoke to Mattera as if he were a fellow gun control enthusiast–and Mattera played along, eliciting answers about Schakowsky’s enthusiasm for gun control.

“We want everything on the table,” Schakowsky told Mattera. “This is a moment of opportunity. There’s no question about it.”

One poignant exchange was as follows:

Schakowsky: We’re on a roll now, and I think we’ve got to take the–you know, we’re gonna push as hard as we can and as far as we can. Mattera: So the assault weapons ban is just the beginning? Schakowsky: Oh absolutely. I mean, I’m against handguns. We have, in Illinois, the Council Against Handgun… something [Violence]. Yeah, I’m a member of that. So, absolutely.

In another exchange, Schakowsky proposed allowances for states and municipalities to ban guns–though such laws have been repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court:

Mattera: We’ll never get a handgun ban with the Second Amendment as stated. Schakowsky: I don’t know. I don’t know that we can’t. And there may be an allowance, once again, for communities–I have communities in my district that prohibited handguns within their borders. The rights of municipalities and states to view that as a sensible way to keep people safe–I don’t think it’s precluded.

When Mattera asked why legislators were not pressing for a handgun ban, given that most murders are committed with handguns, Schakowsky replied: “Because we’re not going to be able to win that. Not now.” She went on to explain why background checks were a useful interim policy, arguing that they would “address any kind of weapon.”

Schakowsky’s remarks about plans for broader gun control are not the first time she has revealed the long-term goal behind short-term policy debates. She has a tendency to do so when speaking to apparently sympathetic audiences. In 2009, she told a crowd that the goal of Obamacare would be to “put the private insurance industry out of business.”

Officially, Democrats–including Schakowsky–hew to the party line as laid down by the president, which pledges support for the Second Amendment and for gun ownership in rural communities where hunting and shooting are viewed as traditional pastimes.

Gun owners fear that the Sandy Hook-inspired gun control measures before Congress–none of which would have stopped the mass shooting at Sandy Hook–are a prelude to broader regulations, including the banning of handguns and the eventual registration and confiscation of firearms, despite earnest assurances by Democrats to the contrary.

The Democratic Party has taken a hard line on guns recently, with President Obama’s strategist, David Axelrod, joining New York mayor Michael Bloomberg in backing gun control enthusiast Robin Kelly over former Rep. Debbie Halvorson, who has an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association, in the recent primary to replace former Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr. of Illinois. Kelly has promised to be a “leader” in “banning guns.”"

President Obama has given Vice President Joe Biden the task of surveying a wide range of interested parties to formulate a remedy for the horrific gun violence that bedevils American society. The shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and innocent bystanders at a shopping mall in Tucson, the slaughter in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., the heartbreaking murder of a class of first-graders in a schoolroom in Newtown, Conn., and a long string of similarly horrific incidents have become a recurring nightmare from which we all want to awake.

Supporters of gun rights make a fair point when they insist that guns are not the sole cause of the problem. They are very likely right that the ultra-violence in movies and video games inspires already troubled young minds to re-create bloody fantasies in real life. And they are right that something must be done to stop those warped-minded individuals who pull the triggers before they can do their evil deeds.

But the gun rights folks seem incapable of acknowledging that guns are part of the problem too. There are mentally deranged people and violent entertainment and video games in every developed country, but only in this one is there such frequent carnage. The one factor that is different is that, in the United States, there are as many guns as there are people.

This would suggest that it is at least worth considering measures that would make it more difficult for the wrong people to get hold of weapons. Yet, when better background checks or tighter regulation of private gun sales are proposed, too many gun enthusiasts immediately start screaming about confiscation. They insist that any step toward better regulation of firearms is an unthinkable slide toward a Stalinist world of gulags, government tyranny and defenseless citizens.

Right-wing talk show screamer Alex Jones went ballistic in a CNN interview when host Piers Morgan suggested a few sane steps to manage the gun problem might be a smart idea. “Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns!” Jones ranted. “And I am here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!”

Yes, it always seems to come down to that –- the paranoid certainty that even the most modest move toward better gun regulation is actually a smokescreen for some tyrant-in-waiting who wants to banish all guns and enslave America. That prevalent view among gun rights advocates pushes some of them to accept even loopier ideas.

In recent days, a tenured communications professor at Florida Atlantic University, James Tracy, wrote several blog posts that suggested the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown may well have been a staged event with actors hired by the Obama administration and orchestrated to provide a pretext for pushing gun control.

Now, that is about the most crazy and obscene allegation that has ever oozed from the right-wing blogosphere. But when the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported about the professor’s theory, quite a few readers called and emailed the newspaper to defend and applaud Tracy’s ideas.

This explains why laws that would keep guns out of the hands of crazy people are opposed by many firearms fans. So many of them seem to be totally nuts."

At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security has said it wants to buy more than 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition in the next four or five years -- which could put further strain on the supply.

The shortage, coupled with an increase in prices, comes as many gun owners head to the stores in anticipation of new gun control laws. States like Colorado and New York have already approved such legislation, while Democrats move toward bringing a bill to the Senate floor. At the moment, the congressional bill does not include an assault-weapons ban, but a ban is expected to be floated as an amendment.

Still, what one official described as ""panic-buying"" set in, as lawmakers rallied to draft new legislation in the wake of a series of tragic mass shootings last year, from Aurora, Colo., to Oak Creek, Wis., to Newtown, Conn.

In Tennessee's Hamilton County, the sheriff's department says its officers will be given fewer bullets when they train at the range.

""The concern over firearms availability and ammunition availability and potentials of gun control certainly has impacted the availability of ammunition purchased locally,"" training coordinator Jody Mays said, according to WDEF.

Earlier this year, Rollingwood Police Chief Dayne Pryor told MyFoxAustin.com that ""panic-buying"" is contributing to a situation where officers trying to order new firearms are being forced to wait. He said the city, which is outside Austin, has been told to expect wait times to purchase AR-15s and ammunition.

""We have adequate supplies right now, but we're limited to how often we can go to the firing range to train because we want to be conservative right now,"" he said.

Similarly, the Jenks Police Department in Oklahoma has faced rising ammo and assault weapons costs.

Police Chief Cameron Arthur said the department is still waiting on an order from October, according to KJRH.

Meanwhile, according to CNSNews.com, Rep. Timothy Huelskamp, R-Kan., said he still hasn't heard back from the Department of Homeland Security on why it's buying 1.6 billion rounds.

The Homeland Security Department, though, has said it needs the bullets for law enforcement agents in training and on duty.

Published federal notices about the ammo buy have agitated conspiracy theorists since the fall. The government's explanation is much less sinister.

The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga., and others like it run by DHS use up to 15 million rounds a year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises.

More than 90 federal agencies and 70,000 agents and officers used the department's training center last year.

The rest of the 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition would be purchased by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal government's second largest criminal investigative agency.

The Homeland Security ammo buy is not the first time the government's bullets purchases have sparked concerns on the Internet. The same thing happened last year when the Social Security Administration posted a notice that it was buying 174,000 hollow point bullets.

He Has Covered The White House', 'Congress']",Gun rights group endorses Manchin-Toomey background-check bill,"In anticipation of Senate votes this week on a proposed expansion of criminal background checks for firearms sales, one gun rights organization broke with the powerful National Rifle Association on Sunday to urge support for a compromise drafted by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.).

The endorsement by the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms — which calls itself the second-largest gun rights organization in the country, behind the NRA, claiming 650,000 members and supporters — is one of several moves over the past few days that have provided a boost to the hopes of proponents of background checks.

While leading gun-control advocates — including President Obama and New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) — back the bipartisan proposal, the announcement of support Sunday from the Citizens Committee reveals that substantial parts of the bill are viewed as “wins” for the gun lobby, including provisions that would prohibit a government registry of gun ownership and make it easier to transport and market weapons across state lines.

Though news of a split in the usually unified gun lobby cheered gun-control advocates, the gun lobby can count other probable wins in the current debate, such as the likely defeat of legislation to limit military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. Now, an expansion of background-check requirements for gun sales is considered the most likely major achievement.

Initially, gun-control advocates hoped for a requirement for background checks of individuals purchasing a gun under most any circumstance. Currently, background checks are conducted only for purchases made from licensed gun dealers. The compromise measure, drafted by Toomey and Manchin, would require background checks for currently exempt online and gun-show sales but not for most other private transactions.

There were other signs of momentum on gun-control legislation over the weekend, including a tentative expression of support for the Toomey-Manchin compromise on Sunday from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), an endorsement by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), and indications of backing from several House Republicans, including some who have had previous endorsements from the NRA.

Officially, only three Republican senators — Toomey, Collins and Mark Kirk (Ill.) — have said they plan to vote for the Manchin-Toomey agreement. Democratic aides say the bill will need the backing of at least six Republican senators to pass. The measure still has a long and tortuous path, with dozens of amendments expected. The Senate is scheduled to begin formal debate Tuesday by first considering the plan to expand the gun background-check program.

Sixteen GOP senators voted late last week to proceed to debate, but several of them and some moderate Democratic senators said they are unlikely to support the bill’s proposed compromise amendments. It is not known how many amendments will be considered by the Senate over the next two weeks.

A decade ago, the NRA backed expanded background-check legislation, but it now stands firmly opposed. An NRA spokesman re­iterated the group’s opposition Sunday evening and again promised to score the Senate vote on the compromise in making future election endorsement decisions.

The group that backed the bill, the Citizens Committee, has far fewer members than the 4 million claimed by the NRA. It was founded in 1972 and functions as a kind of sister organization to the Second Amendment Foundation, a legal think tank and law firm based in Bellevue, Wash., that, along with the NRA, has been a leader in filing major court challenges to halt restrictions on gun rights.

“We decided to back it because we believe it is the right thing to do,” said Julianne Versnel, director of operations for the group.

The chairman of the Citizens Committee, Alan Gottlieb, told supporters in an e-mail Sunday that the group would embrace the Manchin-Toomey compromise. He urged members to read the senators’ proposal to understand why the gun rights group would back it.

Gottlieb made clear in his e-mail that he enthusiastically backs the bill the NRA opposes.

“If you read the Manchin-Toomey substitute amendment, you can see all the advances for our cause that it contains,” Gottlieb wrote. He then listed the gun rights advantages in the bill: “interstate sales of handguns, veteran gun rights restoration, travel with firearms protection, civil and criminal immunity lawsuit protection, and most important of all, the guarantee that people, including federal officers, will go to federal prison for up to 15 years if they attempt to use any gun sales records to set up a gun registry.”

These “advances” cannot be achieved, Gottlieb wrote, “unless we win the Senate vote on Tuesday to substitute Senators Manchin and Toomey’s balanced approach” to background checks. Gottlieb, like other gun group leaders, opposes a more far-reaching background-check bill proposed by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).

The organization has already been in touch with individual Senate offices. Some have already rejected its argument.

Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who voted to proceed with debate, labeled the Manchin-Toomey agreement “unworkable and unfair to gun owners” in a message sent to constituents late last week. Because the plan would require gun purchasers to pay for a background check, “visitors to . . . gun shows across America will face a new tax of $30 to $50, and sometimes more, as they exercise their constitutional right to buy a gun,” Coburn said, adding that gun owners “will ignore and reject these changes.”

Other Republican senators who voted for debating the gun bill but plan to vote no on the amendment are Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), John Hoeven (N.D.) and Johnny Isakson (Ga.), their spokesmen said Sunday.

Among Democratic senators, moderates Mark Begich (Alaska) and Mark Pryor (Ark.), who face difficult reelection fights in 2014, voted against proceeding with debate and are expected to oppose the overall gun bill. Max Baucus (Mont.), Kay Hagan (N.C.) and Mary Landrieu (La.), who are also facing difficult reelection prospects, voted for debate but have signaled they may vote against the Manchin-Toomey deal.

A Baucus spokesman said Sunday that the senator is reviewing the Manchin-Toomey proposal “and listening to feedback from Montanans to make sure they have a chance to weigh in.” A Landrieu spokeswoman noted that the senator voted to proceed to debate on the gun bill but hasn’t made up her mind on other amendments. Aides to Hagan did not respond Sunday.

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) hopes to hold an up-or-down vote on the Manchin-Toomey plan by midweek and then proceed to vote on other amendments, according to senior Senate aides familiar with the plans.

Reid also is expected to call for a roll call on Democratic-backed amendments including the plan to ban military-style assault weapons, the aides said. A vote on the proposed ban, which is sponsored by 22 Senate Democrats, is expected to fall far short of the 60 votes needed to ensure final passage. Regardless, aides said Reid wants to hold a vote on the proposal early in the gun debate to fulfill his promise to Obama; the plan’s lead sponsor, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.); and gun-control groups that supported the ban.

Reid also hopes to hold a vote on a Democratic plan to limit the size of ammunition magazines, another proposal expected to fail, aides said. From there, he could proceed to a host of proposed amendments, including a bipartisan plan to provide more federal funding for mental health programs that assist military veterans, a Coburn proposal to establish an online portal for gun buyers to conduct their own background checks, a Republican plan to change the legal definition of mentally ill people when it comes to gun crimes, and an overarching GOP alternative to the underlying gun bill.

Gun-control advocates are worried about some of the expected amendments authored or backed by the NRA, including one that would provide a “national reciprocity” arrangement in which a gun owner who receives a permit to carry a concealed weapon in any one state would then be allowed to do that anywhere in the country.

Reps. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) plan to introduce on Monday a House version of the Manchin-Toomey agreement that mirrors the bipartisan Senate deal. King, who represents a suburban Long Island district, said he hoped the Senate deal would extend background checks to include most private firearms transactions but that “there’s no sense of making the perfect the enemy of the good these days.”

“Rather than reinventing the wheel, we adopted Manchin’s plan because we thought that any bill that passes the Senate could pass the House,” King said in an interview Sunday.

Expanding the background-check program “is absolutely essential” to curbing gun-related violence in New York, King said, noting that most gun crimes in his state are committed with firearms illegally obtained in other states.

Only King and Thompson are sponsoring the bill, but other House Republicans who represent suburban districts in the Northeast and Midwest are expected to sign on if it advances in the Senate, King said. Separately, Republican House members from Pennsylvania with past NRA endorsements indicated support for the Toomey-Manchin approach, including Reps. Michael G. Fitzpatrick, Patrick Meehan and Charlie Dent.

In a sign of the wait-and-see attitude in the House, King said he has had no formal discussions with House GOP leadership or the House Judiciary Committee about his bill or when gun legislation will begin to move in the chamber.

Late Sunday, a second gun rights group, the Independent Firearm Owners Association, joined the Citizens Committee in endorsing the Manchin-Toomey proposal. The group is led by a former NRA regional political director, Richard Feldman, but has far fewer members than either of the more established gun rights groups.

Toomey said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he expects a close vote this week on the measure. “I think it’s an open question as to whether or not we have the votes,” Toomey said. “I think it’s going to be close.”

Rick Perry (R) criticized a decision by the Obama administration to pursue legal action against the Lone Star State to place Texas back under preclearance, requiring federal approval for any changes to voting laws.

In a speech to the National Urban League in Philadelphia this week, Attorney General Eric Holder said the Department of Justice will ask a federal court in San Antonio to require advance approval for voting changes in Texas. Perry called the move an ""end-run around the Supreme Court,"" claiming the Obama administration is casting ""unfair aspersions"" on Texas' voting rights efforts.

In June, the High Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, the provision of the landmark civil rights law that designates which parts of the country must have changes to their voting laws cleared by the federal government or in federal court.

Holder's announcement marks the administration's first response to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Voting Rights Act. Holder said the action ""will not be our last.""

Once again, the Obama Administration is demonstrating utter contempt for our country's system of checks and balances, not to mention the U.S. Constitution. This end-run around the Supreme Court undermines the will of the people of Texas, and casts unfair aspersions on our state's common-sense efforts to preserve the integrity of our elections process."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/20/Democratic-Mayors-Take-On-Gun-Manufacturers,2013-01-20 00:00:00,['William Bigelow'],Democratic Mayors Take on Gun Manufacturers,"Apparently the word has come down from the White House to Democrats across the nation, get in line behind the Obama Administration on gun control. The National Conference of Democratic Mayors are now threatening to have their police departments boycott the purchase of guns from manufacturers who won’t adhere to the Obama Administration’s strictures.

The mayors are going to grade the manufacturers on their record of support vis-à-vis Obama’s plans for gun control, including universal background checks, the elimination of high-capacity magazines and sharing information on crime and mental health.

The leader of this crusade is Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, who stated:

When we were lobbying on Capitol Hill, it became clear that our goal of trying to pass laws that make it easier to make our communities safe was going to be opposed by the gun and ammunition manufacturers. We recognize as mayors, we help fund that, because we are one of the largest purchasers of guns and ammunition in the country. So at the Democratic mayors meeting last night, we agreed that we would all go back to our communities, gather information from our police chiefs and procurement officers about how many guns and how much ammunition we purchase, bring that in from the Democratic mayors so that we have a common list of how much money we’re spending, what purchases are pending and who we’re buying from.

Rybak added that the group will join Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns to grade the manufacturers.

Rybak concluded:

Then we’re going to do everything we can as mayors to use … the collective buying power of many millions of dollars in guns and ammunition, to support those who will support common-sense laws and oppose those who are fighting us in Congress. I am not going to have the people, the taxpayers of Minneapolis, pay for people to stop the Congress from passing laws that keep our people safe. It’s especially galling, paying money from our police departments to produce loopholes that allow illegal handguns into my communities that could be used against police officers.

On Friday night, the National Conference of Democratic Mayors resolved support for the gun control and public safety proposals of the White House."

Senate takes key vote at 11 a.m. to break filibuster

Vote will set up first major gun debate in 19 years

Debate on gun bills likely to take weeks

The Senate on Thursday voted 68-31 to move forward and start the most comprehensive debate on reducing gun violence in 19 years.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev, said the process of amending the gun legislation will begin -- and there are several proposed changes that will be introduced. The first amendment offered will be the bipartisan deal to expand background checks on gun purchases negotiated by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa. Scroll down for highlights:

11:38 a.m. ET: Reid announces the amendment process will begin. He says it will possibly take ""weeks"" to legislate. Reid also says there will be a vote on an assault weapons ban, which is not expected to pass.

11:35 a.m. ET: The final vote is 68-31. The debate begins. By our count, there were 16 Republican senators who agreed to move forward.

11:23 a.m. ET: Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, another Democrat from a red state being targeted in 2014, votes ""yes.""

11:20 a.m. ET: Another vote with political connotations: Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, votes ""no."" He is also facing voters next year, but is probably not as vulnerable as Pryor.

11:17 a.m. ET: Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., votes ""no."" He is up for re-election next year and is a top target for defeat. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., also on the ballot in 2014, votes ""yes."" The key will be to watch how they vote on the bill itself.

11:16 a.m. ET: The clerk has announced the first votes. GOP Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and John McCain of Arizona are among the ""yes"" votes. That means they want to start debate. Collins is the only GOP senator up for re-election next from a state that President Obama carried in 2012.

11:13 a.m. ET: A reminder: A ""yes"" vote Thursday means the senator wants to go ahead and start debating gun legislation. It is not an indication of support for the substance of the bill. A ""no"" vote means stop -- don't move forward -- and essentially would kill the bill.

11:03 a.m. ET: The clerk is starting to call the roll and the senators are coming to the Senate floor. A bit of procedure: The senators are actually voting on what is called a motion to invoke cloture, which requires 60 votes. Then the next step would be to start the clock (for 30 hours of debate) on what is called a motion to proceed.

10:49 a.m. ET: USA TODAY's Jackie Kucinich is at a news conference with families of Newtown victims. They have a statement about the bipartisan deal announced Wednesday by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., on expanded background checks for gun purchases. ""We are deeply encouraged,"" they say. ""No one should have to experience the pain we have endured.""

10:44 a.m. ET: Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 GOP leader, brings up the point that the focus should be on keeping guns away from the mentally ill. He warns about choosing ""symbolism"" over ""solutions.""

10:40 a.m. ET: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., makes reference to the National Rifle Association and its warning that it will ""score"" senators on their votes Thursday. ""We do not need a lobby's permission to pass laws,"" Leahy said, before imploring his colleagues to ""stand up and be counted. Have the courage.""

10:26 a.m. ET: Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, one of the Republicans seeking to filibuster gun legislation, just said the Senate needs more debate on guns -- not less -- to ensure that Second Amendment rights are upheld. ""Proponents say the people deserve a vote,"" he said. ""Don't they deserve to know what they're voting on?""

10:14 a.m. ET: Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., is telling the stories of children killed at Newtown as he stands besides a poster of some of the Sandy Hook victims. Politics may be politics, but it's clear that there will be several efforts to personalize the issue.

10:12 a.m. ET: Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democratic leader, brings up Hadiya Pendleton, the 15-year-old Chicago girl who was shot and killed shortly after participating in President Obama's inauguration.

9:50 a.m. ET: A reminder that the Senate is taking up gun legislation because of the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., explains that several family members who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook are in the chamber. ""Today let us decide there will be no more Newtowns,"" Blumenthal urges.

9:30 a.m. ET: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., kicked things off by saying he wants to start debate — but whether the gun legislation passes won't be known for some time. ""I hope we can ... start legislating today,"" he said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell followed."

Story highlights Starbucks refuses to ban loaded guns from its shops in 43 states that allow open carry Writers: Thousands of mothers want Starbucks to ban guns; nobody needs to be armed They say chain bans smoking in front of any store; is smoke riskier than loaded guns? Writers: Many businesses in open carry states ban guns to keep workers, customers safe

Editor’s Note: Shannon Watts is the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and Kate Beck is the head of the organization’s Seattle chapter. The organization was created to build support for what they term common-sense gun reforms.

(CNN) —

Starbucks lauds itself as a company committed to operating responsibly and ethically, and many of its policies reflect a strong corporate conscience. But when it comes to responsible gun policy, Starbucks has lost its moral compass.

Starbucks refuses to ban loaded guns from its coffee shops in the 43 states that allow people to openly carry loaded weapons.

As mothers, we wonder why the company is willing to put children and families in so much danger. Nobody needs to be armed to get a cup of coffee. And that’s why thousands of moms across the nation are asking Starbucks to put the safety of its customers first.

We’ve started a petition asking Starbucks to ban guns from its stores. In response, Starbucks has referred concerned moms to a statement on its website, a statement last updated in March 2010, about 90,000 American gun deaths ago. The statement reads, “The political, policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts, not in our stores.”

Shannon Watts

Kate Beck

Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson recently told Seattle Weekly that it is a legal strategy. “In communities that permit open carry, we abide by local laws. Where these laws don’t exist, openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited.”

Moms don’t want a gun debate with our coffee either. But when children are shot in schools, in movie theaters and even at Fourth of July parades, we can no longer keep the debate in the places where they “belong.” As the debate on guns spreads to town hall meetings nationwide in August, do we really have to have one in Starbucks too?

Starbucks’ refusal to ban guns from its stores has made it a nationwide venue for pro-gun rallies, where customers toting loaded weapons gather over coffee. There have even been accidental shootings: earlier this year a woman shot another customer when she dropped her purse and a loaded weapon inside discharged. A pro-gun site called I Love Guns and Coffee sells a coin that looks like the Starbucks logo, except the mermaid is wielding handguns. On Sunday, for example, 60 pro-gun activists carried handguns, semi-automatic rifles and shotguns into a Starbucks in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Starbucks claims its open carry policy simply follows state laws and local ordinances. However, the company is willing to overlook those in other instances; it recently announced a smoking ban within 25 feet of any store.

Why is Starbucks willing take a public health stand on smoking, but not gun violence, which kills more than 55 children and teens a week in America? Since when is second-hand smoke more dangerous than second-hand bullets?

Starbucks also claims that banning guns from its stores would put its employees in a “potentially unsafe position” if they had to ask a gun-wielding customer to leave. This alleged concern has not stopped other companies – including Disney, California Pizza Kitchen, AMC Theaters, Toys R Us, and even Starbucks competitor Peet’s Coffee & Tea – from prohibiting guns in their stores in states where open carry is legal. In fact, these companies have banned guns in order to keep employees and customers safe.

Starbucks bans guns from its corporate headquarters in Seattle, where open carry is perfectly legal. This same protection should be afforded to the millions of unarmed customers Starbucks serves each week.

An overwhelming majority of Americans want common-sense gun reforms. But it’s not just Congress and state legislatures that impact society; business policies also affect our safety. Shame on Congress for failing to act, but that’s no excuse for companies like Starbucks to fail to lead.

We never saw ourselves becoming activists. But like so many mothers on December 14th, we were horrified by the Sandy Hook shootings. The realization that our country’s lax gun laws led to the massacre of 20 innocent children shook both of us to the core. As mothers, we cannot and will not abide politics and policies that needlessly put our children and other children in danger.

Moms Demand Action has become a rallying point for mothers across the nation who refuse to tolerate the inaction over the epidemic of gun violence. We will not stop until gun reforms and responsible policies are in place at the federal level, in our states and at American businesses.

We have the most important reason of all for never backing down – our kids. Risking their safety isn’t worth a nonfat misto at Starbucks. Women make the vast majority of spending decisions in America; you can be sure we’ll spend those dollars with companies that value the safety of our families.

So you wake up this morning and find you’re president of the United States.



Pretty cool, no? Helicopters and a 747 at your disposal; courtside seats at any NBA playoff game of your choice; everyone stands up and the band plays when you come into the room.



But the job comes with some baggage, and one of the heaviest of steamer trunks is what to do about a political ally—make that three or four of them—who hands you a stinging defeat on a key, emotionally laden issue.



After the Newtown massacre, you put gun control—sorry, you call it “gun safety” now to avoid ruffling red state sensibilities—back on the table. You give powerful speeches surrounded by the grieving families of the kids who were killed at Sandy Hook. You see a gun rights Democrat, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, and a gun rights Republican, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey draft a bill that provides a kind of, sort of, sprinkled-with-exceptions background check.



And then you see four Democratic senators vote “no.” Three of them—Mark Begich of Alaska, Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas—were up for re-election next year (Begich and Pryor still are, but since the vote Baucus has decided not to run) in states where gun rights sentiment runs strong, and where Obama lost last year by wide margins.



What do you do now? For some on your side of this fight the answer is easy. William Daley, your former chief of staff and a member of the Chicago political family that has always played politics as a contact sport, says he’ll tell the apostates to look elsewhere for campaign contributions.



Some of your own supporters make a different point. They say you’re too soft, unwilling to back a senator up against the wall, stick your face in his (or hers), and get the vote you want—the way Lyndon Johnson used to do.



But you’ve got other considerations to think about. Next years’ midterms are going to be dicey under any circumstances, at least if history is a guide. Presidents in their sixth year almost always find their party losing seats in the Congress. With the retirement of Democrats in tough states such as South Dakota, West Virginia and Montana (Obama performed dismally in all three last year), your party’s hold on the Senate is in jeopardy. Cutting two incumbent Democrats loose significantly raises the chances that your party will lose the Senate. And if that happens, you can say goodbye to your domestic agenda, not to mention your federal judgeship nominations.



What you’re facing, it turns out, is the same dilemma that any president, any major officeholder faces: How much are you willing to live with in order to pursue a broader agenda?



FDR had to deal with Southern segregationists—and outright racists—who held power in Congress, so he had to yield to that power in order to get his New Deal legislation passed. As the Digital History website tells it: ""Most New Deal programs discriminated against blacks. The NRA, for example, not only offered whites the first crack at jobs, but authorized separate and lower pay scales for blacks. The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) refused to guarantee mortgages for blacks who tried to buy in white neighborhoods, and the CCC maintained segregated camps. Furthermore, the Social Security Act excluded those job categories blacks traditionally filled.”



JFK faced the same ugly reality: In order to get a black candidate approved for a federal judgeship, he had to name an ally of Mississippi Sen. James Eastland to the federal bench. That judge delighted in calling black civil rights demonstrators “chimpanzees”—and worse—but Kennedy paid that price.



So what do you do, Mr. (or Madame) President? Do you offer an object lesson to other members of your party by telling the trio of defecting senators to take a hike as a way of saying, “If you desert me on a big issue, you will pay the price?”



Or do you decide to swallow your anger and cheerfully hit the campaign trail next year to save this trio, because the price of losing the Senate is just too high?



You make the call."

That's right, the National Rifle Association's fire-breathing defender of gun rights is more academic than marksman.

""A policy wonk,"" says Joseph Tartaro, president of the pro-gun Second Amendment Foundation. ""He is more professorial than you would think.""

""Wayne is a Washington-type person,"" says John Aquilino, a former NRA spokesman who worked with LaPierre. ""He is best characterized as an absent-minded professor.""

A professor, that is, with a million-dollar megaphone and a well-honed ability to dish apocalyptic warnings about a tyrannical government angling to grab people's firearms.

""It's about banning your guns ... PERIOD!"" LaPierre wrote in a January email to the NRA's 4 million-plus members.

For decades, LaPierre, 63, has been serving up heated us-vs.-them rhetoric to rally the NRA faithful. Usually it works; sometimes it backfires.

There was his 1995 reference to federal law enforcement agents as ""jack-booted government thugs."" (He later apologized.)

And his 2000 declaration that President Bill Clinton was ""willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda."" (No apology.)

And his 2002 complaint that tougher airport screenings after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks signaled that ""I guess it's OK to wand-rape someone's daughter in public.""

A week after the December school shooting in Newtown, Conn., LaPierre gave a fiery speech calling for armed guards in every school. He blamed violence on a culture that celebrates gory video games and ""blood-soaked slasher films"" and rewards killers with fame.

""Gun nut!"" the New York Post screamed on its front page.

""The most revolting, tone-deaf statement I've ever seen,"" tweeted then-Rep. Chris Murphy, now a Democratic senator from Connecticut.

""Call me crazy,"" LaPierre retorted on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ''I think the American people think it's crazy not to do it,"" referring to armed school guards.

Story continues

In fact, a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in January found that 55 percent of Americans said they would support a law ""placing an armed guard in every school in the country.""

In the weeks since Newtown, LaPierre has been the ever-present public face of gun-rights forces, shuttling between speeches, hearing rooms and TV studios to forcefully reject proposals for tighter gun controls as misguided ideas that will do nothing to stop criminals and everything to tangle law-abiding citizens in a bureaucratic nightmare.

Jimmy Carter was president when LaPierre first went to work for the NRA in 1977, and for the past 22 years LaPierre has been the organization's executive vice president, steering it through a transformation from a clubby marksmanship group into a political movement adept at beating back efforts to tighten firearms regulations.

Along the way, says Josh Sugarman, head of the pro-gun-control Violence Policy Center, LaPierre's tenure has been marked by a willingness to push the envelope with over-the-top language that casts the government as the enemy and stokes ""fear-driven paranoia.""

LaPierre has been richly rewarded for his efforts: NRA tax returns show he earned $835,000 in salary and $126,000 in other compensation in 2010.

For all of LaPierre's tough talk, friends and former colleagues describe a soft-spoken man who's a little scattered.

Aquilino, the former NRA spokesman, remembers his former colleague oversleeping and missing a golf outing with Vice President Dan Quayle. Leaving a trail of dropped notebooks and papers on the path from his office to a cab. Sitting head in hands in an airport terminal, unable to remember what flight he was booked on.

Aquilino says he once asked LaPierre what he wanted to do eventually and was told, ""To tell the truth, I'd like to run an ice cream parlor in Maine.""

How does all of that square with LaPierre's combative reputation?

""It's all done on purpose,"" says Grover Norquist, an anti-tax crusader and member of the NRA's board. ""It's hard to say: 'The Second Amendment's in danger' and say it in a shy, soft-spoken way.""

Or, as LaPierre himself put it in a 2000 interview: ""When I used less strong words for the last three years, everyone dozed off.""

No one snoozed in 1995 when LaPierre signed an NRA fundraising letter that accused the Clinton administration of empowering police to ""murder law-abiding citizens"" at will and described the ban on semi-automatic weapons as a law giving ""jack-booted government thugs more power to take away our constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill us.""

Even some NRA members were aghast. Former President George W. Bush very publicly quit the group. LaPierre at first defended the letter then offered a qualified apology.

He'd slipped over the line from hard-nosed to incendiary in an episode that will always brand him.

By those standards, his words have been generally more measured since. But when LaPierre speaks, those who watch him wonder what undercurrents he's tapping.

The NRA's website describes LaPierre as ""a skilled hunter, from Chesapeake waterfowl to African Cape buffalo."" Online, there are lots of suit-and-tie photos of LaPierre, and a couple of hunting shots, including a picture of him next to a downed buffalo in Botswana.

The NRA declined to make LaPierre available for an interview or to answer questions about him.

But former colleagues say LaPierre did not show great interest in shooting. And they're hard pressed to recall any LaPierre hobbies beyond devouring nonfiction. LaPierre is married but does not have children.

""There was an opportunity for him to learn about firearms, and he certainly knows about them,"" says Tanya Metaksa, who hired LaPierre at the NRA and later worked under him. ""But he's more the intellectual in his understanding of the history of the issue and the philosophical underpinnings of what it means to uphold the Second Amendment.""

LaPierre's path to the top of the NRA began with an interest in politics, not guns.

Richmond attorney Tom Lisk grew up across the street from LaPierre in Roanoke, Va., and remembers him as an avid bowler, passionate about hockey and politics. As a teenager, LaPierre would take his young neighbor along to the bowling alley on Saturday mornings, and he'd hang out at Lisk's house to talk government with Lisk's father, who was on the city council.

The NRA executive who's worked against many a Democratic presidential candidate over the years actually cut his teeth working for Democrat George McGovern's campaign in Roanoke back in 1972, when LaPierre was 22. LaPierre, who has a bachelor's degree from Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y., and a master's from Boston College, got a job early on as an aide to Vic Thomas, a pro-gun Democratic state legislator in Virginia. He worked on gun legislation for Thomas, and that led to his hiring by the NRA in 1978.

Lisk, whom LaPierre later recommended for an NRA job, remembers LaPierre as ""a person that people gravitated toward"" at the organization.

""Wayne wanted to be liked,"" says Lisk, noting that he'd send out for ice cream as the group's lobbyists met to decide which candidates would get campaign contributions.

Richard Feldman, who worked with LaPierre at the NRA but later had a falling out and now runs the Independent Firearm Owners Association, says LaPierre's success as a lobbyist came in part from never saying ""no"" to those he might need.

""Wayne's approach would be, 'That's a good idea. Yeah, I'm with you on that,'"" says Feldman. ""Meanwhile, he's doing everything around your back to kill it.""

After a surprisingly long run as the NRA's executive vice president, surviving insider plots along the way, LaPierre remains the hero to many a gun lover and villain to opponents.

The sharpened battle lines since Newtown have made it easier for LaPierre to pitch his uncompromising message that gun owners must band together to fight liberal elites out to take their firearms.

LaPierre has been here before.

When he went before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, one of the questioners was Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., his longtime nemesis on the subject of banning assault weapons.

Feinstein welcomed the witnesses and made a point of saying, ""Even you, Mr. LaPierre. It's good to see you again. I guess we tangled, what was it, 18 years ago? You look pretty good, actually.""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/24/bloomberg-mayor-group-tout-big-gun-control-push/,2013-03-24 00:00:00,[],NRA chief says Bloomberg can't 'buy America' amid $12M gun control ad blitz,"NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre on Sunday challenged New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's plan to spend $12 million on ads meant to pressure senators into backing strict new gun control measures, saying Bloomberg ""can't buy America.""

Bloomberg's pro-gun control group Mayors Against Illegal Guns is launching the campaign in states where senators may be on the fence regarding a package of firearms proposals making its way to the Senate floor. As the push for that legislation appears to falter, President Obama plans to soon tour the country to talk about the need to reduce gun violence, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News. Bloomberg also confirmed Sunday that he plans to spend $12 million to run ads in at least 10 states, suggesting there could be a political price to pay for opposing the measures.

Making clear he intends to be a counterweight to the NRA, Bloomberg said he wants to make sure the powerful gun lobby is not ""the only voice"" in this debate. If he can achieve that, Bloomberg said, ""then I think my money would be well spent.""

LaPierre bristled at Bloomberg's comments.

""He can't spend enough of his $27 billion to try to impose his will on the American public,"" LaPierre said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""He can't buy America.""

Part of the purpose of the ad buy will be to rally support for comprehensive background checks.

LaPierre, though, said the existing system only serves as a ""speed bump for the law-abiding"" without catching the bad actors. LaPierre stressed that the NRA will continue to push for enhanced security in schools, better enforcement of existing federal gun laws, stricter penalties for straw purchases and illegal trafficking, and a system for making sure dealers can check gun purchases against a record of the mentally incompetent and dangerous.

""We're 5 million families. We're 80,000 law enforcement families. ... We want to make people safe. That's what the NRA does every day,"" LaPierre said.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid plans to include a universal background check provision in a gun control package he's preparing for the Senate floor. However, Republicans have so far been reluctant to back universal checks. Reid's office is leaving the door open for substituting the Democrat-backed measure with a compromise proposal, should one emerge.

At the same time, Reid announced this past week that a renewed ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines would not be in the main bill, though it would be voted on as an amendment.

Amid these hurdles, Bloomberg announced the ad buy Saturday. He said they were meant to bring the ""voices of Americans -- who overwhelmingly support comprehensive and enforceable background checks -- into the discussion to move senators to immediately take action to prevent gun violence.""

Bloomberg defended the ad buy Sunday , speaking on the same program as LaPierre, saying it would be a ""great tragedy"" if the momentum for gun control generated after the Newtown mass shooting withered. At the same time, Bloomberg said ""I think we are going to win this.""

We was blunt about the purpose of the ad buys. ""We're trying to do everything we can to press upon the senators this is what the survivors want.""

The two ads posted on the group's website, called ""Responsible"" and ""Family,"" show a gun owner holding a rifle while sitting on the back of a pickup truck.

In one ad, the man says he'll defend the Second Amendment but adds ""with rights come responsibilities."" The ad then urges viewers to tell Congress to support background checks.

In the other ad, the man, a hunter, is shown with the rifle and children playing in the background.

""I believe in the Second Amendment, and I'll fight to protect it. But with rights come responsibilities,"" he says. ""That's why I support comprehensive background checks.""

The Senate is scheduled to debate federal gun control legislation next month. On March 28, the group plans for more than 100 events nationwide in support of passing gun control legislation that includes background checks.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns and other gun-control advocates frequently cite a mid-1990s study that suggests about 40 percent of U.S. gun transfers were conducted by private sellers not subject to federal background checks. Based on 2011 FBI data, the group estimates 6.6 million firearms transfers are made without a background check for the receiver.

A spokesman for Bloomberg could not immediately say if the $12 million was coming from Bloomberg or the mayor's political action committee, Independence USA. The New York Times, which first reported the ad campaign Saturday night, said Bloomberg was bankrolling the ad buy.

A spokesman for the National Rifle Association blasted Bloomberg and the new ads, saying NRA members and supporters would be calling senators directly and urging them to vote against proposed gun control legislation.

""What Michael Bloomberg is trying to do is ... intimidate senators into not listening to constituents and instead pledge their allegiance to him and his money,"" said spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.

Bloomberg has long supported efforts to curb gun violence, including sending New York City undercover investigators into other states to conduct straw purchases from dealers. Last month, Bloomberg's PAC poured more than $2 million into ads supporting Illinois state Rep. Robin Kelly, who won a special primary and ran partly on a platform of supporting tougher gun restrictions.

The new ads will air in states the group believes are divided on gun control. The ad campaign begins on Monday, sources told the New York Post.

The Senate is scheduled to debate federal gun control legislation next month after returning from the Easter Recess, which lasts from March 25 through April 5. On March 28, the group plans for more than 100 events nationwide in support of passing gun control legislation that includes background checks.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/15/gun-bill-backers-try-to-ease-registry-concerns-as-senate-debate-begins/,2013-04-15 00:00:00,[],Gun bill backers try to quell ‘registry’ concerns as Senate debate begins,"As debate begins this week on sweeping firearms legislation, supporters are running into renewed concern from conservatives that the bill could lead to a gun ""registry"" despite adamant pledges to prohibit this.

Fear of a national registry has remained even after two influential senators last week proposed a compromise on background checks. The proposal, which will be voted on as an amendment, would expand background checks to gun shows and Internet sales while exempting personal transactions like those among family members.

The provision, meant to ease concerns about the checks becoming too pervasive, also included language to bar the creation of a federal registry.

But the language was not enough. Some gun-rights supporters continue to worry about a slippery-slope scenario, where a background check expansion sets the stage for a national registry -- which could then be exploited to seize weapons from individuals. Despite the fact that licensed dealers already keep records of their sales and a national registry has not yet been created, the Second Amendment nightmare scenario has lived on.

""Once you get these lists out there, once you have a gun dealer keeping lists for lots of other people, the only way that works, frankly I think, is if you keep the paper,"" Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., told Fox News on Monday. ""And if you keep the paper, eventually, somebody's going to ask for it.""

Concerns about gun seizures were stoked most recently after a New York gun owner had his weapons mistakenly seized. They were later ordered to be returned.

Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who drafted the background check amendment, insist a registry is expressly prohibited.

The language of the proposal says the Justice Department ""may not consolidate or centralize the records"" on firearms sales or possession. It goes on to say nothing in the proposal would allow the establishment of a ""federal firearms registry.""

Manchin, speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" reiterated that sellers can do a background check and keep a record -- but the proposal would prohibit a national registry, punishing anybody who tries creating one with up to 15 years imprisonment.

Despite the assurances, some lawmakers were skeptical.

""It has been said on the floor recently that background check legislation cannot lead to gun registries because federal law prohibits that. But current federal law can be changed,"" Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said last week, calling recordkeeping a ""step toward registration.""

He cited testimony that gun registration is important to ensuring a system of universal background checks works.

Those concerns were echoed Monday by Blunt, who said he plans to oppose the bill. He cited reports last week that said 185,000 people in his state were affected after a list of concealed-weapon permit holders was given to federal officials.

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., also said in a statement last week that the Manchin-Toomey proposal ""prioritizes collecting records over protecting citizens.""

David Addington, with the conservative Heritage Foundation, argued that while the new proposal prohibits a federal registry, it also includes language that could create wiggle room for the Justice Department.

Yet supporters of new gun legislation are slowly peeling off votes in favor of the bill. The Senate voted 68-31 last week to advance to debate, easily clearing the 60-vote threshold.

The bill will have to clear that bar once more before earning a final vote -- and some of those who voted ""yes"" last week could vote ""no"" the second time around.

But over the weekend, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he was ""very favorably disposed"" to the Manchin-Toomey amendment.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., as well as Toomey, have also signaled support from the Republican side.

Democrats have a 55-vote majority in the Senate, including two independents who typically caucus with Democrats. If all those Democrats vote for the bill, they would still need five Republicans.

But Democrats could lose a handful of their own -- for instance, two Democrats facing reelection next year opposed last week's motion -- which would require even more Republican support.

It's not yet clear whether Democrats can garner enough of it. Another prominent Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced Monday that he will oppose the Toomey-Manchin amendment.

""Instead of expanding a broken background check system, let's fix it,"" he said."
http://news.yahoo.com/cowardly-congress-ruthless-nra-impotent-obama-conspire-against-092719796--politics.html,,[],"Cowardly Congress, Ruthless NRA, and an Impotent Obama Conspire Against Assault-Weapons Ban","I don’t have the words to describe the cowardice of Congress or the depravity of the gun lobby, which conspired to kill the assault-weapons ban. I can’t explain the apparent impotence of President Obama who vowed to “use whatever power this office holds” to convert the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School into commonsense common good.

Fortunately, Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News found the words:

Any fool knows that [Adam] Lanza couldn’t possibly have killed as many children as quickly as he did on the morning of Dec. 14 without an assault weapon in his hands. So how does the president and any other big politician who allows the gun nuts from the National Rifle Association to win again answer the larger question about weapons that make killings like the elementary-school massacre ridiculously easy: If not now for a ban on these weapons, when?”

His must-read column was illustrated by the pictures of 20 slain Sandy Hook students and this headline: “Shame On U.S.”

The ban on assault weapons sponsored by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California apparently died Tuesday with barely a whisper from media outlets or the White House. Black bunting should have hung from every window in Washington.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democratic ally of Obama, told reporters that Feinstein’s proposal could not overcome Senate rules requiring the support of at least 60 senators before allowing a final vote. The proposal “using the most optimistic numbers, has less than 40 votes. That’s not 60,” he said.

In fairness, the gun lobby deserves most of the blame for creating a political climate in which any regulation of firearms is viewed as an attack on the constitutional right to bear arms. This as much a financial issue to the NRA and its industry allies as it is a constitutional one.

But Obama and fellow Democrats shoulder a responsibility to reframe the debate around unassailable facts: The Second Amendment is not at risk; modest regulations would improve gun safety and strengthen the nation's noble gun culture; and nobody outside the U.S. military needs an assault weapon. Instead, the White House and Democratic lawmakers signaled retreat on the assault-weapons ban almost immediately after Obama proposed it. He didn't fight.

Story continues

“We cannot tolerate this anymore,” a teary-eyed president told the nation after the Sandy Hook shootings. “We are not doing enough and we will have to change.”

I don’t doubt Obama’s sincerity, but it is fair to question the president’s stomach for hard and hands-on legislative campaigns in a divided Congress. Not only are the facts on his side, but so is the public. An ABC News/Washington Post poll shows that 52 percent of the public favor stricter gun laws; 91 percent support background checks at gun shows; 82 percent want to make illegal gun sales a federal crime; and 57 percent favor a ban on assault weapons.

Every member of Congress, every White House aide, and every National Rifle Association dues-payer should take another look at those numbers. Be ashamed.

Sure, there is a chance that Obama will eventually sign legislation that requires background checks at gun shows, that makes gun trafficking a federal crime and that provides funding for school security. These provisions would allow Democrats, moderate Republicans, and a legacy-seeking president to claim they did something about gun violence. And they might, in fact, help. But don't be impressed: If anything comes out of the GOP-controlled House, it's likely to be weakened.

Remember Lupica’s words: Any fool knows what an assault weapons is created to do. “If Sandy Hook Elementary doesn’t make every member of Congress take a stand against assault weapons in this country, then what does?” Lupica wrote. “How many small coffins do we need the next time?”"
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/06/08/free-gun-initiative-begins-in-houston-neighborhood/,2013-06-08 00:00:00,[],Free gun initiative begins in Houston neighborhood,"Houston resident Cheryl Strain's inexperience with guns was apparent as she struggled to load shells into a 20-gauge shotgun.

Over the piercing blasts of gunfire in the shooting range, Strain's instructor, Dan Blackford, patiently directed her on how to use her thumb to shove a shell all the way inside the barrel and feel it click.

""Now we got a round in the chamber ready to go,"" Blackford said as he positioned her body on the right way to hold the shotgun. ""Look down your sight, put that BB right in the middle of your target and press the trigger.""

Strain's northwest Houston community of Oak Forest is the first neighborhood in the country being trained and equipped by the Armed Citizen Project, a Houston nonprofit that is giving away free shotguns to single women and residents of neighborhoods with high crime rates.

While many cities have tried gun buy-backs and other tactics in the ongoing national debate on gun control, the nonprofit and its supporters say gun giveaways to responsible owners are actually a better way to deter crime. The organization, which plans to offer training classes in Dallas, San Antonio, and Tucson, Ariz., in the next few weeks, is working to expand its giveaways to 15 cities by the end of the year, including Chicago and New York.

But others in Houston, while expressing support for Second Amendment rights, question whether more guns will result in more gun-related deaths rather than less crime.

Residents of Oak Forest say their neighborhood, made up of older one-story houses and a growing number of new townhomes, has experienced a recent rash of driveway robberies and home burglaries. On a recent Sunday afternoon, a group of 10 residents, including Strain, went through training at Shiloh Shooting, a northwest Houston gun range.

Kyle Coplen, the project's 29-year-old founder said his group expects to train at least 50 Oak Forest residents and put up signs saying the neighborhood is armed.

""When we have a crime wave, we don't just say let's just increase police and that's all we do. We do multiple things. I see this as one aspect of what we can do,"" said Coplen, who graduated from the University of Houston with a master's degree in public administration.

It costs the organization about $300 to arm and train an individual and about $20,000 for an entire neighborhood. All costs are paid through donations, said Coplen, though he declined to say how much his organization has raised so far.

While some residents in the neighborhood are supportive, several officials have mixed feelings about it.

Sandra Keller, Strain's neighbor, said she is participating in part because of the helplessness she felt after her furniture store was robbed a couple of years ago.

""If you don't have a gun, you're just a walking victim. You're just waiting for somebody to take advantage of you and your property,"" said Keller, 64, after practicing at the shooting range.

But Houston City Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, who represents Oak Forest, said, ""I have serious concerns about more guns in homes.""

Cohen said she supports Second Amendment rights and believes that such a responsibility should include proper training and background checks.

David Hemenway, a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health who has written about firearms and health, said studies suggesting gun ownership deters crime have been refuted by many others that say the opposite.

""Mostly what guns seem to do is make situations more lethal because most crime has nothing to do with guns,"" he said. ""When there is a gun in the mix, there is much more likely to be somebody dying or somebody incredibly hurt.""

Proponents of increased gun ownership point to a variety of statistics to support their argument, including ones showing that some cities with strict gun control laws, like Chicago, still have high murder rates.

Blackford, the firearm instructor in the Oak Forest training, said the group is teaching residents not only how to handle and store a weapon but also when to use deadly force.

""The sad part is most people think if you're pro-gun, that you've got this gunslinger attitude, that you are walking around looking for a gun fight to get into and that is so far from the truth,"" said Blackford, a former Secret Service agent.

Harris County Precinct One Constable Alan Rosen, whose deputies patrol Oak Forest, said that while he believes the best deterrent to crime is effective neighborhood watch programs, he believes people should have the right to protect themselves.

""In terms of having a shotgun, after you've been properly trained on it, to have that in your home to protect your home, I'm for it,"" he said.

Strain, 46, a single mother who has never owned a gun, said she was nervous firing the shotgun but that more training will help. She also had her 12-year-old son Rory practice firing the shotgun so ""if God forbid something happens, he could be prepared as well."""

Under the terms of an agreement between Senate leaders to consider amendments to the larger gun bill, nine amendments are to be offered Wednesday, from Democrats and Republicans. Each would require 60 votes to pass.

Most whip counts indicate that sponsors have 52 votes for the background checks amendment, including three Republicans -- Sens. Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mark Kirk of Illinois, the measure’s co-sponsors, and Maine Sen. Susan Collins.

It was just a week ago that the announcement by Manchin and Toomey on the terms of the background check plan was seen as a possible breakthrough in the nation’s gun debate. But further GOP support failed to materialize, and some Democrats facing tough reelection bids have not committed.

On Tuesday, even as Manchin and Toomey pressed their case in their respective party luncheons, more Republicans stated their opposition. Late Tuesday, Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski said she would vote no, and would instead support an amendment being introduced by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley that she said was “more in line with the views of Alaskans because it accomplishes our shared goals without adding any new steps or layers of bureaucracy for any law-abiding Alaskan who wants to purchase a firearm for sport or protection.”

Manchin, himself a red-state Democrat who had an A-rating from the National Rifle Assn., said he thought he could bring the “credibility” needed to convince skeptical colleagues that his measure would strengthen the background check system while protecting 2nd Amendment rights.

“I can’t understand it. I really can’t,” Manchin said in the interview, talking about the stubborn opposition to the amendment.

A defeat of the Manchin-Toomey measure would likely doom the fate of the larger gun bill, which also includes new penalties for gun trafficking and more funding for school safety.

But Democrats have signaled the case for stricter gun laws is one that they will continue to press.

Bill will include controversial language on background checks

Reid hopes talks may achieve compromise that would replace his background check language

Assault weapons ban will get a vote%2C but will not be in the bill

WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday that after the congressional recess, he will bring to the Senate floor a gun-violence bill that will include measures to expand background checks for gun purchases, strengthen trafficking laws and improve school safety.

Reid acknowledged that the background-check language he is including in the bill could change in the final product.

The current background-check language, authored by Sen. Charles Schumer, is serving as a place holder while the New York Democrat – along with Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill. – continue to negotiate a compromise with Republicans.

Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma had initially been part of the negotiations, but he dropped out after the group could not come to an agreement over a requirement for private gun sellers to keep a record of their sales – a provision opposed by the National Rifle Association.

Reid said in a statement he is ""hopeful"" that negotiations will be successful over the two-week break.

""If a compromise is reached, I am open to including it in the base bill,"" Reid said. ""But I want to be clear: in order to be effective, any bill that passes the Senate must include background checks.""

The other two provisions in the gun-violence bill – increasing the penalty for trafficking firearms and expanding grants for school safety – are largely non-controversial and were approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support.

Reid added that once debate on the bill begins, he will ""ensure"" that votes occur on a ban on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and mental health provisions.

""In his State of the Union address, President Obama called for all of these provisions to receive votes, and I will ensure that they do,"" he said.

Reid created an uproar among supporters of stricter gun regulations Tuesday when he told reporters the assault weapons ban simply did not have enough support to be part of his broader gun bill."

In 2010, there were over 15,000 felons and fugitives who tried to illegally purchase firearms. Of those 15,000, the Obama Justice Department prosecuted just 44. Let me repeat those numbers because those numbers are staggering, 15,000, they only prosecuted 44.”

— Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), on the Sean Hannity Show, April 10, 2013

We’ve written before about the disconnect between the number of people denied guns via a background check and the number of people prosecuted. Essentially, bringing a criminal case for lying on a government form is a relatively low priority for prosecutors. But we have also shown that the federal numbers do not tell the complete picture, because there is strong evidence that state officials use background checks to pick up and charge fugitives and other at-large criminals.

Cruz, in a talking point he also repeated on the Lou Dobbs show, placed the blame for this problem on the Obama administration. He got one set of numbers wrong — in 2010 the number of felons and fugitive denied a firearm was actually 48,000, not 15,000 — but the number of prosecutions he cited (44) was on the nose. That’s out of nearly 73,000 total denials, for a variety of reasons, by the FBI.

Still, we were intrigued by his partisan framing of the problem. So we dug into the numbers again to see if there was much difference between Obama and the administration of George W. Bush in prosecuting such cases.

The Facts

Ever since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was established, government reports — such as by the General Accounting Office in 2003 and the Justice Department Inspector General in 2004 — have documented how few people are prosecuted. In 2002 and 2003, for instance, the IG found that only 154 people (much less than one percent) out of 120,000 denials were prosecuted — about an average of 78 prosecutions a year.

Starting in 2005, annual studies of the NICS system began listing the number of prosecutions per year that resulted from federal background checks. Generally, about the same number of people is denied through state agencies, but the records are spotty on how many state prosecutions resulted.

Below is the key data, with links to the reports in the date. The 2005 report did not break out the actual number of fugitives or felons, but just gave a percentage. We calculated the percentage of denials out of all denials because the data does not how many prosecutions involved felons or fugitives.

2010: 72,659 denials

34,459 felony convictions/indictments

13,862 fugitives

44 prosecutions (0.06 percent of denials)

2009: 67,324 denials

32,652 felony convictions/indictments

11,341 fugitives

77 prosecutions (0.11 percent)

2008: 70,725 denials

39,526 felony convictions/indictments

9,464 fugitives

105 prosecutions (0.15 percent)

2007: 73,992 denials

23,703 felony convictions/indictments

4,803 fugitives

122 prosecutions (0.16 percent)

2006: 69,930 denials

25,259 felony convictions/indictments

4,235 fugitives

112 prosecutions (0.16 percent)

2005: 66,705 denials

36.8 percent felony convictions/indictments

5.3 percent fugitives

135 prosecutions (0.20 percent)

Clearly there is a bit a downward trend here, with the low point reached in 2010, both in terms of raw numbers and as a percentage of denials. (We suspect there might have been a brief burst of enthusiasm for more prosecutions after the critical 2004 IG report.)

But the differences are really on the margins. Neither the Bush administration nor Obama administration ever prosecuted even ¼ of one percent of the people who failed to pass a criminal background check.

“The senator did not mention President Bush, did not say Bush was better,” said Cruz communications director Sean Rushton. “We’re talking about the current administration, which we are debating on its current hard push for new gun regulation. Obama’s prosecution stats stand on their own, regardless of the Bush record. And the underlying point is the same — why increase restrictions on law-abiding people when we’re not prosecuting under current law?”

The Pinocchio Test

If Cruz wants to attack the fact that relatively few people are prosecuted by federal prosecutors for lying on a background check, he should drop the partisan frame.

This clearly has never been a priority in either Republican or Democratic administrations. So Cruz’s claim that Obama has not made this a priority lacks the proper context and, under our Pinocchio scale, represents “selective telling of the truth.”

USA TODAY Poll finds support for a new gun-control law has ebbed to 49%25-45%25

Advocates of gun control back a strong bill%2C even if it won%27t pass%2C over a watered-down version

More than 7 in 10 support creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants

WASHINGTON -- Four months after the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School, a USA TODAY Poll finds support for a new gun-control law ebbing as prospects for passage on Capitol Hill seem to fade.

Americans are more narrowly divided on the issue than in recent months, and backing for a bill has slipped below 50%, the poll finds. By 49%-45%, those surveyed favor Congress passing a new gun-control law. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in early April, 55% had backed a stricter gun law, which was down from 61% in February.

The survey of 1,002 adults was taken Thursday through Sunday by Princeton Survey Research. The margin of error is +/- 4 percentage points.

Those who support a bill want advocates in Congress to hang tough and not compromise -- an attitude that also could complicate passing legislation. Sixty-one percent say members of Congress ""should only agree to a stronger version of the bill, even if it might not pass."" Just 30% say they should ""accept a weaker law"" they know can win approval.

""So much of the support for gun control is emotional, following the Newtown tragedy,"" says Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. The December shooting at the Connecticut school left 20 children and six adults dead. ""The longer you get away from there, people start thinking of other issues. They start thinking about terrorism or jobs or immigration, and not surprisingly, then some of the momentum behind gun control starts to fade.""

The Boston Marathon bombings last Monday also may have had an effect, he speculates. ""It wouldn't be shocking if people sitting in their homes in Massachusetts cities and towns thought to themselves, 'Boy, I wish I had something to protect myself with if a terrorist came through the door now.'""

Last week in the Senate, a bipartisan proposal for expanding background checks for gun buyers failed to win the 60 votes needed.

Those surveyed who oppose a gun-control bill are split on whether senators who agree should use a filibuster to block debate: 44% back the idea of a filibuster; 41% oppose it.

On immigration, support for taking action is strong: 80% back ""better border control"" and 71% favor creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants now in the United States illegally, if they meet certain requirements. Just 25% oppose creating a process to gain citizenship.

Americans remain more concerned about tough enforcement, however. By 55%-33%, they say they place a higher priority on preventing illegal immigration in the future than on dealing with immigrants who already are in the U.S. illegally."

Biden said the issue of gun violence is one “that requires immediate action,” and the president and he were “determined to take action.”

“I want to make clear that we’re not going to get caught up in the notion that, unless we can do everything, were going to do nothing,” Biden told reporters before a meeting with gun safety advocates and victims of gun violence. “The president is going to act,” he said, adding the White House has determined that “executive action can be taken.”

As a practical matter, Biden’s comments reflect the political reality in the House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans who have been resistant to new restrictions on guns. Even in the Senate, Democrats are shy of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. And a number of the 53 Democrats there may face difficult reelection fights in 2014, in which pro-gun groups such as the National Rifle Assn. may exert their political muscle.

Biden did not specify what executive actions might be on the table, saying they still were being reviewed.

After the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting, the administration pointed to some “common-sense efforts” it had already implemented using executive authority, primarily through improvements to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

Biden’s recommendations will no doubt still include legislative prescriptions, though. The president has indicated he is prepared to use the bully pulpit as he begins his second term to push for congressional action, and reform advocates are also mobilizing independently of the White House.

Actions are also possible at the state level. Gov. Jack Markell (D) of Delaware, chairman of the National Governors Assn., said at an event in Washington on Wednesday he would be introducing legislation in a matter of days addressing three components: access to mental health treatment, school security and access to guns.

In his state of the state address Wednesday, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy (D) promised “to make specific, actionable recommendations in the areas of school safety, mental health services and gun violence prevention.” But he noted that state action had its limits.

“This conversation must take place nationally. As long as weapons continue to travel up and down I-95, what is available for sale in Florida can have devastating consequences here in Connecticut,” he said.

The NGA as a group was unlikely to take an official position. “Each state is different. Each state has its unique needs,” said Gov. Mary Fallin (R-Okla.), the NGA vice chair.

“If all you’re going to do is legislate on guns, then you’re not dealing with the whole issue,” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said on MSNBC. “You’ve got to do some stuff on guns, but you also have to deal with mental health, and substance abuse. Because if you don’t, then all you’re doing is being political.”

Biden was to hold a conference call Wednesday afternoon with a group of governors. Markell said one area that states may be drawn into the administration’s recommendations is in opening access to state mental health databases.

The vice president is also meeting this week with gun ownership groups, including the NRA, as well as manufacturers of video games and representatives of the entertainment industry.

The White House says Biden will be making recommendations to the president soon after the conclusion of his meetings. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, members of which have been at the forefront of the gun issue, announced Wednesday that Biden will be addressing the group at its convention in Washington on Jan. 17.

Where exactly will the lines be drawn in determining who is too mentally ill to own a gun? Is it only those who have been forcibly committed, or do we go for even those suffering from slight depression? That would likely include more than half of America. If something as simple as this or a brief hospitalization can revoke someone's right to have a weapon, that will, in the long run, prevent many with problems from seeking help for fear of losing their rights.

Some in Congress want to pass more gun-control laws on law abiding citizens.

I've given this some thought: The person who shot those individuals in Newtown, Conn., stole the gun he used, which is against the law. He shot and killed his mother, also against the law.

He transported the loaded gun onto school property, against the law. He broke into the school and discharged the weapon within city limits, killing 26 people, against the law.

Yet there are people in this country who think passing another law would protect us. The only people that a gun-ban law would impact are law-abiding citizens.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is also a mental illness. Should we disarm servicemembers? Gauging what ""mental illness"" prevents someone from getting a gun is complex.

Karl Sagan

We need to dedicate ourselves to finding the best solution, regardless of personal biases. We can't keep depending on tragedies to remind us that gun control is a problem we haven't come close to solving.

Jayson Flores

Letter to the Editor:

The recent USA TODAY editorial about gun control promulgates the idea that the main ingredient in the tragedies caused by people using military-style weapons is the mental state of the perpetrator.

I have experience with weapons similar to those used in many of the recent killings. These weapons might be fun to use, and I suppose I could bag a deer with them, but they were designed for one purpose — to kill people. Arguments against gun control boil down to one thing: the attitude that as long as there is no skin off my back, I don't care. If we can blame these senseless killings on the mentally unstable, then we don't have to think about controlling the guns. To all owners of assault weapons: If it would save one life, would you give up your gun and 30-round clip?

State Supreme Court Justice Gerald Connolly signed an order granting the request for a hearing by plaintiffs who are challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo's decision to waive the three-day review usually required before votes on bills, according to LoHud.com.

The plaintiffs argue the law violates the guarantees of free speech, property ownership and the right to petition the government guaranteed under the state and federal constitutions.

Plaintiff Robert Schulz called Cuomo a ""king"" for pushing through the nation's toughest gun law by suspending the three-day vetting period by submitting a “message of necessity” on the law, which allows the constitutional waiting period to be suspended.

""Kings govern by opinion,"" said Shulz, who calls himself a ""constitutionalist"" and has challenged governors for decades in court although he isn't a lawyer. ""There has to be some rationale, some justification of facts before waiving the people's demand for three days""' review of a bill.

The law enacted Jan. 15, pushed by Cuomo, sets a seven-bullet limit on magazines, tightens the definition of illegal ""assault weapons"" and requires owners of formerly legal semi-automatic guns to register them, among other measures.

The New Yorkers are representing themselves, without lawyers. A March 11 date in state court is scheduled. State officials will have to argue their case to avoid an injunction against the law.

""We believe the law is, and the process was, valid and constitutional,"" said Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi.

Cuomo and legislative leaders agreed on the bill in closed-door negotiations and put the politically dicey measure to a vote at night in mid-January. That was after Cuomo issued the message of necessity, which the plaintiffs say includes misrepresentations.

The message of necessity, according to LoHud.com, reads: “Some weapons are so dangerous, and some ammunition devices are so lethal, that New York State must act without delay to prohibit their continued sale and possession in the state in order to protect its children, first responders and citizens as soon as possible. This bill, if enacted, would do so by immediately banning the ownership, purchase and sale of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices.”

Schulz, of Warren County, called the gun control law ""repugnant"" and seeks to have it declared void. The plaintiffs said they have 1,200 backers.

You’ve made it clear that it’s time to do something.”

Before departing on his trip to Israel and Jordan, Obama spoke with lawmakers from both parties about the gun measures under consideration, according to a White House official. The president plans to continue pressuring Congress on the issue, including additional travel outside of Washington designed to mobilize public support, said the official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.

Obama’s remarks come after a difficult week for his gun violence agenda. After a ban on assault weapons -- supported by Obama and authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) -- did not gain enough bipartisan traction on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) decided not to include it as part of a bill encompassing several other gun-control proposals that the Senate is scheduled to begin debating in early April. Reid’s decision severely diminished any prospect of passing a prohibition on hundreds of specific so-called assault weapons, although Feinstein still can introduce the assault weapons ban as an amendment to the full bill.

The centerpiece of Obama’s gun-control agenda is universal background checks, which has by far the most support among Americans, and appears to have more momentum in the Senate than the assault weapons ban.

In his radio address, Obama urged the Senate and the House to vote on each of the proposals he is championing – from background checks to bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines to school safety measures to the gun trafficking bill.

“These ideas shouldn’t be controversial – they’re common sense,” Obama said. “They’re supported by a majority of the American people. And I urge the Senate and the House to give each of them a vote.”"

(AP) Colo. lawmakers lose recalls over gun laws support

By COLLEEN SLEVIN

Associated Press

DENVER

Two Colorado state lawmakers who backed gun-control measures in the aftermath of the mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut last year have been ousted in recall elections.



Pueblo voters in Democratic Sen. Angela Giron’s district approved her recall, with results coming in late Tuesday. Returns earlier showed Democratic Senate President John Morse also lost his seat in Colorado Springs.



In Giron’s race, voters chose Republican George Rivera, a former Pueblo police officer, to replace her.



The firearms legislation package Giron supported this year included size limits for ammunition magazines and expanded background checks for private and online gun purchases.



Her working-class district favors her party but includes Democrats who are big supporters of the Second Amendment.

UPDATE 12:26 AM EST — Senator Angela Giron is now down 60 to 40 with over half the votes counted and FOX31 Denver predicts she will follow Morse out the door. Giron says she is not conceding yet and will wait for more votes to be counted before speaking.



UPDATE 11:37 EST — Morse has conceded. Morse said, “It has been an honor to represent the 11th Senate District. It’s been hugely rewarding.” He is the first Colorado legislator ever successfully recalled. He vowed that Democrats will continue the fight for gun control.

UPDATE 11 pm EST — With 75% of the vote in, Morse is now down 52 to 47.

Kurt Bardella, a communications consultant for the Colorado recall effort, told Breitbart News: “If the early voting trends hold steady, history will be made in Colorado tonight that will reverberate throughout the country. After tonight, no one should underestimate the political potency of the gun-control debate. Democrats have targeted Colorado in recent cycles and have had some real success turning the state from red-to-purple. The fact that the sitting State Senate President is on the cusp of being the first-ever recalled state official in Colorado’s history should give anyone who is considering moving forward with additional gun control legislation real pause.”"

Signs such as this one appear on many Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants across the country, which has a corporate policy banning guns from all of their establishments. (Jason Lea/Mentor Patch)

While some businesses, such as Starbucks, have no policy on whether you can carry guns inside, the restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings does have a policy: No guns. And when a group of eight plain-clothed Prince William County police officers wearing guns sat down last month at the new BWW in Manassas, near Wellington Road and Market Street, a waitress there refused to serve them.

Jamie Rogers broke this story in the Manassas Patch, and reports that the restaurant’s manager tried to make amends the next day with the Prince William police. “There is no reason why those officers should have been asked to leave,” manager Scott Lupton wrote in a letter. “Police officers are always welcome in my establishment and even though we do have a no-gun policy, as a company that excludes off-duty police officers.” Lupton told Rogers he would try to personally apologize to the officers, and he later told Fox News the officers were not asked to leave. I was unable to reach Lupton Monday.

(UPDATE, 11:30 am: The officers were on duty, though in plain clothes, Prince William police Officer Jonathan Perok said, and were not in violation of the restaurant’s policy because there is an exemption for police. Lupton said he had been instructed not to discuss the incident. Waiting for a call back from the BWW HQ.)

Buffalo Wild Wings launched this policy in 2009, and regularly issues the following statement when asked about it: “Buffalo Wild Wings respects the right of individuals to carry firearms. However, because we are focused on the comfort, safety and enjoyment of all of our guests, we have elected to exercise our right to restrict the carrying of firearms within our restaurants. We regret any inconvenience this may cause but believe that this policy is in the best interest of all our guests and our Team Members.”

Openly carrying weapons in Virginia is legal, though private establishments may make their own rules. Carrying a concealed weapon requires a permit. In 2010, Virginia legalized the previously prohibited practice of carrying a concealed weapon in a restaurant or bar, so long as the person does not drink alcohol (and the restaurant allows it). Concealed or open carry, though, Buffalo Wild Wings still says no to average citizens. What do you say?

Also establishes the nation%27s first statewide registry for people convicted of crimes involving dangerous weapons

Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed the nation's most far-reaching gun control bill Thursday, the ceremony in Hartford concluding several emotional weeks of debate and compromise since the state was rocked and the world stunned by the mass murder of children in Newtown.

""This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room,"" Malloy, a Democrat, said moments before signing the bill. He added that he hoped the state's bipartisan effort would provide an example for Congress.

""When 92% of Americans agree that every gun sale should be subject to a background check, there is no excuse"" not to make it federal law, Malloy said.

The Connecticut law adds more than 100 weapons to the state's ban on assault weapons, limits the capacity of ammo magazines and requires background checks for all weapon sales, including at gun shows.

It also establishes the nation's first statewide registry for people convicted of crimes involving dangerous weapons. Access to the registry would be available only to law enforcement.

READ:Bill summary

Nicole Hockley's 6-year-old, Dylan, was among the 20 children who died when Adam Lanza began shooting inside Sandy Hook Elementary on Dec. 14. He also killed six adult staff before killing himself. Hockley said she appreciated the bipartisan political effort that led to the law.

""While I am grateful for the progress being made, I wish more than anything that I was just back at home waiting for both Dylan and Jake to come home from school,"" she said.

Hockley said her effort to press the law forward was one way to honor her son's life. ""We want Newtown to be known not for tragedy, but for transformation,"" Hockley said.

The state House voted early Thursday in favor of the 139-page bill crafted by leaders from both major parties. The bill passed the Senate in a 26-10 vote Wednesday. Both bodies are Democrat-controlled.

The bill drew angry protests at the Capitol this week, with some gun rights supporters booing leading advocates of the bill. But in Newtown the bill and the bipartisan effort involved in its passage were warmly received.

Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman on Thursday thanked the families of all the victims for their leadership in the effort. ""I've been amazed at the strength of the families since that day at Newtown,"" said Wyman, a Democrat. ""Today won't make up for all that went on that day. But I have gained so much strength from these families, and I thank you.""

Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra, the town's chief executive officer and a Republican, said she is ""pleased for the most part"" with the legislation.

""It includes action on some of the most critical elements in gun control and certainly signifies to the rest of the country — and maybe the world — that significant, meaningful change can come about through the political process,"" Llodra said.

The bill was drawn up by a bipartisan task force assembled after the Dec. 14 Newtown massacre.

""The tragedy in Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends politics,"" said Senate President Donald Williams.

While Republican state Sen. John Kissel of Enfield acknowledged that ""you just can't have a heart at all if you don't feel for the families and friends and neighbors of the victims of that Newtown massacre,"" he expressed concern that the law is ultimately harmful to lawful gun owners.

""When it comes to further regulations on guns and ammunition in one of the states that's touted as having, right now, some of the most tough gun laws in the United States of America, I think it goes one step too far,"" said Kissel, who opposed the bill.

But Wyman said the intent was not to take away anyone's rights. ""The intent is simply to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them,"" she said.

Among the law's provisions are a requirement of eligibility certificates for the purchase of any rifle, shotgun or ammunition. Penalties for illegal possession and firearms trafficking would also be significantly increased.

In addition to the controls on guns and ammunition, the law sets safety standards for school buildings, allow mental health training for teachers and expand mental health research in the state.

The law does not ban large-capacity magazines outright, but grandfathers them in from Jan. 1, 2014. The magazines can be loaded only with 10 or fewer rounds, except in the owner's home or at a shooting range. Owners must register the magazines by year's end.

Thursday would have been the 7th birthday of Ana Marquez-Greene, who died at Sandy Hook. In an op-ed column appearing Thursday in USA TODAY, her parents, Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez-Greene, write:

""We don't need new laws to begin strengthening the bonds of family and community. We can be more giving, loving parents, friends and neighbors. We can offer love to those who are outcasts or alone. We can look to God and form an eternal relationship built from nothing but love.

""But we must do more. Today (Thursday), the governor of our home state of Connecticut will sign historic bipartisan legislation designed by legislators to make our communities safer. Their cooperative spirit should be a model for Congress, when the Senate considers legislation next week to reduce gun violence.""

Newport Police Lt. William Fitzgerald said Wednesday that officers had faxed a copy of their report to the Newport Naval Station after Alexis told them on Aug. 7 that he was being threatened by unseen people and feared that “some sort of microwave machine” was penetrating his body.

“We faxed it to them that same day, an hour after we spoke to Mr. Alexis,” Fitzgerald said. “They said they would look into it, that they would follow up on it. It was a routine thing for us to give them a heads-up.”

A Navy official in Washington said Navy security agents in Newport had reviewed the allegations and decided Alexis was not a threat to the installation or to himself. He called the notification “routine” and said security personnel apparently did not interview Alexis or revoke his security clearance.

While in Newport, Alexis contacted human resources for his employer, the Experts, multiple times to complain about hearing voices in his hotel room, company spokesman Lou Colasuonno said. Company employees thought he was referring to actual voices, Colasuonno said, and moved him to new hotels twice.

The firm also contacted police to ask about Alexis but were told the department had no information about him, Colasuonno said, even though a police report had been filed. No one from the Navy or the Pentagon contacted the Experts about Alexis, he added.

The Department of Veterans Affairs said Alexis had been treated on Aug. 23 in the emergency room at the VA Medical Center in Providence, R.I., “complaining of insomnia.” He was given “a small amount” of medicine to help him sleep and instructed to see his primary care provider. Five days later, he received a small refill from the emergency room at the VA Medical Center in Washington.

“On both occasions, Mr. Alexis was alert and oriented, and was asked by VA doctors if he was struggling with anxiety or depression, or had thoughts about harming himself or others, all of which he denied,” VA officials said in a statement.

They added that he enrolled in VA healthcare in February 2011 — after his discharge from the Navy — but “never sought an appointment from a mental health specialist.”

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel acknowledged that officials had missed many warning signs.

“When you go back in hindsight and look at all this, there were some red flags — of course there were,” Hagel said at a Pentagon news conference. “Why they didn’t get picked up, why they didn’t get incorporated into the clearance process, what he was doing — those are all legitimate questions that we’re going to be dealing with.”

Adding that “obviously something went wrong,” he announced a series of reviews into base security.

On Monday morning, six weeks after the Newport incident, Alexis appeared at the Washington Navy Yard, where he was working as a computer technician for the Experts, a contracting firm. Hidden in a bag in the trunk of his blue vehicle was a Remington 870 Express shotgun he had purchased two days earlier, federal officials said.

According to one federal law enforcement source, Alexis carved two cryptic messages into the weapon’s wooden stock: “Better Off This Way” and “My ELF” — messages that appear to be a clue into his possible motive for killing 12 people and wounding several others.

The messages were carved with a knife or some other sharp instrument, the source said. The My ELF message could have been a reference to “extremely low frequency” and could refer to his hallucinations in Newport, the source said. Or, the source said, it could mean “executable and linkable format,” a common computer coding term that Alexis would have known.

When Alexis opened fire with the shotgun, the source said, he was confronted by a Navy security officer armed with a .40-caliber Beretta semiautomatic. Alexis shot the guard, took the handgun and continued to fire at employees, the source said. The gunfire lasted more than half an hour, until police killed Alexis.

“He was a loner,” added the official, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was still underway. “Who knows what was in his mind? He told people he was crazy.”

Alexis bought the shotgun Saturday at the Sharpshooters Small Arms Range in Lorton, Va. A lawyer for the range, J. Michael Slocum, said Alexis had also tried to purchase a pistol, but store clerks refused to sell it to him because he was not a Virginia resident. Residency was not required to buy the shotgun.

In New York on Wednesday, Alexis’ mother apologized to the victims’ families as she spoke publicly for the first time since his rampage in the nation’s capital.

“I don’t know why he did what he did, and I will never be able to ask him why,” Cathleen Alexis said, reading from a statement outside her Brooklyn home. “Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone, and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims, I am so, so very sorry that this has happened. My heart is broken.”

Dressed in black and flanked by two local pastors, she did not address the question of her 34-year-old son’s mental stability. But his father, Algernon Alexis, told Seattle police in 2004 that his son suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after helping rescue people from the rubble of the World Trade Center after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001.

There has been no verification that Alexis was among the first responders. Barry Rosen, a spokesman for the Borough of Manhattan Community College, where Alexis worked from February 2001 to February 2003, said his work record “does not indicate anything at all, good or bad or otherwise,” to hint at problems.

Rosen added: “There is no indication that he was present at 9/11 and no record of him being a first responder. The college was close enough to ground zero that it provided a rest haven for first responders. But we have nothing to indicate that Alexis was involved in 9/11.”

Four are still hold-outs,"It would seem a lobbyist’s dream: rounding up votes for a proposal backed by more than 8 in 10 people in polls. Yet gun control supporters are struggling to win over moderate Democrats in their drive to push expanded background checks for firearms purchasers through the Senate next month. Backed by a $12 million TV advertising campaign financed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, gun control groups scheduled rallies around the country Thursday aimed at pressuring senators to back the effort. President Barack Obama was meeting at the White House with gun violence victims.

At least four red-state Democratic senators could vote against a bill that would extend background checks to private gun sales. A few others have indicated they would vote in favor of such a law if the details are to their liking. Unless they—the two independents in the Senate and five Republicans there—agree, the proposal that has the most popular support across the nation and was seen when it was first suggested three months ago as the most likely new gun-control measure to pass, may never become law. Alan Fram reports As I noted Thursday, two of the five Democrats targeted by the Bloomberg ad campaign have indicated they would be amenable to a favorable vote on expanding background checks that now cover sales by the estimated 55,000 federally licensed dealers nationwide but not private transactions. They are Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Joe Donnelly of Indiana.

As soon as Donnelly said he could vote for extending the background checks, the Bloomberg-funded ads were pulled from the Indiana market. But neither he nor Hagan are solidly in the thumbs-up column. Their vote depends on the details, they have said. What that could mean is that one or both of them are concerned about record-keeping. That's been a major sticking point.

Many gun-rights advocates, including Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, oppose any record-keeping by anybody on the grounds that it would produce a registry that the government could later use to seize firearms. Gun-control advocates, most notably Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the sponsor of the background-check bill, says without record-keeping of some sort, extending the checks would be pointless.

But Hagan and Donnelly can at least be counted in the ""probably yes"" category. Four other Democratic senators in red states are still not on board. Follow me below the fold to find out who they are."

USA TODAY

An advocacy group wants folks to boycott Starbucks on Saturday

The group wants Starbucks to ban guns from all of its stores nationwide

Starbucks has the legal right to prohibit firearms in its stores

The Starbucks siren suddenly has a gun to her head.

An advocacy group has called for ""Skip Starbucks Saturday"" this weekend — a nationwide boycott on Aug. 24, to pressure the coffee giant to amend its current policy, which allows customers to carry loaded guns into Starbucks stores where permitted by state law.

""Many moms are unaware that if they take their children to Starbucks, their children may be standing next to a customer who has a loaded weapon,"" says Shannon Watts, founder of the non-profit group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. She says the group hopes to gather 25,000 signatures to ban guns at all U.S. Starbucks stores. She hopes to personally present the signatures to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.

The boycott is an attempt to place the world's biggest coffee chain — which prides itself on consumer advocacy — in the middle of one of the nation's hot-button social issues. Most major companies work to steer clear of such issues for fear of antagonizing customers. The boycott is a bid to force Starbucks to re-think its current policy, which it has previously said is gun-neutral, but which anti-gun groups have tagged as pro-gun.

""Our long-standing stance has been to comply with local laws in the communities we serve,"" says Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson. ""We believe gun violence is a serious issue and something our elected officials should address.""

Hutson says Starbucks doesn't want its stores to be used as ""staging grounds"" for either side of the issue. Even then, he says, ""our policy is not changing.""

The move comes less than two weeks after gun rights advocates nationally sponsored a headline-grabbing ""Starbucks Appreciation Day,"" in which Starbucks customers toted guns into Starbucks stores, where permitted, including the Starbucks store in Newtown, Conn., which opted to close early that day. Critics dubbed the day ""Bring Your Gun to Starbucks Day.""

Starbucks currently allows guns in stores in 43 states — where states permit. But Starbucks has the legal right to prohibit firearms in its stores ""in the interest of customer safety,"" says Kim Russell, national director of outreach for Moms Demand Action.

In May, a female customer at a Starbucks store in St. Petersburg, Fla., was accidentally shot in the leg when another woman dropped her purse — which carried a gun that discharged.

""Starbucks is a progressive company that does a lot for the community,"" says Russell. ""That's why we hold them to a higher standard.""

She notes that Starbucks employees are not permitted to carry guns at work — even in states that allow them to do so.

But because Starbucks has not come down squarely against folks bringing guns into its stores, gun owners have increasingly been using Starbucks as gathering places, Russell says. ""We're just not feeling safe there anymore,"" she says."

%22Probably not a bad idea%22 for Mayor Bloomberg%2C others to step back%2C Hickenlooper says

New recall effort%2C if successful%2C could switch control of Colorado Senate to the GOP

Federal government shutdown has hurt recovery from last month%27s devastating floods

WASHINGTON -- Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper suggests national gun-control groups stay away from a looming recall battle that could switch control of the state Senate to the GOP. The groups poured money into an unsuccessful defense of two state lawmakers recalled over their gun votes earlier this year.

""Colorado is a state that people like to be themselves and solve their own problems,"" the Democratic governor said in an interview with Capital Download, USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. ""They don't really like outside organizations meddling in their affairs, and maybe the NRA gets a pass on that.

""But (it is) probably not a bad idea"" for gun-control groups, such as the one established by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to curb their efforts if gun-rights activists collect enough signatures to force a recall vote on state Sen. Evie Hudak, a two-term Democrat from a suburban district north of Denver, he said.

If Republicans succeed in gaining her seat, Democrats would lose their 18-17 edge in the state Senate.

Petition organizers have until Dec. 3 to collect 18,900 signatures. ""They're well-funded and there's a lot of energy behind this, a lot of frustration,"" Hickenlooper said. ""I'm going to guess it's probably 50-50"" that they will be able to get the recall vote on the ballot.

But, he noted, ""I didn't think they'd get enough signatures for the first two.""

The recall campaigns have been aimed at legislators who voted in favor of requiring universal background checks for gun buyers and limiting magazine clips to 15 rounds. The laws, pushed by Hickenlooper, were enacted in the wake of a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last year that left 12 people dead.

In September, Senate President John Morse and state Sen. Angela Giron — both Democrats — were ousted from office by recall votes. Bloomberg's group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, contributed $350,000 to the anti-recall campaign, but the efforts by groups from outside the state became an issue itself for some. After the recalls succeeded, the National Rifle Association gloated on Twitter that Bloomberg had ""wasted his money.""

Hickenlooper acknowledges the difficulties of passing federal gun laws even after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., last December and other tragedies. ""We have this tradition of the Second Amendment and people's rights to self-defense and a certain suspicion that the government can't be trusted,"" he said. ""That's going to make it very difficult. I think any progress in terms of even universal background checks will be slow.""

The governor was interviewed while in Washington for The Daily Beast's Hero Summit, discussing crisis leadership after Colorado's devastating floods last month.

The partial shutdown of the federal government has complicated recovery efforts, Hickenlooper said in the interview with USA TODAY.

""We had the worst floods probably in the history of the state, and yet we don't have the resources of the EPA,"" he said. The Environmental Protection Agency has been unable to test for suspected e-coli, the possible result of sewage contamination, on grass and parklands where children are playing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development ""doesn't have the resources or the flexibility to get shelter"" for some of those crowded into temporary housing.

""FEMA still has got all their people on the ground in Colorado,"" he said of the Federal Emergency Management Administration, ""but when they make requests now, all their support staff in Washington is gone.""

Hickenlooper, 61, was hobbling on crutches after undergoing hip surgery last month. A former mayor of Denver, he is running for re-election as governor next year, a race that the non-partisan Cook Political Report now rates as solidly Democrat, indicating a likely victory for him.

""Easy for them to say,"" he said with a smile.

The bill is thorough and bipartisan. Swift approval would send a message to the entire country that, as John McKinney, the Republican State Senate minority leader, observed, some issues must rise above politics. Mr. McKinney represents Newtown, where, in December, a gunman armed with a Bushmaster XM-15 military-style rifle massacred 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

If the bill becomes law, no firearm could be sold in Connecticut until the buyer passes a national criminal background check; private sales of rifles and shotguns will be regulated; the list of banned assault weapons will be expanded from 66 to more than 150; and the sale, purchase, transfer or importing of large-capacity magazines (more than 10 bullets) will be prohibited.

Because of pressure from the gun lobby, lawmakers refused to add a ban on current possession of these magazines. They also failed to include a provision requiring the annual registration of handguns, including proof that a gun is still with the original owner. Connecticut Against Gun Violence, an advocacy group, says that most of the state’s gun murders occur in the cities of Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport; of these, most are committed with handguns no longer with the original owners. But lawmakers chose not to push back against the gun lobby’s false claim that registration leads to confiscation.

The gun lobby’s basic position is that the package would not have prevented the Newtown massacre. But it might have, if one of its provisions had been law: current state law requires secure firearms storage in households with anyone under 16; the bill extends that to households where the gun owner knows that someone living there poses a risk of imminent injury to himself or others. By significantly limiting access to the most dangerous firearms and ammunition, the package will not only contribute to public safety in Connecticut but will provide a laudable example to Congress and other states of what can be achieved with a serious bipartisan effort."
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-24/news/ct-met-illinois-gun-control-0524-20130524_1_assault-weapons-ban-house-committee-nra,2013-05-24 00:00:00,"['Ray Long', 'Rick Pearson', 'Rafael Guerrero', 'Chicago Tribune Reporters']","Quinn, Emanuel lash out at Madigan gun bill","— Gov. Pat Quinn, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Senate President John Cullerton decried a bill to legalize concealed firearms that is backed by powerful House Speaker Michael Madigan, contending it would invalidate strict local gun laws like Chicago's ban on assault weapons.

That opposition, however, didn't stop Madigan from advancing the bill Thursday, demonstrating that after months of negotiations, the time for talking was over. Predicting it would pass the House, Madigan has indicated that a vote on the measure could come as early as Friday.

The odd tensions among the four top Chicago Democrats who run state and city government are exacerbated by twin deadlines: the legislature's own scheduled May 31 adjournment date and a June 9 date set by a federal appeals court for Illinois to come up with a concealed carry law after it struck down the nation's only state ban on possessing firearms in public.

The House bill is sponsored by Rep. Brandon Phelps, D-Harrisburg, the legislature's strongest voice for gun-owner rights. It would put in place a statewide standard for concealed carry that would not allow Chicago or other home-rule communities to enact stricter local laws on where guns could be carried.

Moreover, it would wipe out Chicago's existing gun laws by removing the right of home-rule communities to enact their own firearm regulations.

""This legislation as written is a massive overreach that goes far beyond the conceal carry issue,"" said Quinn spokeswoman Brooke Anderson. ""The measure would repeal Chicago's assault weapons ban and put public safety at risk. We oppose this.""

After lawmakers had gone home for the day, Emanuel's office issued a statement opposing Madigan's plan, saying the mayor is ""committed to working with the leaders"" on legislation to combat gun crimes and keep illegal guns off the street.

In a Capitol where political posturing is second nature, Cullerton's decision to attack what he sees as a pro-gun tilt in the House bill only escalated the drama between two chambers already at a standoff over how to fix a nearly $100 billion pension debt with only a week left in the spring session.

Even before a House committee advanced the bill on a 13-3 vote, Senate President Cullerton released a stinging statement that contended the National Rifle Association's ""fingerprints"" can be found ""all over"" the bill. Cullerton criticized the House bill as an ""NRA dream"" because it gives state government ""exclusive authority to regulate any matter related to firearms"" beyond just concealed carry.

NRA representatives were uncharacteristically quiet and took no position on the bill in the House committee. An affiliate of the NRA, the Illinois State Rifle Association, said it was ""neutral"" on the measure.

The NRA's silence prompted state Sen. Kwame Raoul, the sponsor of a Senate bill backed by Cullerton, to ask, ""When have you known the NRA to be quiet on a bill of this magnitude or quiet on a bill that they don't like? One's got to be suspicious of that.""

Both Cullerton and Raoul left room for further negotiations. Cullerton said that absent the language ending local communities' rights to regulate guns, the House legislation was ""clear evidence that the two chambers are close to an agreement.""

Raoul's bill stalled in the Senate last week when Madigan made it clear to lawmakers, including senators, that the House was working on what he indicated may be a better bill.

Both the House and Senate bills agree on some basics, such as banning guns in places like CTA buses and trains, stadiums, casinos and government buildings.

The House bill says state police shall give concealed carry permits to people who fit within the letter of the law. But local officials can still object, and applicants, if denied a permit, can appeal to a new review board loaded with appointees who have law enforcement backgrounds.

The Senate bill would require applicants to get separate endorsements — one for Chicago and one for the rest of the state — to carry a concealed weapon statewide. Those carve-outs are not in the House bill — a position the NRA has backed.

Rep. Andre Thapedi, D-Chicago, said it was a ""no-brainer"" to vote in favor of the House bill. He underscored the silence at the committee hearing from lobbyists for Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart and Emanuel.

A Dart spokesman said in an email that the ""situation in Springfield is just too fluid for the time being."" Alvarez's office had no comment.

Quotes attributed to him and tied to the right to bear arms litter the social sphere. But how did a man 200-plus years past his prime become today's gun-debate darling?

""Jefferson becomes this great political Rorschach in which people pour into him different things,"" says Saul Cornell, a professor at Fordham University who studies early American political and constitutional thought.

People read into the inkblots of antiquity, molding Jefferson into who they want him to be on the subject of guns.

""Basically, what the Internet has done is democratized or Starbucks-ified discussions of the Founding Fathers. Everyone can talk about them without actually knowing anything about them,"" Cornell says.

It's the Wikipedification of knowledge, and it doesn't matter if it's true.

Real or fake, the Internet has spoken; it's loudest after tragedies like Aurora and Newtown. Read these Jeffersonian quotes fueling the debate. What do they say to you?"

(CNN) —

Was it a debate? A berating? A surreal televised “stunt”? No matter what you call radio host Alex Jones’ appearance on “Piers Morgan Tonight,” one thing is certain: It’s generating a great deal of social media buzz.

On Tuesday morning, Jones was a top-trending topic on Twitter as people read about the interview, watched clips online or shared their thoughts after watching Monday night’s fiery exchange live.

The man behind a petition to deport Morgan back to the UK for expressing his views on gun control went on the attack, calling the CNN host “a hatchet man of the new world order.”

“1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!” Jones yelled. “It doesn’t matter how many lemmings (mindless followers) you get out on the street begging for them to have their guns taken! We will not relinquish them! Do you understand?”

Morgan has pushed for stricter gun control regulations since a gunman killed 27 people before committing suicide last month in Newtown, Connecticut – 26 of them in a mass shooting at an elementary school, including 20 children.

“I’m in favor of a nationwide ban on military-style semiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,” he said as he opened his Monday night show, before introducing Jones.

Alex Jones: “The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns”

Watch: ‘Deport Piers Morgan’ host’s rant, Part 1

Jones’ petition, posted on the White House website, accuses Morgan of being “engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment.” It has more than 100,000 signatures.

Morgan prefaced his confrontation with Jones with a live report on Monday’s testimony in a preliminary hearing for Aurora movie theater shooting suspect James Holmes and a live interview with relatives of two victims who died in a hail of bullets from a military-style rifle in that shooting in July.

“I appreciate you having your First Amendment right. I am glad you are speaking out,” said Dave Hoover, whose nephew died in the movie theater.

The White House also made reference to First Amendment freedoms, in a statement Monday night.

“The White House responds to all petitions that cross the threshold, and we will respond to this one,” spokesman Jay Carney said, referring to petitions on whitehouse.gov that get at least 25,000 signatures. “In the meantime, it’s worth remembering that freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy.”

’World tyranny’ warning

Jones thanked Morgan for having him on the show, and then said he and others started the petition to point out that “we have all of these foreigners” and globalist forces, including “megabanks that control the planet,” trying to take away American guns.

“When they get our guns, they can have their world tyranny,” he said.

Morgan’s attempt to interject questions ran up against Jones’ heated chatter, leading up to a crescendo with Jones reciting a list of despotic world leaders who he said took away guns: Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Chavez.

Live Blog: “Guns in America,” a discussion

As Jones continued, Morgan looked on, tight-lipped and silent.

After 2½ minutes, Jones rounded off his monologue with a friendly offer to take Morgan out shooting, so he could “become an American” and “join the Republic.”

He also offered to climb into a boxing ring with Morgan. At the end of the interview, he imitated the Briton’s English accent, before declaring him a “Redcoat” who should go back to where he came from.

Morgan asked: “Are you finished?”

Jones said: “Yes.” Then he began a tirade against makers of antidepressant drugs.

Jones said he owns about 50 weapons. His radio show can be heard on 140 radio shows around the country, he said.

Morgan: No better advertisement for gun control

Morgan says Jones’ rant backfired, making Morgan’s point for him.

“I can’t think of a better advertisement for gun control than Alex Jones’ interview last night,” he said Tuesday on CNN’s “Newsroom.” “It was startling, it was terrifying in parts. It was completely deluded. It was based on a premise of making Americans so fearful that they all rush out to buy even more guns.”

“I think silence was the best weapon against him because he just dug himself an ever bigger hole,” Morgan said, adding that Jones “spouts dangerous nonsense.”

Jones, on his website infowars.com, had an image of Morgan dressed as a “Redcoat” next to Jones himself dressed as a “patriot.”

A summary of his plan for Tuesday’s radio show said he would discuss “his effort to defend the Constitution and the Second Amendment from attack by the establishment media as the government prepares its latest gun-grabbing assault on law-abiding Americans.” The description adds that through the interview, “we have put the globalists on notice.”

On the program, he said that 95% of people he has heard from “think that I just told it like it was” and “slammed them hard,” delivering an important message.

“I have been overworked,” Jones added, describing a busy schedule. “But I did the best job I could and I’m proud of the job I did overall.”

Responding to Morgan’s depiction of how the interview went, Jones asked whether that was because he is “a hillbilly that won’t be your slave and knows history.”

He described Morgan as being like “a mannequin, a vampire.”

’Piers Morgan can’t understand being American’

Though many found fault with Jones’ performance, some found common ground with his arguments.

“The tact with which Jones presented himself with was inexcusable. However; looking past that (I know… hard to do especially after that English accent he so offensively portrayed)… I have to say that his statistics were much more compelling than Piers’s. I mean, ok, gun violence is higher here in America… but it has a lower violent crime rate than those countries with banned fire-arms?” PhilipCabibi wrote in the comments section of this article.

“I see where Jones was trying to go, but unfortunately, he presented his facts in such a manner that it will turn most off to them. Which is unfortunate… because no matter how rude someone is, it doesn’t change facts and it doesn’t change history.”

’Meltdown’ or ‘punching out?’

Reactions on social media were blunt.

New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen called the interview a “meltdown” and called Jones “revolting.”

James Poniewozik, TV columnist for Time – which, like CNN, is part of Time Warner – wrote, sarcastically: “Shocking: You reward a lunatic on TV for pulling a stunt,” and he fails to “behave with civility.”

Facebook user Steve Spark made similar comments in a CNN discussion. “If you have a nutjob as a guest, you can’t be surprised when they act like a nutjob,” he wrote, adding, “Some might say it makes for good TV, but I think it’s just embarrassing.”

The Huffington Post summarized the program this way: “Piers Morgan’s pro-gun guest goes absolutely nuts at him.”

Jones retweeted a supportive note from Gerald Celente, who has 36,000 followers. “Bravo,” the tweet said, praising Jones for “punching out CNN Presstitute Piers Morgan.”

CNN iReporter Jason Asselin posted a video saying he believes that Morgan has no right to debate gun control in America, and that only U.S. citizens should do so.

Piers Morgan: Sandy Hook must be a tipping point for change

Jones’ appearance on “Piers Morgan Tonight” was followed by an interview with famed attorney and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz.

“We lawyers refer to people like that not as witnesses, but as exhibits,” he said of Jones. “He was an exhibit, like a piece of evidence. You see him speaking and you say to yourself, ‘I don’t want that man to have a gun.’”

Dershowitz said Americans who want even-handed gun policy should not leave the arguments up to gun advocates such as the National Rifle Association and Jones without speaking up themselves.

“We have to fulfill what the real meaning of the Second Amendment is: reasonable access to guns for self-protection and for hunting. And there’s no room in America for these semiautomatic, automatic and other kinds of weapons that are simply designed to cause mass havoc,” Dershowitz said.

In addition to the limitations on military-style rifles, Morgan wants gun show loopholes closed and demands that gun dealers be required to run background checks on purchasers at shows.

He also advocates an increase in federal funding for mental health treatment to anyone who needs it.

Morgan recently wrote a column in the Daily Mail saying that for every critic, he has had many Americans thank him for speaking up in favor of gun control.

“If you don’t change your gun laws to at least try to stop this relentless tidal wave of murderous carnage, then you don’t have to worry about deporting me.

“Although I love the country as a second home and one that has treated me incredibly well, I would, as a concerned parent first – and latterly, of a one-year-old daughter who may attend an American elementary school like Sandy Hook in three years’ time – seriously consider deporting myself,” he wrote.

Proposal will still get a vote as an amendment

Ban was never considered likely to pass

Gun votes could begin in the Senate next month

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday he hopes to have a bill to address gun violence on the Senate floor soon after the Easter break, but confirmed that measure will not include the assault weapons ban.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told reporters Tuesday she is disappointed that her assault weapons ban will not be part of a larger bill, but acknowledged it will likely make it easier to pass gun-related legislation through the Senate.

Feinstein said Reid told her Monday afternoon that the ban on certain types of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines would not be part of package of bills that would make up the Senate legislation.

Reid, D-Nev., said Feinstein's measure simply did not have the support necessary to clear the floor and could not pass the 60-vote threshold needed in order to be considered by the full Senate.

""Right now, her amendment, using the most optimistic numbers, has less than 40 votes. That's not 60,"" he told reporters. ""I have to get something on the floor so we can have votes on that issue and the other issues.""

The Senate Judiciary Committee passed three other measures, in addition to the assault weapons ban, over the past two weeks that are expected to be considered in some form on the Senate floor.

These measures include bills to strengthen federal penalties for trafficking and straw purchases, improve school safety and require background checks for nearly every firearm purchase.

Feinstein's ban will be voted on as an amendment to the larger package.

""Obviously, I'm disappointed, because if was in the package, it would take 60 votes to get it out. You know, the enemies on this are very powerful. I've known that all my life,"" she said. As an amendment, it will require a majority of Senators to vote to add it to the bill.

Feinstein reintroduced the ban in January as a response to the mass shooting of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school Dec. 14 in Newtown, Conn.

While acknowledging her own bill would face an uphill climb as an amendment, she held out hope that a proposal by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., to ban high-capacity magazines could be voted on as a separate amendment to the bill.

Even if the full Senate legislation does get through, Feinstein said, the fight is far from over.

""Then we face the wonderful House of Representatives,"" she said in a sarcastic reference to the Republican-controlled chamber.

It was unclear when the full package of bills will be released, but they are expected to be voted on as early as April.

The path in the House remains even murkier.

Asked Tuesday about the progress on the gun issue in the House, Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said, ""There's nothing new on that front right now.""

""We are hard at work looking at enforcement of current gun-control laws, but we are really focused on immigration right now,"" he said."

Victims and relatives of those killed in massacres in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Tucson and elsewhere visited 25 cities by bus over the summer. The tour’s final stop was Thursday in Washington.

Victims and relatives of those killed in massacres in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Tucson and elsewhere visited 25 cities by bus over the summer. The tour’s final stop was Thursday in Washington.

Victims and relatives of those killed in massacres in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Tucson and elsewhere visited 25 cities by bus over the summer. The tour’s final stop was Thursday in Washington.

The survivors took their places onstage from memory, because by now they knew exactly where to go. The shooting victims in wheelchairs entered first, rolling into the front row, wearing bracelets engraved with the words “Aurora,” “Oak Creek” or “Virginia Tech.” Behind them stood a dozen people in black T-shirts who held memorial photos of relatives killed in America’s most infamous mass shootings. In the far back were politicians holding copies of their speeches and gun-control activists waving signs, including one that read: “How many more victims does it take?”

Minutes before the rally began, two of the speakers walked across the lawn of the U.S. Capitol toward the stage. One of them, Stephen Barton, had been shot at a midnight movie premiere in Aurora, Colo., and he had deferred a teaching position in Russia so he could recover from having 16 shotgun pellets surgically removed from his arm, neck and face. The other, Carlee Soto, was taking a semester off from community college because the desks reminded her of the first-grade classroom in Newtown, Conn., where her sister had taught.

“We have to make people understand what it feels like,” Barton told her.

“It has to make their skin crawl,” she said. “It needs to physically hurt.”

“Make them uncomfortable,” he agreed.

Their event in Washington on Thursday was the final stop of a 100-day summer bus tour: 25 rallies in 25 states organized by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, involving more than a hundred survivors who told their stories and showed their scars, hoping to inflame a country that they fear has gone numb.

They traveled by bus to mark six months since Newtown and the first anniversaries of gunfire at a movie theater in Aurora and a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis. They went to Ohio, where a gun rights counter-rally drew twice the crowd; and to Fargo, N.D., where the mayor told them guns didn’t present a problem.

Then, just last week, hours before the bus arrived in Washington, a dozen people were slain at the Washington Navy Yard.

Another Newtown. Another Aurora or Oak Creek.

Now Barton stepped up to the lectern in Washington and studied a crowd that included some of the latest survivors of a mass shooting. The 100-day bus tour had not been enough to change national gun laws. Trips to lobby in Washington had not been enough. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s money had not been enough. Neither had 20 first-graders, or 70 people killed or wounded in a Colorado theater, or 32 dead at Virginia Tech, or 13 at an immigration center, or the 35 people who are killed with guns in the United States on an average day.

“We should probably begin with another moment of silence,” Barton said.

* * *

That silence was all around them now. It was a Senate that had no more plans to take up gun control, and the members of Congress who refused to meet with them, and the state lawmakers who had been voted out of office for supporting background checks, and President Obama’s apologies that he had already done what he could do, and a general public that sympathized and sent flowers and, yes, even mostly agreed with their positions on gun control but had lost its capacity for outrage nine months and more than 9,000 shooting deaths after Newtown.

In the hours before their rally in Washington, five survivors met near the Capitol to discuss strategies for breaking through the malaise. They had spent the morning in meetings with aides to lawmakers, who offered condolences and water.

“Thoughts and prayers and it ends there,” said Lori Haas, whose daughter was shot and injured at Virginia Tech. “I can’t do anything anymore with thoughts and prayers.”

“I’m learning that you have to be brutal with these people,” said Patricia Maisch, who wrestled away a magazine clip and disarmed the shooter at a 2011 event in Tucson where Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others were shot. Maisch took out a picture she carried of the six people killed at that event and set it on the table. “Now I show this to people and start getting graphic,” she said. “This is not a pretty death like you see on ‘NCIS’ or ‘Law and Order.’ This is six people murdered on the sidewalk on a beautiful Arizona day.”

“Bloody and scared,” said Bill Badger, who was shot in the back of the head that day.

“Oh, and by the way, loved ones aren’t lost. They are killed,” Haas said.

“Murdered,” said Roxanna Green, whose 9-year-old daughter was murdered at the event in Arizona.

“I just want to shake people,” Badger said. “If this was some disease . . . we’d be in a national emergency.”

“You’d see planes dropping medicine,” Maisch said. “Instead, it’s another day. It’s nothing.”

Some of them remembered what it felt like to be oblivious, a part of the audience they were trying so desperately to reach. Barton learned about the 2009 killing spree at an immigration center in Binghamton, N.Y., only three years later, in 2012, after he was shot in Aurora and started to research mass shootings. “Thirteen dead and I didn’t notice,” he said.

Other survivors at the table had remained uninvolved even after their own traumas. It was one thing to be shot in a fluke incident, they said; it was another to be made aware that those flukes were in fact occurring constantly in the United States, where a mass shooting involving four or more people happens about once each day. Green, whose daughter died in Arizona, decided to become an activist only after the shooting in Aurora. Colin Goddard, shot four times during his Intermediate French class at Virginia Tech in 2007, said his “awakening” came years later, while watching coverage of the Binghamton shooting in his New York hotel room.

Now each shooting made Goddard “deflate,” he said, “like going back to square one.” Each new incident made him feel stuck in time: same gun laws, same public inertia, same predictable sense of disbelief, same calls from the same reporters who asked him to reiterate the same story of his own shooting, even though retelling it exhausted him. “You are constantly reliving it, and summoning the outrage, and that’s horrible but also the best chance to make it stop,” he said.

After the shootings at the Navy Yard, Goddard told his story a few dozen more times: that three bullets remain in his shoulder and hip, and that only seven people in his class survived. Haas redoubled her efforts to pressure state lawmakers in Virginia. Tom Mauser, whose son died at Columbine High School in 1999, went to another candlelit vigil wearing his son’s old shoes.

Soto, whose sister was killed in Newtown, received a call Monday from a friend of a friend — a young woman whose mother had just been killed at the Navy Yard. They spoke for an hour. The woman was on her way to identify her mother’s body. Then she was going to a meeting with the FBI. Hundreds of people had visited her house in Washington and dozens more had sent flowers, she told Soto. The woman wanted to know what to expect in the weeks ahead. “What’s it like?” she asked.

“The craziness dies down, and people stop paying attention,” Soto said. “But the feeling goes on forever.”

* * *

The next day at the rally, Soto stood onstage holding a picture of her sister, trying to get some of that attention back. Insects buzzed in the trees above. A motorcade raced along the adjacent street. Soto looked out at about 200 people seated in black folding chairs — a good crowd, she thought, in part because of the recent Navy Yard shooting. “My sister was gunned down,” she began.

During the bus tour, Soto had taken the advice of fellow gun advocates and revised her speech to make it more detailed, and lately she had been telling stories to crowds that she never shared with her family. “We can’t really bring ourselves to talk about it in private,” she said. She knew her speech by heart, but she found it easier to read onstage from an iPad, because it made her memories feel more like remarks.

“We laid my sister’s clothing from that day out on her bed,” she told the audience. “If you have never seen what a bullet hole looks like, your imagination doesn’t do it justice. There were five. One was right by her heart.”

Next to speak was Badger, the 76-year-old retired Army colonel shot at Giffords’s event in Arizona: “There were nine chairs, and this man was just walking down the chairs, shooting them, point-blank,” Badger said. “A congressman. A judge. A 9-year-old.”

Next came Jennifer Longdon, paralyzed in a random shooting in 2004: “My fiance’s most devastating injury was a bullet that roared through his brain,” she said. “Then I was in a room that reeked of blood and antiseptic.”

The speakers rotated onto the stage for about an hour before the president of the local NAACP announced the beginning of the event’s long finale: He would read from a list of names of people killed in gun violence this year. He bowed his head and spoke in staccato rhythm. The audience remained in place — mournful, appalled, activated.

“Michael Arnold, age 16, killed with a gun.

“Sylvia Frasier, age 53, killed with a gun.”

Ten minutes went by, then 20. Some people began checking e-mail on their cellphones. Others left to get lunch. A few dozen more waited until after lunch and then returned to work, leaving behind a sea of empty chairs.

“Michael Cunningham, age 38, killed with a gun.

“Gerald Cunningham, age 27, killed with a gun.”

The remaining survivors at the rally departed for a reception. A man in a business suit walked by and pulled an empty chair into the shade to talk on his cellphone. A school group from Indiana wandered through, sat for a minute and then left.

Soon all that remained was one person at the lectern, reading names that were broadcast through a speaker system. A helicopter flew by. A nearby protester screamed into a megaphone about the federal budget. The speaker leaned into the microphone and raised his voice. “Courtney Davis, age 20, killed with a gun,” he said, but there was nobody left to hear him."

The House voted in favor of a bill that would seek to block the federal government from restricting assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It amended the bill to specify that federal officials who tried to enforce any ban would be subject to state misdemeanor charges instead of felony charges.

President Obama has called for reinstituting a federal assault weapons ban following the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders by a gunman last month.

The House on Wednesday also gave preliminary approval to a bill that would allow citizens who hold concealed carry permits to carry guns on campuses of public schools, colleges and the University of Wyoming.

Rep. Kendell Kroeker, R-Evansville, sponsored the bill to exempt assault rifles and magazines from federal control. He said Wyoming should get its position on record before a new federal ban comes down.

""It is clearly a different case than trying to nullify something that's already in existence,"" Kroeker said.

Rep. Mary Throne, a Democrat and attorney in Cheyenne, said some states have tried such nullification laws in the past. She said such efforts were common in the years before the civil war and then during the civil rights movement, when some segregationist states tried to ignore federal law and practice nullification of federal laws.

""If we want to make a statement we can do it, but let's not let's not pretend that it's consistent with the Constitution, because it's not,"" Throne said.

The non-partisan Legislative Service Office has issued a legal analysis of Kroeker's bill that notes the U.S. Supreme Court recognizes federal laws as the supreme law of the land.

Rep. Allen Jaggi, R-Lyman, sponsored the bill to allow people who hold state-issued concealed carry permits to carry guns on school campuses. A retired teacher, he said he worries about the safety of schools in the state, noting that they're currently classified as gun-free zones under state law.

""Most of the horrific accidents that we've heard about have happened in gun-free zones, and the bad guys really don't care what the laws are,"" Jaggi said. ""I'm a law-abiding guy, and if that's the law, I won't carry where I'm not supposed to carry. But the bad guys don't have that thought, they just want to do whatever they want to do.""

Rep. Jerry Paxton, R-Encampment, said that as a former school principal he had serious concerns about the including elementary and secondary school provision in this bill. ""I certainly don't want to get into a situation where we're creating a killing field inside of a school, but I think this bill creates the opportunity for many, many different things that could happen that would endanger kids.""

Paxton said he could see where a student could get ahold of a firearm inadvertently if a teacher forgot to lock a drawer.

Rep. Stephen Watt, R-Rock Springs, said school administrators don't currently know if guns are coming into their schools or who has them.

""Someone who wants to bring a gun into a school will do it, and if they want to use it for evil, they'll use it for evil,"" Watt said. ""It's that simple.""

Chris Boswell, lobbyist for the University of Wyoming, said after the House vote that the university administration is concerned about the prospect of losing its authority to maintain its current policy of prohibiting students from carrying weapons either openly or concealed.

""I believe the trustees, through the regulation, have indicated that the risks may outweigh the benefits of allowing guns to be carried on the university campus,"" Boswell said, adding that the university has a police force."

The push to reduce gun violence comes after a mass shooting at a Newtown%2C Conn. school

President Obama has proposed new gun control measures%2C including an assault weapons ban

The NRA says there should be armed guards in schools

The Senate on Wednesday held its first hearing on ways to reduce gun violence since 20 Connecticut students were killed in a December mass shooting.

President Obama proposed a new ban on assault weapons, background checks on gun buyers and limits on ammunition magazines. He has called on the divided Congress to enact legislation soon.

Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman shot in the head in 2011, opened the Judiciary Committee hearing by urging Congress to ""be bold"" and to do something to reduce the number of children killed by violence. Her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, also made a statement and took questions from senators.

Wayne LaPierrre, executive vice president and CEO of the National Rifle Association, testified that new gun laws ""is not a serious solution to reducing crime.""

USA TODAY's Jackie Kucinich is at the hearing and is filing stories throughout the day. Follow some of the hearing highlights here:

12:09 p.m. Kelly says he would give up his right to own a high-capacity magazine in order to bring back Christina-Taylor Green, the 9-year-old girl killed in the Tucson shooting.

12:04 p.m. LaPierre says Americans are afraid that ""they will be abandoned by their government. The only way they can protect themselves ... is with a firearm."" Johnson, the police chief, is asked to respond. He says law enforcement is ""well prepared"" to deal with any disaster. ""I can't relate to that kind of thinking,"" Johnson says about LaPierre's statement.

12 p.m. Durbin says there should have been a hearing like this after Giffords was shot, but he said it took the Newtown incident to get to this point.

11:56 a.m. After hearing statistics on gun violence, LaPierre of the NRA says it is tragic. ""We've got to interdict these people and get them off the streets,"" he says. ""Problem with gun laws is criminals don't cooperate with them. The mentally ill don't cooperate with them."" He repeats his stance against proposed universal background checks.

Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., refutes LaPierre's testimony and Leahy bangs his chairman's gavel to restore order in the hearing.

11:52 a.m. Cornyn asks Kelly about people with mental illness in Arizona whose applications for guns were denied. Kelly refutes a point made earlier by LaPierre, the NRA chief. About Loughner: ""His plan was to assassinate my wife. He was a criminal because of his drug use,"" Kelly says. ""He would have failed that (gun) background check.""

Kelly says Giffords would not have been at the Senate hearing on Wednesday ""if we had stronger background checks.""

11:49 a.m. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the GOP's minority whip, says he has a hard time telling his constituents that Congress is considering new gun laws when existing laws are not enforced. He says it's a good idea to look at things such as mental health treatment. Like other Republicans at this hearing, Cornyn criticized the Obama administration on prosecuting gun crimes.

11:47 a.m. Johnson, the Baltimore County police chief, says comprehensive background checks are ""not inconvenient.""

11:44 a.m. Sen. Charles Schumer, D.-N.Y., says he is in discussions with legislators who have ""high NRA ratings"" on bipartisan legislation to reduce gun violence. He says he can't share details. ""It won't create any gun registry. That is already illegal. It will not limit your ability to borrow your Uncle Willie's hunting rifle,"" Schumer says.

11:38 a.m. LaPierre says crime would be reduced if laws already on the books are enforced. ""The numbers are shocking,"" he says.

11:33 a.m. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a former prosecutor, criticizes the Obama administration's record on prosecuting gun crimes.

11:29 a.m. Feinstein asks what can be done to prevent gun violence at shopping malls, theaters and other businesses.. ""We can't have a totally armed society,"" the senator says. She asks Chief Johnson if the legislation proposed would be effective. He says: ""Yes, ma'am, I do.""

11:24 a.m. Feinstein, the California Democrat and author of a proposed assault weapons ban, makes a joke that it's good to see LaPierre, the NRA's CEO. She notes they tangled during the 1994 battle over the weapons ban. ""You look good,"" she said.

11:15 a.m. Grassley questions Kopel, the Denver law professor, about the effectiveness of the 1994 assault weapons ban. ""It was tried with great sincerity ... but it didn't seem to save any lives that the researchers could find,"" Kopel said.

11:11 a.m. LaPierre says ""straw man"" gun sales should be prosecuted -- such as anyone who helps a criminal get a gun. But he says it does no good to extend background checks to private sellers or in all instances. ""The fact is the law right now is a failure the way it is working,"" LaPierre says. ""This administration is not prosecuting the people they catch.""

11:09 a.m. Question goes to Kelly. He says there is more that can be done on background checks. He notes that Jared Loughner, the shooter in the Tucson massacre that wounded Giffords, purchased a gun with a background check. ""This is one of the most important things we must do,"" he said. ""Requiring private (gun) sellers to have a background check before they transfer a gun ... I can't imagine something more important"" than requiring that.

11:06 a.m. The formal statements are over and questioning of the witnesses has begun. Leahy asks Chief Johnson about the effectiveness of background checks.

11:04: More from LaPierre's testimony: ""Proposals that would only serve to burden the law-abiding have failed in the past and will fail in the future."" He said studies show the 1994 assault weapons ban did not reduce crime. ""And when it comes to the issue of background checks, let's be honest -- background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them,"" he says.

11:02 a.m. LaPierre says ""proposing new gun laws, while failing to enforce the thousands we already have, is not a serious solution to reducing crime.""

""Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals. Nor do we believe the government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families,"" the NRA chief says.

11 a.m. LaPierre says NRA does more ""than anyone else on teaching safe and responsible gun ownership."" He explains former congressman Asa Hutchinson's role in developing a school safety program. ""It's time to throw an immediate blanket of security around children,"" he says.

10:58 a.m. Now up, Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association.

10:57 a.m. Trotter calls for ""sensible"" enforcement of the gun laws already on the books. ""Instead of self-defeating gestures, we should address gun violence based on what works,"" she says. ""For women, the ability to arm ourselves is even more consequential than for men. Guns are the great equalizer.""

10:54 a.m. Now testifying: Gayle Trotter, a lawyer and senior fellow at the Independent Women's Forum. She talks about violence against women and research on concealed carry laws. ""Armed security works,"" Trotter says.

10:53 a.m. Giffords just sent a tweet, quoting from her husband's testimony: ""The breadth and complexity is great, but it is not an excuse for inaction.""

10:46 a.m. Now testifying: James Johnson, chief of Baltimore County (Md.) Police Department. He says law enforcement leaders back Obama's approach to reducing gun violence. ""I'm here today to tell you we are long overdue in strengthening our nation's gun laws,"" he says. Johnson calls for background checks and says law enforcement groups support the assault weapons ban proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Johnson also says states need help dealing with gun trafficking across state lines. He says high capacity ammunition magazines are not necessary for hunting.

10:42 a.m. Now testifying: David Kopel, a professor at Denver University's law school. He's going through the history of congressional statutes on guns. ""Universal background checks should be available,"" Kopel says. ""Mandating universal checks can only be enforceable if there is universal gun registration.""

10:39 a.m. Kelly says Congress should close the gun show loophole and enact a tough federal gun trafficking statute. Kelly says Congress should not look to ideology but try to compromise.

10:35 a.m. ""We believe in the Second Amendment. We take that right seriously and we would never give it up. But rights demand responsibility and this right does not extend to terrorists...to criminals ...to the mentally ill. When dangerous people get dangerous guns, we are all the more vulnerable,"" Kelly says.

10:33 a.m. Kelly says he and Giffords ""aren't here as victims. We're speaking to you today as Americans. We're both gun owners and we take that right and the responsibilities that come with it very seriously.""

10:32 a.m. First witness is Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut and Giffords' husband. The couple have founded Americans for Responsible Solutions, a PAC aimed at reducing gun violence.

10:27 a.m. Grassley criticizes executive actions taken by Obama to reduce gun violence, saying there is not enough detail provided about the specifics of each move. He also says they could have been issued before Newtown.

10:24 a.m. Grassley says any discussion about what to do needs to include focus on mental health. He also condemns violent video games. ""Banning guns based on their appearance does not make sense,"" Grassley says about proposed assault weapons ban. He also questions limit on ammunition magazines.

10:21 a.m. Grassley, the top Republican on the committee, is now speaking. He says no one will ever forget where they were when they learned about the ""evil act"" that happened at Newtown. ""Clearly violent crimes and those who commit them are a plague on our society,"" he says.

10:20 a.m. Leahy says he hopes hearing will build consensus around ""common sense solutions."" He urges the new 113th Congress to act in a bipartisan fashion -- something that has been missing in recent years on Capitol Hill.

10:17 a.m. Leahy says ""Americans are looking to us for solutions and for action.""

He says it is a ""simple matter of common sense"" to plug loopholes in the law dealing with background checks for gun owners.

""The Second Amendment is secure and will remain secure and protected,"" Leahy says.

10:15 a.m. Leahy begins his opening statement, saying ""America's heart was broken"" on Dec. 14 when 20 children and six educators were killed at Sandy Hook school in Newtown, Conn.

""I hope we can forgo partisan recrimination. It's too important for that. We should all be here as Americans.""

10:12 a.m. Giffords is speaking haltingly, slowly enunciating her words. ""This is an important conversation for our children,"" she says. ""Speaking is difficult but I need to say something important Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. ... It will be hard but the time is now. You must act. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you. Thank you.""

10:11 a.m. Leahy lays down the rules for the hearing, asking for respect on this ""serious subject."" Capitol police will remove anyone who is disorderly. ""We're going to hear a lot of different perspectives on gun violence,"" he says.

10:09 a.m. Giffords and Kelly are being escorted to the witness table by Leahy and Grassley. The photographers are snapping away.

10:01 a.m. ET Before the hearing, Giffords sent out a tweet thanking Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, ""for starting this conversation."""
